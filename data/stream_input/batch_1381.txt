0307593312|5.0|What can i say as a \\"normal\\" avid reader after all that has been said about this novel? I can say that i read the wonderful Spanish translation ([[ASIN:8483832968 1Q84 (Coleccion Andanzas) (Spanish Edition)]]), that i had read three fabulous Murakami books before (in English) and that this might be the best book i've ever read! Yes: profound, multilayered, bizarre, moving, iconoclastic, imaginative... Too long? I dont think so. Indeed, i didnt want it to end. The anticlimactic climax simply made me cry (i shed tears with movies, but had never done it with a book...). Perhaps because i have read (sometimes the bizarrest) science ficton since i was 15 or so, i was not taken aback by the deeply strange moments this novel has. Perhaps more than anything, reading that stuff made me open to accept more or less easily the metaphors of universes with two moons and little people (as appetizers for deeper things). In a sentence, i urge people to read this unique marvelous novel, to forget about its size and to open hearts and minds for a, perhaps, once-in-a-lifetime experience. Ill read it again soon...(perhaps in English, to see if there are diffrerences... yet another layer to this book...)
0439023483|3.0|It's a fun read and certainly a page turner. But that's mostly it. I enjoyed reading it, couldn't put it down, and finished it in under a day; however, when I did finish it I wasn't satisfied as the book (and characters) felt hollow. This is perhaps a result of two factors: 1) the book comes highly recommended by nearly everyone, and more importantly 2) I had no idea it was a teen fiction book until after I finished it. Considering it's teen fiction, I suppose the fact that there were far too many implied points that were unnecessarily mentioned by the narrator (or the narrator says points in a way that tries to make it sound insightful to the reader, which they were not) and too many words were italicized for effect are justified (but they were frequently annoying while reading).<br /><br />Due to its entertainment value, I'll give it a solid 3 stars and recommend it to people who are looking for a quick, easy read  - perhaps a book you'd take to the beach (though my recommendation so far to people I've spoken with about the book is that they're probably better off just waiting for the movie to come out). But if you're looking for something insightful and thought provoking, I'd look elsewhere.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it seems like you have unlimited. options to play... mindless fun and hours of entertainment ... great<br />on o road trip
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|My husband and I did not like the movie.  It was a complete downer with monotone acting and unlikeable characters. The scenery was beautiful and the concept of \\"finding the important things in life\\" through a family tragedy is commendable, but to us, the film just didn't rise to the level of enjoyable entertainment.  We found it to be a chore to make it to the end of the movie.  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers who commented about all the high reviews, \\"what ARE people thinking?\\"  Must be easy to please or George Clooney devotees?!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favorite solitaire of all. To be able to have this ap on my Kindle Fire is fantastic!
B004F1F32A|4.0|This is an action feel good movie. Liam Neeson shows his range by playing a tough guy that can handle himself with the best of them - Cruise, Damon, Eastwood.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is a fun game to play. I especially enjoy the fact that it mixes the hard and easy levels
B005VTS4EY|4.0|one star off for no skip level button..... you have to go all the way back to menu... but its a really original idea and the extra step wont kill you.... its worth it
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a really simple game to play and is easy to get hooked on. If your looking for neighbors add Rose471. I play every day.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is simple, fun and addicting. Great for killing some time and making you think. The puzzles get more challenging as you go.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|This game is very well done.  Its easy to play and the puzzles keep you on your toes.<br /><br />It runs well on my Evo View, Flyer and 3d.<br /><br />The graphics are &quot;good enough&quot; to support the game, but, some better visuals and sound would definetly make this a 5 star app.<br /><br />Definetly a better than average game.
B0020TS5KQ|2.0|****BEWARE*** this release is the 1080i version.(hence the two star rating) if u dont care.. then buy away. Other than that, this a Great movie....
B006IDG2T6|3.0|Although short, a good amount of content is presented. Much of this was already covered by Harris in A Moral Landscape but is still worth reading again. Wish there was more new content from Harris presented in this release however.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I think this app is awesome you will love it love this app this app is so handy totally awesome.
B000N6TYLW|1.0|Such a lame season!! Ok, just because marriage never worked for Lorelai, doesn't mean it couldn't have worked for Rory. She and Logan were obviously meant to be together, so why not marriage?<br /><br />Lorelai needs to pick a man and stay committed to him for more than a few weeks.<br /><br />April drives me crazy! She is so stinkin' annoying. All the scenes with her in them are so nerdy. Also, her mom is a selfish woman to have this custody battle with Luke.<br /><br />Also, Olivia and Lucy get under my skin. There is nothing interesting about them. And is the drama between them and Rory about the whole Marty situation really the best the writers of the show could come up with?<br /><br />If you want to be disappointed, watch the 7th season.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|awesome game! a lot of fun for the whole family, recommending to my friend and family unfortunately already beat it...ha gonna 100 more levels :)
0439023513|1.0|I really LOVED the first two books (Hunger Games and Catching Fire), but I cannot say the same about this one. Here's why. (1) The first person point of view worked great in the first two books but comes up short in The Mockinjay. This is because Katniss, the one telling the story, is either in the hospital or hiding in a closet on the verge of a psychotic break during most of the action. She (and we) have to be retold what happened in a quick paraphrase. (2) Katniss' love interests (Peeta and Gale) are either physically or emotionally absent through most of the book. (3) Too many of the main characters were senselessly killed off. Overall, the book was just too depressing. If a movie is made out of this book, I can only hope they change it - for the better.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I couldn't put this book down! It was suspense and romance. Nicholas Sparks' writing style is an easy read. It was a great love story about two couples, one young, the other much older at the end of their lives, and a surprise ending both tragic and full of hope for the future.
1400069289|5.0|I read through this in one evening; it was captivating. Helped me to understand a few things about my habits. Highly recommend as an entry book on the subject. Now I am  looking into some of the source material.
1612130283|3.0|You can see why she's getting all the hype. This reads quick and if maybe some of the sex is \\"worst sex writing\\" material, some of it is pretty hot. It's something you read in bed at night beneath the covers. It works on you. I got interested after Katrina Von Kessel's Blue Bloodbath, which I also got on Kindle. When I read that this one was sexy too and popular I gave it a try. Not my usual thing, but why not? Katrina writes better -- and her sex is actually a little more daring -- but I kind of like it. Like everyone else is writing: what's wrong with it from time to time?
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is a fun game. Tiles switch up to keep you on your toes.  Graphics are good. if you like this type of game, this one to get.

0545425115|5.0|I read the entire book in less then a week. It was really that good. I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I got it. I got the whole set as a deal on Amazon for my kindle. I've already started the second and am looking forward to seeing what happens.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|I really liked this book by Lee Child. It reverts to Reacher's time in the Army without losing any of the bite that, I find, Child is able to bring to his main character (Jack Reacher).<br />All in all, a very good read.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|great game. love the facial expressions on the squares. deserves high review. u will like it 4 sure! thanks faotd.

B006ON41FC|5.0|I love this game. I am like seriously addicted. I hate having to put it down to go do something else. its my personal squirrel race. what's not to love?
B0052VUNHC|3.0|This was a train wreck, but for some reason I couldn't stop reading it and I don't even really know why. I thought the beginning was good and cute and fun and than things took a turn and Travis and Abby turned into that disaster. I didn't really find it all that beautiful.<br /><br />When I heard this book was corny, I was kind of excited as I do enjoy a little bit of corny in my books. This was way over the top with all the Baby's and the Pigeon's and the Pidge's. Some of the plot line was a little unbelievable as well.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about this book was the beginning parts of Travis's and Abby's relationship development. Some parts were super cute and I was really enjoying it and than things just got a little out of hand with their relationship.<br /><br />I decided to give this three stars because it is right in the middle and that is kind of how I felt about this book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have the first Quell app and loved it!!  Quell  Reflect is even better.  You can figure out the puzzles and pathways faster. The music is a soothing melody that calms u while u play. Nice change from the fast paced, frenzy that most other games have.  Highly recommend. It cost a mere 25 cents...how can u go wrong??
1612130283|5.0|I wasn't sure what this book was going to be about and I was shocked! I LOVED it! I was unable to put it down! The emotions are so strong, the characters are so loveable, and the suspense is so intense. The writing is not perfect but this is the best book that I have ever read and I am reading the sequel now with the same feelings!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cute little games with nice graphics. I like how u have to get points to open other games.But that's just me!

B004132HZS|5.0|I will have to add myself to the long list of reviewers who were skeptics when hearing about a 21st century Sherlock.  Like the others, I too am addicted to Holmesiana, and have been since my early teens when I discovered Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson and 221B Baker Street and all the rest of the beloved world created by Sir Arthur(and my early teens was a long time ago!) After seeing Jeremy Brett, I considered him to be the Last Word on Sherlock, who could ever top it?  But being addicted to all things Holmesian, and since it was streaming on Netflix, what did I have to lose?<br />Well, as you can see from the five-star rating, I loved Sherlock after the first five minutes, and I concur with everybody who considers that Mr. Holmes has now made a flawless transition to the 21st century and its world of technology.<br />One area where I disagree, however, is with those who think \\"The Blind Banker\\" is a weak episode.  On the contrary, in my opinion it is a clever and witty transposition of \\"The Sign of Four.\\"  The coded symbols of the original story, and the mysterious messages, have been been translated into Chinese characters sometimes scrawled as graffiti on walls.  The revenge motif has been kept, still connected to the idea of stolen treasure.  The exotic backstory has been retained, this time in a Chinese venue rather than an East Indian one.  The symbology of numbers is still important.  And of course the \\"Andaman Island aborigine\\" who scales walls in the original has been brought forward as a Chinese acrobat.  As a bonus, we are treated to a performance of the acrobats that is all too short (I was fortunate enough to see a performance of the Peking Opera back in the then-People's Republic, and was enthralled, and can't get enough of Chinese theater.)<br />One other \\"first\\" that the writers kept from \\"The Sign of Four\\" is Dr. Watson's first romance in the saga of Sherlock Holmes.<br />I could be wrong, but it certainly seems that the writers of \\"Sherlock\\" love Holmesiana as much as I do, and so many of the rest of us do.<br />I could natter on about the wonderful performances, direction, pointers to Sherlock's Asperger's Syndrome (I am a high-functioning Aspy myself), and so forth and so on, but you get the idea.<br />Anyway, it is wonderful to know that the game is still afoot!

B0071PS7AC|4.0|Well, I am playing this using a stylus which after some practice is working well for me.<br />I like the challenge of trying to perfect a spinning hook ball or throwing straight. I didn't have the problem of not winning against the computer. The graphics & sound effects are excellent and the game play was speedy for me on android tablet.  I would really like to be able to play against a real live opponent though. I will be playing this often as I do love bowling, and hope it gets updated to include at least 2 players (then I would rate 5 stars). ...And I do think it is worth buying.

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, but you might as well give up when you get to the last boss. The main game is great retro space shooter fun, but suddenly decides to go all &quot;bullet hell&quot; at the end for some reason. I gave up after shooting at the boss for half an hour straight, and the @#$% thing still wasn't dead! Anyway, it's still a fun game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!! you get completely addicted until you can complete the goals. all I can say is that the game needs more goals I've completed all of them!!
B001KX50BK|5.0|The film \\"pretty woman\\" is a modern classic. It became a huge box office hit in the early 90s and made a superstar out of Julia Roberts. The film's release on DVD has been a muddled affair as a special edition version of the film that added all sorts of deleted scenes was the only version available. These scenes in my opinion took away from the original film which was perfect in it's original form. Sadly, the original theatrical version had been unavailable unless you owned a VHS copy.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version here thankfully IS THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSION. The picture quality is clear and you can enjoy Pretty Woman without having to suffer through those awful scenes that the director frankly didn't feel worked either. The blu ray menu is gorgeous with a multipanel layout showing Vivienne's scene from the movie and the corresponding preliminary costume design artwork in another panel. James Newton Howard's amazing (and sadly still unreleased) orchestral scores plays in the background. There are loads of extras that have been offered on previous edition. On this version the main draw is the original film.<br /><br />I'm very happy to have this version back in my collection.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|First of all, I ordered this about a month ago and received it on the 6th of March, which was the release date I think.  The packaging was good and I received it with no damage.  Now to the DVDs.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is not for the sheltered.  If you are a fan of the books and think that there won't be an abundance of nudity and sexually explicit content, you are mistaken.  This is not family viewing, but for those that can handle the content, it is a must watch.  My wife, who is a Christian, and I just finished it tonight and we have both read the books by George RR Martin.  It seemed to me to remain relatively true to the written work.  The casting is solid with the exception of Kit Harrington, and this is a little unfair of me, I just didn't find myself being drawn in by Jon Snow at times.  The vast majority of the time Kit Harrington was wonderful but there was one, maybe two, scenes where I thought he phoned it in.  Aside from that I cannot find one criticism of season 1.<br /><br />I am not a subscriber to HBO, but am considering subscribing for season two which is supposed to start airing on April 1.
B007H7XJD4|5.0|Really, I wasn't expecting such a gritty and intense movie. I was a fan of the classic Greek adventure movies as a kid. Definitely would add this to the collection. But, nothing cheesy about it.

It's not often that you experience such an \\"auditory feast.\\" Great job, Stephen King --I loved every detail of this book, and great job, Craig Wasson for so deftly interpreting King's voice.<br /><br />Update May 24, 2012<br /><br />I have now listened to the audio book two times. That's how much I love it. You can't but love the main character...
0385343175|4.0|I will be the first to admit that I am not an avid reader of Danielle Steel.  Over the years, I have read Zoya, Crossings, and maybe 3 or 4 other books by this author.  Though I don't read her often, every once in awhile a book by her will catch my attention, and I always enjoy the books I read by her.  That is what happened with the book Hotel Vendome.  Once I started reading the book, I couldn't wait to read the book each night when I got home from work and each morning when I got out of bed.  Other reviewers here have mentioned that there was no character development.  I couldn't disagree more.  I quickly found myself caring about Heloise and her father Hugues (though I STILL don't know how to pronounce the man's name!), and even though throughout the course of the book I went from loving Heloise to not liking her very much, I still found myself caring about this girl and her life.  I would recommend this book to others.  If you're a fan of Danielle Steel, you probably won't let the lower scores/reviews by others on this site deter you from reading the book anyway, but if you normally don't read this author, please give this book a chance.  It's a quick read, and to me, it is worth your time to read.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Game has kept me amused so far. Level 28 is where it gets tricky. Graphics are good. Doesn't drain my battery like most gashes. Droid incredible
B004LWZW7O|3.0|Niccol the writer has always been good at creating tight, well-crafted screenplays that address big ideas (Gattaca, Truman Show), but this, along with \\"Lord of War,\\" demonstrate that he doesn't know his way around a camera. The pacing is off, the editing choppy, and the actors seem somewhat lost. Also, during the \\"arm-wrestling\\" scene with the gangster near the end, Niccol commits the deadlist screenwriting sin: the deus ex machina (hint: it's the hidden gun). And although this has an interesting premise, there's a huge plot hole: if the \\"rich\\" (signified by their decades and centuries of time) move so slowly and have no worries, why do they all look like supermodels? I would imagine they would all look like the humans in \\"Wall-E.\\" Despite this plothole and others, as well as the general anarchist theme, I rented it & enjoyed enough of it to recommend as rental, BUT ONLY slightly.<br />Not kinda movie, Makes U wanna re-visited again & Forgettable quicky!<br />C+

0307957934|3.0|I chose this book because I have enjoyed a number of Mr. Harris' works, and in particular, another contemporary story, \\"Ghost\\".  \\"The Fear Index\\" was, however. a disappointment.  The beginning was intriguing.  Immediately the reader is alerted that something strange is going on when the protagonist, scientist-turned-hedge-fund manager Alex Hoffman, receives a strange gift from an anonymous donor.  The gift is just the first of several strange happenings.  We soon realize that Hoffman is regarded by his colleagues as an odd guy to begin with, and it doesn't take much for them to begin questioning his mental health, as he exhibits symptoms of paranoia.<br /><br />It's a poor time for Hoffman to be acting strangely, because the algorithm he invented to choose investments is piling up huge profits, and his partner is on the verge of landing an additional $8 billion or so in new investments, which will lead to even greater wealth for the company.  Hoffman, however, is not really interested in the money as much as in the science and, as the story progresses, who is after him.<br /><br />Sounds great, right?  The problem for me was that it felt one-dimensionsal and old.  I can really enjoy a new take on an old plot (after all, stripped to the bone, there aren't many plots) or even a slightly wooden writing with an ingenious plot.  But \\"The Fear Index\\" felt like neither.  It's an \\"is the scientist going mad or being driven mad?\\" story, with no real surprises, and no characters I could really care about.  Hoffman himself is neither evil nor fully likable, and the other characters, while not badly drawn, were just not deep enough to elicit much emotional investment.  Read it on a lazy afternoon, but don't expect excitement.

B005VTS4EY|1.0|Why leave in the open socket permission if Openfeint was taken out? Because they also demand the phone identification permission and need that internet highway to drive your phone info out of your device. You know why there are hundreds of reviews on this devs free Cow app? Not because it was a great game and 700 people felt compelled to rate a free Cow game. Even kids apps as FAOTD do not get 700 ratings so how did the dev get 700 reviews on it? The reason is the dev designed the app so the people had to rate it before they would be allowed to open it. It blocked you from even playing the first time until you gave it a rating. Who would rate a game low before playing, almost nobody.<br /><br />Now this smartypants wants to take out Openfeint to make you think the 'bad stuff' is gone. But he left in the internet open socket permission that Openfeint needed. Why leave it in when theres no reason to have internet for this game? Thats where your phones identity permission comes in. To get that it needs a way off your phone and the internet is the only way to do it.  WAKE UP, AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!! A for-fee app game has no business stealing this information from you!!!!!!  Future apps will continue to be developed and to do this to you and your teens and children until you make your voice heard and say you are not going to accept this any more! If you cant support the effort to try to improve things then dont blame anybody but yourselves when other apps come rollin in with newer and better spyware that youre gonna complain about later!! You can be glad about your free dollar today and download but your children will suffer for it later because you as a parent didnt do the right thing to prepare their future world of technology to be a SAFE ONE!!!!!<br /><br />Now you can go play with your little colored blocks and say Weeeeeeeeee like that little Geico piglet, knowing fully well you contributed to the larger picture here and just put another small nail in the coffin of the safety of your childrens technological future.  Way to go, responsible MOMS AND DADS AND GRANDPARENTS!!!!e safety of your childrens technological future.  Way to go, responsible MOMS AND DADS AND GRANDPARENTS!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I dont have the ebook version but i have the book and it is so well thought out. It always makes you want to keep reading even when you have to stop. Once i read all the way through science and math! I just couldnt stop reading it! This is one of the best books out of the series!
0062060562|2.0|King Solomon, labeled the wisest man on earth, is thought to have said in Ecclesiastes that there is nothing new under the sun. This may very well be the case, because despite the comments on the \\"freshness\\" of _Before I Go to Sleep_, this breakthrough novel feels like a dozen books or films the reader may have encountered already.<br /><br />Christine is a amnesiac but an odd one. Neither short-term or long-term memory deficient, she instead lingers somewhere in-between. For her, each day starts anew, with her waking to a largely blank slate she must fill over 16 waking hours. That filling is assisted by a mysterious Dr. Nash, who encourages Christine to write a journal, which she then hides from doting, long-suffering husband Ben. Daily, the doctor calls and reminds Christine to review yesterday's entry, giving her a way to reconnect to whatever bits of memory surface.<br /><br />And what those unleashed memories reveal is a descent into horror, violence, and potential madness, persisting over the course of decades. No one can be trusted, and the truth is a lie.<br /><br />Or is it?<br /><br />Sounds a bit like the film _Memento_, doesn't it? Or _50 First Dates_. Or a host of other amnesia novels or films.<br /><br />Beyond feeling familiar, there's a repetitive nature to the book due to its story mechanism. Christine relives, and so does the reader. Over and over, details and plot advancement leech out slowly. Painfully slowly.<br /><br />And this is the major problem with _Before I Go to Sleep_: It has only enough total plot to make a decent novella. That this book fills 368 pages makes it an odd beast, the dull page-turner. After a few of Christine's day relivings, the need to start skimming paragraphs emerges, and sadly, little is lost by doing so. Author S.J.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I just finished the audio book. It was a great story to listen to on an 18 hour round trip. I think the negative reviews are coming in when people don't have the time to sit and read or listen for a good chunk of time. I put in the first disc and I couldn't stop. I can't wait until the next book comes out. It may be that since I am interested in the middle ages, not alchemy though, that I am interested in the history behind the book, but what ever it is i couldn't wait to put in the next cd when I was listening.
B001E45XT4|1.0|Since this is called a gaming headset, I thought it would work as a headset for an Xbox 360. Christmas morning, I found out I was wrong. I contacted the company and told them the problem, and they said they would allow a return. I followed their directions and sent it back promptly, but didn't hear a word back. I finally contacted them nearly 2 weeks after the date they signed for the item and was told that I would have to wait a full 14 days to get any information. Then suddenly the box was returned to me with no email or note inside--absolutely no explanation. I sent it back again with the return information, including their return confirmation number, and once again got the box returned to me with no explanation. The bottom line is that the headphones may be fine for computer gaming, but I can't use them, and this company gave me the runaround for over two months, never returning my money. Be sure what you purchase from them is really what you want since you'll be stuck with it, apparently, even if they say they'll allow a return. I don't know what to do with the headphones; maybe I can make a very weird planter or something. :(
B0072GPPNC|5.0|Steven Spielberg's War Horse misses the boat to being a masterpiece by about 70 years. It's easy to imagine it being a John Ford film or, because of the way Spielberg treats each frame like a canvas, perhaps a film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The use of color, the story, and even the score hearken back to Old Hollywood, but the story has all the elements of a Hallmark film and that's what ultimately restrains it. The story, while epic in scope, is nothing we haven't seen before. In fact, we've seen it done thousands of times. If released in the 1940s, War Horse would be hailed as a masterpiece. Now, it's just an extraordinarily well-made film with familiar story arcs and motifs; an idealistic fairy tale set during WWI that is crowd-pleasing, uplifting, sentimental, and sappy. The heavy drama is kept contained, let loose just enough to tug at the heartstrings of the audience. This could have been a failure of unfathomable proportions, but Spielberg is too talented a filmmaker to allow that. Here, he's made an old-fashioned tearjerker that works incredibly despite reeking of familiarity.<br /><br />Based on a children's book by Michael Morpurgo, the film is essentially told from the perspective of Joey, the thoroughbred horse of the title. Ted Narracott (Peter Mullan), a farmer, buys the horse at an auction for 30 guineas, intending to use him as a plough horse. His decision also stems from spite, as his landlord Lyons (David Thewlis) attempted to outbid him on the horse. Now, Ted is unable to pay rent to Lyons. Ted's son Albert (Jeremy Irvine) names the horse Joey and begins training it for the plough. Soon, with WWI looming and in imminent danger of losing their farm, Ted sells Joey to a young soldier, with Albert promising the horse that they will see each other again. The film follows Joey as he drifts from owner to owner, separated from each new one by the tragedies of war. The people who inherit him are the kind-hearted stock characters you expectto find in such a blood-soaked timeframe.<br /><br />Alas, sometimes breaking new ground is not necessary in telling a good, albeit familiar story. Be aware that War Horse is quite heavy on the sap, going for easy emotional sentiment that has worked with audiences consistently for years. It takes no risks, does nothing we haven't seen before; but even at its most eye-rolling, generic moments it comes together wonderfully. At nearly 2½ hours, it moves quickly and the stock characters give you something to immediately latch onto. Furthermore, while it's rooted heavily in drama, there are some intensely exciting (horse-related) sequences. The scene where Joey gallops through a warzone, ending up trapped in no-man's land may be one of the most thrilling sequences Spielberg has ever filmed.<br /><br />It really is too strong an achievement to dismiss. Predictable it may be, even with that needless, last-minute dramatic conflict, it's a hard film not to enjoy. While the cynic in me tried to fight it, the film did bring me close to tears and I have to applaud Spielberg for trying to tell these classic, cinematic stories while maintaining the feel of them. Some will complain that the film is too generic; expecting more from Spielberg, but it also may become one of those family-friendly movies that achieve \\"classic status\\" among suburban America. It's great entertainment, exquisitely made and nostalgic. While it follows a predictable path, War Horse has plenty of heart and feels commandeered from a long-gone era of films and filmmaking. For this, I both admire and respect it. In many ways, it's one of the most congenial films of 2011.<br /><br />GRADE: A-

1592332803|5.0|So I've been looking for vegan desserts and figured I'd give this book a try. I'm so glad I did. I received it quick on Thursday and by Friday I was already making the covered picture - Chocolate Chips Cookies. They were delicious. I bought everything organic. I only told people they were VEGAN when they came back and asked for another one. They are so delicious. This was my first time using the Ener-G egg replacer and I had my doubts at first. I wanted to use applesauce but I figured I'd stick to the recipe before changing it - and I'm glad i did. Looking forward to making my family a cake.

B006IDG2T6|4.0|This perfectly portioned apology against Free Will will spark frowns and questions for almost any reader.  Harris' treatment of the subject appears balanced with excellently written quotations addressing the most powerful arguments against his conclusions.  I suspect astute Philosophy students will find the work light.<br />I enjoyed being challenged to consider exactly where my thoughts come from.  My understanding of personal responsibility was also challenged.  I found this work perfect for a stimulating Saturday morning read.  I don't think I freely chose my love for Sam Harris' insight but I am lucky to experience it.
B001RNO7D0|5.0|Awesome shoe. The sole is robust has some weight to it but would not consider it heavy.  Overall the shoe is put together very well and will last a long time.  The leather is soft but still rugged and will hold up.  These are the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn and is casual and functional for hiking and walking in the rain.

0596804822|5.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for.  I needed a book that explained the exact opengl es 2.0 api that is used in iOS.  This book's examples are in C++, which is perfect because I plan to use mostly c++ in my iOS app's logic and graphics code.  Objective-C programmers will probably be scared off by the use of C++ and STL in this book, but they shouldn't be.  If you're writing games or any kind of cpu intensive program, C++ is a better choice than objective-C.<br /><br />The only negative about this book is that it is now a few years old and therefore the text talks about an older version of xcode.

B005VTS4EY|2.0|looks cute, but open feint is mentioned in the app description and there is no way to disable it from the main screen or menu. That is unacceptable. Opteron feint is unnecessary in games, and if included should always prompt the user IMMEDIATELY to disable it.

B005VTS4EY|3.0|I'm enjoying this game. Simple concept but with some real puzzling levels. Played it straight through to level 50, but now I'm stuck. I agree that there needs to be a way to earn a skip or clue or something. I'd like to keep playing but I am blocked. As a free game it would have gotten four stars, but since it's not, I'm giving 3 because I would be annoyed to pay for a game I couldn't continue.

082300659X|5.0|This is a must have book for any student studying art. The instructions are well written. So often when viewing a work of art in print, the details and nuances are lost. That is not the case in this book. The illustrations alone are well worth the cost of the book. The DVD is just the icing on the cake.

B0071MV540|3.0|Tower Heist is a average movie worth renting, but not buying. It has its moments that are pretty good, especially when the car is hanging outside the tower, but overall its not as good as it should be considering the cast involved. I think everyone played their parts well, though Eddie Murphy is showing his age trying to play a street punk and more of a role he would have mastered 25 years ago. I was never bored with the movie, but it just wasnt that good. Its a popcorn flick. Rent it when you are bored, don't expect too much from it, and you wont be disappointed.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I remember reading the first book before any of the others came out. I was so into the story and suddenly it ended, bringing great misery upon me.<br /><br />Now I was able to read the Omnibus edition, and I can definitely say it was really good. Not just part of the five books, but all of it. At no point was I ever bored. At no point did the story feel  like it wasn't working.<br /><br />Im a huge sci-fi/fantasy reader, and after so many years of reading, most books, or series, seem to be variations of something I've read before. Wool seems to cut its own niche and do its own thing pretty independent of whats come before. The author did a good job of putting the pieces and story together, and it has left me really wanting more.<br /><br />It also leaves you very curious about what will come next and unanswered questions that you want answers to literally RIGHT NOW!<br /><br />[sort of spoilers]<br /><br />1. The past was only explained generically so what really did happen to destroy the earth? Did the USA really do something like nuke the whole planet because it was losing power in the world and wanted a new world order? Was it global warming gone wild and earth became something like Venus?<br />2. Who was Lukas talking to in Silo #1? Is there a US government in there? Was that the president of whats left?<br />3. Will the shadowy leaders of the other silos try to secretly attack #18 when they realize what is going on?<br />4. What exactly is going on in Silo #40?<br />5. Can we get a prequel series of books, or one book, that discusses what really made all this happen? How did the world basically come to an end? These books could tell the story of what was happening, why the silos were created, and the story leading up to the day the doors were closed to the rest of the world that was left for the last time.<br /><br />Congratulations Hugh on some really great storytelling. Now give us more Wool.

B000068FY0|5.0|At 36 years old and having been a music fan/collector since 10, I am still ocassionally amazed at some of the music that has eluded me all these years.  This is one of those times.  As I write this I am listening to \\"Blood well Right\\".  I have had the \\"Breakfast in America albums for years and it has been one of my favs.  This album seems to be a little more of the prog rock style with a more varied range of sounds, though I love \\"Breakfast in America\\" as well.  This is great albums all the way through.

B007CM9AMI|3.0|Being from Bruces hometown, his music holds a special place in my heart whenever I hear it no matter where I am in the world, it brings me home to Jersey. I bought \\"Wrecking Ball\\" on iTunes the day it came out and listened to it all the way through and wasn't sure how I felt about it.  I loved Bruce's latest works like \\"The Rising\\" and \\"Magic\\" but felt that his last album fell short and had high hopes for this album.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad album by any means but leaves much to be desired from Bruce and The E Street Band. Some of my favorites from the album include, \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\", \\"Easy Money\\", \\"Death to My Hometown\\" and \\"Wrecking Ball\\". I will give this one a few more listens but it just didn't do it for me personally.
0553801473|3.0|A Dance With Dragons is, for me, the least enjoyable Song of Ice and Fire entry to date. Most of the book is dedicated to moving characters around and for set-up. The final third of the book is considerably better than the preceding two thirds, and is probably the saving grace for the book as a whole. There's some more expansion in scope, as well as some smaller developments on the expansions in the previous volume, A Feast for Crows.<br /><br />Once again, as with Feast for Crows, Martin relies on his world and characters. Unlike Feast, however, where Cersei provided a counterbalance with plot development, there's much less plot going on, making the narrative far more reliant on world and characters. Some of it is interesting, but mostly all the characters drifting around left me bored.<br /><br />There's some political intrigue, but it mostly lies beneath the surface, only to rear its head in the latter half of the book. There isn't a whole lot of focus on these threats, nor is much indicated about them, so there's a distinct lack of tension from that.<br /><br />Of all the characters, Jon Snow was my favourite, purely because i'm more interested in him as a character. Tyrion had some interesting character development, and his sarcasm and cynicism is always a breath of fresh air, but significant portions of his story are focused on the things around him. Daenerys was the least interesting of the three main perspectives. Of the others, only Theon, Davos and Barristan Selmy noticably stood out, and they're only here for as long as is absolutely necessary. Arya continues to be a joy. We get a bit of time with Bran, mostly to see where he goes.<br /><br />The rest of the viewpoints are minor characters, meant only to shed light on other areas of the world and developing plot arcs. We return to a few characters from the previous book, briefly, so the plotlines from Dance and Feast begin to sync, but these cover very little ground.<br /><br />There are two overriding issues which put a negative tint on this book. The first is the number of cliffhangers, the second the way seemingly finished character/story arcs are unashamedly manipulated.<br /><br />The first point: nearly every plot arc of this book, divided either by setting or character, ends with a cliffhanger. Given my feelings about the first two thirds of the book, and how the final third shone by comparison, it's frustrating to have everything build up and lead into... nothing. While the next volume, Winds of Winter, looks to be positively packed with plot action, everything that happened in this book builds up to a climactic point which just ends with a \\"to be continued\\" notice.<br /><br />The second point: by this time in the series, Martin is abusing the unreliable narrator. If a character dies, it's no given that they're staying dead, or that they even died at all. Cutting off the narrative at a point where everything seems lost, or showing something happening then having a conspicuous absence of the character involved, can be effective if used occasionally. It's not, though, it's used several times, and as a result the events themselves lose their impact because, instead of having it sink in and being surprised later, i'm left wondering whether it's really done, or how things turned back from the brink. It dulls the impact. I understand that Martin is telling these chapters from a strictly subjective viewpoint, but that doesn't preclude an indication of finality.<br /><br />I'm hoping for a short wait for the next book, and some serious delivery on setup. If not, the series might begin to crumble under its own weight.<br /><br />3/5
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always liked Spider solataire and played endless games on my laptop while at work on slow days.<br />To have such a great version of it for my new Kindle Fire is amazing. The game moves quickly, it never<br />freezes and it is VERY customizable.  I love it and sometimes lay in bed and play it till I get sleepy.
0553801503|4.0|In A Feast For Crows, Martin produces the biggest expansion of scope in the series thus far. We get 3 new main character perspectives - Cersei, Samwell and Brienne - as well as about a half dozen others with one or two chapters each. This is very much a transition book, a way to get from A to B. Martin throws in several of his renowned twists, but here they fail to have much impact, particularly considering the increasing ambiguity and uncertainty around what actually happens.<br /><br />Martin's writing remains competent, though the chapters are progressively getting longer and longer, but with the plot stagnating he necessarily falls back onto either the characters or the world. As a result, character development tends to dominate the main viewpoints. We also get various glimpses of the world, but neither it or the characters are engaging enough to stand up on their own.<br /><br />I found Cersei to be the most interesting. She remains completely unlikeable, but she's at the centre of events at King's Landing, and seeing things from her viewpoint is interesting. Jaime's character development continued, and he half made up for Tyrion's absence in this book. Samwell was also interesting despite spending the whole book journeying, though his part was a little too stretched out, and I think Arya's perspectives are the most enjoyable they've ever been. Brienne was somewhat interesting, but she also spends the whole novel journeying through the wilderness, and apart from a few glimmers of her character her part was relatively boring. Sansa's part was least enjoyable, but mostly due to the scarcity of her chapters combined with the fact she's only in the book to show events elsewhere in the world.<br /><br />In addition to these, there's the other minor character perspectives giving insight into the settings of Dorne and the Iron Islands. In retrospect, after reading a Dance with Dragons, it's more obvious that these things have a deal of importance. It didn't seem likeit during reading, though, and even though by the end of most of these chapters I was interested there's a big gap between them, and there's normally a shift to a different character perspective. Overall, these parts tended to be semi-interesting.<br /><br />In all, I wasn't too disappointed by Feast. It was better than I expected, with almost all my favourite viewpoint characters missing, but Martin's strength is definitely plot, and he moved away from it here.<br /><br />3.5/5
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|I saw this CD on a Rolling Stone best-of list for year-end CDs.  \\"Lovin' You Baby\\" is one of my favorite tracks with Bradley's plaintive vocals strong and oozing longing in every bar, \\"No more bad dreams, baby; No more afraid to open the door and let you in.\\"  \\"How Long\\" is another favorite of mine with a slow blues groove opening the track and Charles' vocals looking for salvation amidst trials and tribulations, \\"How long must you keep suffering like this?  You know our people are suffering.  They're looking for something to look up to; They're looking for a change.\\"  The rest of the set is also strong with his version of Neil Young's \\"Heart of Gold,\\" the title track and \\"The Telephone Song\\" catching my ear.

B004T0XYKK|4.0|I won't waste time reviewing the film, as most of you will have seen this countless times, and concentrate on the Blu Ray itself.<br /><br />The picture:<br />The transfer is superb, far superior to the recent Horse Soldiers Blu Ray release, the picture is bright, rich and not overly sharpened. The blacks are pretty solid and the picture holds together in the dark passages, there is obvious grain in certain scenes but this should be expected due to the age of the film.<br /><br />The sound:<br />5.1 surround on a John Wayne film! They've done a pretty good job on this, adding sound effects and splitting the soundtrack to give it a sense of space, the spurs literally jump out of the speakers and Jerry Goldsmith's score sounds superb! Don't expect this to be like a modern film, it's not true 5.1 but it does the job.<br /><br />If only they could enhance the woeful acting by Jennifer O'Neil, however pretty she was I've see chairs with more talent, and a pretty poor effort by Jorge Rivero, the film would get 4 stars. Look out for Mike 'Tarzan' Henry as a sheriff!<br /><br />All in all an excellent Blu Ray release which is encouraging for future John Wayne releases. 3 out of 5 for the film, taken up to 4 out of 5 as looks and sounds so, so good it actually enhances the watching experience.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book! I couldn't put it down and once I finished I had to start on the next one! Not usually my type of light reading but, I read due to a friend's suggestion and didn't regret it.<br />Great work, great detail. Puts you right in that moment with what the character. Loved!

B005N0PJJO|5.0|It's a typical romance novel in most ways.  She and he repeat themselves in speech and sex, their shallowness can be exasperating.  I won't repeat what others have said - they're mostly right about the story being great, and that if attention was paid to inconsistencies and repetition, it could have been one of the most unbelievable trilogies ever written.<br /><br />With that said, though, there is little that will stop me from devouring the third one.  The NYTimes review talks about Ana being one-dimensional and him being abusive.  But the world is full of immature abusive men and too trusting immature women, so to most of us this is not news, or even particularly shocking.  And you might be tempted to say why is soft porn being put at the front of the store (as some are now doing)?  Well think of it in context - compare it to the incredibly disturbing and violent images and story line of a \\"Saw\\" movie trailer one is surprised with on prime time television.  I had bad dreams, and stopped watching that channel.  They work through their problems, illuminating why certain things are abusive and others are simply awesome sex, and I feel this is exceptional.  The author allows the characters to develop and use their experiences to change their lives.<br /><br />The amount of people who I've known who have healed and finally understood their own sexuality through Dominance/Submission, and often to find their soul mates, is staggering.  I do understand why it's not for everyone, but glad that the concepts are becoming more mainstream and available to anyone who can download books or walk into a store.<br /><br />Fifty shades is a wonderful romp, and I'll be sad when I've finished the trilogy.

First, the subtitle &#34;Based on the Restored Text&#34; is misleading in suggesting that the prior edition was somehow faulty.  One German critic argued way back in 1957 that the Cathedral chapter with the famous &#34;Before the Law&#34; parable (Kafka had previously published it as a short story) should be moved from the second to last chapter where Max Brod, Kafka's editor, put it and put just before the Painter chapter.  The order of the chapters has always been controversial because Kafka did not leave a table of contents behind when he died.  There is nothing to be restored since the original order will always be unknown.  Brod's order has stuck, and this edition does not alter Brod's order at all and includes the same fragments he did and in the same order.  There is no difference between the text of this translation and the text of the earlier translation by the Muirs. To call Mitchell's version &#34;restored&#34; is merely a marketing trick.<br />  Second, it is to be expected that a new translation of a famous work of literature like The Trial will trumpet its superiority over any previous translation, and translator Breon Mitchell does just that in his introduction to the new edition.  In his introduction, he finds various fault with the earlier translation of The Trial by the Muirs. [[ASIN:0805204164 The Trial]] But similar kinds of faults may be found in Mitchell's less readable translation.  For example, in &#34;The Painter&#34; section, Mitchell mistranslates the German word &#34;Erkl&auml;rung,&#34; which means &#34;affidavit,&#34; as &#34;certificate.&#34;  Certificate in German is &#34;Zeugnis&#34; or &#34;Bescheinigung.&#34; The Muirs give &#34;affidavit of your innocence&#34;; Mitchell gives &#34;certificate of your innocence.&#34;  Mitchell deliberately makes Kafka's highly enigmatic text more obscure without any justification for doing so.  Mitchell also sacrifices readability to pedantry.  In his introduction, for example, Mitchell objects to the Muirs' use of the word &#34;postponement&#34;:  The painter explains K's two options, &#34;Ostensible acquittal and indefinite postponement.&#34;  Mitchell translates the same German words as  &#34;Apparent acquittal and protraction.&#34;  &#34;Apparent acquittal&#34; is arguably an improvement over &#34;ostensible&#34; because of the alliteration (both apparent and acquittal begin with the same sound).  But &#34;protraction&#34; not a commonly used noun and has no meaning even as legalese whereas postponement does.<br />  Since the kind and extent of legalese Kafka uses in his novel is one of the major issues Kafka scholars discuss, Mitchell's choice of an English word that any reader will needlessly wonder at (when the more obvious equivalent favored by the Muirs does just fine) may be considered as much of a flaw as any he notes in the Muirs.  I do think the Muir translation, whatever its flaws, reads much better than Mitchell's does.  The Muir &#34;definitive edition&#34; (as it was advertised on the cover in 1968) includes the three postscripts Kafka's first editor, Max Brod, added to his three editions of The Trial.  The first and second postscripts tell the story of Kakfa's request that Brod all of Kafka's writings.  All three postscripts are missing from the Mitchell translation.  Malcolm Pasley's excellent afterword to the German edition of the Trial on which Mitchell's translation is based oddly is not translated by Mitchell whereas the Pasley's afterword to the new translation of Kafka's The Castle is translated.<br />  However, I recommend you read both translations, as Mitchell does point out at least one major improvement he made. Mitchell rightly uses the same English word every time for one particular German word Kafka uses five times (the Muirs used different English words for the same German word, thereby negating any possible significance Kafka intended his repetition of a German word to have).<br />  By the way, the English translator of one of the best books on Kafka, [[ASIN:0816615152 Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature (Theory and  History of Literature)]], used the Muir translation and it reads well when cited.  In my view, the best reading of The Trial is Jacques Derrida's &#34;Before the Law,&#34; available in [[ASIN:0415900573 Acts of Literature]]way, the English translator of one of the best books on Kafka, [[ASIN:0816615152 Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature (Theory and  History of Literature)]], used the Muir translation and it reads well when cited.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|All those Michael Moore haters probably never watched an entire movie of his  because he's been maligned  by the \\"Right Wing Echo Machine\\". This is his most affecting film , I think. It really makes connections between our current system and those want to keep the status quo. As with ALL the evils of our society, it comes down to money. It's really sickening to think of America compared to these other countries, and how LAME we are to NOT have universal health care. And unlike those stupid misinformed folks that say, \\"I don't want a government run health care, or socialized medicine, or to be like Europe\\", I've actually been to these countries featured in the film(except Cuba)...and to the man not ONE would switch their health care for ours. They work...Ours, not so much. So PLEASE inform, educate yourself and check out SICKO and ALL of Moore's films.
B006M81Y72|5.0|Couldn't put this book down - exceptionally funny in parts and sad in others.  You really feel the emotions that Dex and Emma are feeling.  Great read!
0439023483|5.0|I was, I must admit, skeptical from the very beginning. I'm not usually one into the latest things and only eventually read the Hunger Games after picking it up at the library.<br />Forget twilight, forget Harry Potter. It's the Hunger Games all the way!<br />Maybe the reason I'm drawn to this book so much is that it's actually, in it's own way, relatable. These are humans who have had their own share of suffering, their own consequences of war. Our history is woven into this book.<br />Thus, I'm very drawn to these characters, and it's almost as if they are tactile. And while the author's actual writing style is not fleshed out, her story is!<br />I'm looking forwards to the movie and reading the rest of the series.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|I like hidden pic games and will deal with corny storylines, but this game has no control. I had to tap several times on the items before the game would cross them off the list. this happened on every chapter with almost every item. so glad I tried the free one before I put out five bucks for the full game.:
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book (and she & I are ready for the movie to come out at the end of the month!) and I'm so glad that I made this my first purchase on my Kindle (and buying the digital trilogy version will save you money in the long run!) The main reason I am writing this review is because many people have said that the font changes sizes for them throughout the books - however, this had not been the case for me (not sure if that's because it was fixed or because I have the Kindle Fire) but I am halfway through the 3rd book and have not had an issue with the font size at all.<br /><br />What an amazing series (though I am only halfway through the last book)!  I normally dislike books that are written in first person but Suzanne does such an amazing job that I forget that I the book is a first person book. Even with her lack of conversation versus the amount of long detailed paragraphs, it is not hard to get lost in this series.  And don't let the talk of this being a teen book stop you from buying it if you are an adult! You will feel for the characters as you progress through the books and you don't want it to ever end!

B004LWZW8I|2.0|Capitalizing on 300, we now have branched out into making up new greek myths.<br /><br />We did Troy, why not the Odyssey?  That might have been good.  Or make a version of the Iliad where the gods are involved like they were in the story by Homer.<br /><br />This just left me asking all sorts of questions during the movie, which is never good.  If I'm asking questions, it means that I am not remotely immersed in the story.<br /><br />If Hyperion had a bow that could blast a 30 foot diameter hole in a solid block wall, why didnt he just take an extra five minutes to shoot a couple more arrows into the Hellenic army and win the final fight before it started?  He just couldnt be bothered?  He didnt want to guarantee victory?  He just gathered an army of thousands, marched them across a desert, wiped out the Hellenic villages and majority of their soldiers, but he had some other crap to do that night and was in a hurry?<br /><br />Why would anyone go fight for Hyperion in the first place?  His leadership qualities are not inspiring, he has his employees smacked in the groin with a giant mallet so they wont reproduce.  Those soldiers who dont get their giggleberries crunched get stabbed or get their eyes poked out.  His management style is highly questionable.  I'm pretty sure I'd seek alternative employment.<br /><br />If the gods could instantly teleport themselves to Olympus and back, maybe that would have been a good thing to do when getting stabbed in the crotch area by a titan.  I like to avoid getting stabbed in the crotch myself.  I cant help but assume that gods like to avoid getting stabbed in the jimmy also.  Poseidon, or at least I figured it was Poseidon (he had a trident after all), didnt seem to be in favor of being on the receiving end of the whole crotch stabbing.  Good time to jet back to Olympus real quick.<br /><br />How did this army of what appears to be hundreds of thousands get across what appears to be a very unforgiving desert?  Where did theyget food and water.  The logisitics are baffling.  I liked the movie 'Kingdom of Heaven', as they address this issue directly.  Here we just have this huge freaking army sitting around, waiting to go kill some folk for a boss who is kind of a dick to begin with.
B007H51DQG|5.0|There seems to be a lot of negativity circling this show. I really don't get it, the way some people talk you would think it was the reincarnation of LOST or something hahaha.<br /><br />Its called suspension of disbelief people. Its not perfect, everything doesn't always add up 100%, but no story ever does. If I cared to sit there and over analyze I could poke holes in every plot EVER. Go along for the ride, don't fight it, haha...<br /><br />Ahhh well, we all perceive things differently. I think the characters are great, the story enjoyable, and the men smoking hot. (Oh Daryl I'll eat your squirrel stew any day)<br /><br />That being said this was probably my least favorite episode all season. It did seem a bit drawn out. I haven't thought any of the previous episodes slow...which is odd cause everyone else has. You know what? Maybe its a psychology thing, I usually wait a couple weeks for a few to come out before watching them all at once, but I didn't do that this time. NEW STRATEGY PEOPLE. If it seems slow, wait till the end of the season, take a pajama day, and just watch them all in one sitting.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|This movie got panned by the critics, but I found it to be a decent horror movie, at least as good as Carpenter's. The only problem is that it's not the \\"original\\", it pays homage to it, and so there are many similarities. But if taken on its own, it's as good, except if judged by \\"freshness\\" or \\"originality.\\" Then it falls when compared to Star Trek's or James Bond's reboots. The way to enjoy this, then, is to forget you saw Carpenter's version. Until the ending credits, that is.<br /><br />But it's actually fun to see them recreate what happened at that smoldering outpost that Kurt Russell's team finds later. Kind of like the other other reboots mentioned, seeing things click into place.<br /><br />You know the plot. Our heroine, Kate, is invited to be on the team for a mysterious discovery by famous, cold-scientist type Sanders. His chilliness is part of the horror, in small ways. The Americans in the team of Norwegians add a note of xenophobia later. The story is the same, with the addition of a fresh, new way to \\"out\\" the Thing. The \\"testing\\" scene is full of tension as each person gives off a suitable aura of menace. Most of the characters are likeable, even for the short time you get to know the poor schmucks.<br /><br />The requisite gore is there, although not as icky as reviews led me to expect. Well, your opinion may be different. I suppose it's the type of violence that matters. There are impalements, but no (human) dismemberments, as I recall, so that's \\"toned down\\" in my book. There are still some disturbing moments, such as the terrible intimacy of one absorption during a long, panicky scene (when the flamethrower chokes, of course - but not before recreating an iconic image from its \\"sequel\\"). There are some surprises and new creatures, although after a while the larger ones look similar due to their toothed, gaping maws.<br /><br />Generally, the shock value is diminished if you've seen JC's version, but they manage to pull off a couple of good scares.<br /><br />The ending wasn't as neat as I'd have liked, and didn't quite tie in as well to the \\"series\\", but it still provided a clever twist.<br /><br />I liked it. That's all that matters, right?es.<br /><br />The ending wasn't as neat as I'd have liked, and didn't quite tie in as well to the \\"series\\", but it still provided a clever twist.<br /><br />I liked it.

B0075FMTJS|4.0|I didnt initially purchase this album but as I heard more of the singles off the album (especially \\"Love on Top\\") I thought it might be something to check out so I listened to the samples and decided to purchase the album. Im definitely satisfied with my purchase, IV has been in heavy rotation since I purchased it. My favorites off the album are \\"Love on Top\\" , \\"Dance for You\\" (which is why i purchased the deluxe ed.), \\"Countdown\\", \\"Party\\", \\"Rather Die Young\\", and \\"Schoolin Life\\" (deluxe ed.). Not to say the rest of the album isn't good but those are definitely my faves; overall in my opinion this was a strong album. I would give it 4.5 out of 5 stars there were 4 versions (3 on the deluxe ed.) of \\"Run the World\\" the original was enough.

B002IFT1ZA|3.0|A captivating story.  Spectacular scenary.  Superb casting.  First rate actors and acting.  I was immersed in Westeros in minutes and could have watched for hours.  But about the time I was convinced this was a new epic adventure, HBO reminds me with a regular gratuitous sex scene that never mind, it is just a made for TV movie after all.  A waste of good actors flopping, slurping, and moaning through one more round of soft porn about once every 40 minutes.  About like if George R. R. Martin inserted such a diversion every 10 pages.  C'mon HBO, that is a stale, old, formula.  Do Better.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|If you're into bushcraft, or survivalism,  this is the knife to carry.  This knife is 1 pound of solid steel. The spine of the knife is the thickest I've ever seen on any knife out there.  This knife can easily baton through 4\\" pieces of wood.  The scales are synthetic and have a great feel to them.  The edge is quite sharp, but you're not going to shave with it, but no knife this big can do that.  If you want a razor, buy a Cold Steel Recon 1.  This knife is for heavy work in the field.  Another good feature, it's made in the USA.  The only foreign part is the sheath, which is made in Taiwan, but it's actually built very well. The knife locks into the sheath very tight. It will take some breaking in to loosen it up. You don't have to worry about it falling out or losing it. There is a lanyard hole at the end of the knife, as well as holes in the knife sheath if you want to lace in some paracord.<br /><br />Ka-Bar made this knife like a tank. It's just a tough, rugged piece of equipment. If I had to go into the field with the choice of only one knife, this one would surely be my top vote.  I've seen this knife priced much higher than what is advertised here.  So you're not only getting a quality tool, you're not being taken to the cleaners buying it either.  It's a heckuva deal.<br /><br />I've been a survivalist for over 25 years, and I would trust my life to this knife.

1612130585|3.0|I bought the first two books on Kindle but plan on skipping the third installment.  If you're paying $30 for the paperbacks, you're paying $25 too much in my opinion.  The first book was good but the second book was mediocre.  Annoyances in wording that could be overlooked in the first book just grated on my nerves in the sequel: hooded, dark eyes; the way his pants hung low around his pelvis; the apex of her thighs;I can't believe this Greek god is mine. And Ana does alot of 'muttering' for an independant, college educated woman. Really, some new descriptions in the writing are called for in the next book.<br /><br />Let's be honest, I'm reading it for the hot sex scenes, which are pretty good.  The plot is stupid.  Anyone that falls in love with such a complicated man and agrees to marry him after knowing him only three weeks, needs to have her head examined. Contrary to what other reviewers have written, this love story is not believable at all. What a tired formula for romance novels: Incredibly handsome (Greek god!), millionaire with a dark secret sweeps poor, lovely young woman off her feet.  Can their hurried,but true love overcome his dark past?! Every obstacle is either solved with money or sex. (I'm sure we all find this to be true in our own lives!) I found the time travelling historical romance of Jamie and Claire in \\"Outlander\\" to be much more believable with better plots (lots of plots!) and writing beyond compare.  I know, it sounds weird, but read it and you will not only agree that it's a much better romance but you'll be hooked as well.<br /><br />Save yourself the aggravation and skip the third installment.  After all, there is only one way these formulaic romances end, isn't there?  Happily ever after......
B0073PZIYI|2.0|The main character is portrayed by a singer/dancer. A supporting character is played by a contestant on America's Next Top Model.

0517548232|5.0|Well, I read it and got a lot out of it, but, if you take a look at the negative reviews you'll see that it's \\"misleading\\", or \\"right-wing propaganda\\", or a \\"libertarian manifesto\\".

B002SAUCBC|3.0|Decades ago, Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote a short story about two men, longtime rivals, who find themselves captured by the enemy during a war.  The enemy commander orders that the two men be lined up side-by-side for a footrace to finally settle their ongoing dispute.  The trick is, he has his men slice their throats before he yells \\"Go!\\"  They both die, of course, but one of them manages to thrust his arm ahead of his rival before the end.  He, of course, is \\"the winner.\\"<br /><br />Stephen King's THE LONG WALK is pretty much this same story.  Set in an alternate America, the novel revolves around an annual footrace in which a hundred teenage boys walk to the death.  The rules state that the walkers must continue at a speed of at least 4 miles per hour.  If they fall below that speed for any reason, they are warned.  After three warnings, they are shot.  The winner, who is the last boy standing, gets something vaguely referred to as \\"the Prize,\\" which is supposedly everything he wants for the rest of his life.  One wonders while reading whether \\"winning\\" such a contest is even possible.<br /><br />King wrote THE LONG WALK when he was eighteen and a freshman in college back in the 1960's.  His goal seems to have been to satirize the very American fixation on television game shows (in which people willingly humiliate themselves for a chance to win a refrigerator or a car), as well as our perverse attraction to such horrors as highway accidents, fistfights, and bloodletting of any kind.  King has a valid point and THE LONG WALK works as social satire.  However, it doesn't work as well as a novel.<br /><br />First, the premise itself is impossibly absurd.  The walkers in this novel continue for over four days (yes, more than 96 hours!) at a brisk pace of 4 mph without a break of any kind.  This is, without a doubt, physically impossible.  World record walkers have managed close to 127 miles of continuous walking, but King's teens make it over 300 miles.<br /><br />Second, these walkers spend most of those 96 hours talking to each other!  Anyone who's ever done any fast walking knows that you can't carry on a conversation for very long when you're exerting yourself like that.  But King's teens rattle on and on about their childhoods, their girlfriends, their fears, their philosophies of life, and their wishes and dreams.  They make jokes, razz each other, yell at each other, and act like any bunch of kids hanging out on a Saturday afternoon.  It just stretches credibility beyond its limits and makes it hard to really buy into the real horror as the boys are shot dead, one by one.<br /><br />I like King's work, and THE LONG WALK is entertaining enough, if you can get past the absurdity of its plot.  I think, however, this would have made a much better short story than it does a full-length novel.  Borges got it right in just three pages.br /><br />Second, these walkers spend most of those 96 hours talking to each other!

1451637500|5.0|I do not know if this is the last, Miles Vorkosigan story Ms. Bujold will give us, but it provides a satisfying conclusion. What I like most about these books is that her characters are given admirable human traits. They are not comic book action heroes; they are good people.<br />In this book, there is, of course, Miles. He is noticeably more mature in this book than in previous ones in the series but no less willing to take on a seemingly quixotic task, pursue it with manic obsession, or bend rules to see that right is done. You still don't want to cross him.<br />Roic is Miles' bodyguard and his main function seems to be shaking his head in disbelief when his employer does something especially dangerous, risky, or inexplicable. He's a minor character, a sidekick, but a good one.<br />Then there is Jin, an almost Dickensian waif living on a rooftop with a menagerie of pets. He may be almost too stereotypical--poor, honest, and a bit suspicious about the intentions of grownups, but he's a good kid and you have to like him.<br />Books like music, food, and probably most other things, are a matter of taste. Personally, I like a character driven story. If I'm going to spend several hours with fictional characters, I want them to be people I would like to hang out with in real life. Ms. Bujold provides those.<br />The only gripe I really have about the book is the production. I have the first paperback edition published by Baen. It is not an attractive book. The gutter and margins are too narrow, almost to the point of being difficult to read, and the last twenty or so pages are previews of unrelated stories from the same publisher. It is as though they've tacked a commercial on the end.

0805079831|1.0|After reading two of Jeffrey Sachs' books, I delved into The Shock Doctrine's chapter on Bolivia's economic reforms in the late 1980s. Having recently researched Sachs' work in Bolivia, I was quick to notice a number of factual errors and points that were poorly backed up by Klein. Reading a single chapter in this book told me everything I needed to know about Klein's wishy-washy writing style and has saved me from reading another 500+ pages of what I can only surmise to be of similar garbage.

B00280LYIC|5.0|My son and I finally watched the movie last week. I was thrilled when he said, \\"Mom, I want to read the book!\\"<br /><br />He's NEVER asked to read a book on his own. (Much to my dismay!)<br /><br />So I picked up his Kindle and had it for him in seconds. (I love technology!)<br /><br />As he was still finishing up a book for a school assignment, I thought I'd read the book so we could converse about it, and maybe I could help keep him interested. (He has ADHD and loses interest in stuff quickly... unless it's a special interest subject, he's also an Aspie) which mythology happens to be a special interest of his, so I've been hopeful.<br /><br />HOWEVER.... I still have not given him back his Kindle. (He got it for his birthday, mom didn't get one.) I read the whole series and am now on book two of the Heroes series. Yes, I'm 36.. and gobbling up this YA series as fast as humanly possible.<br /><br />These books have great characters and involved plots that carry though out the series and continue through the next. I'm still reading in that, \\"Ok, so then what happened\\" frenzy.<br /><br />Very, very good... For your kids, and YOU!
B0015DROBO|5.0|this is a great book..a little slow in some spots but overall it's a real page turner. i recommend that you read the first book in the series so that you can become familiar with the characters otherwise you will be lost. love this series!!!

Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer feed off of each other so well here that it feels completely unscripted. If language bothers you, stay away.

0143038419|5.0|What would you do if your life suddenly fell apart?<br /><br />Award winning author, and journalist for GQ Magazine, Elizabeth Gilbert, decided to take a year and live abroad, touching down in Italy, India and Indonesia for four months each.<br /><br />Now I have to admit that when my girlfriend first loaned me this book, I really wasn't that interested in reading it (I had a new mythology book I was itching to get to). But she said it made her want to visit Italy (I love that idea) and that it was a quick and easy read. I was off to the beach for a few days and I needed an easy read to take with me, so I decided I'd give it a go (sorry mythology book).<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was hooked within the first few pages (I'm not usually interested in personal memoirs). But Elizabeth's story is one that many people can relate to. On the outside it seemed she had the perfect life; she was married to a terrific guy, she had a great job and a great house.<br /><br />But as we can all attest, sometimes appearances can be deceiving, and what Elizabeth found was that her world started to fall apart around her. She was suffering from depression and panic attacks and her marriage was disintegrating.<br /><br />In the hopes of discovering her spiritual self (and being in dire need of some recovery from life), she decides to take a year off and go to Italy, India and Indonesia under the premise that in Italy one learns about passion (and she'd always wanted to learn to speak Italian), in India one learns to connect with their inner spirit and in Indonesia one can learn to integrate the two.<br /><br />I really enjoyed her writing on the various cultures she lived in. For instance, I never knew that Naples, Italy, actually had the best pizza in the world? Of course I knew the best pizza in the world must be in Italy, I just had no idea where??? She also gives many interesting insights on life in an ashram (it's not all mediation - people can have fun there too) and she reveals the secret history of Bali.<br /><br />\\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is one of the most inspirational books I've read in a long time! Elizabeth's writing is witty, funny and sincere, so the book gave me the feeling of reading a close friend's memoir rather than someone who I'd never actually even heard of. And she had me laughing out loud throughout the whole book. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who has ever questioned their own life, or wondered about their own spiritual journey.<br /><br />And I will definitely be adding Elizabeth Gilbert to my list of people I'd most like to meet!

Download angry birds space when it comes out which on march 22 2012!!!!!!!! Also I think this game angry birds free is an awesome game. Best game ever download all versions of angry birds. I think  angry birds rio sucks because there is not many levels on the game. There are about 120 levels but all the levels are easy. But there is an update on angry birds rio coming march 2012! I hope rovio makes more versions of the game.
B000UD08HW|5.0|This Blu-ray isn't perfect. The flaws? A lot of smoke used in their show detracts from blu-ray perfect video quality.Wah. Nick Mason would have been nice to see. Boo-hoo. And it's rather bitter-sweet knowing this is my last really good look at Richard Wright before his death. RIP, Rick, we'll miss you.<br />Those gripes aside, this is 6 hours of Gilmour/Pink Floyd bliss. As other reviewers have noted seeing Gilmour & Wright doing Echoes is worth the price of purchase all by itself. Same with Astronomy Domaine. I've always loved Gilmours guitar. 'Soaring' has always been the word I use to describe his wonderful skill. A 2.5 hour concert with 3.5 hours of extra songs, documentaries, etc.<br />Well worth the price & I'll probably grab this blu-ray over the Pulse dvd when I need my Pink Floyd fix.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|It is rare that the cinematography and art direction in a film will make me just sit there and smile for no apparent reason.  Driver did exactly that, and for the longest time I found myself thinking \\"wow, this looks really well done\\".  The beginning builds slowly as you come to love the nameless \\"driver\\" he is seemingly soft yet remarkable cool.  When the movie kicks into full gear later on you will find yourself saying \\"WHOA! DID that just happen!\\".  Yes it really did and when this rollercoaster picks up speed there is not stopping it.  Looking forward to a sequel.
159448385X|5.0|I've read A Thousand Splendid Suns three times over the last few years, and every time I read it - I find something more beautiful in it, and I cry every time.  My nephew recommended it to me and I am a richer person for it.  Some of it is hard to read, and some of it punches you in the gut, but overall - even as sadly it ends or as well as it ends, depends on how you look at it - your heart is fuller.  What a beautiful testament to the human spirit.  Recommend highly.

B000S0GYRU|5.0|I saw Suspiria first around the age of 14 or 15, now at the age of 21, Argento is in my heart forever. Slowly but surely I have built my collection with his best work. Next I will be getting 4 Flies on Grey Velvet. He may not be Hitchcock but his work us just as enticing. It is all beautiful, planned out perfectly stunning. His work past Opera is not really worthy, but I love them all anyways. If you are even mildy interested in Argento or Giallo fims period, start with Argento FIRST, please, he is the grandaddy of the genre, just like Halloween was for the Slasher genre.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Pretty cool program. Lots of fun even for those of us without much skill. A cross between an arcade and puzzle game. BUT: the screen will not rotate. You must hold the tablet in a specific vertical orientation. Would get 5 stars otherwise.

May everyone who reads it be moved to live a better, happier life.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|Watched this movie in theaters and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. The movie is classic Hunter Thompson and is funny throughout.<br />This movie has plenty of random twists/turns and wild characters always getting into even more odd situations while enjoying more than a few home-brews and dealing with a hostile local populace.<br /><br />WARNING:<br />This movie is NOT for people who do not read and/or understand Hunter Thompson!<br /><br />This movie requires you to roll with some twists and turns in the plot line and doesn't always make sense. If you're looking for cheap corny laughs go buy a Will Farrell movie, and if you're looking for a contiguous, easy to follow storyline, then you shouldn't look here.

B004SH40BQ|5.0|It Cost 1/3 of the price I paid for the Nano 6th Gen but worth every penny.  So what if it sucks the battery dry? It's safe to say that hanging a cord from your wrist (Device.) to ears is dangerous, problem solved and it does not get in the way like I thought that it might.<br /><br />So, Yes, there is an even smaller one for $160 some but I rather save that money for my next apple Nano purchase, hoping that it will include Bluetooth.  Kind of like the same way I waited for the iPhone to get a 4G network.  Do I sound frustrated with Apple... Hell Yes!!! No Flash... really - what a bunch of silly punks. Back to the review, it worked right out the box and with it's Bluetooth 4.0 leap to pair the device, it was no problem, loved that.  Now I'm looking for a female to female adapter so I can try to synchronize my stereo dock speaker system H1 via Bluetooth. Apple equals no freedom! Please Master! Push the envelope Apple
0440419514|3.0|This is a great book, for the most part impossible to put down, and an even greater disappointment. It starts with an enormous promise: one feels like having discovered a fantasy of the order of the Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. Unfortunately, Pullman doesn't know what kind of book he wants to write, and the result is the more frustrating for his being such a brilliant narrator and inventor.<br /><br />It all starts as a children's fantasy set in a wonderful alternative world. The daemons, the Gyptians, the evil Magisterium, the anbaric current, the experimental theology, the Zeppelins... it takes your breath away. However, half the way through the first volume it becomes clear Pullman also wants to write a world(s)-mythological saga, turning his naughty-girl heroine into a Christ figure. He even quotes the Gospel to make the point!<br /><br />Unfortunately, what really drives Pullman's writing is his unrelenting and unsophisticated hatred of (Christian) religion, so there're three different threads in the book, and they just don't hold together. The story keeps getting off all kinds of handles--people doing things for no particular reason, achieving them in no time, knowing what they can't possibly know--and culminates, lamely, with a wrestling fight with an angel and a pre-pubertal love affair of supposedly immeasurable consequences.<br /><br />And throughout all of that, the narrative is absolutely gripping, poignant, absorbing... on the second reading, I loved it even more than the first time, and afterwards shook my head even more. What a book this might have been! I don't think I've ever read a better bad book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well the games are pretty varied and interesting, but the ads and slow progress in unlocking new games are disappointing

Nobody is together and everyone in the band is going in different directions at one time  How confusing!!!  The only somewhat good song isTatoo and even that is doubtful.  David lee Roth's voice has aged alot and is somewhat average--no sparkle at all.  Of course Eddie's guitar solos are great but the songs are not togeher at all.  Bring back the previous Van Halen that sounds ready to rock.  This is one stalled effort just to make some money. Very disappointing!!!
B007BLDFWG|4.0|Elizabeth Olsen did an amazing job acting in her debut performance in MMMM. She acts like a veteran, and the role is a demanding one. This movie is not for everyone. It's not an action shoot-em-up movie, or movie filled with explosions and volcanoes. It's a simmering psychological drama that leaves you wondering what will happen, right until the end, when it all comes crashing down. I thought, \\"This is IT?\\" I was surprised, and not in a good way. I expected some type of resolution, and I didn't get it. But all and all, a fantastic film. I look forward to seeing what Elizabeth Olsen brings to the table in the future. Also, I very much enjoyed the distinct lack of music in the film. There was almost none at all. Too much irritating music distracts from movies, IMO.

0545425115|1.0|Ok, for all of you who think that she is so creative and such, look up a novel/manga by the name of Battle Royale. It has 15 books in its series, and was finished back in 2006. All this author did was take Battle Royale's idea, and change some details to make it her own. There is even a Battle Royale movie, made back in 2000! There are too many similarities for it to just be a coincidence.<br /><br />WARNING! SPOILERS!<br /><br />1. Ok, for BR there was a corrupt Japanese government, while HG had it in North America.<br /><br />2. BR kidnapped a class of middle school kids(ages about 12-16), while HG took 2 kids 12-18 from each sector.<br /><br />3. Both had stronger kids forming alliances, also in HG the guy was in love with the girl, and the girl started falling for him. In BR, the girl loved the guy, and the guy started falling for her.<br /><br />4. Both have an \\"arena\\" of sorts that they are stuck on while fighting, and both have the \\"game masters\\" who interfere to make things more interesting. Oh, and both have announcements to say who died.<br /><br />5. While in BR they start out with a bag that had a random weapon in it, in HG they are randomly just scattered at the starting point.<br /><br />There are many other similarities, but i wont point them all out. Also, the first book in HG is whole 15 of BR. BR ended at the end of the games, as did the first book of HG. Now, do you wonder why books 2 and 3 of HG didn't get near the reviews praise that the first book did? Because she had nothing more to copy from! BR was over by this point, so the rest of it is all the authors own ideas. My point is, she doesn't deserve all the credit and praise and money that she is getting. And the only reason she is getting away with it is because the fan base for Adult Japanese manga is small here in the U.S. and in most non asian countries in the world, and it was done 6 years ago, so those who DID read it might not remember it well enough to see the theft.<br /><br />I hopeyou will give Battle Royale a chance(even if you aren't a fan of graphic novels, it is a GREAT story) and see that I am correct. It is 18+ because its aimed at adult audiences, lots of gore and some sexual scenes. Thanks for reading, hope you all take it to heart!

B002POVIMS|5.0|I came via the Skrillex dubstep remix of In For The Kill, thinking that's what I was buying. It isn't, but I was pleasantly surprised. Here's a collection of 80's retro electronic tunes with extraordinarily catchy melodies that will be stuck in your head in no time at all. I wouldn't have expected to like this but I absolutely love it. It's nothing like what anyone else is doing; Elly's voice is a breath of fresh air and the songs are just really well crafted.<br /><br />I love \\"In for the Kill\\" and \\"Colourless Color\\", but hesitate to name \\"high points\\" because every single track is a gem. I'm a new fan and can't wait until La Roux comes out with another album.
B005AKFXZW|3.0|I've been to dark places these past few weeks and enjoyed it immensely. First, I stepped into an unnamed city with The Book of Dead Days by Marcus Sedgwick and then I travelled with The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern which I shall talk about now.    You see, when The Guardian long-listed Morgenstern as one of the best debut authors early in September, her book hadn't even been published. But the article did feature an extract, which was quite unnecessary because it had my attention the minute I laid eyes on the cover. Black, white with a bit of red thrown in, I knew instantly that this was a book I'd adore. The extract didn't do anything to deter my resolve to posses it, so on September 13, I ordered the Kindle version off Amazon.    Set at the turn of the 18th Century, the the story features Celia and Marco, two magicians who are groomed to enter a battle of skills when they grow up. Bound to the game, and more importantly, to each other, Le Cirque des Rêve, the travelling circus that's only open at night, is their battlefield. With brilliant mastery, the duo showcase their skills by creating sections such as a garden made entirely of ice, a room of clouds you can actually jump off and a lair of bottled memories. But that's just the fun stuff. The majority of their powers are utilised to keep the circus and its members safe from peril, travel across continents with quick ease and for some strange reason, keep everyone involved from aging. So you see, the circus is no ordinary place and it isn't just Celia and Marco who are bound to the fate of the game. That is why the two begin to tire of their roles, longing to be together instead. But as with all fairy tales that have been woven in dark, magical surroundings, finding a happily-ever-after ending is a lot more complicated than it seems.    So the question is - is it a young adult novel? Hell to the no! Should you read it? Yes, absolutely! The Night Circus is a brilliant first attempt by the author. Her prose isfilled with imagination, detail and colour (even though there is little mention of any). The structure, divided into five parts, oscillates between the late 1800s and the first decade of the 1900s. The ride can get a bit woozy because the spacetime continuum, works very well in the first half of the book but starts getting confusing to the point of annoyance in the second half. Sure, there's enough mystery to keep you hooked and plenty of introductions to characters you know will turn out to be very interesting as the plot progresses. But alas, somewhere after the halfway mark, Morgenstern's storytelling skills begin to droop and drag. There's only so much one can marvel at the beauty of the black and white circus that's almost like an amusement park, mysterious characters who have hidden secrets and a bonfire that isn't just keeping patrons warm.    Morgenstern's evidently too fresh to create any lasting trends or ComicCon-worthy characters with The Night Circus. But it's just her first novel and going by that - she ought to, no, deserves to be, on every fantasy fiction aficionado's radar.    Verdict: If you begin reading the book, you will also finish it.    First published on -- [...]
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|Another reviewer covered it perfectly, but this is how the movie should have been. The choppiness of the theatrical version has been eliminated, a touch of character development to let you know who these guys are and why they're here. A little more dialogue, and more balance between characters' screen time. The funny lines that weren't funny in the theatrical version--due to bad editing--get the laughs in this version.  This was 100x better.  Way to go Sly.<br />Oh and the Shinedown song--supremely bad*ss--finally gets screen and credits time as well. I sat in the theater thinking, where's that song?

B001FB55L2|4.0|The tale of two brothers. One marries the Portman character and the other has always had guarded feeling for her. Then the one who is married to her goes off to Afghanistan and is presumed dead later on. As the widow grieves the other brother develops stronger feelings for her and they get it on. ** POSSIBLE SPOILER FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT SEE THE TRAILERS ** Then, of course, about midway through the film we cut to Afghanistan and the other brother is a prisoner of war. He makes it out eventually and then there's this whole fallout as the former POW deals with the fact that his wife and brother got it on and he has a mental breakdown from his time as a POW. The acting was above average but the plotting was slow in the beginning. BTW, this is not a happy tale but it isn't particularly tragic either. Tobey Maguire, who played the POW brother, received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor. Besides Portman and Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal plays the other brother and Sam Shephard is their father. The budget for this was $26M and it made a bit over $43M at the Box Office. STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; FOCUSES/THEMES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: early 2011 (streamed).

0439023513|4.0|Okay I have 3 major things that I did not like about this book:<br />1. Why does Katniss always pass out or is knocked out during a major battle? Then after its over we are given a summary of what we missed? This has been Katniss's MO the entire series, and I was hoping that at least in this final book, the battle leading up to the final close, we would have an opportunity to actually be there for it.<br /><br />2. KATNISS TICKED ME OFF with how quickly she just wrote Peeta off.. You know what they did to him! You know it was not his fault, but yet you just become angry with him? Indifferent? WTHeck?! I can understand her being hurt, but the misplaced anger, no, not acceptable at all.<br /><br />3. Once again, Katniss's mom leaves her when she needs her the most! NOT COOL AT ALL!<br /><br />Aside from these set backs, the story and how things unfolded, kept me glued to this book. I could not put it down. I love how it all came together. I loved the ending.. This one was a bittersweet one. I cried just about the entire second half of this book. I cried tears of joy, anger, and sorrow. This was a great close to this series. I highly recommend this read.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Thoughtful and fun game. Quick to learn but still thoroughly entertaining. it's a puzzle game were you have to move items around. Nice physics in bumping items.
1423134206|5.0|Like the title says you can be a Disney fan or not. This book is perfect for the artist or Disney fan. Has some very early design's of characters and some environments. It's a large book physically and a lot of the images are full pages. I really enjoyed the book and bought it to use for reference and now looking at getting more from the series. Check out the rest of the Archive Series for more goodies.
0385342063|5.0|I have read everything Sophie Kinsella has written and just finished this one.  Although I read all of the Shopaholic series, I found the heroine Becky to be annoying and a caricature. (So why read them? Because the writing is so good.) But Poppy Wyatt is a real person, someone I would like to know. Yes, the plot is somewhat predictable, but it still was a joy to read.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is such a fun game! My daughter and I play all the time and we are working on getting all of the stars. Looking forward to new levels!
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|Great story and exemplary performances by the actors and actresses but this show belonged to Rooney Mara.  She absolutely owns it.  Although the Swedish version is good and Noomi is good, she just doesn't stand out to the extent that Mara does in the Hollywood version.<br /><br />Let me speculate as to why:  Salander apparently has some version of Asperger's syndrome - high-functioning on the autistic spectrum with occasional genius traits in certain areas.  Mara delivers less susceptibility in interpersonal relationships in some areas and more in others.  Whatever the formula, it is convincingly persuasive.  There are many opportunities for comparison because both movies use many of the same scenes.<br /><br />I have one big complaint - I disagree with the accolades given to the sound engineers.  No matter what the scene, they attempt to augment the emotion with music and/or background noise.  It's too loud and constant.  At times, these actors already mumble their lines for the sake of their portrayals.  I don't like to miss words of dialogue and it's a distraction.  I'm willing to give up the supposed addition to the tension.  The Swedish version does not have this detriment.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love this game so much but I wish it was longer...I reached the end too quickly.<br />otherwise, it is very clever.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|has no table of contents. can't go from book to book. just not a good book. The word of God yes the app. NO.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Best action movie since the first Die Hard and that is saying something. Tom Cruise is back on top and watching this movie five<br />times ( four of those in awesome IMAX ) I still couldn't believe how much he put into this movie. Talk about commitment , but that<br />has pretty much defined Cruise in his career. Great job by Brad Bird , hard to believe this is his first live action film .<br />And what action ! Kinda feel sorry for the guy in a way , don't know how he's gonna top this ! Great support cast , Paula Patton<br />was awesome, someone give this beauty a movie ( franchise ? ) worthy of her talent. Simon Pegg was great comic relief also.<br /><br />The only problem I had was with Jeremy Renner's character - after giving such strong performances in Hurt Locker and The Town I found<br />he was underused ( if that's a word ) in this movie- absolutely no slight on Renner just think his part could have been bigger.<br /><br />Overall definitely best action movie of 2010 . Best since 1988 ( see Die Hard ) and well worth owning. For the ( too short )<br />scenes of Cruise on the skyscraper alone this movie is great. Still can't believe he was allowed to do that , but I guess<br />being producer of the movie helped !

B005VTS4EY|5.0|Red Wrecker is a simple but challenging game that looked and played well on my Kindle Fire. The developer's description says the game is physics-based, and that's correct, but you find out quickly that the laws of physics aren't always constant in the Red Wrecker world.<br /><br />I've played other games where you removed or destroyed blocks or other objects to allow objects above them to fall. Red Wrecker added some innovative twists that set it apart from similar games. For one, the direction of gravity's pull can vary from level to level. The other twist is that in some levels, objects are moving, and you can't sit and think about the solution - you have to act quickly, or you've lost.<br /><br />The graphics in Red Wrecker are simple and colorful, nothing special, but they're good enough. The only option is to turn the sound on or off (on is the default, but I soon turned off the sound, since it gets a bit annoying after a while).<br /><br />I got through the first 25 levels in about 45 minutes, and now I'm working on the rest. Surprisingly, level #5 gave me the most trouble in the first set of 25 levels. I say \\"surprisingly,\\" because it was the first level after the hints stopped.<br /><br />Overall, a remarkably good game, requiring some thought and concentration instead of just quick reflexes and shooting everything in sight.
B005LZYL3G|5.0|Amazing! I didn't find it in iItaly but I'm glad to have it now...  PJ are always the best.... Really it's better than I was expecting... In high definition it's wonderful experience
B0018QQQK8|4.0|i usually don't read these kinds of books, but my daughter downloaded this when she gave me the kindle for Xmas. I have to say it caught my attention and at times i couldn't put the book down. there were 3 of us reading this book at the same time and we all thought the ending was going to be different than it was- had us in tears.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its the best game ever.<br /><br /> I like it a lot.  Its cool  I really love it.  It is amazing.  It is really great
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book!!  I loved how close Abby and Travis are and how she is desperate to keep her past in the past.  There were struggles for Abby but she overcame them.  I found this to be a very good book!!<br /><br />America who is Abby's best friend in this book, was pretty funny and was usually in a good mood, so at times she lightened up the mood of the book.  Travis had to be one of my favorite characters just because he lives sometimes without thinking.  His choices aren't always good but he trys to fix them if they aren't.  Then there is all of the characters that kind of tie up some stuff in the book such as, Parker, Trent, Mick, and others.  I can't forget Shepley either, he is Travis's roomate and well he is just funny at times.<br /><br />This book was happy and sad, it was full of surprises but overall this book was amazing.  I couldn't put it down and I'm happy I didn't!

B005VTS4EY|4.0|I almost didn't download this, but I'm glad I did. The graphics are simple but the puzzles are well thought out. Not too hard, and fun. I took off a star because the graphics could have been better.
B004XQO90O|4.0|SPOILER ALERT! Although the plot defied logic to me, there was one scene in particular that I liked more than any other scene in the movie. I'm referring to the freeze-frame scene near the end of the movie when the camera slowly zooms out from \\"the kiss\\" to pan across the frozen-in-time faces of other passengers on the previously doomed train of death. Aside from my curiosity as to how technologically this shot was realized, there was a much deeper fascination that appealed to me. Here were the smiling faces of individual personalities rescued from an alternate reality where they smiled no more as the ashes from their fading faces fell to the floor. I immediately began to reflect on the many thousands of souls whose mortal bodies were unjustly destroyed on September 11, 2001 and then I began to forget about the total number reported (a cold statistic) and I began to imagine what it would be like to have really known each and every person prematurely released from this world on 9/11...appreciating the subtle intricacies of each man and woman and child (including future projections of the unborn ones from expectant mothers who were snuffed out before they even had a chance to see their babies take their first breath)...taking the time to clearly focus on each one of them as a unique (one-of-a-kind) child of God just as the glass lens in the scene from this film took its time to allow that same kind of visual perception of each person to slowly sink in. And it's worth mentioning here that there was also some dialogue about LIFE near this scene that helped lead this train of thought to wherever it was going. Life. Death. Life Again. I mentioned God already. He was in there somewhere...inside these thoughts of mine. I'm not sure what He was saying. But I think perhaps He wanted me to know that this is what their smiling faces look like to Him when He puts them all back together again on the other side. God is good at fixing things that are broken, you know.
B0062NAX1U|3.0|Not quite the movie I was expecting after reading the synopsis and then watching it.  The movie is very dramatic and the spirit of humankind shows through.  The movie had me weeping at times because of the moving story line.  I was a little put off by all of the religious references as it seemed to take over from the story line at times.  Being a woman, I also wasn't a big fan of how the men were represented as being more holier than women.  I realize in religion women were not held in highest regards, so perhaps this is why the filmmakers did this.  Those items being said, I did think the movie was wholesome and worth the watch.  I rented this online at Amazon.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie is a shamefully disgraceful, graphically violent example of everything that is wrong with a religion that tries to drown the teachings of Jesus in a bloody river of lies. Jesus revealed God as the Father of each human being and when once you grasp this idea of God as a true and loving Father, the ONLY concept which Jesus ever taught, you must forthwith, in all consistency, utterly abandon all those primitive notions about God as an offended monarch, a stern and all-powerful ruler whose chief delight is to detect his subjects in wrongdoing and to see that they are adequately punished unless some being almost equal to himself should volunteer to suffer for them, to die as a substitute and in their place. The whole idea of ransom and atonement is incompatible with the concept of God as it was taught and exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The infinite love of God is not secondary to anything in the divine nature. Even if God were the stern and legal monarch of a universe in which justice ruled supreme, He certainly would not be satisfied with the childish scheme of substituting an innocent sufferer for a guilty offender! The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive. What a travesty upon the infinite character of God, this teaching that His fatherly heart in all its austere coldness and hardness was so untouched by the misfortunes and sorrows of His creatures that His tender mercies were not forthcoming until He saw His blameless Son bleeding and dying upon the cross of Calvary! It is an insult to God to believe or teach that innocent blood must be shed in order to win His favor or to divert the fictitious divine wrath! These ancient errors and pagan superstitions about the Universal Father's nature represent a doomed philosophy destined for rejection by enlightened truth-seekers.

B0034G4OXQ|1.0|SPOILER ALERT! Hereafter, a bland journey of meaningless chaos and supernatural silliness that will take you absolutely nowhere (and will take its good old time getting there too). All of your unanswered questions about life beyond death shall fade like fragile fragments of forgotten daydreams into the boring blackness of a bottomless oblivion as the screenwriter reveals (eventually) that there are no answers to be found here, no mysteries to be solved, no truths to boldly emerge from the cracked crevices of curiosity to conquer the countless crumbs of contrived content that keep spewing forth like random samplings of a plot-in-progress stuck in the sleepy sap of slow motion until all of the honest of heart witnessing such a dull display of lingering emptiness begin to hope and pray that in the real hereafter, for saints and sinners alike (and everyone in between these two spectral extremes of inner dimensionality), the Creator has perhaps seen fit to let it all beat to the pulse of a slightly less morbid tempo, one where the idea of Death potentially being a transitional modification of living instead of being the final curtain call doesn't come across as a dead-on-arrival script stripped of any substantive qualities (as in introducing any philosophically challenging propositions or explanations or presenting any culturally controversial suggestions or theories) leaving only the anorexic skeleton of an underdeveloped idea that was suffocated by constant exposure to chronic neglect until it morphed into an incomplete torn-package of a production unfulfilling in just about every aspect. It is as though it was an unfinished sketch of experimental improvisation one might expect to find posing as a film school project but never rising above the level of being a platform for mediocrity, a pointless portrayal of a serious subject that no amount of talent in front of or behind the camera could resuscitate.<br /><br />For the record, the reason I warned that this review contains spoilers is because unlike the traditional spoiler that tells how something ends (such as revealing that \\"the butler did it\\"), my comments deal with a slightly different scenario, one where I am revealing in my own way that I was unable to detect any type of what I would refer to as an ending, at least not any ending that conclusively and satisfactorily summarized or punctuated relevant themes and events that preceded it. But if you have not seen the movie yet, I think it is far better that you personally discover your own unique interpretation of this cinematic experience as opposed to gaining access to my views in advance.<br /><br />Besides, since no personality on the planet is an exact duplicate of another one (unless there is a new iPad or Kindle app for cloning that I haven't heard about yet), I doubt that any two people can ever possess exactly the same thoughts and feelings about any movie they have just viewed. I am certainly not arrogant enough to believe that everyone should see things through my channels of perception. We each must march to the beat of the drummer within.tains spoilers is because unlike the traditional spoiler that tells how something ends (such as revealing that \\"the butler did it\\"), my comments deal with a slightly different scenario, one where I am revealing in my own way that I was unable to detect any type of what I would refer to as an ending, at least not any ending that conclusively and satisfactorily summarized or punctuated relevant themes and events that preceded it.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game requires stratagie and a good aim and perfect eye sometimes its hard but it sometimes gets adicting so don't get adicted
B004WCTLNY|4.0|SPOILER ALERT! I found this movie to be an inspirational tribute to the \\"one God and Father of all, who is above all and in all\\" as well as being a good reminder that the sovereignty of God is unlimited. The universe was not inevitable. It is neither an accident nor some self-existent entity of ethereal proportions exploding upon the empty stage of nebular nothingness. The universe is a work of creation and is therefore wholly subject to the will of the Creator. So it is no mere poetic expression that exclaims: \\"The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.\\" \\"He removes kings and sets up kings.\\" \\"The Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men.\\" In the affairs of the hearts of men and women, the Universal Father (better known as GOD) may not always have His way but in the conduct and destiny of a planet, the divine plan prevails...the eternal purpose of wisdom and love triumphs! And unlike any documentary that may have attempted to encapsulate portions of these philosophical mysteries in a few condensed scenes featuring talking heads that move their lips in a rapid succession of lingual fireworks but who fail to say anything spiritually significant, this fun-filled flick was supremely entertaining in addition to being a cinematic fountain of intellectual fascination and cosmic enlightenment.
0446585025|1.0|This book is relentlessly, painfully un-funny.  I say this as someone who admires and likes everything Ellen is and everything she stands for.  I bought the audiobook for those reasons, wanting to enjoy it!  It is not even borderline.  Spend your valuable entertainment time and money elsewhere.<br /><br />Endless free-association, \\"asides/tangents,\\" and ruminating on everyday subjects left me wondering how many editor/publisher types just couldn't muster the guts to tell her: \\"Your style works better in short form, better when interacting with others, and MUCH better when people can see you.\\"  But the fundamental problem is the epically tedious writing. Topics here range from punctuality to \\"whether you can form a sentence not containing 'a' or 'the'.\\"  Seriously!  Cliches compound the tedium; she delivers countless sayings you've heard all your life, each as part of some longer shpiel that's meant to be ... I don't know ... ironic or whatever. I smiled a couple times through almost three CD's, never laughed, and could not finish the 3rd one.<br /><br />If you want to hear a really funny woman who throws in some trenchant discussion about things a bit more challenging than courtesy and recycling, buy and listen to Bossypants by Tina Fey.  The 1-2 slow parts of Tina's book are worlds better than the *best* sections of \\"Seriously ... I'm Kidding.\\"
B001NLKT60|5.0|This second book in this series was a page turner.  Just as fascinating as the first book.  Can't wait to complete the last book \\"girl who kicked the hornet's nest\\".  I recommend it highly.  fast-paced and interesting.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I really love this DVD/CD combo. I have a big screen HD TV and the quality looked great to me.  I really enjoyed the show and I also liked the quick behind the scenes shots and mini documentary.<br /><br />I'll agree there are too many shots of the audience and perhaps a few too many cuss words, but that's Adele and her personality. Adele is just amazing and I loved hearing her talk about her songs and what they mean to her or where she drew her inspiration. I enjoyed the covers she did too, as a little something new and different.<br /><br />As far as the CD goes, the applause is there but I didn't find it distracting in the least. They edited out pretty much all the talking, so there's no cussing on the CD and she is just as good live as on her albums. I definitely recommend this for any Adele fan!
B0002OERI0|4.0|i fell in love with this album when it came out but after hearing so many of these songs over and again, i started to get tired of it. i can barely listen to any of the singles from this album like american idiot or holiday. but some of the other songs like give me novacaine and whatshername are fun to listen to from time to time. its definitely not as bad album by any means, but the radio killed this one for me and many others.
B001NLKT60|5.0|So far this book is amazing. I've read the first in the series and it was great too!  I am planning to buy the third in the Series, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  The movies on Netflix, foreign versions, are great!<br /><br />honeybee

B00000IPAX|5.0|i see a ton of 1-star reviews and i find it funny that most of them were sent in right around the time the band released this which was in 1999. this band was clearly misjudged when they finally hit it big with this cd. either people loved it, but didnt understand it, or just hated it because they thought it was something totally different from what it really was.<br /><br />this is classic blink 182. just a fun bunch of upbeat songs that are great to listen to. i definitely prefer Take off your pants and jacket over this cd but thats not to say this cd isnt awesome. its everything you could want in POP PUNK. and i put that in capitals because its not PUNK music. its not. its very poppy at the same time and very radio friendly but that doesnt make it bad. now that its 13 years after its release i think it is viewed very differently then it was initially. and it deserves to be given a chance to those who think its just a pile of crap.

B000ZINGIK|5.0|i have to say this is probably the best avantasia album to me. the title track is epic and fun to listen to. their are plenty of guest spots that really stand out and make the album that much better. tobias sammett continues to write some amazing music and this is no exception. everything you could want from a metal opera band. this band is really great in all of their albums but this has to be the best one by far.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This is a great movie that was seriously wronged by the mainstream Hollywood establishment.  I was lucky enough to catch this in a small indie theater in Tucson last year while stationed nearby in Fort Hauchuca, and man was it a find!<br /><br />In much the same fashion of \\"Behind the Mask\\" this is yet another brilliantly written satire on the cliched horror genre, but in my opinion this one has far superior acting.  The story revolves around 2 loveable buddies who happen to be hillbillies.  Like most of America, you probably have preconceived notions about hillbillies due to 1. (in my opinion) stuipid, racist horror movies and 2. just the way the liberal media paints anyone who doesn't bow to their idealism.  However rather than falling into the stereotype that the media paints of hillbillies, Tucker and Dale are just 2 pretty average, if somewhat goofy guys who just want to enjoy their vacation home.  Their peace is shattered however when a group of college kids arrive and one of them, Allison, falls into a lake and needs saving.  Dale quickly rescues her but the rest of the kids think the rescue looks more like a kidnapping and resolve to \\"kill those evil hillbillies and save Allison.\\"<br /><br />Tucker and Dale meanwhile try to make things right but the college kids are deaf to reason and also are terribly accident prone and start dying all over the place while trying to kill Tucker and Dale.  Allison meanwhile starts seeing what Tucker and Dale are really like and starts being their friends and even falling for Dale.<br /><br />All in all, its a silly, fun movie.  Theres no vicious stereotypes, (except maybe that college kids are stupid which Im sure is one that we can all agree is actually pretty damn true lol) not excessive swearing, no nudity or sex, but plenty of blood and guts, lots of satirical humor and some truly great chemistry between both Tucker and Dale, and Dale and Allison.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for those with an open mind, a wacky sense of humor, or fans of horror just looking for something a little new.

B0052U59F4|4.0|I don't usually read erotica, not that I disapprove of it, but because I read myself silly with Romance Novels in my twenties, and have since moved on to suspense/thrillers.  I heard about this book in the Dailymail.uk, so I thought I'd give it a try.  While 50 Shades of Grey has a lot going for it, I found myself skipping the sex scenes about half-way through the book.  There's only so many ways to describe an organism no matter how good it was, and really, can anyone really describe one realistically?  It's something you have to experience, like a perfect sunrise, or falling in love unexpectedly, so reading about it, was a bit of a snooze-fest.  But to the author's credit, she is writing erotica, so I can't count that as anything but a pro in the book.<br /><br />What I didn't like in the book was the 'telling-not-showing' of how 'hot' the main character Christian was.  As a woman, I would have found something besides his looks to get excited about.  Brad Pitt is good looking, but more because of his sense of humor, and how he loves his partner and kids.  Seeing a man enthralled with his child is much more exciting, than how a man wears his 'torn and faded jeans'.  That gets old pretty quickly, though don't tell Madonna that, because she seems pretty happy with her boytoys.<br /><br />So here's what the book is about:<br /><br />Ana is an innocent girl who is pursued by a rich, handsome, and deeply damaged, slightly older man, named Christian Grey.  Hence the title, Christian is fifty kinds of messed up.  There are hints as to why Christian is a mess as a human being, he was adopted when he was 4, and has mysterious burn marks on his chest, and can't abide being touched.  For some reason, Christian falls for Ana in a way he's never fallen for anyone before, and frankly, I didn't see it either, but then, that's love.  Ana is a typical twenty-something year old, who is just graduating from college, and who loves classic books.  She wants to work in a publishing house, and she's constantly bringing up her G.P.A., so I'm assuming is pretty high, but not high enough that she sees ahead of time how messed up her new boyfriend is.<br /><br />This book is long, and it gets into some pretty graphic bondage scenarios.  Not for young, impressionable young ladies, or even young men.  It might make them think that being messed up is pretty cool.<br /><br />This is the first of a series, so be warned, nothing get resolved, which sorely disappointed me.  I don't think I can get through another bondage novel to see what happens between these two.  Maybe they'll make a movie, but then again, what would the rating be?e, and she's constantly bringing up her G.P.A., so I'm assuming is pretty high, but not high enough that she sees ahead of time how messed up her new boyfriend is.<br /><br />This book is long, and it gets into some pretty graphic bondage scenarios.

B0078N2MTE|5.0|Great movie, simply great. Ignore the apparently hairy legged woman who opined something mysterious about the wife not really seeing the oncoming storm as it was merely a reflection in a window she was standing by and just take the movie as it is. Freud didn't direct this movie and people that try to find hidden meanings in film are merely further examples of lifes occasional irritants.<br />The movie was well done in every aspect and the lead actor must be a master script chooser as I have yet to see a movie he has been in that I didn't enjoy immensely. He is also very talented.<br />It was also good to see a movie showing a family truly supportive of each other. A rarity from Hollywood these days.....which probably means it wasn't made in Hollywood.
1878424602|5.0|I read one law each day before meditating starting on Sunday with the Law of Pure Potentiality.  Each week my understanding broadens and I find myself relating Chopra's words to recent experiences and using his guidance in planning my participation in events. This book has become a highly valued resource.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have loved Phantom ever since I was a child and listened to the soundtrack on my cassette player over and over again until it broke. It brings back many found memories of seeing it on stage years ago. I highly recommend this production.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this app! I originally downloaded it on my nook tablet, but I'll be transferring it to my smartphone because I have no menu button on my nook. Its beautiful even in the original setting, and I can't wait to customize it on my phone!! Absolutely worth the $1.99!!!
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I just watched this movie its worth watching from start to end. From the squeals I am not fond of the first one but second,third, also fourth are worth it. I did not see it in blue-ray.
B0076303RY|5.0|Downton Abbey episodes are exactly as described.  Imagine my joy when I viewed a program that exceeded my expectations for quality and casting.  This show is fantastic.
B005UVYXPW|1.0|I never say bad things about items I purchase on Amazon because I have NEVER had a bad purchase until I bought video. I have had nothing but problems since the day I purchased this season of SOA and have attempted to watch it. I have Netflix and watched seasons 1-3 with no streaming issues. Since purchasing season 4 on Amazon I have nothing but problems. I own a kindle, and most members of my family own a kindle. I am a huge advocate for ALL things Amazon or was an advocate. If you want to purchase a movie or TV series via electronic download, do so on another site. I am so frustrated with Amazon and this season of SOA, I will not buy anymore videos. I start the episode and adobe crashes, I close all windows, restart my computer, watch 10 minutes and it crashes again. The video starts again and the audio and video do not match up, then I pause the stream, wait a few minutes and it syncs. A few minutes later it crashes again, thus starting the whole process over. If I did not have Netflix or on demand with my cable company, I would be inclined to think I need a new laptop; however, every other streaming media I subscribe to or own never has an issue! Amazon, up your ball game, you are the most widely used internet retailer in the WORLD, give us at least standard streaming replay. DO NOT PURCHASE VIDEO FROM AMAZON. I was considering purchasing a<br />Fire in order to watch Netflix or videos from anywhere, after this, I am considering an iPad.
B0078Q2HAA|5.0|The movie and its cast are exactly as described.  Imagine my joy when I watched a show that exceeded my expectations for casting and authenticity of speech accents.  This movie is fantastic and a slight disappointment when you realize how unlike the Iron Lady the actress who portrays her is.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Very addictive, and challenging. sometimes the whole family gets involved! It's nice to play a game where we actually have to think.
B006903GX8|5.0|Don't watch the series without first seeing this \\"making of\\" classic.  It will give you a much greater appreciation for the challenges faced in filming these episodes in the modern era, while giving you a worthwhile peek at the remarkable differences between the cast and the characters they portray.  This is the best TV series of the 21st Century--bar none!
B001NERPHS|5.0|The Basement Tapes remastered version is worth hearing even if you have, like me, listened to previous releases hundreds of times ever since the year the original official record was issued. The remastering was done masterfully. Unlike many reissued versions, this one is stellar and hearing it you hear the recording in all its classic glory.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|Without question, this is one of the best films ever made.  It will make you yearn for '40s film noir classics.  A real nail-biter from start to finish.  Creepy, when you consider the author of the books is based on is stone cold dead.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game is really fun and addictive!  I would recommend it to my friends to download! Keep up the good work!
B0078JRFZE|5.0|These potboiler episodes are exactly as described.  Imagine my joy when I watched a show that exceeded my expectations for quality and casting.  This program is fantastic.
0446573019|2.0|I listened to this book on tape and found it to be very wordy...to many details...to descriptive,,,this book is not like the author's other novels...every thing that happened in the book was talked to death!  Sorry to sound negative but was exhausted when it ended.
B0078JPCJK|5.0|A big favorite in our household.  Be sure to watch the first season, first!  Imagine our joy when I watched a program that exceeded my expectations for quality and casting.  This show is fantastic.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|people that knock off three or four star for not being able to skip levels are ridiculous. this game is fun and entertaining, as well as challenging. highly approved for me.
B0076D20E8|5.0|In the mood for a good comedy?  Then, how about a film that delivers without intending to.  Rarely does one find a bad movie that is so gripping that it keeps you engaged start to finish.  A terrible cast, worthless plot, in an engaging film that is beautifully photographed.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I highly recommend this book, its a real page turner. There is a surprise around each corner.Lee Child is a wonderful author. I intend to read all of his books.
B007BLDFWG|5.0|Don't watch this alone!  The movie and cast are exactly as described.  Imagine my joy when I watched a movie that exceeded my expectations for quality of casting and plot.  This movie is fantastic, frightening, and unintentionally funny, too!
B007H7XJD4|5.0|Finally a film that has a great story, script, acting, directing, cinematography, sound, special effects...  Honestly, I can't think of a movie I liked in the last few years except this one.  Clash of the Titans was a hunk of crap and Hollywood can't produce an original movie.  This film was created against the odds.  If you like a good movie, or are a lover of film you'll find yourself liking this film equally.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|The movie is exactly as described.  Imagine my joy when I watched a movie that exceeded my expectations for quality of casting, but with a worthless plot.  This film is fantastic, in that it keeps you engaged, despite monumental failings of a magnitude not often seen in cinema.
0385342063|5.0|I knew this book was going to be good, but I had no idea what I was in for.  I loved it!!!  I am going to read it again and again.  Thanks, Sophie!
1451673442|5.0|I really like it. I wish their was an audiobook version also. It would be nice to have a calendar in the book too.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|My Daughter Purchased this case along with her Kindle Fire. She Said it protects the Kindle Very well. She dropped it in Wood shop once and the kindle is fine. nothing damaged or anything. She says the stand is very convenient that it helps alot when she has to write something Down during SSR. its a really good case i would suggest this to anyone looking for a case for their kindle fire.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I enjoy the levels not so much for the complexity, but the overall tone and relaxed atmosphere of the game.  Good purchase.
0307386171|5.0|Just read it in one go. Or read it in stages and intellectually dwell on the brilliance of the story, the unfolding of it and the power of every word to draw a picture that is unforgettable. oh man, I so adored this book and feel like it would be a very powerful book for college aged girls to read and then talk about. Anything Ian McEwan writes is magic, but what separates this book is how tightly, sparsely significantly told the story is- sometimes I just imagined being able to rewrite this story to create a happy ending... by maybe inserting a therapist into the mix so the newlyweds learned to communicate- crazy I know-caveat.... I read a lot and rarely want to insert a therapist into the plot!!!!!
B00005YUFK|5.0|When asked what would be the only CD I would take to a deserted island, I would seriously consider this one.  It is purely majestic, emotional, rythmic, culturally balanced, and energetic.  I sat in my car for 15 min (late for work) to finish a song and hear an additional one.  I simply could not turn it off.  This (the SACD version) was the demo disc a high end audio store uses to demonstrate their speakers.  I can not recommend this one enough
B004GYY714|5.0|We listen to music on this app several hours each day and find it to be a quality source of music. There are stations here for everyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun and it is so great because their are so many diff. options to play a lot of the games are really hard.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|The Grunge movement is part of the rock history, and PEARL JAM is one of the greatest bands of that era! PEARL JAM TWENTY resumes the history of the band and also documents what happened in Seattle on those years...Pearl Jam create 2 of the most relevants albuns of that grunge era...TEN and VS...After that they continue to create great musics, never really selling their sound or becoming part of the mainstream! Eddie Vedder is one of the best lyricists of all time...The duo guitars of Gossard and Mc Cready are incredible and Ament are a great bass player...Pearl Jam is part of my life, thank you, guys!
B000002GB2|5.0|I received this 8-track in '78 or '79 for Christmas - I would play it over and over. This was and is a good album. My best friends in 8th grade got me 'Paradise Theater' for my birthday. Another GREAT album.<br />However, I distinctly remember the lyrics in the first stanza to Lorelei being:<br />\\"... she says be there by 8, tonight's the night we're going out, and I can hardly wait.\\" Then, the second stanza being \\"tonight's the night she's moving in....\\"<br />In any event, if you like Styx, you'll like this album.
B000002MTR|5.0|ONE HOT MINUTE marks the RHCP formation with the great guitar player DAVE NAVARRO!!!I really enjoy One hot Minute...Got Great songs like WARPED, AEROPLANE, MY FRIENDS, COFFEE SHOP and WALKABOUT...The guitars from NAVARRO creates another atmosphere on the Chili Peppers sound...It´s kind of a mix with JANE´S ADDICTION...Got a more HEAVY METAL vibe which i think was amazing! Unfortunately, it´s the only album with Navarro...REALLY REALLY GOOD!
0321647440|2.0|I am a serious amateur to semi-professional photographer with 44 years experience. I bought Aperture 3, because of my fondness for Apple products and my dislike for Adobe. I was excited to get this book so I could learn how to use Aperture 3 to its fullest. However, I have had mixed results using the book. The book's directions and explanations are not always clear resulting in time lost trying to figure out what is being asked of me to do. My biggest problem, however, has been with files that are referenced, but no indication from where they could be downloaded. Specifically they are the Icelandic and Dakar landscapes files. I contacted Peachpit several times about this problem, but after 4 weeks of backs and forths they still have not answered that one simple question. They even offered to refund my money since they weren't sure my question could be answered quickly. (I purchased the book from Amazon so getting a refund from Peachpit was not an option.) I am truly disappointed in both the book and, the inability to resolve what should be a no-brainer question.<br /><br />I have a hard time recommending this book to anyone for those reasons as well as there are comparable books on the market offering the same information. If this book is aimed at the more serious photographer, it doesn't cut the mustard.
B000000OQY|5.0|This is a great rock compilation after the MONSTER MASTERPIECE APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION...The first 4 songs are really cool, recorded alive and the other 4 are GUNS HIGH LIGHTS...The world hit PATIENCE, a great You´re Crazy, ONE IN A MILLION and USED TO LOVE HER!!!If you like GUNS you will love G N R LIES!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just recently installed this app, and so far I love it. There's a great variety of games which I absolutely love, and its great for the moments that I need to waste some time
B000002KIK|5.0|NEVER SAY DIE is the last SABBATH album with the great vocals of the prince of darkness OZZY OSBOURNE!!!!!!! While i completelly love the DIO years, the OZZY years are completelly CLASSIC!!!!!! NEVER SAY DIE got great tunes like the title track, JOHNNY BLADE, JUNIOR[s EYES, HARD ROAD and AIR DANCE!!!!!! the previous SABBATH album TECHNICAL ECSTASY and NEVER SAY DIE got many unfair reviews....Both are GREAT!!!!! All the stuff OZZY recorded with BLACK SABBATH is TOTAL CLASSIC stuff, and completelly recommended!!!!! WELL DONE, SABBATH...MASTERS OF HEAVY METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|can't change size on brushes or any tool. You can select from only three sizes max only on certain tools. Most tools have only one size, few have two sizes and only the eraser has the most size options. Complete failure as drawing app, no room for creative applications withot ability to change brush size
B000078DOI|5.0|MOTHER´S MILK is one of the best moments from the Chili Peppers! It was the first RHCP album i ever heard, and it blows me away! They were very funky, punk, raw and creative on this album! Frusciante´s guitar really contributes to emerge the Chili Peppers to the mainstream...He is brilliant, as is Flea, Kiedis and Chad Smith....SUBWAY TO VENUS, KNOCK ME DOWN, TASTE THE PAIN, SEXY MEXICAN MAID...All the songs are amazing! MOTHER´S MILK and BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK are the pinnacle of the Peppers...2 great Rock albuns, love em´both!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. its entertaining to play when your on a long flight or just really bored. some people might not like it. its not for everyone I guess
B00000J7JO|5.0|After One Hot Minute, which i think is a great album, RHCP was kinda lost on the music industry...Dave Navarro left the band and the bands finds themselves without a guitar player again! Man, THEY REALLY NEEDED FRUSCIANTE BACK! I think the band would end if they call another guitarrist...Frusciante was the right name and everybody knew that! Well, Frusciante comeback and they recorded another rock gem CALIFORNICATION! This album is great, with many classics like AROUND THE WORLD, SCAR TISSUE, OTHER SIDE, CALIFORNICATION and PARALLEL UNIVERSE!!!It´s a great album, if you like the Chili Peppers you will love CALIFORNICATION!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I am 25 years old and have a 4 year old son, My husband is in school full time and works two jobs on top of that. Needless to say we both are to the point where we need a consistant daily workout from home because of the fact that we don't have time to go to a gym. I dont really need to loose weight but i do need to get toned bad!! and my husband really wants to loose weight and get firm in is abs. I have heard alot of Jillian's work outs and I just ordered me \\"buns and thighs\\" and the six week six pack ab work out. would any of these benefit my husband as well or is there something else that would really benefit him?? THANKS!
B000002L1L|5.0|TWIST ON A TALE, NASTY PIECE OF WORK, ANYA, TIME TO KILL...BATTLE RAGES ON got great songs and unfortunately it´s the last PURPLE moment with the guitar wizard RITCHIE BLACKMORE...In my opinion, the guitars from RITCHIE are a huge part of Purple´s sound so this the last album that i cared from these HEAVY ROCK LEGENDS!!! WELL DONE, PURPLE!!!!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is extremely fun and so addicting you won't be able to but it down! Each level has a new puzzle to stimulate your brain and sometimes levels to frustrate you! I find this game extremely smart. Get it free while you can!
B000002KHB|5.0|This is one of the most relevant albuns of the world!!! The MEGA HUGE ROCK HIT SMOKE ON THE WATER is from MACHINE HEAD! This music alone elevates the album to a masterpiece, but MACHINE HEAD also got HIGHWAY STAR, LAZY and SPACE TRUKIN!!!! Even the other songs like MAYBE I´M A LEO and PICTURES OF HOME are great!This is classic stuff!BE COOL!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|A bit of a challenge, but not too much.  It runs well on the Kindle Fire.  As for the junk reviews, I don't care that it's a knock-off of some other game or that you need more fiber in your diet.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|STADIUM ARCADIUM is the last RED HOT album with the great guitarrist JOHN FRUSCIANTE, and like all their albuns with John, i think this is a great rock album!!! There´s 2 discs and many songs, and i think only 4 or 5 are not so special!! This one got many great songs and if you like the Chili Peppers style, you will really enjoy STADIUM ARCADIUM!!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is a really good way to waste time after school and is a mildly strategic game where you can do many things.
B000005RQT|5.0|This is a MASTERPIECE!!! ALL THE SONGS SHINE HIGH...CHILD IN TIME, BLOODSUCKER, FLIGHT OF THE RAT, INTO THE FIRE, SPEED KING....I can´t even describe the impact this Purple album got in me! I love Machine Head, but IN ROCK is one of the creators of all the fast heavy music of future years like Iron Maiden!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is great. Gerry and addictive.  Not to hard or easy. A must buy for the kindle fire. Great for any puzzle lover.
B00009MGR6|2.0|I love all the albuns from AC DC with BON SCOTT...The albuns with Brian Johnson are good, i really like Back in Black, FLICK OF THE SWITCH and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK...But after Back in Black, the AC DC albuns start to bring a lot of filler songs! Blow Up Your Video in my opinion is the one with more fillers and maybe only 2 decent songs, That's the way and Heatseeker! Well, every great band got uninspired moments in their career...
B000Y7U98W|5.0|I'm a believer in Believable Sci-Fi. This movie is not beyond the simple concept of our Sun dying...and scientist have mined All of Earth's nuclear fissile material and have set off on trip in a spaceship to the Sun (with the nuclear material of course) in order \\"re-start\\" or \\"re-ignite\\" it. Great movie. I've purchased the soundtrack for the movie even. This movie was put together Very well. Cast, crew, screen play, plot. Nicely Done. 5 Stars here...
B0054N73EY|3.0|I'm With You is another good album from the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS...Got great songs like LOOK AROUND, FACTORY OF FAITH and MONARCHY OF ROSES...But it's impossible not to notice that this new RHCP is way more POP than on past albuns! Some songs are still good but got a authentic pop flavour...It's not one of the best albuns from RHCP, but got good moments...
0307477479|4.0|Jennifer Egan<br />A Visit From the Goon Squad<br />Alfred Knopf<br />2011<br />365 pages (eBook portrait)<br />ISBN: 0307477479<br /><br />A Visit From the Goon Squad has been characterized by various critics and reviewers as either a book of short stories or a novel (depending on the day of the week or who you ask) but in this reviewers opinion it hardly matters. A Visit From the Goon Squad is urban fantasy at its finest whether in short or long form. Centered on a self-destructive cast of characters the book is mostly an editorial on aging and how different people cope with the inevitable advance of time and of growing old. Set for the most part in New York, the story centers around an aging rock music executive, his one-time kleptomaniac assistant, and their various odd-ball friends and strange associates.<br /><br />While the story itself is strong and the plot engaging where Egan excels is with the characters. The flaws, the faults, the inner struggles we all face become fodder for the pen of this exceptional and gifted writer. She displays the conflicts, emotions, and depressing thoughts everyone undergoes when considering the fact that we are all growing older. That she does it with such skill is a testament to how well she understands the human condition and the thoughts that assail us as we grow older. It is not surprising to me that Egan won the Pulitzer for this book. It really is that good (and I do not always agree with all the choices that win.) This is one of those rare books that I recommend for everyone. A must read no matter what genre trips your trigger. A Visit From the Goon Squad has moved into my 100 books to read before you die... so get to it. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />4 1/2 out of 5<br /><br />The Alternative One<br />Southeast Wisconsin
B000067CPX|3.0|By the Way got some great songs like the title track, ZEPHYR SONG and CAN´t STOP, but also a lot of slow boring ones like THIS IS THE PLACE, I COULD DIE FOR YOU and TEAR...Well, this is when the CHILI PEPPERS really start to produce a lot of uninspired mellow tunes...BY THE WAY got some great songs, but try their best stuff like MOTHER´s MILK, BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIK, CALIFORNICATION and ONE HOT MINUTE...
B000002MP2|5.0|Track by track review<br /><br />Burnout (4/5) - This used to be my favorite on the album for a while. Great guitar and vocals from Billy Joe Armstrong<br /><br />Having a Blast (5/5) - Probably my 2nd favorite song on the album. I love the lyrics<br /><br />Chump (5/5) - At first I didn't really like this one, but it started to grow on me<br /><br />Longview (5/5) - The first single from the album and it has one of the best bass lines ever. The lyrics are awesome and so is Billy's voice<br /><br />Welcome to Paradise (4/5) - Great bass on this one<br /><br />Pulling Teeth (6/5) - My favorite song on the whole album. The vocals are some of the best I've heard. Love this song<br /><br />Basket Case (4/5) - Tre Cool's drumming is great on this. One of Green Day's most famous songs<br /><br />She (5/5) - Great lyrics and bass throughout<br /><br />Sassafras Roots (3/5) - This is my least favorite song on the album, just can't get into it<br /><br />When I Come Around (5/5) - The first Green Day song I ever heard, still one of my favorites<br /><br />Coming Clean (4/5) - Deep lyrics and great guitar work<br /><br />Emenius Sleepus (3.5/5) - Pretty good, drums are awesome<br /><br />In the End (4/5) - Really good, but short song<br /><br />FOD (4/5) - I really love the acoustic opening from Billy. Really cool<br /><br />If you've never listened to Green Day, buy this CD. Chances are you'll love it
B000002LQR|5.0|WOW! This must be the high point of the great carrer of the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS!!! All the songs are simply AMAZING... POWER OF EQUALITY,GIVE IT AWAY, BREAKING THE GIRL, SUCK MY KISS, NAKED IN THE RAIN, UNDER THE BRIDGE....Ok, this is RHCP´s Nevermind...ALL the greatest hits from Chili Peppers are here! A GREAT GREAT PIECE OF MUSIC!!!

B0052RDHTM|3.0|Ever since Pillars of the Earth, I've waited for another wonderful story, populated with colorful characters, interwoven through the background of history.  And, while the characters in this first book of the trilogy does that, the war is the foreground rather than the background.  Let us hope book 2 is less about war, and more about the richness of the lives affected by it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it is awesome. I love the beat the machine game. I would highly recommend it for anyone and everyone.
B0063T12RM|5.0|Though the film was nominated for Oscar's Best Documentary in 2012, \\"Pina\\" directed by Wim Wenders (\\"Wings of Desire\\" \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\"), looks more like a tribute to an acclaimed dancer and choreographer Pina Bausch. Because of her sudden death in 2009, the project was almost canceled, but Wenders didn't give up the idea of making a film for her.<br /><br />So in \\"Pina\\" you don't see much of the person Pina Bausch herself. Instead, what you will see is largely her works performed by the dancers of the Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, contemporary dance pieces filmed for this movie, including except from \\"The Rite of Spring,\\" \\"Café Müller\\" (briefly seen in Pedro Almodóvar's \\"Talk to Her\\"), \\"Kontakthof\\" and \\"Full Moon.\\"<br /><br />The film also includes the comments of dancers of the company (delivered in voiceovers). What the dancers have to say does not reveal much about the person for whom the film was made. It sounds more like eulogy to their teacher. Perhaps it should be so, though this may not be exactly what you wanted to know.<br /><br />Though I know little about contemporary dance, I was fascinated by the amazing movements of the dancers that are beautiful, intense and even comical at times. To be honest I sometimes could not understand what those dancers are trying to express with their dancing (which looks often bizarre), I somehow know it is about raw emotions of a human.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Wim Wenders films, of which drama I sometimes find dry and detached. To me he is more like a painter with a camera and he is always good at using the existing landscapes. In \\"Pina\\" he uses the city of Wuppertal (where Pina Bausch lived for a long time) and its suspension railway (\\"floating train\\") very effectively as the backdrop of dancing scenes.<br /><br />Those who are interested in Pina Bausch herself may want to watch a documentary \\"Dancing Dreams.\\"

B005LAJ212|5.0|Emily Thorne is coming to town and revenge is coming with her. What starts out as a checklist of payback slows to a melodic dish best served cold as Emily works to get payback for misdeeds done to her father. Over 16 episodes she pushes her way all over the board, passing pawns in the first episodes and bigger pieces later on, trying to get to the  bigger fish - the Graysons. We open at an engagement party filled with guests, moving through the people, when a body appears and everyone turns out to find Victoria Grayson crying. Her son is dead. We then go backward, detailing what happened in all its intricacy and who was involved, until we catch up and go a little bit beyond, showing what the show can become in Season 2. It gets a whole lot more complex as the piece move around.<br /><br />While the show seems like a soap at night in large part, the pieces being moved around are interesting. Everyone i knew liked the way it started and some wandered after more people and faces popped in and stayed in, but i liked it quite a bit. You have interesting plots that are sometimes flawed and wrinkled but that the show wears well anyhow, and you have nice acting throughout.<br /><br />I enjoy Emily VanCamp's portrayal of Emily and Madeleine Stowe's as Victoria Grayson. Gabriel Mann is also an interesting piece of the puzzle as Nolan and one that you constantly have to reconsider because he does a great job of evasion. Nick Welsher also does a great job as the love lost to the past. There's a variable who's who of interesting characters popping in and out, and they make things interesting as the show develops roots.<br /><br />If you missed it and want to know whether you want to check the series out of not, there are still previews of the first episode floating around. You get a lot of breakdown there, and most of the things you want to know will be answered - at least in part - by the time you get to the end. A few things happen along the way and you have to wonder about feelings, like love, popping in and clouding the idea of revenge conquering all.<br /><br />I think it was a solid 5/5, meaning I loved watching it weekly and am getting my order ready to go now.elings, like love, popping in and clouding the idea of revenge conquering all.<br /><br />I think it was a solid 5/5, meaning I loved watching it weekly and am getting my order ready to go now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this book was really good. I actually read it in two days and couldn't put it down. I had been avoiding young adult books since the whole \\"Twilight\\" series came out, but I realized that I had \\"The Hunger Games\\" on my Kindle that I must have bought years before, so I decided to read it. I'm so glad I did. I haven't read a book that kept me so engaged in such a long time. Really good story.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This CD is not \\"Born in the USA\\" or \\"Born to Run\\". The Bruce fans who insist he return to that Sound will Hate this CD as they have anything he has released recently. Its clear when you listen to this CD that those days are behind him. This CD is not for the soft hearted. There are songs which will remind you of the Rising (another GREAT...an underrated Springsteen release), and songs that remind you of Live in Dublin. The songs bring you down and they take you up to a different place ans sense, (at least for me) of the panorama of America in all the \\"ashes and glory\\".<br />The CD opens with \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\". When I heard it I was prepared for a similar sound or theme throughout....Nope! There is a spiritual flavor to this CD....lots of different sounds including an Irish folk flavor. Listening to songs like \\"Wrecking Ball\\" and \\"Death to My hometown\\" was difficult without thinking about the CD \\"Born in the USA\\" which I think had a more Hopeful sound. Some listeners will be turned off by that.<br />I call this album an \\"ode\\"...for me it contains a panoramic vision of who we are and where we are headed as Americans. If you had ancestors who came here from Ireland, Italy, Germany, etc...or not...you can visualize them in the  music. There are personal songs too like \\"This Depression\\" and a my personal Favorite \\"Jack of All Trades\\".<br />I Love this CD...its a Great effort by Bruce and the band and for me, the Best he has Done since the Rising!<br />Bruccccccccce!<br /><br />Atreides

B004ZIAB2A|5.0|I chose to buy The Distant Hours by Kate Morton for my Kindle as I had read her previous books The Shifting Fog aka The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden. I enjoyed these very much; and I'm not surprised Kate has had great success with them. Her books are written in a traditional literary style not short sharp sentences that are so common in some modern books. For a relatively young person Kate shows a great depth of knowlege and well honed research skills. Her story is set in England partly during World War II when a child is evacuated to a castle in the countryside. I can't tell you anymore, you must read it for yourself and besides I don't want to give away too much of the story!<br /><br />As I live in Brisbane Australia I guess I have some favouritism for Kate, a Brisbane lass. I was thrilled with The Distant Hours, it was a great read and one I would highly recommend. Can't wait for her next book.
1594744769|4.0|MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN is a fictional narrative that is told from the perspective of Jacob Portman. Jacob is sixteen-years-old and is an all around average student. He's completely ordinary and he feels that there is nothing special about him. He's very close to his grandfather. His grandfather used to tell him exciting adventure stories that he claims actually happened to him. Jacob used to believe these stories (his grandfather even had pictures to prove the truth of the tales), but over time he came to see them as the nonsensical ramblings of an ageing man. Something horrible happens to Jacob's grandfather and but before he dies, he leaves Jacob with a mysterious message. It's a long time before Jacob is able to unravel the meaning of the message, but when he does it sets him out on a journey to a small island off the coast of Wales. There he discovers not only the debilitating house that is grandfather often spoke, but the key to unlocking the mystery that has been haunting him since his grandfather's death.<br /><br />The general plot of MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN isn't that different from the plots of many other stories. That's not to say the book is a bad book because it's not. Riggs does a good job of storytelling and building the suspense of the story and moving it along. He's also a superior descriptive writer, vividly illustrating in one's mind's eye exactly what a particular scene or person looks like. His descriptions are helped by the standout feature of this book: photographs. Scattered throughout the novel are a series of photographs. Some of these photographs are related while some of them are not. However, Riggs uses them as a device to tie together his story and make it more coherent. At face value, the photographs appear to be just a bunch of random snapshots. However, used in the context of the story, they are a tool that makes the story stronger than it would have been without them.<br /><br />Riggs' use of photographs to write and connect a story around is a standard writing exercise. I've been in writing classes before where we were assigned to bring in a picture or photograph and then write a story inspired by the picture. Riggs has perfected that exercise and the story that he composed around these random pictures is an exciting, action-mystery.<br /><br />There are some minor flaws with the writing. For instance, some of the characters begin acting outside of character towards the end of the story. Also, the ending feels rushed and there are some definite loose ends. However, these minor flaws aren't large enough to distract the reader from the main story.<br /><br />The photographs are the device that sets MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN apart from other books, but the story actually reads better as a tell-aloud story or radio drama. It's the type of book that a parent could read at night as a bedtime story for older children. Highly recommended.photographs to write and connect a story around is a standard writing exercise.

B005VTS4EY|2.0|While the developer removed the simple permissions from the game he left in some things you should know about. Three adware programs called AdKnowledge, InMObi and Inneractive. On top of that the app has Flurry Analytics which monitors your game play and actions. It still contains the code for Open Feint which is disliked by everyone. Zong is an InApp purchasing program that is in the app as well as Google Play In-app Billing. Facebook code is also built into the app.<br /><br />He did remove the WIFI permissions that were in the app so that may have disabled these programs I have listed above. Keep an eye on updates as the app was obviously designed with the adware and flurry analytics built in and IAPs for a reason. Perhaps they are there as a result of the SDK used by the developer. I would think that while removing the permissions he would have tried to remove the other offensive parts of the app code.<br /><br />The app downloaded 7.85MB into my device memory. I moved it to my SD card and it left 3.91MB in my device memory and moved 8.25MB onto my SD card.<br />+++++++++<br />This is a wonderful game. It is fun and it makes you think to win. I love the little faces on the blocks as you play and the strategy for each level may take you a few tries to figure out. Once you understand the game and the physics it is using for each type of shape it really gets fun.<br /><br />Some levels not only require you to think about how to clear them, you have to do it fast and in order. Other levels require you to time your moves and use the motion and physics to your advantage. This is a well thought out game!<br /><br />Unfortunately the developer left in multiple permissions that they have no need for. He obviously took out OpenFeint (He states this on his app page on Amazon) as we all now realize how that is really a form of spyware (You share your game scores but what else are you sharing) but he left in:<br /><br />* Network communication - Full network access<br />* Kindle Calls - Read Kindle state and Identity<br />* Network communication - View network state<br /><br />This game is 5 stars but due to the remaining permissions which still leave open access to my network and Kindle data I cannot in good faith give it more than 2 stars.

B005XBA9Y8|5.0|Over the years I have picked up several of the Living Presence LP's.  Then started picking up the CD's.  Then I heard that this box set was going to come out.  I waited and then found a set from Korea I believe, or maybe China, but with shipping and my concern about the language on the disks I passed.  But I knew this set really was out there.  Well the wait was worth it.<br /><br />The sound is outstanding.  You can listen to any of the disks on headphones and you will not be disappointed.  But for real fun sit back and crank up your system to real hall levels... and then remember these were made back in the day.  Superior recording engineering, over all good performances.<br /><br />Cons - small print and very limited liner notes to none.  Yes there is a very nice booklet, with small print, with the set but it would have been nice to include all of the  notes from the original LP's. For the next version I would consider a 12x12 firm or hardbound book with complete liner notes.<br /><br />I would recommend this box, the Decca Sound 50 box set and the RCA Living Stereo 60 box set to any person wanting to start a classical music collect.<br /><br />And I also wish for the Mercury Living Presence II box set...
B005LAIH3G|3.0|As a kid I loved the Tarzan comics and I'm pretty sure I've seen every movie about Tarzan ever made.  But I never knew Edgar Rice Burroughts also wrote the John Carter series of books.  In this the first, in what I'm sure the Disney folks hope won't be the last of many films about the character, I'm a bit conflicted.  The film tries to pull together elements of \\"Avatar\\", \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" and even the TV series \\"Hell on Wheels.\\"  It partially succeeds.<br /><br />Carter (Taylor Kitsch, TV's \\"Friday Night Lights\\"), a Civil War veteran from Virginia, seeks his fortune in the West by searching for gold shortly after the war.  In an unnecessary sequence he is imprisoned by the controlling military Colonel (Bryan Cranston, \\"Drive\\") because he doesn't want to fight the local Apaches.  Escaping, Carter finds his way to a cave, filled with gold.  He also finds a medallion that when rubbed, sends him to the planet Barsoom.  We know it as Mars.  Forgetting what science now knows, Mars has breathable air and has a temperature appropriate for bare skin.  It also has a gravity pull much less than Earth, so Carter develops some unique abilities including heighten strength and jumping.<br /><br />Carter first meets local 4 armed, green inhabitants headed by Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe).  Eventually he makes nice with them and they become allies in a final battle against the evil-doers trying to take control of the planet.  Those bad guys are headed by Sab Than (Dominic West, \\"The Awakening\\") and his mystical shape-shifting mentor Matai Shang (Mark Strong, \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\").  They are in a civil war against other humanoids headed by Tardos Mors (Ciaran Hinds, \\"The Debt\\") and his princess daughter Dejah (a delicious Lynn Collins, \\"X-Men: Wolverine\\").<br /><br />Directed by animated wizard Andrew Stanton (\\"Finding Nemo\\"), the story bogs down too often in order to provide info to the characters and the audience about who and what each tribe is about, how Carter got to Mars, how he's going to get back to Earth, what happened to Carter's family, etc.  For films of this genre, with many funny names and fantasy driven story lines, I found this pretty easy to follow.  When the battles begin, so does the fun.  The airships which look like huge dragonflies are very cool but not well built, so we see them crash often.<br /><br />The visuals and sound in the film are really exceptional and this is where the wow factor comes in.  The movie looks great.  The romantic relationship between Taylor and Dejah really never develops.  I'm sure it will if there are sequels, but here it remains a one night stand with no fleshy details.  \\"John Carter\\" doesn't achieve what it set out to do with its reported $250 million price tag, but has its moments and is certainly no worse than many other recent films of the genre.rter got to Mars, how he's going to get back to Earth, what happened to Carter's family, etc.  For films of this genre, with many funny names and fantasy driven story lines, I found this pretty easy to follow.

B001EO9XEU|3.0|First of all this is not a movie.  It is about a Movie called, Lost In La Mancha that did not get finished.  Basically This director went over budget and they had bad luck and they pulled the plug.  Now his career is basically ruined.  In anycase I found out about it in my Film Production class. this is basically a movie that anyone in film biz or wanting to work in film should watch. anyone else who thinks it's entertaining with Johnny Depp then you can forget about that right now.<br /><br />Great film for students of film/cinema very interesting way of talking about breakdowns, budgets, money, financing films, out of control directors.  Why didnt' they just replace the director and go with CGI?<br /><br />In anycase Orson Welles never finished his film about Don Q either. It has bad luck. They first need to find a person to break the spell I guess.
B006MW3VGA|4.0|This is a series I really enjoy because of the cast and the setting. It really addresses the issues of class/caste, the inequality at the time and how people viewed the levels of separation. It uses this story line to expose the system. The human condition that fought to have the opportunity to be whom and what they aspired to. The start of the women's movement and the blurring of classism. It shows that you can be whatever in spite of the position you hold in society by way of birth. The price of holding the estates was more than just the cost.

B006OCM0G0|1.0|This game within the first five minutes of playing was asking my daughter to buy 50 gems for 9.99. Thank GOD she had enough sense to ask me if she could, which she wasn't happy with the answer. Things popped up every five minutes asking you to buy something more for additional money. Needless to say I uninstalled this app and found her something else on the free app list that wasn't going to try to vacumm all the money out of your bank account.

0312330537|4.0|I bought this book because of the incredible reviews on Amazon. I thought it was good, but not great. I was definitely interested in the character, and wanted to know what would happen next, and the things that happen to him are very interesting. It is a about a person who is very tough and interesting, but who keeps making the same dumb mistakes over and over again, based on loyalty to people who definitely did not earn it or deserve it, and it gets him into way more trouble and pain than is necessary. Just because these people were in his life, he'd put himself in danger to help them, but the cause behind these other peoples' efforts was not worthy of his involvement. \\"Hey Lin, I've got to meet with these drug dealer people. There might be trouble. I can't tell you why, but can you come with me? I really need you\\". That kind of thing. Over and over again. And \\"surprise\\", he gets beat up (again). The character thinks everyone around him is so noble and worthy of his love, but he just doesn't THINK about what he is doing very much, and continually suffers the consequences. You feel bad for the guy, but then he does the same thing again and again. You'd think getting the $&%# beat out of you so many times might help you think a little more clearly. I wish the character evolved and learned something, but I don't think he did. He finds peace at the end, but I don't know how the concluding events caused that peace. Lots of action in this book, but for me, a GREAT book makes me feel I understand the human condition a little better, more in my heart than in my head. Either this book did not quite do that, or I just did not \\"get\\" it.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|I think it's a good game.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be difficult at times.  Most levels are easy to figure out.  But some are head-scratchers. The graphics are simple and clean.  And even though there are hundreds of games out there with the same premise, this one has found a different take.  Worth keeping on my Kindle since it's a FAOTD.

B0060V1WJ6|1.0|[[VIDEOID:moYXIDXJZIHU9T]]If I could rate it -3,470, I would.  This was the dumbest movie ever.

It has no bearing in the real world, which makes it completely

B00170MYIS|1.0|March 10, 2012<br />Review of the purchase of a Sony NP-FG1 infoLITHIUM- Sold by -Good As New Electronics-<br />This advertised Battery didn't display the remaining time on my Sony-HX9V.  After informing the Vendor Customer Service dept the rep wrote to me saying that this was an \\"impossible\\" function for any battery. I was sent a replacement battery after finally successfully educating the Rep. as to the functions of this specific battery. The second battery failed as well. When reporting the second failure to the Vendor I was told that my camera was defective. I doubted that since my other Sony NP-FG1 battery functions perfectly. However, I took this Vendor's battery to a Sony store and had it tested there on the same model camera as mine. You guessed it...FAILURE. In fact, the Sony Technician tried it on other Sony compatible cameras. It failed to indicate the remaining time. When I informed the Vendor they said that I would have to pay for shipping it back. It would be tested on their equipment and if it failed they would credit my credit card. Further, they wrote, \\"If the item is not defective, we will issue you a refund less the original shipping costs (not necessarily your shipping and handling charges - what it actually cost us to ship your item in the first place) and our 15% restocking fee on the item charges.\\"  I had totally lost trust with this vendor and contacted Amazon directly. The Amazon customer service rep could not have been nicer and most reassuring that I would be credited for the full purchase. I paid for sending the the battery back to the vendor. After nearly a week and not hearing from the Vendor I e mailed them for the results. They wrote back saying the battery was not defective yet out of courtesy they would credit my purchase price less shipping costs.  Already, Amazon had kindly taken care of  refunding the full amount back to my credit card.<br />This entire process was a big hassle with this Vendor and I went out of my way to educatethe customer service rep about the product that was being sold as well as driving 30 miles to a Sony Store and having the battery checked out there by the technician only to have the the failure demonstrated. And then told by the Vendor that the battery worked successfully on their \\"DSC-H70/B camera we use in the office.\\"  The bottom line is when purchasing such an important piece of equipment for your camera you want to be sure that it functions successfully. These batteries from this company FAILED. I won't be purchasing anything from this Vendor in the future. One positive comment about the Vendor is...they did respond to my e mails and not ignore my complaint which I appreciated.
1934429821|3.0|I discovered Charley Harper's work recently thanks to a friend, and fell immediately in love with it.<br />I think this is a great book to purchase if you want to get familiar with Harper: it has quite a lot of his wonderful images, divided in sensible sections; plus it is actually quite cheap.<br />However, I have to agree with another reviewer who said the printing is actually not very good, and the binding is very poor. Also, the type size in the introduction is ridiculously small: even with my glasses on it gets hard to read.<br />All in all, I'm happy with my new book!
0316056863|4.0|If you don't like Tina Fey or SNL, you are probably not going to like this book.  I was endeared to Tina even more after I read this book.  (That said, I can't stand 30 Rock.)  This was a well-written, endearing memoir.  Fey doesn't come off as condescending or holier-than-thou. I was endeared by the stories of her childhood, her strong moral unbringing, her embarrassing fashion choices that seemed cool at the time, and the stories from behind the scenes of SNL.  All in all, a great read, well-written, entertaining, but nothing that is going to change your life.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a funny kids movie that grown ups will enjoy watching as well. My kids and I highly recommend it!

B000H4QD1O|1.0|Firefly has the same problem that all of Whedon's shows have. It is unfocused and meanders for far too long. You can throw away about eight episodes a season because he does not know where he wants to go with them. He spends too much time fumbling around in the dark looking for a purpose or a plotline to follow and that is what happened with Firefly. The only difference is that he spends more time world building in this one instead of creating a purpose for the season.<br /><br />After seeing all of the episodes, well it does not live up to the hype. The characters are generic Whedon archetypes. It spends too much time with its being cutesy poo dialog, which is not witty or clever. It spends way too much time explaining insignificant details of the universe that will never pay off. I would probably have enjoyed the show, but the diehard Firefly fans ruined any enjoyment I might get out of it. They built this show up to be one of the greatest shows ever made, proclaimed every episode is golden and chided a network for acting like a business.<br /><br />And nd no, I'm not some lone warrior looking to start a fight. I'm just speaking to the truth that a lot of you are in denial about. Firefly failed not because of some correct order nonsense. If the producer had an idea where he was going, the show would have lasted longer. The general science fiction fanbase saw a badly made show that was confusing to follow. They saw a show whose producer did not have the decency to give them a reason to tune in the following week.<br /><br />Before you spout your correct order nonsense, the science fiction audience had an opportunity to see it in the correct order when SciFi aired for the 13 weeks leading up to the Serenity movie premiere. They did not watch it then, nor did they watch when it was on 13 hour marathons. It was the lowest rated show on SciFi. Ridicule it all you want, but this was from back in the day when SciFi still showed quality science fiction, like Galactica andFarscape. If it did poorly back then, what should that tell you about the show.<br /><br />I am sorry if you Whedonites do not like hearing this, but that is reality. If the show was good, then it did not matter the order it was aired. If the show was good, it would be in its 8th or 9th season. If the show was good, it would not need your wishful thinking and vitriolic responses to keep it alive. If the show was good, it would have expanded beyond the Whedonite audience. Sorry, but the show was not good and you are doing a disservice by hyping the hell out of it.

B000063DFQ|5.0|Number of the Beast is a great album but it isn't as good as everyone says, the rest of their '80s discography is way better. Piece of Mind isn't my absolute favorite but it's underrated and should get more attention. It was released between their 2 most popular albums, before Powerslave but after Number of the Beast. The songs are slower and heavier than on their first 3 albums. There's no filler here and Piece of Mind is a classic. Where Eagles Dare, Still Life, Die With Your Boots On and The Trooper are my highlights but they're all good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the app so much I play everyday. this app has plenty of games that everyone will like plus the games are enjoyable for once
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Stephen King is my favorite author.  That's not to say he hasn't had starts-and-stumbles like any other author, he has.  The Long Walk though truly stands as his strongest masterpiece.<br /><br />The Long Walk is a perfect blend of science fiction and horror.  The story is a simple one revolving around youths who are entered into a death sport...with the macguffin \\"prize\\" waiting for the winner at the end.<br /><br />But it is the journey that is so truly incredible.  It is a frightening experience to read this story and feel like you are there walking alongside the contestants as they plod one step closer to a \\"third warning\\" and the delivering of their \\"ticket\\".<br /><br />I envy any reader who has the chance to take this walk with King for the first time.  And for those who have already read The Long Walk, there's still joy/discovery to be found in repeated trips.  No Kindle should be without THE LONG WALK.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good game some of the games are a little challenging but that's what makes it fun!! I do recommend this game to everyone.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|What made Firefly a chore to sit through was the fact that it did not have a focus. It felt like it was meandering for far too long first episode before it made an effort to tell a season narrative. I mean the actual first episode and not the train robbery. The episodes were disjointed and written by someone that did not have an clue what he wanted to do with the series. Had Whedon figured out a direction before the first episode was penned and stayed with it, then it might have done better with the science fiction audience. Instead, he produced D work and it only has appeal to his fans and no one else.<br /><br />Serenity, on the other hand is everything that Firefly should have been. Yes, I like the movie and hate the series it was based on, something a lot more common that you think. The movie did more things right than the series. It had a clear focus that went somewhere. We understood the goal of the story and it did not waver from it. Every line of dialog added to the story and was not a wasted, look at how clever I am, bit of witty banter that makes non Whedonites want to strangle themselves. Even the story made a sort of sense that worked within the universe and did not reference anything else.<br /><br />The best part of the script is that it trusted itself enough to not waste time explaining how things work in the universe. It told the audience just enough to understand and follow it. All I needed to know about, namely the main characters, their allies, the bad guys and what happened before the series was summed up nicely in the first act. It did not waste time with being clever and told a compelling story. While it did not compel me to seek out the series afterwards, I did not feel like my intelligence was insulted by this movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I did seek out Firefly, it felt more like a waste of time than anything insightful. The series was not nearly a tenth as good as the movie. The series fell into the same trap that all of Whedon's creations fall into. It did not trust the audience to get what it was trying to do. Instead, it meanders around in the dark wasting eight or nine valuable episodes building a universe instead of creating a compelling storyline with character development and a destination. The science fiction audience is a lot smarter than Whedon gave us credit for and would have accepted a lot with the just go with it explanation. We did not need witty asides, clever banter, or incoherent plot threads. He just needed to trust us to get it and not hold our hand through the series.<br /><br />What's even more infuriating is that Whedon's squandered a chance to make Firefly good by doing what he did with Buffy and Angel. He wasted too many episodes with world building and not providing a good story. In the same amount of episodes that Whedon typically wastes, other producers and writers could come up with 3 dimensional characters, believable universes, and great story lines and build to a logical conclusion. That's the difference between good writers and Whedon. Whedon takes 13 episodes to lay down the foundations of the universe, something that he should have done before filming the first episode.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is a challenge, but my children like playing to. They fond it hard at times but still find a joy in it. All 7 of my kids have a ball with this game.
B000001FTD|5.0|ATL is when Anthrax change direction slightly. it's more in the thrash metal genre than their first 2 were. They more speed metal. ATL has more mature and better songwriting, the production is a little better and it's heavier than their first 2. Definitely a must have for if you're a fan of Anthrax or if you just like metal in general. They didn't get as popular as several other thrash bands but for me, they're still one of the best. Caught in a Mosh is a classic. There's no filler here, entire album's a masterpiece.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|First i will address other reviews the books talks about  in the first one how they are escorted by peacekeeper as if they are going to run or if family tries to intervene and remember the people running from the capital to district 13 got killed here had to be a spark of rebellion large enough and if you look at the world the most successful country is totalitarian (China) and fascism is something that has indenture being torn down time after time thus it is not an illogical story line plus it is build on her experiences as a child going to battle sites and one of the thing she took interest in Greek mythology the tributes sent to the labyrinth and they are children so teen can relate and feel empathy and the fact that she is self-centered look at your children and you will probably see the same thing trust me i am at that age unlike you i don't have the bias of perfect angels  we (including myself)look at a situations to see how we can get by without doing any work or how we can benefit we live as if everyone is a tool  thus the book is written as if Katniss was a typical teen and gale is her childhood friend she has a deep connection with him while Peeta she feel for but thought that it was all an act or at least at first that is what she thought but then she can't choose how would you pick the boy who saved your life twice or the one who is so much like you and you have known forever but i am now going to talk about my experience with the book the first chapter was hard for me but then i couldn't put it down and was ready to pull my out waiting for the next one<br /><br />  p.s. i know that someone will take offense to thus but it is my honest option and i would love feed back besides the fact it is poorly written review i am to tired to care right now but after reading all the comments saying it is unrealistic and casting Kat in a negative light you aren't supposed to love her all the time even she hates herself most of the time but in the end she losses so much and she does develop as a human but not in the way you wanted she see the world as it is bitter and unforgiving if you want to give a comment on this but do not ant the world to see it email m,e at jbattiest@gmail.com with subject hunger games review
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game. it is fun and some of them are challenging. I I beat four games in my first thirty minutes.
B000001C6M|4.0|Slayer have several masterpieces throughout their career however they just started on Show no Mercy. They get more technical and unique later, this is just great straight forward heavy metal. At times it sounds like an American version of Motorhead and you can tell that Slayer have a lot of classic speed metal and British Metal influences on Show No Mercy. I wouldn't put it under thrash, it takes until Hell Awaits for them to make a change to their sound. SNM's more melodic and slower than their 2 following ones, the guitar is more traditional and doesn't have the fast tempo changes. Also Dave Lombardo's drumming isn't outstanding either, he was always great but this is their first and he would improve with skill and age. My highlights are The Antichrist, Die By The Sword, Chrionics and Tormentor. It's a must have for Slayer fans but not the best place to start, production could be better also but besides that it's a solid debut.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|fun. easy but challenging. beat all 100 levels in about an hour and a half. hope they make more lvls soon.

B00097DX3U|5.0|Out of Exile is no sophomore slump, it's just as good as their debut. The band changed direction a little, not that much though. It's a little lighter and less hard rock. It doesn't have as much post grunge either and it's more alternative. A few songs are still has some hard rock songs but it also has several lighter rock, more alternative songs. It includes their hits Be Yourself, Doesn't Remind Me, Your Time Has Come and Out of Exile. Some of my personal favorites are Yesterday to Tomorrow, #1 Zero and Drown Me Slowly. Overall, I enjoyed it more than their self-titled debut. All of their albums are great but Out of Exile is their best.

B0052U59F4|3.0|For a BDSM romance, this one is in a class of it's own. While some of the the content was repetitive, the heart of the story is believable. What would happen if an innocent inexperienced girl met a dominant? On the one hand you could rationalize and say a dominant would never go for a girl like Ana but for me it was plausible and EL James did a pretty good job at convincing me it could be. She spent a lot of time with how they met, negotiating through what each wanted in the relationship and how it played out in Ana's mind. The writing was childish at times and the content was repetitive. The jest of the story revolved around Ana's reservations with Christians sexual desires. She liked him and was very attracted to him but her main concern was being hurt by him, not just physically but emotionally as well. Her characterization of Christian was lacking, he was not as believable as Ana and it would have been a stronger story if she presented both characters thoughts and reservations within the relationship. It was clear that James's knowledge of a dominant male was limited but that being said, most sex scenes were well written and entertaining.

B004EBZX6W|5.0|We have so many people in my area with Wi-Fi networks, it's difficult to get a good signal.  I installed the Wi-Fi Analyzer on the Kindle Fire and found the conflicts in my neighborhood.  With that information, I adjusted the channel on my network.  I have fewer conflicts now.  Surfing is smoother, fewer dropped connections.<br /><br />I especially like the graphs.  I am a visual person and the graphs clearly illustrate signal strength and conflicts at a glance. There is also a screen that will give every channel a star rating and recommend the best channel setting for the router.  I don't even have to think about it!  What a great app.

0385534639|4.0|This book is unlike any other book I have read.  The beauty, magic, and mystery will keep you entranced as you find the circus at a new location.  No advertisements will let you know when the circus is coming.  It will just be there one day and the anticipation grows as you wait for the sun to set so you can experience the circus that evening.<br /><br />At the heart of this novel is a challenge that Marco and Celia find themselves as the main participants.  By the time that they realize that they are opponents in this magical game, they can no longer deny their love for one another.  Their feelings for each other conflict with the purpose of the game, so how can one of them possibly win this challenge but yet remain in this relationship.<br /><br />Both Marco's and Celia's magic is special, and it seems that the circus itself feeds off of them as they draw strength from the circus.  But besides these magicians, all of the circus performers are extraordinary with what they have to offer.  Their gifts are exceptional and when it is apparent that the circus itself is in jeopardy, a plan must be devised in order for it to continue.<br /><br />As I said earlier, this was a special and magical novel.  Morgenstern's writing was beautiful and believable, as sometimes when I read books with magical elements they become a bit too far-fetched for me.  I enjoyed this book and I'm sure many of you will also!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got this game to satisfy my kids and play myself every once in a while. it's too hard for my 3 year old but the first two tiers are a good challenge for my 6 and 8 year olds. Beyond the first two tiers has started to challenge me. Not too shabby for a free game!
144234430X|5.0|Once again Kng demonstrates his skills and writing, bothin the story line development, the descriptive writing and the flow.  It certainlyh is not a horror book by any stretch of the imagination, but a wondrful listen (audio book).  the reader was great.  My wife and I enjoyed this for the 30 plus hours and felt it was time well spent.  A quality work.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This book was a huge disappointment. The only thing positive about it was that it helped me fall asleep. Incredibly wordy and redundant. The characters are boring and not very believable. Full of contradictions, such as, the family supposedly goes broke defending the son, even so much as using the equity in their home, yet, they can afford a two week trip to the Bahamas? Hmmm. Dialog is drawn out way too long and not very believable. Why the author felt the need to subject the readers to routine attorney courtroom questions, like, How long have you known the defendant? (which we already know the answer to)is beyond me. Don't waste your time with this book, as I did.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|If you use Google Calendar to organize your life, like I do, you will LOVE this app. It's especially key for the Kindle Fire, which has no other good calendar options. my favorite features: 1) ability to create recurring google tasks (even though google calendar still does not have this option!), which are perfect for bills, etc, and 2) offline viewing. The customizability is fantastic- you can customize virtually every aspect of the display. Definitely worth $5.99!!!
1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habits is not a book that defines how to break or change specific habits but more so explains why habits occur and how to identify them. Identifying our habits and what they're triggered by is the first and perhaps the most important step in changing any bad habits we are guilty of. Would recommend this book to anyone interested in business, psychology, and the coexistence in the field of behavioral economics/consumer behavior.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With all the hype surrounding the upcoming Hunger Games film; it was time to crack open the first book of the series and have a gander. To say that I had high expectations going into this book was certainly true, but casting that aside, and the fact that I avoided plot summaries (which I hope not to provide here) and spoilers, I wanted to go into this fresh, with no outward stimuli to influence my opinion. However, in my haste I recall an episode of the Library Police Podcast, hosted by Dietrich Stogner and Josh Mauthe where they dished about this series. Had I listened? Yes, but in all honesty, I could not recall a single word uttered on the episode. Feigning all other mental inventories of spoiling gremlins, I proceeded.<br /><br />From the beginning of the book, we are introduced to the culture of Panem and it's overpowering government that rules with totality. The way it unfolds, through the first person narration of the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is unique, and often feels like it's fresh, not unexplored but just inexperienced. And really, Katniss is inexperienced in playing the Hunger Games, seeing as how you only play it once, and more often than not you die doing it. Katniss has the misfortune of being from District 12, which focuses on mining coal, and also hasn't won a Hunger Games in approximately 24years. That winner, Haymitch Abernathy, the mentor of Katniss and her fellow male tribute Peeta Mellark, is the towns most infamous citizen, aside from it's mayor, but is also the towns best drunk.<br /><br />One of this book's strongest factors is the mythology it has built into itself. While it's not quite as detailed as say Harry Potter (it's also not as long a series either), it still puts on a clinic as to how to build a great world. Throughout the book, Katniss gives us a great explanation of how Panem is structured, why it's structured that way, the significance of the Hunger Games, all the little details before, during, and after the Games, and what makes certain districts distinct.<br /><br />More stunning is this book's influences, and while it's hard to pin down exactly what this book is similar to, Battle Royale comes closest, but even that film deviates in ways from this sprawling epic. At the very beginning of the book, one can feel a touch of Shirley Jackson's short masterpiece \\"The Lottery.\\" The Games recall to mind a story I remember reading in high school called \\"The Worlds Most Dangerous Game\\"; in which the hunt for human flesh replaces the hunt for big game in the safari's of Africa. I also feel like there is a strong element of the reality TV show Survivor in this book. A more dangerous version of it for sure, but that influence comes through, especially with the way the games are televised. This final reference may seem out of place to some, but I feel it must be mentioned. There are elements of a beauty pageant present in this novel; there is an interview that all tributes must do, along with a talent portion displayed to the gamemakers, and image is definitely how you win crowds and sponsors over in this book.<br /><br />Only being one book into this trilogy, I'm starving for more. Particularly, in the last few chapters, Collins does a great job building tension in such a way, not knowing what will come next. After all, the 74th annual games were very controversial, especially the outcome. These results will lead to an unpredictability going into the next two books, and from my perspective will hopefully live up to this strong first book.<br /><br />Stray Observations<br /><br />There are a couple of things I didn't like in this book: There are a few moments late in the book where Katniss ponders on winning the games and being rich, she distinctly says, long after she lost hearing in one of her ears that \\"I'll pay someone to hear for me.\\" The attitude doesn't really fit her character and kind of had me scratching my head a couple of times.<br /><br />Secondly, I wish we knew a little bit moreabout each district, even if it's just a tiny explanation.<br /><br />Wish there was a map of Panem.<br /><br />I like that the protagonist is a strong woman, and the only man she has in her life is a bit inadequate.<br /><br />Rue Dying = Me Crying<br /><br />There is this great undercurrent in the Games, whereas, yes it is entertainment, but is barbaric in nature. Panem is obviously a bit more advanced than the country we live in now, and they choose to have it's competitors play these games in a barbaric manner, with primitive weapons, surviving in the wilderness (arena).<br /><br />The themes are very relatable to now; totalitarianism, poverty, starvation, technology, war.<br /><br />The romance (if you want to call it that) is so well done here; in other words, take notes Meyer.
B00008BXJ6|2.0|This album showcases everything I can't stand abut AC/dc. Repetitive riffs that suck(repetition is good if done right), annoying vocals, dumb lyrics, and song structures that bore the crap out of you. If you are a huge AC/DC fan you probably love this album. If you are like me and are not a big fan, stick with the Highway to Hell and Back and Black lps.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|Beautiful waste of time. I recognize the physics mechanic from a similar game or two I've played online, but Red Wrecker's physics are flawless and multifaceted, adding in multiple centers of gravity to the different tiles to keep things interesting. The cartoon aesthetic and childish &quot;yays&quot; at the end of each level keeps me from getting too frustrated when I get periodically stuck. More than worth its original price tag, Red Wrecker will almost certainly wreck your productivity with its addictive and frequent &quot;aha&quot; moments.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|First of all, 'kisses on the bottom' refers to signing a personal letter with hugs and kisses.  The CD is nice easy listening music, perfect for background music at dinner.  The baby boomers and the seniors will love the album; they will recognize many of the songs because they grew up with them:  Bye Bye Blackbird, Home (When Shadows Fall), The Glory of Love, just to name a few.  And Paul's new song My Valentine is lovely.  Great for all ages - I'm going to give it to my young grand kids and their parents for Easter!
B004FOA84A|5.0|As mystery adventure games go, this was well done, and held my interest because of the elegant design. There weren't any false leads that sent me scurrying off in the wrong direction. The end was rather abrupt , unexpected, and somewhat of a let down, however, that is minor compared to the massive amount of sheer fun it was to play. Maybe it was short, but it left me wanting more.

B0000062FL|5.0|Released in 1970 after their iconic performance at the 1969 Woostock festival; it forged ahead on the Latin rock, blues and jazz themes from the Santana debut album. Abraxas contains two of Santana's most recognizable and commercially successful songs; \\"Black Magic Woman\\" and \\"Oye Coma Va\\". While Carlos Santana has been making music for over 40 years; he has not often achieved the consistency that this record displayed. Later work often lacked the commercial sensibilities and distinctiveness of sound displayed on this record. Santana was compelled later to move off to other musical exploration that many in his fanbase did not share his enthusiam for and chose not to follow. I believe that the musical direction really changed when Greg Rolie (lead singer and keyboard player) parted ways or perhaps it was the opposite case but regardless his departure removed the more rockin' elements of the music. With the rock and blues elements mostly gone; it was almost just jazz fusion. But, Santana was changing spiritually and the musical direction change was as much about lifestyle change as it was what type of music to play. The Santana \\"project\\" became a constant stream of changing personnel over the years that while it could be interesting (at times) it always lacked the distinct and recognizable sound of the Santana band of 1970. It's on Abraxas that the most appealing and definitive songs of Carlos Santana's career appear.
B005VTS4EY|3.0|This is a \\"paid\\" version, not ad-supported.  Why does it need to know my phone ID, state, who I am calling, and an internet connection?<br /><br />This is nothing short of excessive and deceptive.  It is clearly designed to channel your personal information to somebody else.  Do not install this.<br /><br />Well respected games do not need a network connection for stand-alone play.<br /><br />*edit* increased stars; Developer responded about info being collected.  The problem is the \\"state\\" bucket's description says it CAN be used to read the phone number being called.  That is far too broad of a \\"permission bucket\\" - shame on Google.  They need to have very specific permission names so that we can tell exactly what an app is doing.

B001U0HBPQ|5.0|THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CRITERION COLLECTION VERSION ONLY<br /><br />This DVD set is incredible.  First of all, there is an incredible amount of extras, features/commentary.  In fact, there is a making of type documentary which is worth the price of admission.  It is about as long or longer than the actual movie and really makes you appreciate the movie even more.  It explains how the script knocked around for a long time -- mostly because it would be impossible to film.  Once it was decided that the movie would be made, the process would have be be created as there was no way to actually make the movie (imagine Brad Pitt, 80+ years old, the size of a 7 year old boy).  It's a truly incredible story.  I don't want to explain, but one of my favorite scenes from the movie was filmed on a set, and I had no idea.  The commentary is also excellent.<br /><br />Buy this DVD set.  Watch the movie, then check out the special features.  You won't regret spending a penny if you do.

B006UG90RM|5.0|From start to finish this new release is fantastic! The 1st track TATTOO does keep you guessing how this album might be(not to slow or fast/mid-tempo, but a decent rocker that I believe is meant to grow on you/it did for me!). The rest of the album (She's The Woman to Beats Workin'), is rip-roaring like old-school VH delivered! Still California hard and heavy/big rock crazy from the heat! This album is probably one of the bands loudest efforts and nothing could be more awesome!<br /><br />DLR. still has swagger and funtime stage presence! He also gets the hint with his more in-style shorter look and less chapless attire(still looking fit for 50+ years!). EVH.(Mr. 5150), is back in great form(nice to see), after all he's been through over the past several years. Again, welcome back in 2012. AVH. has never sounded better on the drums(kicking ass and taking no prisoners!), and Wolfgang VH. does a tremendous job as bassist and background singer(a definite chip off the old block musically and how!).<br /><br />A Different Kind Of Truth is everything you want by Van Halen and then some! It's back to classic business in 2012! The tardiness was worth the wait/GET IT!
B000006UNG|5.0|Talk Talk was a very interesting 80's band that altered its sound very radically over its five record career. From their New Romantic period debut in 1982 until their post-rock minimalist 1991 \\"Laughing Stock\\" final album; the span of musical style is somewhat extreme. Like many things in life, the middle of most extremes is often the best place to be and that's exactly where \\"Colour of Spring\\" can be found. It combines the pop sensibilities of the early work with a more organic instrumental approach found on the final two albums. This 1986 recording is the best representation of Talk Talk as a commercially viable band that also appealed to the college music scene of the time. The best known song is \\"Life's What You Makes It\\" yet all of the songs are high quality. Personal favorites include \\"Happiness is Easy\\" and \\"Time It's Time\\" but overall I would view this record as one of the top 100 albums from the 80's. If considering Talk Talk to add to your collection; \\"Colour of Spring\\" is the best choice, in my opinion. This music holds up very well and it's some of the most original material of the decade.

B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|So this is it, the final A-Ha release? I guess there comes a time when it's time to sever the cords that go too far back- all the way to their beginning in the 80's- where we all lived in a different world, when they were very young. I think they did it right with Foot of The Mountain. This is an album that tries to embrace every season of their career and does it nicely without crossing the line into full fledge 80's synthesizer pop. That would have been weird. All of these guys have a life and successful careers outside of A-Ha and I am sure they are ready to move on from A-Ha as an identity and simply get on with other pursuits that engage them as men in their 50's- unlike MANY aging rock stars today that don't seem to know when to call it a day. I like the album and I also purchased their farewell tour DVD because, as hard as my wife and I tried, we couldn't make it to one of their tour stops in the USA. A-Ha is one of my all-time favorite groups spanning from my 20's into my 40's. A part of me is bummed to see them go but I will watch their individual careers with interest. Out of blue comes green!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I overpaid for this Omnibus edition but I would do it again. I read the short (the free first story) and of course, HAD to have more. I came to Amazon and purchased book 2. OOPS! I then see the Omnibus and decide I want that one volume instead of the individual books. With just a few keystrokes I had the Omnibus edition on my Kindle Fire and was back to reading one of the best SciFi series to come out in very long time. Reading many of the other reviews now that I've completed the Wood Omnibus, I have to say, these folks are right in their assessments. I don't need to say how much of an avid reader I am or how I read all genres. However, I will say that I purchased this just a few days ago and now have finished, as I truly could not put it down. I also agree with what plenty of folks have said about the spelling/grammar of most Indie authors. This author did not put out a shoddy product. Makes for a much better read as the story flows right along.<br /><br />Love, love, love WOOL! I don't see a reason to change the name as was mentioned in a comment at the authors' blog. I'd also hate to see this author being edited to the point that the stories are cut short in any manner. Traditional publishing although not a thing of the past, may be relegated there if we keep seeing Indie authors like Hugh Howey. Enough has been said in previous reviews about the scope and character definition that I don't need to repeat.<br /><br />I see book 9 is in progress at the authors website (blog) but cannot find books 6-8. Amazon, where for art' Wool 6-7-8? I NEED these stories!<br /><br />If you are a SciFi fan - you will be intrigued by the scope of what this series presents and the possibilities of where it could go from here.  Read Wool at your own risk - It's ADDICTIVE!
B006INDTAQ|4.0|This film isn't as bad as some of the pro reviewers have written. Obviously this isn't the kind of film that must be taken seriously. If you approach it as an innocent diversion, it can prove to be - well, an innocent diversion.

B006ZCWU5K|2.0|Poor Bruce, he's clueless, his music has become almost as phony as his actions. He takes tax breaks meant for poor farmers by cultivating a garden on one microscopic acre of his vast and expensive estate, but thinks we'll believe he's a regular guy. He's delusional at best.  The album's production it slickly plastic and mechanical for the most part, as are the worn out failed ideas expressed in the albums lyrics. There are two or three bright spots, but in the lyrics of \\"We Take Care Of Our Own,\\" his use of the word `Calvary' is ignorant.  CALvary is the hill where Christ was crucified, `CAValry' are troops sent to the rescue.  If he was seeking to be ironic or profound, he only came off like a pretentious douche.  This cd is destined for the 99 cent bin at the record store , where it will join the last few albums he recorded. It's a shame, I had high hopes for this one.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is addictive and gets the heart pumping. It's hard to find something this much fun for only a dollar.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I held out for a long time on this series, thinking it would be more of the same. There's lots of Dystopian literature out there, how much better could this be? Boy, was I wrong. The thing that distinguishes this series is the writing. This is the Harry Potter of Dystopian lit. There's not one time that you don't feel completely invested in the characters, not once when you think &#34;He/she wouldn't have said that.&#34; You are IN the story the entire time, waiting to see what happens next. Thanking higher powers that you don't have to live in the world of the Hunger Games. Highly Recommended.

1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani points out that it is no easy task to put her profound experience into words. As one who has also had a near death experience, I wholeheartedly agree.  The same is true of her book.  Words simply cannot do justice to the peace and joy I feel from having read it.  Somehow, this book found its way to me at the exact time that I needed a reminder of how wonderful life can be and how incredible we all are. It is a powerful, inspiring message of love. Read Anita's story with an open heart and you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Thank you, Anita, for having the courage to share your story and thank you, Wayne Dyer, for helping to bring it to the public.
0937381888|5.0|We have an excellent brew store in the neighborhood. They give fine instruction - free - have good prices on equipment, and sell kits with step by step instructions that are practically brewing introductions. What don't they do? They don't come over and hang while we work each step of the brewing process. So I wanted a brewing reference.<br />This is the book I wanted. First, John Palmer really parses out the details on basic brewing with kits and extracts, specialty grains or grain brewing. It would be easy to pass on them as mundane, but I compare this book to Ben Hogan's Golf: Five Lessons. Both books recognize the importance of ALL of the mundane details that make up the basics of their craft.<br />For my needs this book will be returned to for any brewing I want to do. Right now I brew with extract kits and have used specialty grains and the recommended yeast packs. Next is to put together extract recipes and specialty grains myself. That will include experimenting with different yeasts.<br />If I ever want to culture yeasts, move on to grain brewing, or turn my garage into a brewery, this book will guide me. The reading is an articulate, highly capable  brewer discussing his craft with the aim of helping ANYBODY who wants to brew. The table of contents is clear, the book includes 8 appendices, a glossary, a section listing references, and a complete index.<br />I read reviews on every brewing book I could find. You may find a book that suits you better, but not one that is qualitatively better for the beginning to intermediate home brewer.

B000096H33|4.0|Being that my favourite film ever made is [[ASIN:B001992NW4 The Exorcist]], it didn't take me long to search out that haunting theme, first on [[ASIN:B00005AY1C Best of Tubular Bells]], and later found out about all the rerecordings (this one) and remasters / new mixes (i.e [[ASIN:B0026S1XDM Tubular Bells [2009 Deluxe Edition]]]). This one stands amongst my favourites of the takes on this classic piece; the original was always a bit quiet and murky, but being that this is recorded from scratch with new technology, it really jumps out - more punchy, more potent, and simply more beautiful. When I read that there was a DVD version included, that sealed the deal. Unfortunately, it isn't what you'd expect; a complete version on both CD and DVD-Audio, rather there's the complete CD and only one video plus the first three tracks on the DVD. However, don't let that discourage you too much. I just had a listen a moment ago, and what's here is really beautiful. You get the option of PCM Stereo, 5.1 Dolby Digital and 5.1 DTS. I picked the DTS-track, and it opens with that infamous piano, joined by organ and glockenspiel. The notes quickly start to dance around your head, and so does the accompanying bass line; a wonderful and sonically tickling experience, which is eventually racketed up even more when you segue into \\"Fast Guitars\\" and the cool glacier is replaced by a gorgeous tropical beach. You truly pick up on the subtleties of the music; the plucking of small strings, acoustics you weren't aware of, and the whole thing finally goes full blast as the scorching \\"Basses\\" kicks in, drowning both your television and your ears in an inferno of color. By that point I had a huge grin on my face, it's just all too sad that it ends there, but perhaps one day we'll see a complete version on DVD-A or Blu-ray Audio? I'd still very much recommend this album as a real tapestry of instrumentals, serving as both chillout moment and powerful rock and roll experience. Until then, you can enjoy the [[ASIN:B0026S1XDM newly remastered original version]] entirely in surround sound, I for one can hardly wait.joy the [[ASIN:B0026S1XDM newly remastered original version]] entirely in surround sound, I for one can hardly wait.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|I've been a Springsteen fan since the early 1980s and,as much as it pains me to say this, this is bad misstep for the Boss.  The lyrics are cliched, the music pedestrian and three of the better tracks (Land of Hope and Dreams, Wrecking Ball and American Land) have appeared before this on other releases/downloads.<br /><br />The most enjoyable new song is the opening track and even that sounds like it was written for a Chevy ad by a Springsteen imitator.<br /><br />I have a bad feeling that Bruce, as much as he might care for the working man, is too far removed from their troubles to write originally and effectively about them these days.  I think he needs to stop trying to remake the subject matter of his past output and come up with some new themes.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I've read hundreds of books and I have never felt the need or felt a book deserving of a review. But this book was amazing! I loved the character development and love story. It was such an amazing book that I read it 3 times in a one week! I've never re-read a book back to the back before, so that alone should state how amazing this book is! I recommend this to all hopeful romantics! Because it gave me hope to find such love in such a flawed relationship.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|A fun simple app where you can create interesting designs using the touch screen. I found myself making sound effects while I swirled around galaxies.<br /><br />My only request would definitely be a screenshot option to make this worth paying.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Let me start this off by leveling with you.  I don't come at this movie from the perspective of someone who knows nothing about the franchise.  You see, I've read virtually all of the Tintin comics, though I never saw the animated series.  I know these characters and what they're all about.<br /><br />Fortunately, fans of the comics won't need to suffer the disappointment of character derailment in this movie.  Every last character is spot-on.  Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thompson & Thompson...  It's all there.  If you read and enjoyed the comics, you'll find much of what you enjoyed in this film as well.<br /><br />I say \\"much,\\" because while a certain amount of excitement was also common in the comics, they were largely mystery-based, rather than action, and this film has very strong and almost-constant action and suspense elements to it, though its penchant for mystery, treasure-hunting and adventure remain as strong as in the comics it was based on.<br /><br />However, now it's time for the fanboy in me to take a back seat and explain some of what this film is actually about for those not familiar with the character of Tintin (who, it must be admitted, is something of a niche character outside of Europe.)<br /><br />Tintin, a young reporter and seeker of secrets and stories, buys a model ship in the marketplace one day, while he's out for a walk.  Immediately, two men try to buy it off him, but he doesn't sell, because he realizes something must be up with it.  A series of accidents, investigations and crimes lead him to uncover an old poem which seems to promise a great treasure to those who can unlock the secret of \\"the three unicorns sailing in company.\\"<br /><br />However, Tintin and his friends will need to fight for their lives, because another man; Saccharine is looking for the same treasure, and that's not all he's looking for.  He's willing to stop at nothing to get what he wants, even if it involves kidnapping, torture, thievery and murder.  Tintinis fast action, high adventure and a thrilling mystery all rolled into one.<br /><br />Now, specifically to those who've tried to claim that Tintin rips off Indiana Jones.  It would be more likely that the reverse was true, since Tintin comics were published from 1929 to 1976, and Raiders of the Lost Ark wasn't released until 1981.  However, it's almost universally recognized that what Indy really rips off is Allan Quatermain, so I won't make that claim.  Needless to say, if you think this film is a ripoff of Indy, you're simply wrong, and that's all there is to it.<br /><br />What this film is, is simply fun.  Good, clean fun with some nice action sequences and several very good chase scenes.  It's a well-done ride, and as icing on the cake, a bit of Catholic history comes up at one point during the movie.<br /><br />Herge himself (the comic's author) was Catholic, and writing for a Catholic publication, which only elevates my respect for the series, as you might imagine.  It's a great series, and a very good movie as well, and I think the main reason is that Stephen Speilburg and Peter Jackson seem to have realized that they just shouldn't mess with what obviously works.  Kudos to them for understanding this, and for their faithfulness to the source material.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone looking for good, clean fun, or anyone who likes a nice, hair-raising adventure.  There's guns and alcohol in it, but it's all treated appropriately, I think.  I don't even think kids would have too many problems with this movie, to be honest.  I know I didn't, and I hope many other Tintin fans will get as much out of it as I did.
B005SZEFH6|5.0|I purchased the book over 30 years ago and enjoyed it! Now I have it in digital format. But one other exception it's an expanded version. Very nice! Bruce's memory will never parish!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I have read perhaps a half dozen books written by former soldiers who served both in Iraq and Afghanistan and found this book to be one of the best. Written in first person it accounts for both the bravado and the fears of combat as well as the difficulties of being separated from family and friends and the pain of readjusting when returning to the \\"world.\\" I was impressed by his candid explanation of how he coped with his job as a top sniper and the credence he gave the importance and responsibility of his assignments. He was a true warrior in my opinion.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|It's obvious that the only thing Conan like, in this movie is the Name. Comics are fantasy, but not absurd. He spends over half the movie flirting with the ingenue, He's a Barbarian for gosh sakes, not some simpering swain. She dispatches bad guys with aplomb, and then spends 50 minutes screaming, in one dangerous situation after another. No matter where they are, ship, forest, or hovel, the (bad guys), are always there. The 1293 gory deaths are O.K.,but,too fast to follow, but the sets are neat. The 3-D effects were weird, the things that are supposed to come out of the screen, don't. I love 3-D, and I just hate see this kind of tripe, in this medium. It gives 3-D critics, fodder for their antipathy.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|A fantastic sequel! Pandemonium definitely lives up to its name, never a dull moment. I loved the \\"then\\" and \\"now\\" and how we experienced Lena's life simultaneously. And oh, what an ending! Wonderfully done!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This game was actually pretty good. I must say there was alot more excitement in this game than in the first free angry birds game. worth buying.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|Praise to Sinead O'Connor for making another CD that ignites various emotions in a person. There's something magical and soothing to this CD and also those in her back catalog. I strongly recommend you to buy this CD, you won't regret it! Forget the mess you see in the press, the music is what matters. It's a shame for someone to miss out on this beautiful music because they've tagged the artist as this or that. Her voice is in fine form and you'll want to listen again and again.

B0054JELS4|5.0|NCIS is an amazing television experience. Mark Harmon is a revelation as Gibbs, the supporting cast is an ansemble of very good actors who compliment each other in the most dramatic, sometimes quirky, sometimes hilarious ways. David McCallum is still sexy while having an acidic, tonque in cheek sense of humor. My only quibble with the cast is Tony DiNozzo (as protrayed by Michael Weatherly). He can be annoying on his best day and needs to grow up. JMHO. Still, it's worth the price to get all eight seasons all at once.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|ABSOLUTELY. LOVED. THIS. BOOK. Adorable, adorable, adorable. I simply devoured it like a fresh baked croissant. I couldn't sleep, didn't care if I ate, and I even dreamed about it. The characters and story pulled me in and Paris was the perfect setting.

B005VTS4EY|4.0|The game play is fun and intuitive.  I love the faces and sounds when you will a level.  However, music would be nice and when you go to select a level, it would be nice to jump to the level you are on rather than starting on the first screen.  However, when you choose play game it puts you in the level you were last in.

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Enjoyable action game, enhanced with a story and modern (yet Retro) graphics. Weapon upgrades add to re-play value. The ambient music is nice too. One of my favorite games on my android tablet.
B003UESJEM|4.0|I suppose the idea that corporate greed should be interesting, and in the case of \\"The Company Men\\" (and also \\"Margin Call\\"), some great characters are on hand to expose it all. I enjoyed both films, due to fine acting, writing and direction. Indeed, Ben Affleck carries the film well, with very able support from the always reliable Tommy Lee Jones. There's a little more integrity in this film than in its subsequent co-film, and there's more back story about the characters.<br /><br />Still, it was hard to wrap my head around the idea that these poor put-upon millionaires couldn't manage their finances. I know a lot of people who lost their jobs unfairly, and their story will always hit a more personal nerve than any film about privileged money-mongers.<br /><br />Still, I admire the achievements of the film-makers.
B004ZNAXX2|3.0|This set is not like the previous immersion sets.  No surround or super high fidelity stuff.  Just the same The Wall and The Wall Live discs, remastered to Roger Waters' high standards.  Which is great.  But for this kind of money, one would expect some new recordings of these songs.  Discs 5 & 6 are filled with mostly snippets of the raw, unpolished \\"demos\\" that were the basis for the songs we all recognize.  Honestly, they suck, and I can't, for the life of me, understand why Mr. Waters would even want us to hear them.  Here is an opportunity for him to share with his fans some of the miles and miles of tape he has from all the concerts Pink Floyd performed.  But no, not even one song!  If you are looking for something new, don't look here.  If you want the remastered versions of these two albumns, then, by all means, buy it.  Come on Roger, share a little!
B002BSHWUU|4.0|As a long time fan, I waited with great anticipation for this release, but I was quite disappointed. I can only detect an improvement on a few songs.  One example is \\"Get Back\\" from Past Masters 2. It sounds a good deal crisper than the original Past Masters version.<br /> These classic albums should have been remixed. Just listen to the songs from \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" and then listen to the same tunes in this box set. Need I say more?<br /> However, I must admit, the packaging is first rate all the way.<br /> I guess in a few more years, the catalog will be remixed and we can all cough up more money for it.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|This is really gorgeous cover and it looks quite well made, my Kindle Fire slipped right in with no problems so I can't confirm other reviewers issues about it being a tight fit.  It feels like my Fire is held very securely however and I don't foresee any issues with it falling out barring normal product aging.  I do have an issue with the gold accenting however, I knew that it would be cheap and probably rub off eventually but when I received my cover I was really disappointed to see that almost all of the detailing is worn.  Not sure yet whether I'll be requesting a replacement since it took two weeks to get my first one.  As for the complaints about the cover not sitting flush with the kindle, that's obviously just a need to break it in.  I imagine that after a week or two of use it will loosen up and sit perfectly but even now it's not enough of an issue to really bother me, in fact I probably wouldn't have noticed or cared if others hadn't mentioned it.  All in all it's a nice cover, I'm just really disappointed about the gold accents.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is concise, quick to load, and more complete than others I've tried. it is just right for a fast update before heading out.

0553386794|5.0|This book was described to me as being Lord of the Rings meets The Godfather. True enough. It is all the subtle beauty of the epic fantasy of Lord of the Rings, with the engaging and fascinating intrigue, family politics, and the conflicts between love, duty, and honor of The Godfather. But I'd also toss in that it also contains a Dickensian/Harry Potteresque cast of fascinating, brilliant, real, characters--torn, tragic, corrupt, evil, noble, beautiful, ugly, warped, innocent, pathetic, hilarious, sympathetic, and horrific--that pull the reader into the story because they either love them or love to hate them. Game of Thrones is an utterly brilliant, and tragically rare, fantasy novel that is the perfect combination of engaging, surprising, and intricate storytelling and fascinating characters. The term \\"page turner\\" is overly used, but, here, apt as all hell. Grade: A
B0063GORYU|5.0|can easily waste hours playing this game, its fun &amp; addicting! looks and works pretty much the same as the iPhone version.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is made of games that are challenging enough to not get on my nerves.  The games are actually somewhat relaxing , especially after a long day of irritation.

0142410705|4.0|Colin is a child prodigy who will never be anything but a smarty pants when he's dumped by his nineteenth girlfriend named Katherine. Hit hard, he embarks on a road trip with his best friend, overweight, cool and not socially-retarded Hassan. They make it all the way to Gunshot, TN, a small town where they find work recording the stories of the elderly residents and hanging with Lindsey, a girl who has made it her life work to be popular. As Colin works on his genius mathematical theorem of relationships (in relation to being dumped), he naturally begins to see what really matters. A brilliant, thought-provoking, heart-wrenching (because it's so tragically true for all of us) novel about intelligence and the heart that unravels it all, a novel about human nature and the human heart, whether you're sixteen or sixty. Not as great as John Green's The Fault in Our Stars, but, still, a brilliant, intelligent, clever, refreshing, hilarious, pensive, beautiful novel that transcends the audience it was written for. Grade: A-
B005VTS4EY|1.0|Looks like a fun game, but it doesn't work on my phone. Instantly force closes every time despite the appstore saying its compatible with it. Huawei Ascend II.<br /><br />Been having this happen a lot recently. What's going on with incompatible apps not being marked as such?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled across this book and decided to give it a shot because it sounded interesting.  It is a spectacular book.  I have never written a review before, but this book compelled me to.  I highly recommend it.  I hope the author will write more books set in the Sllos.  I now plan to read his other works.  Buy this book!
B0073LWEXK|2.0|I like puzzle games, but I really didn't get this one. It didn't come with any type of instruction. Normally I would feel like I was cheating by reading the hints, but even after reading them it was just barely giving you anything to go by and nothing useful.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|ADD ME YOYOLILD FOR ALL OF THE STORIES! Love this game and all of the other team lava games! yay

0142413828|4.0|My daughter has just finished reading Esio trot to me. She thoroughly enjoyed the story and was just disappointed in all the extras at the end which made the book seem larger than it was. She read it in a couple of sittings as there are lots of pictures and not too many pages of story. She is now onto longer Roald Dahl stories.<br /><br />Suitable for age 5-8.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this app is the best same with nigtclub story if I can I would rate restaurant story 500 stars so get this app
B005XOPEOU|3.0|I bought this album when it became available for a quarter, I really like some of the songs on the album and how they are reinventing their sound, esp. with Princess of China. But the quality of the audio is really poor as some previous comments have noted. I am not sure if it is because it's encoded at a lower bit rate, but playing it through my receiver makes it sound really flat. The audio on youtube sounds better, to be honest. But I guess for a quarter, you can't really complain.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This is a very fun game.  the controls are easy to figure out.  Easy to earn power ups and the graphics are good.  My 3 year old likes watching the squirrel eat nuts.

B005CYLSW8|5.0|Riccardo Chailly and his fabulous players from Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra issued recently this appealing box set comprising 5 CDs devoted to the complete cycle of Beethoven symphonies & overtures. It is not only the astounding artistic achievement that shines throughout the proceedings, but also the sound quality of the recording that enraptures the listener from the first bar of the First Symphony up to the last bar of the last overture. Well balanced, minutely weight, firmly articulated by the conductor's authoritative vision, the result seems simply marvelous in musical terms. It could stay on equal footing with the most celebrated versions of the past (signed by legendary figures of the baton such as Toscanini, Karajan, Bruno Walter, Klemperer, Bernstein, Wand, Claudio Abbado, Muti, Barenboim), but with a plus of fresh inspiration and seductive sound-mastering. I am not hesitating in considering that this Chailly-Beethoven set will prove itself as a landmark signature in the recorded catalog.<br /><br />All in all a lovely present for the Beethoven fans, a fabulous traversal of symphonies & overtures from a new illuminating perspective!
B003QSMC18|5.0|I've waited my whole life to see a wonderful multi-ethnic princess story with an original twist.  This movie is funny, positive, filled with love, personal growth, morals and a happy ending.  What more do you want?  Thank You Disney!

B005PK1G76|5.0|Hi,  This was exactly what I needed for both of my baby joggers.  It fit perfectly and held everything I needed.  I have the baby jogger city mini and the city elite.  It worked like a charm and held my keys, phone, life factory bottles, diapers, and wipes.  Hangs upright and has a wire frame on top to keep everything steady.  I love it.  AND THE PRICE CANNOT BE BEAT.

B00005N6KG|3.0|The product is shipped from a company called Limited Goods.  Due to a postal mix-up, it was lost in transit for a bit.  A very helpful gentleman named Nathan e-mailed me first to check on the delivery then followed-up with me every step of the way to ensure I received it to the point of offering to ship me another one.  It arrived and all was well.  The company was VERY gracious and the experience was quite positive.<br /><br />As for the headphones themselves, I agree with other reviewers that the sound quality is excellent and truly surprising considering the reasonable price.  I've always trusted Sony products and this was no exception.  It is also super lightweight with comfortable ear pieces which really attracted me to it in the first place.<br /><br />My problem with it is, try as I may, I just can't get the offbeat shape/design of it to fit to my head or in my ears.  Due to other reviewers not having issues with it I can only conclude that this particular shape/style just isn't for me and I'll choose a different headphone in the Sony family.  This made it hard to review the product since it works beautifully but the shape of it won't work for everyone.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Bought the game based on the reviews.  Only worked the easy level so far. The game is very good.  Like others said, it's kind of mindless but it's a lot of fun just knocking the puck around. Good for just passing time.  The graphics are good enough and I didn't experience much lag.  I'm playing the game on a Kindle Fire.  Colors and all are excellent.  I'm rating this 5 star because of the functionality and ease to use.  I recommend it as I have a 4 year old in the family and he can play it without much problem. Other games are too difficult to learn for the kids and they are a reason I purchased the game as well.  Sure it is easy on the first level but still pretty cool.  I'm happy with it for it's purpose.
B0052U59F4|3.0|I have just finished this book. I must say it took me much longer than any other, ever. At times I was disgusted, but for some reason I had to finish it. I had no idea when I began reading that this was about bdsm. I have read all sorts of books and have a very open mind, after all reading is all about imagination and fantasy. I do have to say I am glad I was able borrow the book for free with my prime membership, as I may have been upset if I had paid for it.<br />The writing itself was fine, better than many books I have read from established authors. Particularly I enjoyed the emails back and forth between Ana and Christian.<br />It just seems so hard to believe. A beautiful, thin, intelligent 21 year old virgin? I guess it's not impossible, just extremely unlikely. A gorgeous, extremely wealthy man will to lavish her with gifts? I must remind myself-that many women fantasize about that. Who wouldn't want a laptop, car, blackberry, first class plane tickets? Still, it was a little hard to swallow (well, not so hard for Ana to swallow).<br />This experience in real life - it could really screw someone up in the head.<br />The ending was good. We have all experienced the pain of first love and author James did well describing the anguish, the second guessing of choices we make as we are getting to know ourself. Not good enough that I will read the other books in this series-not any time soon anyway. I know many people love this series and in some ways I can understand why. Maybe my own life experiences have clouded my view. Just an opinion.

B007D2XSW0|3.0|App does virtually any type of transform needed when working on pica.  I did find that the controls have a few glitches.  For example,  when I tried to use the rotate transform, the only choices that appeared were ACCEPT or CANCEL.  Only by blindly tapping the blank bar above this did I find the actual rotational choices.  Some of the menu choices are a 'little' vague.  (To save your file, tap SAVE,  then&hellip;  what?)  Only by trial and error did I find that you need to tap camera?!  Make the menus MORE detailed and this will be a five star app.

0062060554|4.0|This book definitely kept you on the edge of your seat.  I felt frustrated for the poor woman with no memory.  I cannot imagine starting each and every day over as if it is your first day.  As it went on it became more and more interesting as she began to find herself, even though it was like starting over every day.  I had my suspicions about what had happened to her, but I was wrong!
0439023483|5.0|It all begins with the drop of a hand and the selection of a name. Primrose Everdeen is the name that is called as the crowd falls silent. Primrose Everdeen is the innocent girl everyone loves, and at only twelve years of age, it is a shame she is the one who has been selected to compete in the annual Hunger Games where the prize for winning is the promise of a great life, and the price of losing is an unfortunate death at the hands of another tribute from another district. This news does not sit right with older sister Katniss, who, in a heat of the moment, uses her voice and volunteers herself instead. Suddenly she and boy tribute Peeta Mellark are thrust into a new world, fed foods of the luxurious kind, polished, and treated as royalty as they are transported to the Capitol where they will train until the countdown runs down and the Games begin. Then the bloodshed begins, as all twenty-four tributes have to face the wrath of nature and man until one tribute remains standing as victor.<br /><br />In what is, quite possibly, one of the rawest, goriest novels I've read, Suzanne Collins has created a fantastic dystopian world with an interesting premise, and amazing execution. It includes a romance, that even though it isn't the main focus of the story, is great enough for me to enjoy. All of the characters were unique in each of their ways, and the descriptions and character building were sublime. Now I know why people love this series so much and I am glad I bought the box set of all three two years ago. Had I known such awesomeness was sitting on my shelf all of this time, I would have picked it up sooner. After reading, I am DEFINITELY Team Peeta ;)
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I dragged two friends to see Footloose with Kevin Bacon when it premiered in Seattle.  They didn't care very much for the film.  I, on the other hand, loved it.  I had never heard of Kevin Bacon, but I became and instant fan.  I have watched everything he has done, right down to the episodes of The Closer that he directed.<br /><br />I own 6 DVDs of Hamlet.  Should I say that since Laurence Olivier filmed Hamlet there is now no room for anyone else to do so?  Are David Tennant, Derek Jacobi and Christopher Plummer to be seen as \\"upstart crows\\" who have nothing new to add?  I mean, Olivier!  How do you top that?  Or could we see Tennant and Jacobi and Plummer as actors with a different interpretation?<br /><br />And, could we not look at the remake of Footloose as a different interpretation rather than seeing it as a replacement?  I loved Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer.  But, I was a Kenny Warmold fan from the moment I saw him in Center Stage: Step It Up.  As Ren MacCormack he shines, for me, as innocence and determination combined.  And Julianne Hough -- what a revelation !!  I mean, we knew she could dance.  But, as an actress, she blew me away !!!  And what a find in Miles Teller.  He was hip, cool, and funny all at the same time.<br /><br />I don't see this rendition of Footloose as a would-be replacement of the original.  I see it as a new interpretation of a story that will never grow old.  And, as such, I welcome it, I embrace it, and I commend it.<br /><br />Two great versions of the same story!!  Who could ask for anything more?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good but I would put in better instrukens but it was good without putting. in stupid games like some games .!!!:)<br /><br />:)

030746363X|5.0|I have struggled with my weight my whole life. (30yrs male)<br /><br />I was introduced to this book in November 2011 from a friend of mine that has been loosely following it for a year now. At that time I picked up the book and loosely followed the \\"slow card diet\\". I was 225 pounds at the time. From November 2011 to January 2012 I lost 15 pounds. Starting in February I started following the book more strictly and adding the supplements, I am now down to 205 roughly (March 10).  I work out twice a week Tuesday upper body strength training, and Thursdays lower body strength training (1 hr - more time socializing with friends then working out).  I have never looked or felt better. I even partake in the free day, last Saturday I ate a box of doughnuts for breakfast and the $10 Pizza Hut dinner box for dinner. I have suggested this book to a number of people I work with within the last month they have been seeing great results also. I do have to add that it took a good month to see or feel results, But I think it was because at first I wasn't following the diet as closely as he suggest.
B007H51DQG|1.0|I've bought season one and season two so far but I'm done. Season one was great. Season two sucks. It's almost like they didn't expect the series to get past season one and they didn't have any scripts written. No plot. Like everyone else, I say it's time to get off that damn farm, go back to the storyline from season one, on the road and fighting for survival. Season two is boring and I'm sick to death of the love triangle stuff. I feel like I'm watching a Lifetime Channel movie. Maybe the writers don't get it, but i see this as mostly a series for guys. Most women I've talked to about the series hear \\"zombie\\" and immediately lose interest. Now, with the ol' McDonald's farm setting, no action, no plot, and the love triangle b.s. taking over the show, i think they're losing their core audience. I know they lost me. I may check out the first episode of season three and see if it gets any better. If there is a season three. In the meantime, for me, it's back to the Resident Evil and George Romero series for my zombie fix.
0439813786|5.0|This book was wonderful to read, for people of all ages!!!!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is one of those rare finds which completely pulled me into a new reality.  I could not stop reading, and had to force myself to eat and go to sleep.  This series is so powerful that when I finished I found myself reflecting on the story and the issues raised in these books. I was unwilling to start reading anything new without taking days to process the many ideas and images from these books. Reading the trilogy as a complete story made the story lines more powerful for me.  I felt the last book which has been the subject of many mixed reviews brought home the message that people are changed by their experiences of violence and war.  This series raised questions on what the costs of violence are for individuals and societies and what are happens when each line is crossed to win a conflict.  We expect happily ever after endings and instead get something that feels much more real.  Hopefully high school English teachers around the country will be engaged in profound conversations with their students with these books as a a starting point.  What are the costs of war and when is it worth it?  I noticed that even when reviewers hated the last book they would write passionate page after page on the subject, which demonstates just how deeply the reader had been affected.

0670022950|3.0|This very ambitious and sprawling book is a serious effort to argue for and explain the progressive decline in interpersonal violence in human societies.  The book is divided into 2 parts.  The first part is an effort to describe a broad sweep of human history from prehistoric societies to the present, arguing for a progressive though intermittant decline in violence in human societies.  The second part is an effort to understand the underpinings of the decline in violence in terms of human psychological processes.<br /><br />Pinker's sequence of the decline in violence is based on synthesis of a large volume of literature generated by archaeologists, ethnologists, historians, sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists.  Pre-state societies, while low in absolute population and absolute number of violent acts, had very high per capita levels of violence.  The emergence of states resulted in some decline in violence and the gradual strengthening of the state resulted in a progressive decline in interpersonal violence, even as states became more capable of waging war.  This is best documented in Europe from the Middle Ages to the present.  Pinker highlights a number of important parallel processes.  The \\"Civilizing Process\\" described by the great historical sociologist Norbert Elias of the increasing importance of self-control, manners, and social amity from the Renaissance onwards is prominently featured as a key feature in the decline of violence.  Similarly, Pinker emphasizes the humanitarianism of the Enlightenment and subsequent reform movements.  In the 20th century, the \\"Rights Revolution\\" that has brought widespread acceptance of religious and ethnic minorities, women, and homosexuals, is also discussed as improving our societies.  Pinker makes the important point that while the 20th century saw great violence with the tremendous crimes committed by totalitarian states and the huge casulties of WWI and WWII, on a per capita basis, there is continued decline which has accelerated in the post-WWII era.<br /><br />All of these phenomena are generally well known to historians and many social scientists. Pinker deserves considerable credit for bringing them before the broad reading public and for synthesizing them into one broad arc.  That said, Pinker's presentation and discussion of these topics is uneven.  In general, Pinker does better when drawing on political science and other social science literature.  His discussion of the democratic peace phenomenon, for example, is quite good.  His discussions of historical topics often leads a good deal to be desired.  Treating the admirable Barbara Tuchman as an authoritative source on late Medieval Europe when there is a lot of excellent secondary literature seems a bit lazy.  Referring to Napoleonic France as the first fascist state is very misleading about both France in this period and 20th century fascism.  I share Pinker's enthusiasm for Enlightenment reformism but his schematic version of the Enlightenment is a distortion of this rich historical phenomenon.  Pinker also overlooks an important complication of his primary story.  All of his discussion of the decline in violence from the Middle Ages onward, the Civilizing Process, Enlightenment Humanitarianism, etc., is based on European examples.  But this is the same period during which European expansion results in the victimization of the pitiful remnant of the native peoples of the Western Hemisphere, Australia, and the Pacific.  It is also largely the period of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, which probably caused a marked increase in violence in sub-Saharan Africa.  These phenomena were accompanied and followed by considerable imperialist-colonial depredations, some of which had marked destabilizing effects.  One of the most traumatic events of the 19th century was the Taiping Rebellion, which caused tens of millions of deaths in China.  The Taiping revolt was partly a result of the destabilization of the Qing regime by European colonialism.  None of this means that Pinker is wrong about the overall story but its a much more complicated evolution than he suggests.<br /><br />In the final part of the book, Pinker discusses the possible mechanisms of the decline in violence.  This is largely a discussion of possibly relevant psychological processes.  Pinker discusses psychological processes that would favor violence and other processes that would reduce violence. As with the descriptive part of the book, this is an effort to synthesize a lot of prior literature, notably social psychology literature.  Pinker develops an interesting model in which some psychological mechanisms could interact in virtuous circles to enhance personal restraint, sympathy with others, and improve sociability.  This is somewhat speculative but plausible.  In one case, Pinker offers an interesting specific hypothesis that the decline in violence and increase in social tolerance we've experienced in the past decades is due to the Flynn effect, an apparent increase in certain aspects of intelligence across the 20th century.  Also as with the first section of the book, these discussions are uneven.  Pinker does better when discussing social psychology literature.  As someone who is involved in neurobiology research, I found his efforts at including brain mechanisms overly simple.  Given his reliance on social psychology studies for many of his most important analyses, the gestures at neurobiology add little to his overall presentation.<br /><br />Another deficiency of this book is Pinker's style of argumentation.  On a paragraph by paragraph basis, Pinker is a clear and often engaging writer.  Some sections could be confusing because of a tendency to abruptly reverse directions.  In a section on the decline in crime in recent decades, he expands at some length on the effects of increased incarceration rates.  He then abruptly changes course and attacks this idea.  Without careful reading, it would be possible to take very different conclusions away from this discussion.  Similarly, he has a discussion of so-called power law relationships in which he suggests the presence of apparent power law curves suggests a uniform process.  He later suggests that dual processes could underly a power law curve and, in fact, the existence of a an apparent power law curve tell you nothing about whether a single or multiple processes underlies the phenomenon under study.  Pinker also has a tendency to punctuate his analyses with opinionated asides that may or may not be relevant or valid.  The purportedly destructive effects of the 1960s counterculture seems to be a idee fixe.<br /><br />This book would have benefited from a major revision prior to publication, some shortening, and a lot more historical research.ng regime by European colonialism.  None of this means that Pinker is wrong about the overall story but its a much more complicated evolution than he suggests.<br /><br />In the final part of the book, Pinker discusses the possible mechanisms of the decline in violence.  This is largely a discussion of possibly relevant psychological processes.  Pinker discusses psychological processes that would favor violence and other processes that would reduce violence. As with the descriptive part of the book, this is an effort to synthesize a lot of prior literature, notably social psychology literature.  Pinker develops an interesting model in which some psychological mechanisms could interact in virtuous circles to enhance personal restraint, sympathy with others, and improve sociability.  This is somewhat speculative but plausible.  In one case, Pinker offers an interesting specific hypothesis that the decline in violence and increase in social tolerance we've experienced in the past decades is due to the Flynn effect, an apparent increase in certain aspects of intelligence across the 20th century.  Also as with the first section of the book, these discussions are uneven.  Pinker does better when discussing social psychology literature.  As someone who is involved in neurobiology research, I found his efforts at including brain mechanisms overly simple.  Given his reliance on social psychology studies for many of his most important analyses, the gestures at neurobiology add little to his overall presentation.<br /><br />Another deficiency of this book is Pinker's style of argumentation.  On a paragraph by paragraph basis, Pinker is a clear and often engaging writer.  Some sections could be confusing because of a tendency to abruptly reverse directions.  In a section on the decline in crime in recent decades, he expands at some length on the effects of increased incarceration rates.  He then abruptly changes course and attacks this idea.  Without careful reading, it would be possible to take very different conclusions away from this discussion.  Similarly, he has a discussion of so-called power law relationships in which he suggests the presence of apparent power law curves suggests a uniform process.  He later suggests that dual processes could underly a power law curve and, in fact, the existence of a an apparent power law curve tell you nothing about whether a single or multiple processes underlies the phenomenon under study.  Pinker also has a tendency to punctuate his analyses with opinionated asides that may or may not be relevant or valid.  The purportedly destructive effects of the 1960s counterculture seems to be a idee fixe.<br /><br />This book would have benefited from a major revision prior to publication, some shortening, and a lot more historical research.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|I first read \\"A Princess of Mars\\" in third grade, in 1951.  I loved this character, and the following books just as much.  This film is a weird combination of the first and second book.  For instance, the Therns were not introduced until the second book, \\"The Gods of Mars\\", but they are introduced here, not as the religious leaders but as the villains and very technologically advanced.  However, after seeming to pan the film, I do have to admit that it definitely had the \\"feel\\" of a Burroughs book.  I'm still not sure whether the changes made it better or worse.  The acting was really quite good, the special effects are uniformly excellent and the story, while not \\"true\\" to Burroughs, had enough of his ideas that it was very entertaining.  So, if you are a fan of Burroughs like me, it is somewhat disappointing, but the good points do outweigh the bad.  I would really give this 3 1/2 stars but Amazon won't let me do half stars, so I guess 4 will do.
B002KKCVS2|1.0|My husband had a pair that were very old. They were very durable hence he had them for at least 10 years. The Teva's now are not the same, my husband hates them and said they don't come close to how they were made before.
B004V6X90W|1.0|I am a huge Jim Carrey Fan,but sometimes he comes out with Flops and some disturbing stuff,The Part I like is with The Vette'. but then to see it Trashed?No.The subject matter is gross,repulsing and disturbing.One of those weird-let's make a statement about society movies that I would pass on.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|N. Sparks writes these emotionally over the top books that are portrayed in emotionally over the top movies...and I love that!! The movie did the book justice and I loved the cast.<br />Only problem was that the quality was HORRID!! I have fast internet so I was confused as of to why it was so blurry. Amazon changed rules so I could no longer download movies that I purchased if I don't have certain devices from them. I think that's dumb and it's made me purchase less movies from them. If I'm in a waiting room or on a trip I don't have internet (esp good enough to load a movie) to watch it online.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|We bought this set because my daughter recieved two of the very small Friends Lego sets for her birthday and she wanted the house.  The Friends house was way more than I wanted to spend.  So we opened this box in the store to compare the door sizes to the Friends house doors and they are the exact same size.  So now my daughter can build a small house and other items for her two Friends she received for her birthday.  This is a nice set but a bit small.  I am considering buying another box or finding another pink lego set.  I am glad we purchased this set, no regrets!
B007G5FX4K|2.0|If any other artist released a song like this i.e. Britney, Rihanna, Gaga etc everyone would hate it, but since Madonna has such a large fan base, and justifiably so, they seem to be desperate for her to make a comeback. Before you say my review isn't \\"helpful\\" I'll go through why I don't like the song:<br />1. The vocal is lifeless and dull. She sounds like she'd rather be somewhere else, and it doesn't have any impact on the listener, while in songs like \\"S&M\\" by Rihanna, there is a heavy beat in the background and her sassy vocal gives the song more power and makes you want to keep listening to it.<br />2. The vocal production is mediocre. Even though her vocals were dull, they could have easily made it better with compression and AVOX punch etc, and therefore make it sound more powerful and have a bigger impact on the listener.<br />3. The lyrics are VERY cliché. It sounds like she's trying to be like every modern pop artist out there, and it doesn't work.<br />4. Many people are saying this is a \\"club banger\\", but no-one would EVER play this in a club. The instrumental is mediocre, but the vocals are so distracting that I find it hard to believe that anyone would dance to it, unlike a song produced by David Guetta or Calvin Harris - for example Titanium or We Found Love.<br /><br />I'd even go as far as saying that I prefer \\"Give me all your Luvin'\\". If she wanted to make a song that would top the charts, then she should work with a popular producer like (as I said before) David Guetta or Calvin Harris.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I love a good thinking game.<br /><br />This one starts off really easy.  You simply click a blue block and it disappears - letting the red blocks on top of it fall away and disappear.  The green ones stay safe.  As the levels progress, it gets significantly harder, requiring more thought and better timing to get rid of all the red blocks and keep the green ones. It's just like red remover if you've played that, but looks a bit more graphically polished on my kindle fire.<br /><br />If you like skill and thought based games - give this one a try.  It's worth checking out.
1400064287|4.0|How many ads do you remember from last super bowl? Few you could recall, do you know why you remember those? This book not only consolidates the thinking process behind that recall but goes beyond. Written in simple, anecdotal and common-sensical way, it reminds us most basic things we forget in our day to day communication.<br />It summarizes qualities of an effective communication in acronym, SUCCES.<br />S = SIMPLICITY<br />U = UNEXPECTEDNESS<br />C = CONCRETENESS<br />C = CREDIBILITY<br />E = EMOTIONS<br />S = STORIES<br />The part ,most revealing to me was about Curse of knowledge, which explains why ignorance is bliss (sometimes) & De Bono's thinking hats works so effectively.<br />Overall a great read & I would recommend it.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|this is a fun game and you really have to think. i play this everyday and it never gets boring............it is very addicting! :))

B000RZGFYS|5.0|Slayer definitely had shock value back in the early 80's when much of their subject matter was taboo. I saw them in concert back in 1985 and by word of mouth I bought Reign In Blood when it was released in late 1986... talk about shocking, when I first popped this album on the turntable back then... it punched me right between the eyes from start to finish. A sonic blast of mayhem that made Metallica seem tame at the time. Lyrical content that made Tipper Gore cringe with demand for more stickers & regulation on artists.<br /><br />While bands like Metallica and Anthrax started going main stream and soft back then, Slayer was always that little secret that only true hardcore head-bangers knew about and understood. That underground band you can always count on for a good backhanding of intense music. I believe that still holds true today for hardcore medal fans young and old.<br /><br />Reign In Blood will always be Slayer's masterpiece. I feel it's their best recording as far as sound quality and production. The guitars sound absolutely wicked on this one and the bass & drums are thunderous! They would literally shake my furniture into different directions with my old AR speakers back then. A great revenge album for those pesky neighbors. Though I think the vinyl version of this album sounds a bit fatter and warmer than the CD version.... but It will still blacken both your eyes when listened to at high volumes.<br /><br />Slayer's Reign In Blood is solid and stood the test of time!!
B000OEZ88G|5.0|Strangely, but quite understandably, reading of this book was constantly reminding me of the writings of Deepak Chopra and his laws of orderliness and entropy. As with personal success, this book solidly puts together that organizational success can only be achieved when it has a higher purpose of existence, a missionary's zeal, long term vision & capability to execute that vision, withstanding the test of times. In short, here again, success is an inside out phenomenon. It does not matter what world thinks about you, as long as you know what you are doing. Case in point is legendary Phillip Morris.<br />The book is definably more interesting read than \\"Good to Great\\", which I found more of scholarly (read dry).<br />My favorite chapter is one on Time Teller v/s Clock Builder. Though time tellers grab all headlines, it's the clock builders who build ageless institutions. To emphasize, the authors gave example of founding fathers of America, who chose supremacy of a cluster of democratic institutions rather than relying on good king model of Europe. Another one, worth mentioning is \\"preserve the core and stimulate the progress\\" mantra, which summarizes an evolution model in its own way. The concept of \\"Genius of AND\\" also struck chord with my thinking. While dealing with complexities of world, human mind (organizations as well) prefers EITHER-OR logic, in reality most of the times, AND is a definite possibility & often results in greater good.<br />The book also tries to analyze the difference between being daring and foolhardiness (chapter on Big Hairy Audacious Goals). However, with its rear view mirror vision and success bias, it generates skepticism and leaves readers only half full.<br />Overall a definite business classic, with good case studies and compelling reasoning.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|If you have angry birds, where's my water, or anything similar then you will enjoy this too. Some have said it's too hard and they wish there was an option to skip levels. A hint would be nice sometimes but to skip it all together is kinda lazy. Apply yourself and you might feel something called pride in yourself for your accomplishment. Have a great day all!
B007D5DUBG|5.0|I love The Pretty Reckless.  When a lot of people knew about Taylor's band because she was on Gossip Girl I learned that Taylor had been on Gossip Girl through loving Taylor's music.  I saw them about a year ago live and it was incredibly awesome, they were much better live than I even anticipated!  And there are not a whole lot of bands you can say that about.  I just bought tickets recently to see them again in May on their tour with Marilyn Manson and can't wait!  I hope that they play these new songs and obviously other favorites.  ;D
B001N1DPDE|5.0|it would be real had to add to what other reviewers have said. I have wanted this knife for a long time and finally got it. it is everything I thought it would be. sheath is good but belt loop sucks but all you need to do is search \\"bk2 sheth modifications\\" and you will be overloaded with ideas on how to modify this thing. same with the knife. the bk2 is one of the best knives out there for the price point if your looking for this type of knife. I have 2 [[ASIN:B0033H7VI6 Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife with Fixed 1095 High Carbon Steel Blade and Black Kraton Handle and Sheath]] and when I head to the great outdoors it is hard choosing which one to bring. hope this helps.
055338466X|3.0|When this book was first published couple of years back, I remember WSJ ran a special, full of rave reviews and extensive commentaries by religious zealots, atheists and scientists on this controversial topic of benevolent god and humans as intelligence designs.<br />While the topic is highly interesting, this book is no leisure read. At my best I could comprehend only 30-40% of the content. Nevertheless intellectual depth of the author unquestionable and even at the 30% level, you get a pretty decent idea of current day cosmology and physics and their evolution.<br />Suggestion for average reader like me: Like any great work, this book can be read at multiple levels, satisfying to different degree of intellectual curiosity. Don't bother yourself with remembering all scientific mumbo-jumbo or space-time calculations, but rather focus on author's core message and its relation with religion, scientific theories, facts & human evolution. Then you will enjoy the book.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Good game, but not very hard. Beat it in a short amount of time. Worth 99 cents. Minus 1 star for permissions.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Just saw this last night (early screening), and though I went in with doubt, it was wonderful! There were just 200 people in the screening, but from how much and loudly we all laughed, it could have been far more.  Applause at the end was well-deserved. It may weaken my review, but I'm trying so, so hard to avoid spoilers... There are moments everyone deserves to see with fresh eyes, not knowing what will happen.<br /><br />It builds... you meet the characters, get little insights into their lives, and then, there it is, a whole world of reasons to laugh, as people are put in positions where they have little choice but to pursue the sheikh's desire to fish in the desert... and face personal decisions about love, and love of life...<br /><br />Honestly, as 'distant' from my life as the premise may seem, it's utterly relatable to my general experience with corporations and government, yet removed enough to be pure fun, to just laugh at, and feel a warmth for the characters who are (rightly) frustrated, yet make the best of each situation.<br /><br />It's humor in words and meanings, in situations... Overall, the film is uplifting and good, something we could all use more of.<br /><br />I've added this movie to my wish list and am eager to own it so that I can watch it for laughs and for when I just want to feel better. Between now and the DVD, I look forward to paying to see it in the theater, because it's a movie I'll be proud to support, and grateful to see again.
B005XOPEOU|2.0|Honestly don't like the direction Coldplay is going with this album.<br /><br />it's overproduced and a bland.<br /><br />While i enjoy artists that think out of the box - this album is just safe as a pillow.

Love every songs in this album.<br />I feels wonderful every time when hear the intro of the song 'Don't know why'. This song can create special atmosphere, beautiful warm and happiness.<br />Other songs in this album also be in the same class.<br />I do love other album of Norah Jones but this album is one of the best album for me in the past decade.
B007IQX1G4|4.0|This is a great movie! I really liked it.  It was super engaging, it just pulled me right in.  I forgot I had a life for an hour and a half.  I'm from a small town, and moved to the big city. So, I can really related to this movie.  The acting was really good. I hope Charlize Theron gets an Oscar.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Growing up to Whitney's music, this is definitely Whitney's best work, with duets with contemporary musicians.  \\"I look to you\\" was almost a premonition to her untimely passing.  My favorites are \\"A Song for You\\", \\"Worth it\\" and of course, \\"I look to you\\".

B000FA675C|5.0|This work is an absolutely exciting, cleverly written cat-and-mouse chase which will run through your most deeply held convictions – one which continues to challenge today’s real institutions, or perhaps even support traditional beliefs, but certainly unsettling any status quo between man and faith and all the underlying pillars of everyday life.  THE DAVINCI CODE, therefore, easily remains one of the most excitingly written suspense novels – or creative historical codex – of our time.<br /><br />Nowadays, the general premise is widely known, and in whichever camp one’s convictions may lay there is surely an abundance of artistic entertainment here.  Beyond the last page, however, is where the tale really begins; the struggle within oneself.<br /><br />Absent blind allegiance, the narrative encourages you to read this work in different contexts, i.e., other, more studious works on which it is based.  Take, for example, &#34;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&#34; (Baigent, Leigh & Lincoln), whose groundbreaking study in 1982 upset the status quo in their time; then, perhaps, consider the Nag Hammadi scriptures, discovered in 1945, or the known record concerning the Council of Nicea (AD 325) and discover the reasons of the &#34;missing books&#34; of the Bible.  These are but a few, but all equal building blocks which may even be found hidden within the U.S. Declaration of Independence.<br /><br />In any case, this book will capture your attention with much detail, certainly test all you may have been taught, and in a more profound way than any Hollywood movie has dared to produce - even its own namesake.<br /><br />Read the book for yourself, free and independent of other rigid views, and you will enjoy the ride….

B000LGZHDS|4.0|Prompt and fast shipping, I ordered Gary on a Monday afternoon and received him Wednesday afternoon the same week.<br />Gary is very durable and accurate in comparison to his animated counterpart. He is soft, nicely sewn together, and has very bright colors. The bottom of Gary is a bit large making it difficult for him to sit without having to lean on anything. Still for five dollars with prime shipping, best money I ever spent on a SpongeBob item.Gary now hangs with Phineas, Ferb and Perry on my desk. SpongeBob soon to come (hopefully).

B00114UUFO|5.0|Fantasy is hard to find in the movies -- for every \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" there's only a handful of bad sword'n'sorcery tales for kids (\\"Eragon,\\" \\"The Seeker\\"). As for fairy tales, forget it.<br /><br />But one little fairy tale HAS made its way into theatres -- an enchanting little story loosely based on a Neil Gaiman novel. And \\"Stardust's\\" charm is its lack of pretension, and its willingness to be silly, romantic, fantastical, sparkling and most importantly, tongue-in-cheek. And it has pirates too.<br /><br />A wall separates our world from the world of magic -- and one night, Dunstan Thorn went over it, and had a brief tryst with a beautiful princess, who is imprisoned by a witch. Nine months later, baby Tristan is left on his doorstep.<br /><br />Nineteen years later, a dying king magically flings a ruby into the sky, and says that the prince who finds it will be the new king. The two remaining princes -- and the ghosts of their dead brothers -- et off to find it. But that ruby dislodged a star, and it plummets to the ground across the Wall -- attracting the attention of three ancient witches, who use the hearts of stars to restore their spent youth.<br /><br />Still with me?<br /><br />Tristan (Charlie Cox) also sees the star, and the snotty girl he adores (Sienna Miller) says that she will marry him if he gets her the star before her birthday. Tristan does manage to find and entrap the beautiful star, Yvaine (Claire Danes), and they start off on a magical adventure of air pirates, unicorns, evil witches, and true love.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" has pretty much all the requirements for a fantasy and/or fairy tale movie -- magic, love, an evil villain, and lots of odd characters to round out the cast, and flesh out the story. Not much is actually new. But like the original Gaiman tale, the movie winks affectionately at you as the story unfolds.<br /><br />In fact, the movie only really stumbles when it stops to ruminate on true love and how precious it is, etc. Cute, but boring -- especially since the romantic leanings of the leads are pretty clear. Director Matthew Vaughn really shines when he's focusing on airships, goat-men, and the occasional magical sword-fight with an dead man.<br /><br />Despite the scattered nature of the plot, Vaughn directs with a smooth, sure hand, and he sprinkles plenty of comic relief through it -- Captain Shakespeare dancing in drag, or the Greek chorus of murdered princes. And the dialogue avoids fantastical pomposity by being just as tongue-in-cheek (\\"Nothing says \\"romance\\" like a kidnapped injured woman!\\")<br /><br />Cox makes an excellent wide-eyed, slightly blinkered country boy, who turns from a bumbling suitor to a strong young hero. Danes isn't quite as ethereal as one would expect Yvain to be, but she gives a solid performance, and Miller is perfect as the snotty, shallow Victoria.<br /><br />But while the younger performers are solid, the veterans are absolutely brilliant. Pfeiffer is hilarious, chilling and pouty as the constantly frustrated witch, and De Niro steals the show as a cuddly, twinkly-eyed gay pirate who pretends to be brutal. And Peter O'Toole and David Kelly have brief but brilliant appearances.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" is exactly what the title suggests -- sparkling, funny, wry, and just deep enough to be entertaining.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|I am so hooked on this game. My nine year old downloaded it and now I cant stop playing!! This game is addictive!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wow!!! I could not put this Trilogy down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked. When combined with the very dramatic life-or-death plot, they are incredibly compelling, entertaining, and incredibly disturbing all at once. Once I read the first book I had to start the second and then the third. I read the three books in four days I was so caught up in them. It is like you cannot put them down until the end! I don't know how people who read the books as they were published waited for second and third book! If this was merely a good read, I would have given it 4 stars, these are the best books I have read in a very long time and I read a lot!!! They say great art leaves you changed after you experience it... and these books definitely do that. Suzanne Collins has, with one amazing work, propelled herself onto my top shelf!
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|I bought this because it said IMAX and Robert Redford.  But it turned out that another guy did most of the talking and there were just too many shots of his kid and not enough shots of the what I thought I'd be getting... namely the grand canyon.<br />My own kids and my wife stopped watching it after 15 minutes.  I watched to the end hoping that it might redeem itself but sadly it didn't.  If anyone wanted to borrow it, I wouldn't mind if it was never returned.
B005IML464|4.0|I picked up DG's el cheapo 13-CD reissue of \\"Beethoven/Karajan\\" the other week, mainly because it included his recording of the Grosse Fuge, which I hadn't noticed before on CD.<br /><br />The set received, I loaded the symphonies into the CD magazine in the car and have now listened to all 9 symphonies. I remember these recordings from their initial CD issue back in the mid-80s. I also remember being none-too-happy about the recorded sound. I was among those who thought, \\"why bother? He's already done better than this.\\" This set was later re-released in the Karajan Gold series in the mid-90s, but I avoided it as I felt these recordings were beyond salvaging.<br /><br />Well, this new set features those Karajan Gold re-masterings, and I am shocked  - SHOCKED! - to find myself pleasantly surprised with these recordings. The recordings have a much more natural front-to-back perspective than I recall. They certainly have more depth than his 1977 cycle, which up to this point has been my go-to set when it comes to Karajan in Beethoven. The oppressive mic closeness that compromised so many early DG digital recordings - and that was present on this set's initial release - has been tamed here.<br /><br />As far as the interpretations, they are aggressive in the typical Karajan fashion. Andante tempi are sometimes slower than his previous recordings. Overall, the interpretations all make sense to me. This is big-boned Beethoven, but it isn't muddled Beethoven at all. On occasion, the solo winds seem a little distant when playing solo licks (notably in the Eroica). This isn't a problem in tutti sections where the winds are doubled. There, the balances are just fine between the choirs. But when it's a single wind soloist against the string section, the wind soloist can sound a bit distant. It comes off almost like a ripieno effect. I wonder if that was a conscious decision on Karajan's part, or if the soloists are simply over matched in the mix.<br /><br />The set's outstanding feature is Karajan's musicality. His sense of legato and his ability to create that technicolor sound is impressive. Yes, he tends to ramp up the harmonic tension on occasion (often by having the players add an edge to their tone), but that serves Beethoven well, IMHO.<br /><br />In short, everything that I look for in Beethoven - or in musical performance, for that matter - is here in spades.<br /><br />A few specifics:<br /><br />The first two symphonies are played at slower tempi than we've become accustomed to these days. Karajan plays the first movement repeats, which I assume is a gesture to their echt-classical form. The playing here is really clean but still luxurious. I think these may be his best versions of these early gems.<br /><br />The \\"Eroica\\" is very powerful and fleet. Karajan knew how to build tension, and that serves him well in this history-changing work. The Finale is powerful, logical and exciting. The only real caveat I have was already expressed above - ie: the wind solos seem to be off in the distance on occasion.<br /><br />The 4th - which happens to be my favorite among the 9 - comes off wonderfully. The move from the mysterious opening Adagio to the Allegro vivace of the first movement is expertly handled. I also like the recorded sound, which is hands-down better than that given to Karajan on his 1977 cycle. Karajan actually felt that this was the toughest Beethoven symphony to pull off, but pull it off he does. I get the feeling that he thought long and hard about this piece and came to terms with it on its own merits, and not as an imitation of the 2nd or a precursor to the 5th. As I tend to listen to the 4th more than I do the other Beethoven symphonies, it's nice to have another good version available to pull off the shelf to indulge my excesses.<br /><br />The 5th is the typical Karajan 5th, but in the best sound ever. Hard to imagine I'm typing those words, as I spent the last 25-odd years believing the recorded sound on this digital cycle wasn't salvageable. The first movement is aggressive - there is very little time to catch one's breath. The second movement is beautifully realized. It's amazing how \\"personal\\" an interpretation can be when one maintains harmonic tension while trusting what the composer wrote on the page. I sat back and just enjoyed the final two movements as they unfolded, basking in the sheer musicality of it all. This is a keeper. No repeat in the Finale, BTW.<br /><br />The 6th is shorn of its first movement repeat, which is a minus, as far as I'm concerned. I know that this symphony was coupled with the 5th on its initial CD release, and I wonder if the time constraints involved with fitting 5 & 6 on the same CD had something to do with that repeat being cut. The whole symphony is carefully judged and expertly balanced, though the storm that interrupts the village band is quite cataclysmic!<br /><br />I was particularly pleased with the 7th, which I have always found to be problematic for Karajan. This performance is on fire! The finale is unbelievable. It's incredibly energetic, almost manic. The Third movement is a great example of Karajan's ability to sustain tension into a climax. The trumpets peal out magnificently when their big moment arrives and later repeats. The entire Symphony is given a glorious performance. The sound is also very natural and realistic, and - again - not at all what I remember from the initial CD versions.<br /><br />Karajan was always successful with the 8th, and so he is here. The first movement is super energetic, the third movement more relaxed in tempo and feel than the more recent cycles by Chailly et al. Still, the overall approach is extremely musical. I'd think that performances like this should gain the 8th more popularity than it seems to enjoy. It's not an easy symphony to pull off, but in the best hands, it seems to play itself. A highlight of this cycle.<br /><br />As far as the 9th - well, all good things must pass. This is definitely the weakest symphony in the cycle. Messy and imprecise. The Choral finale is a real disappointment, chiefly because the choir and soloists are particularly weak. There's lots of uninspired and out-of-tune singing to be heard. The Scherzo and the Third movement fare the best, but I imagine Karajan could pull those off in his sleep. I almost get the feeling that he had lost interest in this symphony by this point in his career, as if its public spectacle didn't sit well with him. Maybe that's why he elected to use such a light-voiced solo quartet, ie: as a counter to the bombast. In any case, you can go to any of Karajan's other (and many) recordings of the 9th to get a better idea of what he could do with this piece.<br /><br />Over all, I was pleasantly surprised by the recorded sound on these discs. For once, the BPO sounds like a real orchestra on a DG recording. I'm sort of kicking myself for not having picked up the Karajan Gold issue when it was released in 1993. That's 19 years that I could have been listening to what is an impressive cycle, but that I wrote off based on the harsh sound of the initial CD release.<br /><br />I may be coming around to thinking this set surpasses the 1977 cycle, except for the Ninth included here, which is - to my ears - Karajan's weakest-ever effort in the Ninth (and that includes his one-off audio and video performances as well, not to mention the complete cycles he did for Unitel and Sony video).<br /><br />Prospective buyers should realize that DG still offers the Karajan Gold issue of Karajan's digital Beethoven Symphony cycle for around $80 as a 6-CD set. Considering one can get the same recordings in the same re-mastering in this 13-CD budget box for LESS than half the price of the 6-CD set, well, you've been apprised. The only loss is that the Overtures included in that 6-CD Gold set are marginally better performances than those included in the 13-CD set. The gain? The symphonies take only 5 CDs in the budget box, which means you get an additional 8 CDs of Beethoven for half the price of the symphonies alone.<br /><br />Moving along, I next gave a listen to the 1985 recording of the \\"Missa solemnis,\\" a recording that I somehow missed and was hearing for the first time. It's definitely different than Karajan's earlier versions. This one is much more rough-and-tumble, even a bit raw. It's certainly faster. There are any number of advantages to this approach, and I did find myself smiling at the uncluttered and un-messed-with nature of the proceedings.<br /><br />The recorded sound isn't on the level of the Karajan Gold versions of the symphonies which I reviewed above. The sound is certainly more than acceptable (at least it doesn't have that flat, glare-ridden perspective of some early digitals), but I think a remaster would improve things.<br /><br />The Vienna Singverein has never sounded better than they do here. They have always come off to me as an amateur group that produced a rather thin sound for all their numbers (there are up to 230 people in the group), and that had a love-hate relationship with things like good intonation. I don't get that it did them any good at all as a vocal group to be under Karajan's direction for the better part of 40 years, but they're very accomplished here. Much better than they were in the contemporaneous 9th Symphony recording.<br /><br />What can I say about the solo quartet? The women are OK, not stellar. The tenor - Vinson Cole - possesses a very light voice that tends to get lost in the textures, while bass Jose van Dam turns in what we've come to expect of this artist - an often beautiful tone, a musical rendition but with no lower voice to speak of.<br /><br />I think I would still go with Karajan's earlier effort on DG with Janowitz, Ludwig, Wunderlich and Berry, though that set also has its drawbacks. Perhaps Ks' best Missa solemnis is the video version he did for DG that was taped live at the 1979 Salzburg Easter Festival. That one seems to be a good blend of live-performance energy and Ks noted knack for nuance. It also features the under recorded tenor Eric Tappy, who retired in 1982.<br /><br />I highly recommend James Levine's Salzburg version on DG in this work ( http://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Missa-Solemnis-Ludwig-van/dp/B000001GGK ).<br /><br />While we're in the realm of Beethoven's vocal works, his opera \\"Fidelio\\" is notably absent from this set. Karajan and the Berlin PO recorded the work for EMI with a pretty good cast that included Jon Vickers and Helga Dernesch. That recording fits comfortably on two CDs. As DG licensed the EMI recordings of Piano Concerti 2-5 with Weissenberg for inclusion in this set, I wonder why they didn't go the next step and include the EMI Fidelio under license as well. I doubt that the price point for a 15-CD box would have hurt sales potential compared to the present 13-CD set. Sales of a 15-CD set to the triskaidekaphobics out there alone could make up for any lost sales due to a 15-CD set's higher price point.<br /><br />I will review the remainder of this \\"Karajan Beethoven\\" set at a later date.is definitely the weakest symphony in the cycle.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|I bought this along with a set of AKG K240 mk II headphones and the iPod out cord, For the price, I thought it did a nice job. Too bad it just crapped out on me inexplicably after only about 4hrs usage. Don't know if it's an issue with charging or what, but it just stopped turning on. I'm sending back for an exchange in the hopes that I just got a bum unit.<br /><br />If I get one that works I think it gets about a 3.5 star review. Really quite good sound for the price and the size. It's a bit awkward for how I expected to use it - alongside my ipad or iphone in my pocket. Although, the FiiO ipod line-out cord may be more to blame there, as it adds some bulk to the mix.<br /><br />Rather than the little plastic clips provided, I would add some tape-on velcro strips to the back of my ipod or case and the E6 amp so that it has an anchor.

B000X2H8G4|5.0|For a long time I have been looking for a product like this. I would almost call it an answer to prayer. I regularly attend meetings where many people speak, and I have had trouble understanding those who speak softly. I wear excellent hearing aids but I needed a way to turn up the volume occasionally when I couldn't understand what was being said by someone soft-spoken. This works wonderfully! It's called a Personal Sound Amplifier and that is exactly what it does.  It is well designed with a good microphone and a sensitive, wide-range volume control.  It also comes with several devices to clip it to a cap, belt or binoculars.<br /><br />This comes with headphones which fit well and are comfortable. With headphones, however, using it is not particularly inconspicuous. That has not been a problem for me because almost everyone is comfortable once they understand what I am doing.<br /><br />I am a absolutely delighted with this purchase.  The service was very fast and the product is well-made and sturdy.  I have been told there are smaller, miniaturized devices but for $30 this has been a great discovery at a reasonable price.

B005FITIK0|4.0|This movie isn't just a fascinating character study. It's a sharp and melancholy tale of lost youth and arrested development.  It also makes some subtle points about the most youth-obsessed, immature aspects of today's culture.  (It's no coincidence the main character constantly watches reality TV and writes young adult novels - there's even a veiled reference to Twilight at one point, that teen phenomenon that became curiously popular with adults.)<br /><br />Enter 37-year-old Mavis, once the prettiest and most popular girl in her high school.  Years later, Mavis still has the mentality of a lazy, snotty and self-obsessed adolescent . . . along with a drinking problem, depression, anxiety, and a foundering career as fiction writer.<br /><br />Mavis learns her high school boyfriend, Buddy, has had a baby with his wife.  Nostalgia for her glory days drives Mavis to hatch a ridiculous plan - return to her Minnesota hometown to \\"save\\" Buddy (who hasn't seen her in years) from his boring suburban existence.<br /><br />Once in town, Mavis runs into sarcastic former classmate, Matt - because every queen bee needs someone to listen to her talk about herself, Mavis strikes up a sort of friendship with Matt.  Matt still lives at home, immersed in his hobbies like the lonely, unpopular teen he once was.  A  severe beating by bullies in high school left him disabled - Matt is frozen in time due to tragedy, while Mavis is stuck because she peaked in high school.  While Matt sees Mavis for the lonely mess she is, Mavis is too deluded to realize how much they have in common.<br /><br />Theron and Oswalt are absolutely perfect in their roles. Mavis and Matt are extreme examples, but their malaise will strike a chord with anyone who ever struggled to become a grown-up, or wished they could recapture the promise of youth.<br /><br />Word to the wise: this isn't really a comedy, though it has some brilliant moments of dialogue.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Had the opportunity to see this in a limited movie showing.  There are too many hidden secrets, twists and turns to reveal spoilers and I wouldn't want to because it would ruin the beauty of the story. So, there will be no specifics given here. But to give you an idea of the audience reaction, these are the words being said over and over and over again by those exiting the theater:<br /><br />Perfect, brilliant, speechless, amazing, incredible, beautiful, moving, romantic, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  More than one person said Love Never Dies is the exact story that should have been told.  Everything was as it should be.  As we wanted it to be.  Pure satisfaction.<br /><br />In the preview movie, Andrew Lloyd Weber talks about a conversation in which someone told him this was probably one of the top three musical movies ever made.  That comment is true.  The stage production filmed live turned out to be an entertaining, entrancing, immersive experience that translated wonderfully to the screen.  I fully intend to have a copy for myself, and several for friends and family that did not have the opportunity to see this in the very limited US theater release.
0784011710|5.0|No words can describe the power of this film - all of the characters are magnificently played.  I've never really been a fan of Kline, but he does a really good job here.  Meryl Streep - well, that's all you need to say. She can't be anything but brilliant - I first fell in love with her in Out of Africa. Nothing I've seen since has lessened my opinion of her brilliance.  As a mother, I can not imagine the horror of having to make the choice that Sophie was forced to make.  It is a choice from which you would never recover - No small wonder that this one won the Academy Award..

B002X1JD4S|5.0|I have no snobbish hang-ups about enjoying this work and already own very satisfying accounts from Mehta, Mata and de Burgos but this one goes to the top of the list by virtue of its rough, searing energy and sense of humour. G&uuml;nter Wand is hardly the first conductor you would think of as being suited to doing justice to this music in that he has something of the sober Kapellmeister about him but here he directs a scintillating performance, giving his choir, soloists and orchestra the latitude to take expressive risks and throw themselves wholeheartedly into this medieval pastiche with all the requisite passion and even crudity it requires. Special mention must be made of the baritone soloist Peter Binder, of whom I have never heard but who ranks with and beyond the very best and who is, to my ears, far preferable to the hectoring D-F-D. He is much smoother and resonant of tone when it is required but also possesses both a lovely falsetto and a really biting top. Neither the tenor nor the soprano is as captivating as, say, John Aler or Lucia Popp or Sumi Jo respectively but they by no means let the side down and there is an argument for having a tenor whose voice exhibits more buttock-clenching strain than beauty; Aler makes the Roast Swan solo sound almost too beautiful.<br /><br />This is a live recording in superb sound; very few coughs and a real sense of space. A palpable sense of enjoyment runs through it and it sounds much closer in spirit to the bawdy riot that Orff surely intended rather than a decorous concert performance. The sopranos in the chorus are a bit stretched and there is the odd wobbler but in general artistic standards are remarkably high, testament to the talent in depth available in and to regional German orchestras.<br /><br />Buy this and you'll be pleasantly surprised.

B000S9VRLO|5.0|Released in 2007, Souvenirs D'un Autre Monde (Memories of Another World) put (the one piece and originally black metal band) Alcest on the map in the metal community. Only six songs and about 41 minutes, Alcest perfected what was done on their 2005 EP, Le Secret. Achingly pretty melodies and vocals glitter the whole entire album from start to finish. Main band member, Neige, sings like a light gust of wind over the gorgeous guitar melodies. Every once in a while he'll show his teeth when the riffs get blackened. But overall, things stay fairly calm throughout. Fans who have listened to his albums from 2010 and 2012 but haven't heard this should definitely check it out since it is one of the, if not the, definitive album for this style of metal. All of the songs are standouts, especially the closing song Tir Non Og, which features quiet percussion, acoustic guitar and dreamy vocals with piano drifting in and out while towards the end a string section fades into the background.<br /><br />Pros- Perfect from start to finish. Great ideas never overstay their welcome or get boring. Perfectly balanced between shoegaze and great metal.<br />Cons- None.<br />Overall- One of the best metal (related) albums from 2007, if not the best (along with the releases by Pig Destroyer, Deathspell Omega, Dillinger Escape Plan, Caina and High on Fire).

0671015206|4.0|Humphrey Bogart said it best;<br /><br />\\"The only point in making money is, you can tell some big shot where to go\\".<br /><br />The point of \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" is to reach a state of freedom. Freedom from financial ruin, freedom from \\"keeping up with the Jones\\", freedom from being suckered into a lifestyle that is self defeating. In my opinion, most of the critics seem to miss that concept. Being frugal is not a means to an end, it is a way of freeing one self from the onslaught of American Marketing. Being able to live beyond two paychecks, in my mind, is priceless. Being tied to a high consumption lifestyle is slavery.<br /><br />\\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" breaks the myth and gives a new way of looking at what it means to be free.<br /><br />Just my two cents.

B004LWZVZM|4.0|I love anything having to do remotely with Abraham Lincoln.  This movie is a little slow, though, because there is not much even Robert Redford could do to enliven a kangaroo court trial.  For those who don't know the Mary Surratt story, this movie is very much worth seeing as an object lesson of hysteria.  I think that Surratt was guilty in the Lincoln conspiracy but agree that not granting her a civil trial was a government failure.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I admit my curiosity was piqued when I saw this book ignited such controversy on several of the morning news shows. I also don't normally read romance novels only because I have such a vivid imagination that such books create unrealistic expectations for me. Overall I thought this book did it's job. While it's no literary feat like \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\", it entertained but I think more than that it made the reader ask themselves would they want this, what would they do.<br /><br />I'll start with what I like about the book-<br />I thought it was addicting because I was so caught up in Christian Grey's psychological make-up. He's dark and mysterious, but yet on some level I understood him (or at least didn't judge him). I was so interested to see what he would do next (but not so much what Anastasia would do next). I in no way found this book to be about violence against women. I thought the author went through great pains to make it clear to the audience that Anastasia was in control and consented to everything. I do think unbalanced men may interpret this the wrong way and not understand the difference between violence and consent to pain or understanding the difference between hurting someone and causing them pain.<br /><br />The cons-<br />I didn't read about the author first, but it was evident to me several pages into the book that the author must be English. As such I found some of the dialogue unrealistic for two Americans in their early and mid 20's. That was distracting. At times it seems like the book was written by two different authors, as if she realized she lapsed into English culture and suddenly reverted to American.<br /><br />Without revealing too much his introduction to Mrs. Robinson did disturb me a bit, what she did was not legal.<br /><br />The descriptions of their encounters were a bit repetitive, and there is a gross over use of several words (baby, holy, beautiful, etc.) that became irritating. The encounters were described in such a technical manner. I really dislike many of Grey's one-liners.<br /><br />As the book went on I found Anastasia to be utterly annoying. I had hoped that as her character progressed that the writing for the character would progress. But neither happened. She remains very flat for me, however the \\"sub-conscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\" characters had much more \\"life\\" and I came to enjoy their antics. The descriptions around them were so vivid and not repetitive at all. Unlike the descriptions of Christian and Anastasia. However, I realize that Anastasia is in her early 20's and is bound to be annoying because she doesn't know better. I'm sure I was equally annoying at that age. The way she pushes or approaches the issue are annoying, or at least it's annoying that by the end of the book she hasn't really grown in my opinion. Now that is to say that I don't think all women in their early 20's are this annoying, but Anastasia seems particularly sheltered which lends to her cluelessness about how to deal with Grey.<br /><br />I do think this book is quite expensive in general, but certainly when compared with the quality of the book. Since I noticed the price increased, the publisher is clearly capitalizing on the popularity of the book.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|this game is great now only if I could get past level 24. now I'm writing cause I need more words to submit this and now I'm done

B0046W1692|5.0|This no doubt is another excellent album by Mana.  Mana has been around for a while now and they have set the bar exceedingly high.  Perhaps this album does not raise that bar, but it is still an inspired effort and an awesome addition to their lineup.  The album has been getting considerable playing time in my cd player for the past few months.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|this games is awesome but also trick its so addicting get this game.... unless u can make a bettering will like to see u try so get this app now!!!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's just a fun app to kill time. part of the fun is the challenge to unlock new levels.  its free.  what do u have to lose.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|I couldn't stop watching this. Seriously, if you like movies like Cloverfield, watch this. The characters are really great actors too. Never heard of them.
0307931803|4.0|I realized today that the most beautiful aspect of the books Dr. Seuss wrote is all about reading them ALOUD.  They are not meant to be silent.  On the same note, they are also meant to be shared among the young and adult.  I find myself at a responsibility now to share and talk about them.  Plus, with every Dr. Seuss story, I am realizing, there must also be a special story to share.  Here is my first. Come and check out more of this review here.  [...]

So when I don't see a way to turn sound off in a game(Right Away!), I take it as a personal insult, and affront as a fellow game developer, and a slap in the face to all gamers everywhere.

0439023491|4.0|This book is all about the ramifications and reprecussions of The Hunger Games.  Life for the victorious tributes is not any better than when the first left their homes, nor is it back to normal.  Katniss says something so powerful, it's worthy of giving it to you right away.  \\"I mourn my old life here.  We barely scraped by, but I knew where I fit in, I knew that my place was in the tightly interwoven fabric that was our life.  I wish I could go back to it because, in retrospect, it seems so secure compared with now, when I am so rich and so famous and so hated by the authorities in the Capital.\\"  There are a lot of universal themes throughout the book, and this is one which you have to stop and think about.  Things are relative in life and sometimes we may think they will get better but when we arrive there we find ourselves thinking life was much better before.  Change is not always better.  We also don't always appreciate what we have as we are living it.  It takes loosing a piece of our life to know how much better off we were with it. See more at the link below<br /><br />[...]

0307352145|5.0|In this age of \\"brain storming\\" and \\"collaboration\\" touted as the best way to get the best results from our best minds, comes a distinctive new voice. Some people think better, produce more, and are more inventive when allowed to do their thinking, or creating on their own. This should be a must read for all educators and corporate leaders. It is also an excellent read. I highly recommend it!

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is very robust. A thick, wide razor sharp blade, and a generous handle. This is not a small knife. Quality is excellent and comes with a lifetime warranty. Nice even blade grind with a straight sharp tip. Made in Olean NY USA by a company that has been making knives for well over 100 years.<br /><br />The sheath itself is nice. The knife locks in it very securely. The belt strap is kinda ghetto.The strap is limp cheap nylon webbing and I don't like button snaps. Snaps get clogged up with mud and are also a hassle to snap shut with cold hands. The sheath can be modified easily to your liking. The first thing I did was remove the belt strap. I wish it came with a Tek-Lok though. Sheath made in China.<br /><br />I like this knife. The sheath is adequate.

B0071T5PN0|5.0|As a long time fan, I was a bit wary of these guys releasing new material. Comeback albums are \\"high risk\\" propositions.  Then, when I heard Tattoo I thought all of my fears had been realized.  But, have no fear my friends, VH has brought the goods here, and I'm thrilled with the results. Putting Tattoo aside, the remaining 12 songs definitely deliver, and display what this band is, and, maybe more importantly, what it \\"could have been\\" -- going beyond its already legendary status. The song structures return to the stylings of early VH efforts like Fair Warning and WACF. And the lyrical melodies are formed/placed in a way that only DLR can do, creating that long missed back-and-forth with Eddie's guitar playing. Speaking of which, Eddie's guitar work here ranges from brilliant to outright wondrous. And Alex didn't squander the long layoff between albums either; as a drummer myself, I was blown away by his performance here. Yes, I realize we miss Mike's vocals, and as you listen the first few times, you can hear just where his voice would have put this album into the stratosphere; but the layered vocals suffice, and the bass playing here surpasses that which appeared on prior VH records. Dave's voice doesn't have all of those old layers and textures, and it does sound a bit strained at times; but these guys are in their late 50s (that alone is worth an extra half-star), so you've got to give a nod to this overall effort. It's a triumphant return to form, perhaps only lacking in a true \\"single\\" -- \\"Blood and Fire\\" and \\"You and Your Blues\\" have that break-thru potential. It would have been nice if the band had crafted a *true* radio friendly song for this set (just one) to help reclaim their place as a chart topping public favorite (Aerosmith always seems to do so). Then again, WACF and Fair Warning never worried about such things, and that's specifically the fan-base (myself included) that this offering is geared toward. Glad to hear them back! Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really liked playing this version of solitaire.  It is challenging. I play it every chance I get.<br />Thank you
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book is the prequal to the Halo; Combat Evolved game that launched Microsoft`s &#34;Xbox&#34; game console.  The game was great, but this book was even better!  The storyline from beginning to end was exciting.  So were the dramatic parts, from heart felt emotions to fight scenes that made you think you were there.<br />This book is an absolute must buy for fans of the Halo series or fans of fictional characters who fights for planet Earth.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|very enjoyable some of the levels I did not see a way to complete and then when you figure it out it seems so easy.  fun game enjoy it when I am waiting.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Let me start by saying that I have not read the book this movie is based on. I have to admit that I only recently was excited enough to go see this movie. I ended up watching it in 3-D. The first 15 minutes or so of the movie were nothing special in 3-D. Once the action moved to Mars, things definitely looked a lot more visually impressive. I thought that the action sequences were pretty good. I feel like the director balanced out the action sequences and the non-action sequences nicely--basically, there was plenty of action, but not so much that I felt overloaded by it. The plot was not too complicated. I felt pretty engaged in the movie for most of it--even the early part where not much was going on. The main actors in it did an excellent job. The dialogue was not dull like it could've been. Honestly, I think the main difference between the regular 2-D version of it and the 3-D version is the clarity at which you can see the creatures on Mars. There are probably one or two other differences, but that's the main one I can think of. I wanted to primarily talk about my visual experience at the theater in this review. I figure that most people going to see this movie already know what it's about. I hope this helps some of you that might be trying to decide whether to see it in 3-D or 2-D.

B007APG16U|2.0|This album is garbage. He is portrayed as a west coast gangsta rapper in the song \\"im faded\\" and \\"rack city\\" but this album is full of singing and saying stuff that doesn't even rhyme.  I'm very disappointed with this. If I knew he wanted to be so much like Drake i wouldn't have bought it. It would have been nice to have a song on the radio that represented the rest of his album.

1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris, philosopher and neuroscientist, writes this treatise on Free Will from an incompatibilist view point. Most theologians and many philosophers today take the compatibilist approach, which is the view that determinism (we have no control over causal events) is compatible with the idea of free will. Harris makes out a forceful argument that this is not so. He believes that free will is an illusion. Citing the fact that \\"No human being is responsible for his genes or his upbringing, yet we have every reason to believe that these factors determine his character\\" to illustrate his point that we mistake conscious deliberations for free will. He asks, for example, if his decision to have a second cup of coffee was due to a random release of neurotransmitters, how could the indeterminacy of the initiating event count as an exercise of free will? If he drank a glass of water because he was thirsty, even though he was free to choose orange juice, it could hardly be an exercise of free will if the thought of an orange juice never crossed his mind. He goes further and suggests that even if we were to believe in a \\"soul\\" that dwells within us, we cannot be exercising free will - \\"if we have no idea what [our] soul is going to do next, [we] are not in control.\\" Harris does not believe that determinism necessarily leads to fatalism and he explains so in pages 33-35. He also believes that belief in determinism \\"need not damage our system of criminal justice.\\" (see pages 56-60). He concludes his book thus: \\"Now I feel that it is time for me to leave. I'm hungry, yes, but it also seems that I've made my point. In fact, I can't think of anything else to say on the subject. And where is the freedom in that?\\"

0393316041|3.0|I was very saddened by reading this egotistical rant.  Feynman was a kind of hero to me, as the raconteur physicist, winner of the Nobel, and teacher extraordinaire.  But now I see the guy, in his own words (and very poorly written at that), telling everyone how smart and funny, witty and clever, he was.  When you stoop to that, well, the genius sort of goes out the window, doesn't it?.  Or maybe this is overcompensation for a self-admitted social inept.  I don't know.<br /><br />\\"As told to Ralph Leighton, edited by Edward Hutchings?\\"  Where were these guys?  Leighton must have had a tape-recorder going, and just transcribed the results, and Hutchings ought to be fired if he's really an editor.  But the real tragedy was letting Feynman go on and on about his superiority over the rest of the boobs he ever came across in his entire life... including the big names at Los Alamos.  And it doesn't make me feel any better that while he's supposed to be working on the atom bomb (and THEY'RE ALL SO STRESSED, UNDER UNIMAGINABLE DEADLINES, WORKING OVERTIME), he apparently spent an inordinate amount of time teaching himself safe-cracking just so he could rub everybody's nose in it, as well as inventing funny games to torment the mail censor, and wandering around banging his drum in the woods -- had he spent the time paying more attention to Klaus Fuchs, the spy who lends him a car so he can visit his dying wife, he might have nabbed him early on.  That puzzle just seemed to have slipped him by.<br /><br />Feynman's a character, I'll give him that.  But would I like to be around him?  I don't think so (except maybe when he was bar-hopping, skirt-chasing, and still drinking).  Sure, I would have liked to have taken classes from him, but that's about it.  I was especially interested in his observations with John C. Lilly and the isolation tanks, and his self-experimentation with out-of-the-body \\"Altered States,\\" but like so many of the other things he described in the book, once he got bored with it, he just dropped it. For all his tenacity at problem-solving, he sure did leave a lot of things unfinished.<br /><br />As I said at the beginning of this review, I was saddened... by learning TOO much about someone I had admired, and discovering their all-too-human failings.  I wish I hadn't read it; it wasn't funny, and it certainly wasn't flattering. If you are a fan of Professor Feynman's I wouldn't recommend that you read this particular book (read the physics stuff instead). If you already read it, saw something in there that I didn't see, and gave it 5 stars, well, there's nothing I can say that will change your mind.  You must be a genius too.h it, he just dropped it.

B005HV6YO8|4.0|For $3.99, how can you go wrong with \\"If You Love Somebody Set Them Free,\\" \\"All This Time,\\" \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith In You\\" and previously unreleased live versions of \\"Message In A Bottle,\\" \\"Demolition Man\\" and \\"Heavy Cloud No Rain\\"? If you already have a collection of Sting's music (and, I do not), this album probably won't appeal to you at full price.<br /><br />But, the MP3 download for $3.99? Are you kidding me?<br /><br />It is March 2012 and I am now just fleshing out my Amazon Cloud drive. Earlier this year, I uploaded my old CD collection and began buying tracks and albums for my cardio playlists: bicycling, walking and aerobics. That said, I'm looking for value purchases and Sting's \\"Best of 25 Years\\" is a great deal at $3.99 -- 12 songs at roughly the same price as four singles.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.<br /><br />BTW: The live tracks are a nice surprise. I tend to avoid live albums, however, [[ASIN:B003UPDS88 Paul Simon's \\"Concert in the Park\\"]] is the exception to the rule.

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|I was saddened to watch Bruce struggle vocally with the We Take Care Of Our Own on the Jimmy Fallon show.<br />I saw in his face & his eyes a fear that I have never seen before.  Fear, not of losing his home, family & incredibly enormous wealth, but fear that he does not believe in what he is saying & fear that his loyal fans will see through the charade of this once awe-inspiring working-class hero.<br />I just hope this is not the beginning of the end of my hero, the man who inspired me so much in life.<br />Inspired me to pick up blues harp,<br />introduced me to the rock \\"n\\" roll electric guitar sounds of the Fender Telecaster.<br />Influenced my musical tastes, which cost me 1000s as I watched my vinyl LP collection grow and grow into 4 figures.<br />How can a man that was so in touch with the realities of life, the true turmoil that the everyday men & women face in everyday situations, a man that could write over 50 plus classic songs for just one album alone, turn out such mediocre material.<br />I am not going to mention or compare this album to Darkness, as Darkness is probably one of the GREATEST albums & most fruitful recording sessions with the greatest number of unheard unreleased CLASSIC songs EVER!!!!<br />Anyway.......<br />Whilst I appreciate what Bruce is trying to do here, I do not believe that he is being sincere.<br />Musically the album is \\"good\\", and that's it.  But, that's like saying to your hot sexy girlfriend after she has spent 4 hours getting ready to go clubbing, you look \\"nice\\".<br />Wrecking Ball lacks \\"Balls\\".<br />The backing vocals featured on many of the songs are weak & add nothing to the songs themselves.<br />Bruces vocals sound tired and strained.<br />The Irish fiddle thing is over played way too much.<br />Maybe for his next album he can have some Tarantella.<br />What I miss the most here is Danny's Hammond, one of the most beautiful sounds ever to grace my ears.<br />I tried my best to like this album.<br />I tried to lookfor deeper meanings.<br />I tried to appreciate the simplicity of the lyrics.<br />I tried to overlook the fact that here is this multi-millionaire rock legend pretending to be something that he is not, and never ever was, but in the early days was so much easier to believe he was.<br />It is ok as for an artist to pretend to be somebody they are not, but when they step over that line & start preaching to their congregation of what is good, bad, right or wrong with the world, they better look at themselves & ask if they truly believe what they are saying & if they do, then what are they doing about it, because if they are not doing anything, then it is just a lie.<br />And that is what we have here.<br />Heartbroken and Dismayed I stand before you...A TRUE Springsteenite now fallen to his knees.

B006ISJQ3K|5.0|This album represents one of her biggest peaks in her amazing career.  She was riding high on the success of [[ASIN:B000B5XOSY Mahogany]]and had 3 strong singles from this one album.  The cover alone was brilliant--a defining moment in the birth of her true DIVA status...which continued with the covers of [[ASIN:B000008K89 Baby It's Me]], [[ASIN:B00000J2RF The Boss]] and [[ASIN:B00009U5J6 Diana (Deluxe Edition)]].<br /><br />This album (the vinyl record) had always been one of my favorites, and for several years was unavailable on CD (Motown was really bad about releasing her 70s music on CD in the 90s...I had to hunt for everything at used CD shops before the internet made shopping easier.)  Thank you Hip-oSelect for re-issuing all her CDs as expanded editions with lots of extras.  Nearly every Diana song is now available on CD except for one of her most beautiful ballads from [[ASIN:B000UTJT5S Ross (1978)]]: Where Did We Go Wrong.  All the other songs from that album have been added as extras in other CDs.<br /><br />Why should you buy 1976 Diana Ross?  If you were a fan of the original, you will like hearing the alternative versions.  Another reviewer said, \\"there is a reason they weren't ever released,\\" which I understand.  However, although I prefer the versions I am already familiar with, it's FUN to listen to outtakes, and hear some of the other choices she made when discovering the songs.  Do you know how many countless bootlegs of Beatles Albums there are out there?  Countless! And fans buy them for the exact same reason: to hear the decisions that the band was making for each song, different riffs, different harmonies, maybe even a little laughter.<br /><br />But the most fantastic track on this 2 disc set for me is the interview with Diana from 1975/6, who sounds the most eloquent I have ever heard. She sounds relaxed and smart and in love with life.  I am a huge fan but the first to admit that sometimes she doesn't interview well--because she might misinterpret the question or not connect with the interviewer (but her last appearance on Oprah in 2011 was probably my all time favorite interview with Diana that I've seen!)  On this CD she talks about the birth of the Supremes, about working on her movies, about the tracks on this CD, and she exudes confidence and joy being exactly where she is in her life.<br /><br />So for Diana novice who wants to hear her 70s hits, buy [[ASIN:B00007MB3K To Love Again]] for ballads, or [[ASIN:B00004YWW7 All The Great Hits]].  But for the people who are fans and liked [[ASIN:B00383UBV4 Touch Me In The Morning [Expanded Edition]]] or [[ASIN:B000WQJJ7W Last Time I Saw Him (Expanded Edition)]], definitely get this.  If you liked the original 1976 release and want to dig deeper, get this before it goes out of print.  It already happened with [[ASIN:B000BPGJIQ Where Did Our Love Go]] (another Hip-oSelect special).  If I had to choose my top 20 Diana Ross songs, 6 would come from this album alone: After You, Ain't Nothin' But a Maybe, Theme from Mahogany, I Thought it Took a Little Time, Love Hangover, AND One Love In My Lifetime. SO MUCH GREAT STUFF HERE!
B006MQRLSA|5.0|I thought the movie was put together well. The acting was great. The conflict between old school and new school was very enlightning
1594744769|1.0|I was anxious to read this book, but after reading the first chapter, I was anxious to get it over with!  I did read the entire book, but it certainly is NOT something I would recommend.  Firstly I detest the teenage type language the author uses.  Secondly the peculiar children we meet are not described in enough detail for us to really care about them. Thirdly, it is obviously written as a prelude to upcoming books where the \\"adventure\\" will be continued.  ARGH!  Not for me.  I've had enough of this poorly written story.

It has great suggestions for making your photos look more professional as well as what kind of equipment you should think about getting - if you really like photography or really like having better shots than your friends. I highly recommend his books they are all easy to read, funny, and informative.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|amazing movie the story the music the locations,and of course the acting i wish they would come out with a soundtrack
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This review is based on The Trilogy of The Hunger Games.<br />I decided to read \\"The Hunger Games\\" after realizing it was so popular that a movie was being released in a few weeks.  I've always preferred books over movies, and I know my husband would drag me to see the movie even before me having the opportunity tor read the book.  I love the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer (absolutely every book and still crave more).  Young adult books usually don't interest me, but as I said I knew I couldn't resist knowing what I was going to get myself into.<br />Book 1-<br />I couldn't put it down from the first page.  I was absolutely taken with Katniss and Gale.  I knew it took place in the future and it would be a \\"difficult to handle\\" read.  Maybe I just have a strong stomach or don't find what occurred in the book that depressing.  While it did spawn some deep emotion, I felt that the characters all represented what they had to do to survive in that time period.  Some reviewers said they wouldn't allow their daughters to read it, as they didn't want their child emulating Katniss.  Katniss is in the future and has to fend for food in the wild, then play a game to kill other children.  I don't see that kind of game being required anytime soon.  Besides, aren't our children killing each other already? This is a work of fiction and should be taken as such.  It started out exciting, knowing that the games would soon begin. The elaborate costumes, the presentation of the tributes, and the parade down the streets of the Capitol.  Collins did an awesome job going through detail, but not so much so that I felt it dragged on and wanted a break.  I read this book in less than two days, and I was craving more.  It reminded me of Lord of the Flies, Romeo and Juliet, and Twilight all in one book.<br /><br />Book 2-<br />Obviously with the ending in Book 1, I couldn't help but want to continue reading on.  What I thought was about nothing but suspense and a little about love turned out to be nothing but about love.

B000SEFNMS|4.0|At first you might think that it is kind of odd how to book starts off (dont worry no spoliers will be put in this review, only things that you learn from the free sample will i talk about}. If you enjoyed the book hatchet (a very popular book assignied to kids in middle school now adays) then you will love into the wild. its simply a great book. although right at the begginning you learn that the main character dies , it just makes you even more interestred in knowing what happens to them. you might find at times it gets kind of boring but that quickly passes as they have to add alot of details to make the story really flow. all in all its a great book. i loved it. i only gave it a 4 star however becasue of how u know as soon as u start that the main charcter will die, which for me was a bit of a downer.<br /><br />happy reading!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This is so pointless. You slingshot birds at walls. They suicide trying to kill pigs. Since when could birds kill pigs? They don't even survive to hatch the eggs, assuming they died when they poofed out of existence. Apparently this game is successful. HOW?!?!?!? What has the world come to?
0517548232|5.0|The subtitle of the book says it all. This is definitely \\"the shortest and surest way to understand basic economics\\". The author takes a unique approach by introducing all the main concepts through \\"exposition\\". As he says \\"...its effort is to show that many of the ideas which now pass for brilliant innovations and advances are in fact mere revivals of ancient errors, and a further proof of the dictum that those who are ignorant of the past are condemned to repeat it.\\" The main premise of the book is that: \\"Economics, as we have now seen again and again, is a science of recognizing secondary consequences. It is also a science of seeing general consequences. It is the science of tracing the effects of some proposed or existing policy not only on some special interest in the short run, but on the general interest in the long run.\\".<br /><br />In addition to the unique approach taken by the author he is committed to making the material accessible to all: \\"I have tried to write this book as simply and with as much freedom from technicalities as is consistent with reasonable accuracy, so that it can be fully understood by a reader with no previous acquaintance with economics.\\" A definite read for all!<br /><br />Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"A certain amount of taxes is of course indispensable to carry on essential government functions. Reasonable taxes for this purpose need not hurt production much. The king of government services then supplied in return, which among other things safeguard production itself, more than compensate for this. But the larger the percentage of the national income taken by taxes the greater the deterrent to private production and employment. When the total tax burden grows beyond a bearable size, the problem of devising taxes that will not discourage and disrupt production becomes insoluble.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"There is no limit to the amount of work to be done as long as any human need or wish that work could fill remains unsatisfied. In a modern exchange economy, the most work will be done when prices, costs, and wages are in the best relations with each other.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"...our real objective is to maximize production. In doing this, full employment - that is, the absence of involuntary idleness - becomes a necessary by-product. But production is the end, employment merely the means. We cannot continuously have the fullest production without full employment. But we can very easily have full employment without full production.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"Paradoxical as it may seem to some, it is just as necessary to the health of a dynamic economy that dying industries be allowed to die as that growing industries be allowed to grow. The first process is essential to the second.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"So government policy should be directed, not to imposing more burdensome requirements on employers, but to following policies that encourage profits, that encourage employers to expand, to invest in newer and better machines to increase the productivity of workers - in brief, to encourage capital accumulation, instead of discouraging it - and to increase both employment and wage rates.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"Profits, in short, resulting from the relationships of costs to prices, not only tell us which goods it is most economical to make, but which are the most economical ways to make them. These questions must be answered by a socialist system no less than by a capitalist one; they must be answered by any conceivable economic system; and for the overwhelming bulk of the commodities and services that are produced, the answers supplied by profit and loss under competitive free enterprise are incomparably superior to those that could be obtained by any other method.\\"<br /><br />7-\\"Inflation is the autosuggestion, the hypnotism, the anesthetic, that has dulled the pain of the operation for him. Inflation is the opium of the people.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"Saving, in short, in the modernworld, is only another form of spending. The usual difference is that the money is turned over to someone else to spend on means to increase production.\\"world, is only another form of spending.

B005VTS4EY|5.0|dude, who cares if its hard, that's the point of the game To THINK! I thought it was great. good job five stars.
0307595862|4.0|Overall, I liked the book. Interesting plot twists and turns. Parts of it were page-turners, while other parts seemed to drone on and on with details and background that added little to the storyline. Much of this was character development, which was interesting, but IMHO the story wouldn't have suffered if some of it had been omitted. It also took me a bit to get into it, but with perseverance it got better. There are numerous descriptions of graphic violence and sex, but if these don't bother you it's a good read. The book is 380+ pages, which I think is probably 50 to 80 pages too many but, again, overall, I liked it and would recommend it to a friend.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|We all loved Shrek, to the extent that theres a grand total of four films as well as numerous spin off shorts and even amusment park rides. While the franchised was loved till the very end, Shreks recent outings have been more of an after thought. Sloppier and genrally less fun than Shreks 1 & 2, the final two weren't bad by any means, just a tad redunt. Luckily the studio realized this, as well as the fact that there was two foot four gold mine starring in their second Shrek title, so they gave him his own well deserved film.<br />What we're left with is the greatness that is Puss in Boots, a movie about one of the series most iconic characters, yet only garnered minimum time on the big screen in the shadows of Shrek and Donkey, especially in the latter two films. Rest easy, the big green lug and his noble steed are nowhere to be seen in this film. The film benifits from this, as you need no previous Shrek knowledge to understand Puss, which is a good thing.<br />Finally, as for the actual film, its undeniably well excuted. Who've thought that the studio originally had this film planned as another direct-to-video spin off when the final product is this good? They simply put alot of effort into it, and it shows with its dazzling visuals and surprising deep and implemented characters and somewhat emotional plot. When its all said and done, I really couldn't find anything noticably wrong or flawed in it, which is hard for me to do. One could make the arguement that its just another cash-in on the Shrek franchise by giving us more time with one of favorite cats, but when the movie is this good, its hard to argue.<br /><br />I highly recomend this film because, in an already overtaxed franchise, a breath of fresh air a fun and stylish as this isn't so bad.
B002IFT1ZA|1.0|What a piece of crap, watched the first two episodes I was never so bored with a series.<br />Will not be watching the rest of the episodes.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|this is my first review and mostly in response to others.<br /><br />I have always liked these types of games. it was also nice to see that the developer gave credit to red remover as their basis for the game. props for that.<br /><br />other reviewers have mentioned a way to skip levels ... this is only possible through the first 16, then you have to beat each one to unlock the next. this leads me to my first (and really only) complaint ... a hint button would be nice. I know red remover doesn't have one, but sometimes a little help would be nice.<br /><br />also for those who said that the music couldn't be turned off ... it can be done in the menu accessed during a level.<br /><br />overall a good fun game.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA Agent eager for a new assignment. After almost a year as the \\"landlord\\" of a safe house in Cape Town, he wants to transfer to a more high-profile gig. He spends his days bouncing a ball against the walls, trying to stave off boredom. He is surprised to get a last minute reservation; the CIA has captured Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a notorious and very dangerous ex-CIA agent who is now considered a traitor. No sooner has Frost been brought in than a group of renegades break into the safe house and start shooting. Matt manages to smuggle Tobin out and the chase begins.<br /><br />Written by David Guggenheim (his second film) and directed by Daniel Espinosa (his first Hollywood film), \\"Safe House\\" has all the makings of a top-notch thriller directed by Tony Scott. In fact, I thought it was a Tony Scott film when I saw the trailer for the first time. But that isn't a compliment.<br /><br />The film begins by establishing both lead characters. We spend a significant amount of time watching Tobin weave in and out of the crowds and dark alleyways of Cape Town. Eventually, he meets another agent and buys a chip containing some very damaging information. Once he takes possession, it seems like everyone is out to get him. But Tobin has some moves and manages to escape them every time. Well, almost every time...<br /><br />Matt wakes up next to his beautiful French girlfriend and they talk about the future. She wants to move back to France and he is itching for a different assignment. He pushes his mentor (Brendan Glesson) to get him reassigned. At lunch, she says she doesn't have to be at work for an hour, they should go back home and make love. At work, he walks the empty halls of the 'clinic' and eventually starts bouncing a ball against the wall.<br /><br />All of this is actually interesting because it helps to establish and build each of these characters, giving us some insight into their lives and we realize each one is in a very different place with a completely different skill set. Through the course of the chase, each person will have to rely on the other and use their skills to help both of them survive.<br /><br />Once the men break into the safe house and start shooting, everything starts to go wrong.<br /><br />As soon as Tobin arrives, he size up Matt. The men who have captured Tobin push the younger agent to one side, treating him like the insignificant innkeeper he is. Nothing escapes Tobin's eyes and he turns on the Hannibal Lecter-ese; the crazy, super-intelligent mad man persona. He starts to goad Matt, saying things like \\"Tick Tock\\" to get the younger, less experienced agent to make a rash decision. He doesn't expect Matt to be of any consequence.<br /><br />Matt is inexperienced, but because he wants a more exciting post, he isn't about to let anything happen to Tobin and smuggles him out steps ahead of the men who stormed the safe house.<br /><br />Once Matt and Tobin start to run through the streets, trying to evade the men, the film becomes incredibly routine.<br /><br />These characters are a fun thing to watch. For a few minutes. And then you realize you have seen these types of performances a million times before. It just becomes so boring, so quickly.<br /><br />Washington is a great actor and always brings a palpable intensity to his performances. And Tobin Frost is no exception. From the moment we first set eyes on Tobin, we know there is something going on beneath the surface. He isn't telling everything to everyone. He has some ulterior motive to his actions.<br /><br />But he has done this type of character before. And there really isn't anything new in this portrayal.<br /><br />I think Washington is a cinematic tour de force, but he needs better direction. He works with Tony Scott on an abnormally frequent basis. Many successful directors and actors have created legacies together. Scorcese and DeNiro and DiCaprio. Hitchcock and Grant and Stewart. Ford and Wayne. Huston and Bogart. There are many, many more. And you can just tick off the names of movies that will stand the test of time associated with each of these teams. On the flipside, many successful, well-known actors continue to work with the same people. This doesn't stretch their talents and they continue to make the same films. Washington has the talent to join DeNiro, Grant and Stewart. He doesn't deserve to be lumped in with actors like Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds has made an interesting transformation over the last few years. He used to do a lot of broad comedies, a lot of comedies filled with low brow humor. Then, he made \\"The Proposal\\" and has been in some action films, transforming his whole persona, trying to become a big-time movie star. His status is certainly on the rise, but the lackluster performance of \\"Green Lantern\\" and \\"The Change-Up\\" last summer didn't help. But what the diversity of his films shows is that he can do action, he can do comedy, he can do low brow. He is also a very good-looking guy, which doesn't hurt. People obviously see the potential and believe he will deliver on it.<br /><br />Reynolds does a nice job with Matt. We immediately get who he is; his ambitions, his unfulfilled promise, his boredom. These all paint a very different picture of who he actually is. Than, all of a sudden, everything in his life changes and he will have to use all of the long-dormant skills and lessons, many never used and only learned, to stay alive.<br /><br />\\"Safe House\\" holds a lot of promise, but it has a number of problems creating the equivalent of a wash. It isn't a good thing when your film is reminiscent of Tony Scott's work. When someone mentions Tony Scott, my guess is the first thing you will think of is over-editing. Editing is an art form, used to tell a story, to keep the audience engaged. How is it possible for anyone to get engaged in a story when no shot lasts more than a few seconds? Can you watch a film with a constantly moving hand-held camera? No. These are the tell-tale signs of Scott's work. It almost seems like he uses the over-editing to hide his lack of story telling ability and his lack of creativity. Because he doesn't give us time to concentrate on anything, it is more difficult for most to notice the problems. Espinosa is clearly influenced by Scott. Too bad he didn't look to Ridley, Tony's brother, for inspiration.<br /><br />If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? Using that philosophical question lets take a brief look at this suspense film. One of the key factors to a successful suspense film is that it surprises the viewer. If a suspense film doesn't have any surprises, can the audience enjoy it? Very early on, you will be able to guess who is pulling all of the strings behind the scenes. When this becomes evident, the film just becomes a long chase and you will probably be able to guess how that will end. And the little twists and turns are all predictable as well because they have to happen. The filmmakers know they need to keep us guessing, so they throw in these little moments, these little surprises.<br /><br />\\"Safe House\\" is okay. But it promises much more than it delivers.

006056251X|5.0|What can I say that already have not been said about this book... Devil in the Winter is my favorite historical romance novel. I read it every year or so and it always brings me a smile. It is entertaining, well written and witty.<br />Sebastian St. Vincent is the perfect hero: strong, smart, arrogant (but not too much). Someone who thinks he does not need anyone in life but who is also desperately longing to be loved (altghought he does not seem to realize this at first). Evie is the perfect match for Sebastian: sweet, kind, intelligent and strong.<br />If Lisa Kleypas decides one day to write another book about the life of Evie and Sebastian, I would not hesitate to buy it.

076115728X|5.0|My 6 year old son and I are both type A perfectionists. For myself, I tend to not start projects because I want them to be perfect and fear making mistakes. Even with my art, I tend to be very conservative. I've noticed that my son has become aggravated and frustrated with himself when he is unable to maintain perfection. This is a hard (and impossible) state to maintain!<br /><br />This little book has reminded both of us that even an \\"oops\\" can be \\"beautiful\\".<br /><br />Sometimes the unintended, has a purpose greater that what we initially set out to do.<br />Yes, it's \\"just\\" a kids' book. But, this is a wonderful that can be applied time and time again in other, real life situations.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.

B003A02W0I|3.0|Refreshingly, this book is nothing like [[ASIN:B002PJ4I2A Angels & Demons - Movie Tie-In: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]]. No baggage, no controversy, no obscure objets d'art, no wannabe Riddlers--just an adventure-thriller in the vein of Vince Flynn ([[ASIN:B005MWIW1U American Assassin: A Thriller]]) and Tom Clancy, with a touch of Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Brown is quite an author. I n fact, I think his two non-Langdon books are lost treasures. Ahem! He has all the elements in place, namely taking extant science and events, vibrant and bold characters, \\"wheels within wheels\\" of competing Machiavellioids, a thought-provoking MacGuffen, and put them in a super-charged situation. A page turner, to be sure, and no drag.<br /><br />It filled a gap, and reminded me how much I missed \\"[[ASIN:B0044E9JU0 24: The Complete Series]].\\" Both take dramatic license--be it the convenient submarine at the arctic or no potty breaks for 24 hours--but that is understood. Getting things right 80% of time is good enough for me.<br /><br />(And, yes, Corkie is Jar-Jar Binks [[ASIN:B00000J2AO Star Wars Episode 1 Jar Jar Binks Action Figure]].)<br /><br />And then there are Brown's women. If you could not guess from \\"The Da Vinci Code, \\" Brown is quite the feminist. Again, think of the women in all of his books. There are the career women (Rachel Sexton, Marjorie Trench, Gabrielle Ashe, Yolanda Cole, Xavia), and then there are the dead women (Katherine Sexton, Celia Birch, Diana Pickering), and there is the Sophie Neveu--the Queen of Heaven.<br /><br />All are competent, all realistic, all essential to the story. But they all seem so lonely. Of course you need a Junoesque lead female to balance the action. Wilma Deering ([[ASIN:B0002MHDW4 Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Complete Epic Series]])and Princesses Amidala and Leia are good examples of these. But a housewife can be an action heroine. Read Orson Scott Card's [[ASIN:0765355221 Empire (Tor Science Fiction)]] and[[ASIN:B0044KN2B6 Hidden Empire]].nd[[ASIN:B0044KN2B6 Hidden Empire]].

B0062QFZ10|4.0|This is a very fine recording of the Beethoven Violin Concerto in my view. Isabelle Faust has some phenomenal competition from recordings by the very greatest violinists (my collection includes Oistrakh, Perlman and Tetzlaff, for example) but she stands very well among them. Her fabulous virtuosity enables her to sail through the technical demands of the piece and to put her own emotional stamp on it. Her tone is lovely throughout and she brings real passion to the fiery passages and a true beauty and insight to the slow movement.<br /><br />It's a lovely individual performance and Abbado's conducting adds weight and warmth to it. This is a smoothly-flowing orchestral performance, clearly deeply thought about and beautifully executed. The recorded sound is rounded and resonant which I like a lot, although it does occasionally blur the sharp detail. It's a cracking performance and I think the enthusiastic reviews it has received are well justified.<br /><br />And now a confession: I don't like the Berg Violin Concerto. Sorry, but I just don't. I fully accept that this is a failing in me and no reflection on the music, but I have tried several times over the years and it does nothing for me whatsoever. I was hoping that this performance might change that, but no luck. This means, of course, that I am in no position to review Isabelle Faust's performance for which I apologise. I'm afraid you will have to ask someone else about it.<br /><br />That said, I think this disc is worth it for the Beethoven alone. I think that the Perlman/Giulini recording (included in a fantastic budget set of concerti Great Romantic Violin Concertos) remains my personal favourite, but this is certainly among the best I know, and very warmly recommended.

B003O86FMW|5.0|What an awesome sequel this was! When reading the reviews for Catching Fire, many said that it was 'like treading water'. I did not feel this way at all! Filled with just enough twists and turn to keep it exciting, but not to many that it got to be too much.<br /><br />Just like The Hunger Games, I found Catching fire nearly impossible to put down. Catching Fire is focused around yet another Hunger Games; this one being a Quarter Quel which comes every 25 years and brings a \\"twist\\" to the Games. More distaste and anger for the capitol is introduced too. Like the first, there was enough action in this sequel to keep those readers who love thrills entertained. But don't worry if you love romance! There is plenty of that with, of coarse, twists! Katniss's love deepens. For whom?? Well you'll just have to read it to find out!<br /><br />Loved, loved, loved Cathching Fire!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|When I finished the book, I felt hollow. Empty. Extremely sad. And I felt like maybe this book had been a waste to read...<br /><br />But after much thinking, I realize it wasn't. It's not.<br /><br />Katniss changes greatly in the book do to many different reasons. Reasons that I don't want to give away. She also spends a lot of her time unconscious and in shock; which to me, made the book a little dull. She struggles to adjust to her new life. To being the Mockingjay. To me, in Mockingjay, she lacked the \\"life\\" that I loved about her in the first and second books. Peeta isn't present for a large portion of the book. This made the book very interesting. One of the sole reasons why I found this book hard to put down, was because I was waiting for Peeta. But Peeta wasn't the same either. Gale is there much more than he was in The Hunger Games and in Catching Fire. This was a huge plus for me.<br /><br />Mockingjay was filled with so many twists and turns, that I (a reader who can predict almost anything) found it unpredictable! This is a huge reason why I gave 4 stars. But I didn't give more for one reason...<br /><br />Lack of romance! There was the occasional smooch and hug, but not much more... I wanted those nights where Katniss didn't have any nightmares because she was wrapped in Peeta's arms!<br /><br />Finally the ending! At first I hated it. I felt like there was so many loose-ends. I cried. Maybe it was because I had just finished an amazing series. Maybe it was because it was so sad. Katniss is still struggling, even many years down the road. But guess what?! There's a surprise! Wait! Another surprise! And yet another! These 'surprises' are what later made me very happy with this book. They are the reasons why, a few hours after finishing, I really enjoyed Mockingjay!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Best brain teaser on the site; And I'ts FREE!!!  I've played a lot of puzzle apps, this is one of the best!
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|I'm so glad we watched this on demand before ordering a DVD of the movie.  We loved the Puss character in the Shrek movies, but this movie had such a wierd plot that it was a poor vehicle for what should have been a movie that allowed Puss to show his sassiness and confidence much more.  There were only a few short scenes that even gave a hint of the Puss we saw in Shrek.  And at least in the Shrek movies, the plot didn't suddenly insert a sicene that made you say, \\"Where did his horse come from??\\"  Rent it - don't buy it!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I rarely bother writing reviews of the free apps, as most of them are fairly average. But I loved this game from the minute I loaded it. Starts quickly, concept is simple at the start, and the graphics are perfect for this style of game. The expressions on the boxes are great. And it is worth paying for.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Season 3 has lived up to our expectations.  We are loving it!!  It is definitely a must-have for any Castle fan. You will enjoy watching these episodes again and again.  We get more details on Kate's mom's murder, as well as some other very intense episodes.  You won't be disappointed.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I purchased this DVD just to watch the band as they played some of those old memory songs.  Good quality and sound.  Surprise performance by Olivia Newton John was nice.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great graphics, easy to play, harder to master but not impossible with perserverance. good replay value if you want to strive for perfection.
074356619X|5.0|Watching the DVD of the \\"Secret\\" is what prompted me to buy this CD. I really love it because it helps me to remember & follow through with this positive philosophy. I just throw it in my CD player whenever I travel anywhere...even to the store! My life has changed dramatically for the better. It's almost crazy how everything is falling into place. Listening daily to this CD has been crucial for the change that I want in my life.
B005GVA2L0|1.0|This is a review on the digipak for the Evanescence S/T Deluxe version.<br />What kind of crap package is this???  Just to get the CD out, I ended up \\"accidentally\\" ripping the thing in half.  But to be honest, how do you get the CD out without ripping it open?  The CD and booklet were jammed into a tight slit on the front cover side.  You'd think that for $14.00 (that's the cheapest price) they'd come up with a better design.  Now I'm pissed.  I don't even want to listen to the CD now.<br />I know it's not Evanescence' fault.  So who do we blame for this?  Sony?  Wind-up?<br />No wonder more and more people are just downloading the albums...

B00009MGGI|5.0|This trilogy is one of the finest series I have every seen. Every aspect of this series is perfect, from the writing, to the acting, to the casting, and the direction, all brilliant. Ian Richardson was perfect in the leading role of the viciously ambitious politician, Francis Urquart, and the rest of the cast was entirely worthy of playing opposite him. I have watched this series at least three times, and will probably watch it at least three times more.<br />[[ASIN:B00009MGGI House of Cards Trilogy (House of Cards / To Play the King / The Final Cut)]]

B006PHD0RW|5.0|I downloaded this game as the free app of the day, and have been pleasantly surprised with it since. Very original premise, bagging groceries -- I've done this as a job before, and it was often this nerve-wracking! I would recommend this game as a paying app, too.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Of course like most free apps you have pop up ads, so I don't think this one is any worse than the others - you know when they are going to appear and you just exit. I find this game to be addictive....  and just fun to play.

B00479SVBU|4.0|It works well in my car transmitting decent signal to the radio.  No annoying noise audible until I turn up the volume that I rarely (never in fact) use.<br />The navigation through the menu is not that user friendly.  It automatically turns on as soon as the car starts, I wish it is rather off and leave up to me to turn it on. It plays well through an SD card also. I would buy again if I need one more.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I just got this app not so long ago and I already love it.  you can fey any thing off youtube and be able to watch it when you are not in a wife zone and you can put stuff on as your music

B00007KQKM|1.0|I bought this flick to compare to 1981 issue with Silvia Kristel and, well, result is...boring. For obvious reasons I expected in 1992 somehow higher standards but, instead,...boring. Endless talking dont bother me but choice of actors does. I should state I didnt like any actor in this movie whereas in previous one everything was almost perfect. English movies are notoriously boring and and this one not an exception.It started promising with some class clashes but...boring.
B006ON41FC|4.0|It is a fun game and it can be challengeing but it keeps ob asking you for a review but overall it is a fun game.

B00127RAJY|1.0|The beginning was OK, but as I got into it I think it was the way she spoke to the the ladies that were helping!  The one thing that really bothered me was when she took her foot and pushed the other lady down! For those who like to be treated that way I guess it's OK. Not my thing!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I cannot fully express in words how much I truly enjoyed this book.  The characters and world created by Collins were rich in detail and didn't follow any overly predictable path.  Katniss, Peeta and Gale became characters that I cared about and I couldn't seem to put the book down until I knew what would happen to them - immediately after finishing the Hunger Games, I purchased Catching Fire... quickly followed by Mockingjay.  I highly, highly recommend this trilogy. - you will not regret reading it!

B004LWZW88|3.0|I was expecting a lot more from this movie...the previews were funnier than the movie itself. It did have a few laugh out loud parts but this would be a good movie for young children, not so much for adults. The plot was weird and didn't really make sense.. I was going off of a Shrek expectation on adult humor.

B007HJ84WS|2.0|This movie reminds me of someone growing up on 300, Troy and Braveheart.  Many of the scenes look like they were \\"stolen\\" from those that came before it.  The editing for this movie is weak and gives it a \\"choppy\\" feel.  I was looking for an action flix to kick back with, this movie didn't make the cut.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|sweet potatoe pie.  The spider is quite crafty moving around his web. And the screams from the bugs are halarious.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is a magnificently put together production. After watching the series, I decided to read the book, and while I thoroughly enjoyed it, I gained a real appreciation of script writer Sandy Welch's talents. Elizabeth Gaskell never had the opportunity to develop North & South to the extent that she wanted, but I have no doubt that she would have been extremely pleased with Welch's interpretation. She adds so many wonderful elements to the story, with the most remarkable being the ending, of course. I must admit that I was a bit disappointed with the novel's conclusion, as it ended rather hastily, making it seem unpolished, whereas the end of the miniseries brings the story full circle in such a spectacular way. Sure, some have criticized it for being un-Victorian, but it is intended for a modern audience. Had the ending been in keeping with Victorian traditions, it would not be as memorable, and I certainly don't think I'd want to watch those last 5 minutes over and over again, as I have countless times already.<br /><br />Whoever did the casting for this production is a sheer genius. Everyone was cast absolutely perfectly. Of course, what is there left to say about Richard Armitage as John Thornton? The man is a brilliant actor and it is easy to see how he has amassed an army of loyal female fans. I am certainly looking forward to seeing more of him onscreen. I thought Daniela Denby-Ashe was exquisite in the role of Margaret Hale, and the more I watch the movie, the more I appreciate her fine acting talents. I looked to see what else I may watch her in, but unfortunately I could not find much accessible. I have just started watching Downtown Abbey and was delighted to find Brendan Coyle, who plays Nicholas Higgins in North & South, in it. He is simply a joy to watch. Of course, Sinéad Cusack was fabulous as Mrs. Thornton, and I can just go on and on. I actually feel a bit guilty not naming all of the fine actors in this miniseries because everyone brought some magic to the table. The behind the scenes folks should also be applauded, from the director and producer, to the set designers, to the costume designers and make-up folks. A lot of love and thought went into this miniseries and it shows.<br /><br />In summation, this miniseries is a must-watch, and I do think that many men would enjoy it as well, as this story has so many layers beyond its evolving love story. As for the DVD itself, I definitely recommend it. I received it one Christmas, but never found the opportunity to watch it. I was reminded of this series again when I finally saw it was available on Netflix, and a few days after watching it through, I finally cracked open my DVD because I wanted to soak it all in again. I am glad that I did. The version that streams on Netflix cuts out or shortens a few scenes. While this does not necessarily detract from the story, you do miss out on some interesting scenes and perspectives. The DVD also has some nice bonus features, including a narrated first and fourth chapter, where you gain interesting insights into how and where scenes were shot and what transpired during filming. You also have access to the deleted scenes and an interview with Richard Armitage.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The Hunger Games is great.  However, the formatting randomly changes font and it is really irritating.  Font is large and then tiny without changing the font by the user.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so much fun. At first, I thought it was dumb, but as I played it, the game got more exciting. Great investment!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|so fun I was a little skeptical but this is an awesome app.  fun and challenging mentally.  must have time waster that's fun
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I've dissed Springsteen's last couple of studio albums; the lack of passion and vocal distance in Magic and Working on a Dream were just too disappointing to this long-time fan.  But Brendan O'Brien's production is gone (hooray!!) in Wrecking Ball and you can feel Bruce close and intense throughout the album.  I'm sure the haters will say, \\"oh yeah, super-rich Springsteen sings for the downtrodden again, boo, hoo,\\" but the thing is, he voices real emotions that nobody else talks about, and he makes you FEEL them.<br /><br />The sound is different here too.  Tempos are generally pretty slow, but the percussion is satisfyingly powerful.  I think the live versions of Land of Hope and Dreams ([[ASIN:B00005AFVR Live In New York City (2CD)]] and American Land ([[ASIN:B000P1KTVY Live In Dublin]]) are better than the versions here, and I wish there were a couple of danceable songs for leavening, but on the whole this is a passionate, deeply moving album from the master.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|works great on touchpad with cm7. tablet optimized graphics look great. five star reviews are well deserved.  addicting gameplay. enjoying the story.
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game, the only thing that I don't like is that you don't see how much $ you need to upgrade the buildings
B003274QH6|5.0|I usually don't watch any TV series that air, but after someone mentioned this show was about a high school chemistry teacher making meth I couldn't resist.  This show is very unique in that the plot is highly unpredictable because of the characters.  This is constant throughout each episode and keeps you wanting more.  I plan on buying all the seasons.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|How do you have a note that is set up on the calendar - show on the workspace as a true note that I can check off?
B004DM1ZQY|1.0|Yeah, love the game and its look, but when the computer gets all of its pieces on its home side and starts throwing 4 to 6 sets of doubles while you get 1 and 2 rolls, you know the author set it up so you lose on purpose.  Uninstalled immediately after the first game played.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really. like this app. good graghics. the price is rite.the app is fast and accurate. I use it all the time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book--the first of the three--is a great opening for the trilogy. It may not have been edited as closely as the others, there are a lot of errors, but the story is absolutely enthralling. It has everything one could want in a book: romance, murder, intrigue, mystique, and a corrupt dystopian society. This is \\"The Running Man\\" for young adults, and a great addition to any mature reader who loves a good story.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|helps pass time on slow days at work. plus has a verity of games to pick from. its not a bad app

B005URRCUY|4.0|I have the last three Keys CD's.  I love their sound and highly recommend them. I do have an observation:  I first downloaded Brothers and thought \\"This sounds distant, somewhat fuzzy, perhaps this is a bad download.\\"  So, I bought the CD, same thing.  The same production values are apparent with El Camino. I even went out and purchased a 100 watt Yamaha receiver to go with my Mission 765's.  I played \\"loud\\" and still felt the production values are distant and not robust.  In many ways, I like Attack and Release, mainly because the sound is more clear and full.  Anyway, go Keys and I plan on seeing them in concert and am a huge fan.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game for myself and my kids. easy to understand instructions. a little bit of a pain to gather the points needed to add other games but overall fun.

0062060562|2.0|After reading reviews on Amazon you will conclude that this is the kind of book you will either love or hate...not much in between. The haters almost had me convinced to pass on this one, but as it was our book club selection, I caved and ponied up the $13.00 for the ebook. Turns out the haters were right.<br />First,it is very repetitive as Christine tries to remember her life anew ...every...single...day.  By the middle of the book, I was hoping for amnesia myself; to forget my obligation to the book club.<br />Second, it was painfully obvious to me that this story, supposedly told from a woman's perspective, was written by a man. When she describes certain of her thoughts, like an anticipation of a date with her husband and what will occur afterward, she wonders if they will become intimate later. But that's not how it's written. The author goes straight to the f-word (as he does frequently.) I mean, I know women use that word, but in this context when she is getting ready to go out, dreamily putting on sexy lingerie and perfume, the mood calls for a romantic \\"make love\\" or at worst the clinical \\"have sex\\".<br />Not only that, the author doesn't seem to understand how fiercly a woman will fight for her child. When she's told that her only son died in a war, she doesn't ask for proof. It occurs to her to ask about the gravesite, but she's afraid of displeasing her husband. Really?? She doesn't ask for, or seek his death certificate or his military records. She finally discovers an obituary, but it's all so matter-of-fact as she grieves each day as if it's the first time she's heard of his death.<br />I will say that after slogging through the first 3/4 of the book, the story did pick up and got pretty interesting for awhile.  Though, after the painful detailing of Christine's life in the first part, the ending is surprisingly sparse. The energy fizzles out like a balloon that's come untied.<br />This book was written in a writing class and it feels like it. I thought the premise was good and they are going to make it into a movie. I hope the screenwriters do a better job of writing it.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|As he says early in the book, \\"you will learn nothing new here\\". It's true, you have already heard all you need to know to be successful, but he puts it in a very organized order then motivates you by using common sense to do it.<br /><br />I have read dozens of these self help books but this is the first one that has really inspired me to get started in a daily systematic way.<br /><br />A little too much filler and pointless drawings for my tastes (beginning to think I am a Type A personality) but all in all and great book.<br />I would recommend this book no matter what your goal is, and I look forward to reading his future books.<br /><br />This was the Kindle version of the book.

0553277472|1.0|The author constantly defends his head games by trying to explain why people dislike head games, but this does not make the head games any more palatable. What a book. The other one star reviews have said it all: boring, dry, heady, rambling, burdensome, sluggish, heavy. And if that weren't enough, it's got mid-life-crisis written all over it.<br /><br />The one thing that really gets me is the author's note at the beginning:<br /><br />\\"What follows is based on actual occurrences. Although much has been changed for rhetorical purposes, it must be regarded in its essence as fact...\\"<br /><br />Are you kidding?<br /><br />Personally I say you're much better off - philosophically, spiritually, logically, rationally, romantically and in terms of quality - reading the Gita, or a Michael Chrichton thriller.<br /><br />Two thumbs the heck down for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|These wolves are Huge!  This is a different type of show for Liam to be in but it turned out quite well. It would have been a good movie with just the trying to survive in the Alaskan wilderness but then when you add the wolves it makes it 2x better. How they survived for so long was really clever but the ending kind of bothered me a little bit. It's like the Edge but its with wolves!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A fun game that develops. problem solving skills and patience.  there are do-overs. so, one can learn the moves easily enough while still being challenged.
1451626657|2.0|It took me a while to get into this. And the humor was the only thing keeping me going throughout, that and how it's juxtaposed with these scenes of war-induced brutality and human venality. Heller moves, often disorientingly, between the two. We get a a really funny exchange between army officers, then an incredibly tense, well wrought depiction of a bombing run over an Italian city. It definitely stretches between the psychological extremes of (what I infer from what military people tell me) what it feels like to actually be in a war. You have these long moments of dull, bureaucratic stasis and personal malaise, punctuated with brief moments of \\"oh god oh god oh god oh god they're shooting at me oh god oh god oh god I'm going to die here\\".<br />I guess this seemed like a powerful indictment of authority circa 1961, and in a lot of ways it does antedate a lot of what the sixties was about. I guess if you're a baby boomer, it probably does seem like an unqualified masterpiece from your youth. For a young adult in 2010, not so much.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great! awesome gane play. Challenging,  yet relaxing. Earn hints for the harder puzzles.  nce music. beautiful graphics.  various and advancing levels.  fun foe all ages. warning: addictive.
0375701427|5.0|I can't think of many novels which do a better job of exploring the disconnect between different generations of people than this. It's a powerful, wrathful sort of work, and it explores rage itself, whether it's the sort that's motivated by clearly stated principles and old-world values or just disorienting, unaccountable, seething anger. Roth refuses to sell any of these characters up the river, and treats them all with a level of generosity and compassion that, without which, would probably make this an excruciating read. It would have been so easy to endlessly ridicule the Levov's descent from grace with the rise of the modern America. Instead, Roth fights for his characters, showing where their ideals come from and making you realize that a life, and all of the thoughts which go into making one, are too important and too vital to merely wave away for the sake of easy moralizing. Even if those same ideals blow up in your face. It's a powerful, often harrowing examination of what an American family is. I can't recommend this highly enough. This is the only novel that has ever made me cry.
0062059882|4.0|I devoured this book in what is pretty much record time for me to read something this long. The only thing that kept me from giving it a full five stars is Gaiman's tendency to, well, meander. I feel that at times, especially in this Tenth Anniversary edition, he overindulged in that tendency. Nevertheless, it's a fantastic tale with a satisfying conclusion. No spoilers here. Just go read it.
0062082353|5.0|Could not put the damn book down. Finished it in two days. A compelling story about a true warrior. Chris Kyle is an American hero.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|must strongly disagree with the naysayers: this is the strongest springsteen album in years.  musically diverse and inspired, lyrically simple, honest and thought-provoking.  if you're truly listening, it grabs and holds on the first play.  one of those increasingly rare albums that gets your attention and rewards it.  this is anything but a failure.  and, it is possessed of hope, not hatred or surrender.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|more free games love the ones on here wish I had more time to play them y'all are doing great
B0054JZC6E|5.0|to be short this app is awesome!!!! a lot of games and there all easy and level 1, but there skillful games that are great for gammers
B0000062FJ|5.0|Just been back to my old love of listening to home stereo after years of listening thru headphones at work.<br />From someone who's been listening to this gem in its LP,CD,and now re-mastered<br />CD version on and off since 1970: it's a definite sonic improvement over the first cd version and a must have!! The sound is audibly cleaner<br />and clearer. I listen to it on a system with Carver sonic holography thru a pair of<br />Dahlquist DQ-10s and the sound is just unbelievable. Get it and you'll be glad you did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like it because it is not complex and it is very simple and there are games ive never played on before
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Lots of fun! Get it! The puzzles are clever and often challenging--you have to be creative &amp; patient to solve the hard ones. Some are sort of annoying, but as a whole, it's a great way to clear your mind during a coffee break, or just &quot;chillaxin&quot; at home. Some music would be nice, so would better graphics (it's very flat &amp; 2D)  but the physics are spot on.
1423113381|1.0|I was so excited to see that Rick had published another series about children and mythology that I went out and bought the series without actually reading them - thought it would be great like the Percy series but boy was I disappointed!!!  I really tried to like it but after toiling over it I actually got upset about my time being wasted.  The experience was a horrible waste of time - reading about unlikeable protagonists, boring storyline, and issues that made me roll my eyes so many times I thought I was going into convultions.  Ricky's name has now lost some luster and I will never go into a purchasing spree in regards to his books without doing some investigative work first.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun set of games for my children. they like the various games it offers and they like the challenge of earning points to open new games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is hours of fun.I think every one should get it.u have to get it. trust me.
0312641893|5.0|This was a great read.  I was hooked when I downloaded the first five chapters free.  Then had to buy the rest of the book.  I finished it in one sitting.  Cinder was easy to love, her sense of right and wrong, her insecurity about Kai, and her miserable situation with her step-mother.  Her fierce loyalty to her sister and her droid made her that much more of a hero.  The prince Kai was easy to love as well.  His need to care for his subjects over his need to care for his self, his devotion to his father, and the willingness to take the responsibility of the crown at such a young age were the main reasons.  My favorite part was both Cinder and Kai's  sarcasm and wit that kept me amused throughout the book.  I will look forward to book 2 and the adventure continuing.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|love the app. so convenient to use.  like having various versions at my fingertips. the highlighting and bites feature is cool too. will be using this app more and more. sometimes taking notes is tricky.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I enjoy the daily reading plans and the reminders. Has helped me develop a good reading plan. I would most definitely  recommend this app
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app introduces the power of your desktop/laptop to your Kindle Fire.  Everything that you can do on your desktop you can now do on your Kindle Fire... well almost.  I often attempt to watch DVD movies using this app.  Occasionally it works flawlessly, but far to often the connection continuously crashes.  :(  I have not had the time to troubleshoot the problem and so its instability may be due to User error. Apart from this one issue I highly recommend this app.
B004LWZW88|5.0|Love it, love it, love it! My granddaughter just became the recipient of this movie and has watched it over and over. It even has grandpa enthralled! It's a keeper!
B005ZB91KY|4.0|This was a nice movie to watch.  I like the fact that they broke away from the standard where the hero gets the girl.  It was tastefull.  I wonder when the sequel will be out?
B004I744AS|5.0|Best of all it free and very informational. Not had much time with it, but I'm very pleased. This is a must have while being a student.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It was a nice way to blow off some steam. I was skeptical, but ended up really enjoying it.
B0058DRUV6|2.0|If being obsessive-compulsive about one thing is a prerequisite to greatness, I'm going to start feeling much better about mediocrity.
B005HP2JAM|2.0|I have recently gotten into home theatre 3D and started buying up as many titles that appeared to be fun or interesting to watch. Above all the movies,documentaries,and iMax releases, Cave of Forgotten Dreams was the worst one of them all. It was just plain BORING. All of the people on camera didn't even seem to be enjoying themselves and after you see the cave paintings in the first 10 minutes of the documentary, the rest was just a poor attempt to lengthen the film. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is so awesome.  Its relaxing and its the only majong game that has a story to it.  I love it!
B0013FSXT6|5.0|I don't know if you know this but, it could be a dream or it could be reality.  Make sense?  If you view this film, you will constantly question your own reality.  Make sense?  Stabley Twobricks is maybe the like bestest and kewlest moving picture maker person in eggsinstance.  Make sense?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best app in the world. you sould really get this app.  but sometimes its hard but really good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this book because of the favorable reviews on Amazon.  I am not disappointed.  For those of you who like stories about people and how they respond in difficult situations this book is for you.  The science fiction is only as a backdrop for a very good story about people.  Highly recommended.

B000002J3W|5.0|I was just listening to Skid Row Subhuman Race. If you missed this last album with the original band go back and listen. It is so heavy, I love it!
B001675YQ6|5.0|I enjoy Brittany Murphy's movies. Amazon suggested this movie to me. I enjoyed it very much. I also think that Brittany looked very beautiful. I loved her makeup and her hair looked great in each shot. I haven't seen all of her movies. But from the ones I have seen, I think she looks the best in this movie.
B0038P59A0|2.0|Technical quality of movie was very good, but movie was only fair. I found the story line less than great. I felt a Sherlock Holmes movie could have provided a better story.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Great way to access and do minor editing on Office files, especially for files that are stored in the cloud.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games<br />some are, stupid so are fun. some games you are in a space ship but some u jump out a elevator.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I have loved Sinead O'Connor since her first album came out and I have bought every CD she's put out since.  Some where ok, some were a bit crazy and a little lame but this new CD is amazing.  She is back to her old form, her voice sounds better than ever.  The songs are very personal which is what we have come to expect from her.  My favorite song is Queen of Denmark, it's a bitingly realistic story about some one who is full of themselves and Sinead speaks from her heart in a raw and honest way.  It's great to see her back and making great music again.  I would highly recommend this CD!
B004XECNCW|4.0|I had not seen this film since it came on cable for the first time.  I almost did not want to see it again, but I forgot how good it was!  Do not let the price deceive you, this is a well put together product!<br /><br />The picture is very clear, although film-like with a lot of pop, but it does have that slight orange look that a lot of films from the era have, but you hardly notice it.  The sound is great and this disc is all-around flawless.  What I like are the extras!  Of course they have the music video \\"Growing Up in the Hood\\" by MC Eight, who I thought was one of the better west coast rapper with jherri curls!  It is good to see that video again.<br /><br />There are also actor auditions which I loved!  They had the Ice Cube audition which I see how he got the role besides his fame.  He did a very good job.  Morris Chestnut must have gotten the role based on looks alone since he did not impress me at all!  Angela Bassett is a TRUE actress in case you did not know!  Just in an audition she just brought her character to life!  I get impress with people who really get deep into their craft!<br /><br />Go get this disc as the price is right!
1594630844|5.0|When I was young I asked my parents and in-laws to tell me what they had learned by living and they did not answer.  This book provides the answers I was seeking.  I am in the age category of the respondents and found the book helpful and true.  I have recommended it to my children and my friends.<br />The author writes well making the book interesting to read.  I am glad I bought this from Amazon in book form (rather than ebook) so I can lend it to friends.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|worked well on nexus s.  very fun and enjoyable puzzle game.  realistic physics animations.  the animation of facial expression makes it more amusing.  highly recommended.
1423140591|5.0|The Son of Neptune is the second in the Heroes of Olympus series which is set not long after the original Percy Jackson series. The Son of Neptune finds Percy Jackson confused and lost remembering only a few bits of his past and who he is. He soon discovers Camp Halfblood's Roman equivalent. We get to see how the Roman camp functions and its reaction to their part in the prophecy of 7. Percy teams up with his new friends to complete a quest and hopefully get back his memory and reunite with Annabeth the one person he can vaguely recall from his lost past.<br />  This book expands the mythology by further exploring the Greek and Roman equivalents of mythology. It is also written a little bit older. While I loved the original series the writing was geared towards a younger audience which I found annoying at times but these books are more young adult making the writing style a bit more adult friendly. I also enjoy that these books are written from multiple characters points of view.<br />  Eagerly looking forward to the next in the series which based on its title will hopefully bring us more  Annabeth who I really missed in this book.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Love this game. I like that it starts out super easy until you get the hang of it, but it quickly gets challenging, which I love. I enjoy games that make me think.  The only improvement I would like to see is hints,  but it is a great game anyway.
0142410373|5.0|I just read this again after something like 20 years, and still SOOOO good! Matilda is a child character but has so much to teach adults. Her powers are just an extension of her strength of will and smarts and confidence. Its so rare to find a book that speaks to kids as much as adults. It goes without saying the writing and story are wonderful, tightly-written, and supremely funny. My new old favorite book.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Tremendously useful on my Kindle fire, laptop, home Pc, windows phone, or at work!  8ve been using it for a few weeks but I couldn't imagine life without it.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|A great little thinking game involving graphical representation of vector addition and projectile motion.  Among the 100 puzzles, are several that will take you multiple attempts to solve.  Enjoyment for &quot;kids&quot; of all ages.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I own a Kindle Fire, and really liked this cover, but the front flap, which is supposed to fold into a stand is worthless. It kept falling down, so I returned the item.<br /><br />Then, I purchased a case and stand separately (7 Inch Tablet Zip Sleeve for Amazon Kindle Fire and Belkin Flip Blade Stand).  Am extremely happy with my new purchases.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|a little confusing. had to use map and hints to get anywhere. very frustrated because I had not played in awhile and when I went back to resume where I had left off, everything was gone and I was back to screen one. uninstalled at that time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|One of my all time favorite. If your going to buy a game don't. 1st its free.2nd its the best game ever. Oh. And get the cheat code for it its only 1.99c. I like to trick my friends and say I beat the game. And it says its only 4 1/2 stars it should be 5 stars. Well you can tell I like angry birds. So my favorite is mighty eagle like not everybody who is stuck on a level they should make a store just for angry birds.
0761169253|5.0|This opened my eyes.<br />It's well written and easy to read.<br />Think different and have fun. I highly recommend this book.

B006PHD0RW|4.0|I like this game and all but some levels are really hard and you cant skip them... over all I think its and fun and totally worth the money you should get
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so much variety, some I love and some not so much.  too good to be free, but glad it was!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun for everybody! Hours. and hours of fun be careful or you will find yourself up all night playing trying to get to the next game

0385344228|4.0|William Landay has kicked off the year by penning the legal thriller that will be the one to beat in 2012.<br /><br />DEFENDING JACOB combines both psychological thriller elements along with intense courtroom scenes. The novel has already been compared to other legal classics as Scott Turow's PRESUMED INNOCENT and even Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.<br /><br />Assistant District Attorney Andy Barber has his normally serene New England lifestyle rocked by the brutal slaying of a fourteen-year-old boy named Ben Rifkin. Everyone knows each other in Andy Barber's small town and he is no stranger to the Rifkin's. Andy's own son, Jacob, is a classmate of Ben Rifkin --- that makes the shock of this senseless murder that much more powerful.<br /><br />At the onset, the criminal case begins and ends with a local pedophile that has a history of molesting young boys and sometimes becoming violent. While Andy and his legal team are pursuing that conviction a startling wrinkle is thrown into the case. It appears that several posts on various social media sites by Ben Rifkin's classmates are pointing an accusing finger at Andy's son, Jacob Barber.<br /><br />As evidence begins to mount against Jacob, Andy is removed from the case due to conflict of interest and suspended. Stepping in now is one of Andy's blood-thirsty colleagues, Neil Logiudice, who is seeking to make a big name for himself by bringing down Jacob Barber (and Andy's career in the process). Andy's world is rocked and he and his wife, Laurie, must now deal with not only the legal defense of their only son but also the ostracizing their family is now subjected to by the rest of their close-knit community.<br /><br />Andy hires a friend of his, Jonathan Klein, to defend Jacob. Andy and Laurie have to sit by quietly and hope for the best as the testimony about Jacob's motivation to kill his bullying classmate, Ben Rifkin, comes to light during the course of the trial. To make matters worse, Andy has a family secret that he has kept from even his own wife. His estranged father is an infamous criminal currently serving a life sentence. It turns out the Barber family has a history of violence --- one in which Neil Logiudice is sure to exploit in court.<br /><br />One of the more interesting premises in DEFENDING JACOB is the possibility of there being a `murder gene' and the realistic possibility that Jacob could be afflicted with it. The quandary that this poses is whether or not to plead Jacob guilty and use the murder gene defense or continue to protest his innocence. Without revealing any major plot twists, there are more than a few doubts in Andy and Laurie Barber's minds about their son, Jacob, and that keeps this novel consistently interesting.<br /><br />Just when the reader thinks they have things figured out, William Landay hits you with another curve-ball that will have you rethinking everything you thought you knew up to that point. DEFENDING JACOB is a top-notch and engaging thriller that never falters in intensity and will appeal greatly to fans of both psychological and court-room based thrillers!<br /><br />Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader
B0053O89WY|5.0|What a way to go back and revisit episodes from the past. This is one of the funniest shows if you're into that type of humor. This one is still on back order, but I have received up dates in email. Lot's of laughs already from seasons 1-4.

The series is finished and I have to admit, I enjoyed this book the best out of all three. That has never happened to me before.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting this book down. I wanted to know when WICKED would reveal the tricks and lies. They had a pretty good lie toward the end that kind threw me.<br /><br />Thomas and his shank friends have been through trial after to trial so WICKED can find a cure for the Flare. But this time, Thomas is ready to be on his own and he escapes from WICKED. But is this a trick too? Another trial? Will they ever escape the clutches of the group who thinks they are on the verge of a cure? Just slim it and read the book.<br /><br />James stayed true to the characters through this last book. They have to make hard decisions, escape from tons of scary and hard situations and still be strong.

B005UBNKZG|4.0|This thing is sweet. Be sure to install the windows 7 updates for it. Before the updates, most of the time this thing was using four cores unless it ran into something intensive and then it would utilize all 8 cores. After update, it uses all cores on almost all programs which keeps cpu usage very very low, even when using cpu hungry applications. Install windows hotfixes in this order, per microsoft: KB2645594 and second, KB2646060. I have a radeon hd 5770  and would lag while playing metro 2033 on high settings with a amd 4 core. With this chip and the same graphics card, it runs smooth. games are still CPU hungry and this chip will appease any modern game. If you plan to overclock, get a better heatsink and a good case. I have a coolermaster 430, 8 gigs of 1066 ram, msi 870A-g54 FX motherboard,  500 gig sata WD green hard drive,550 watt power supply, an artic freezer pro 7 heatsink (replaced fan with a 80mm speed adjustable fan) and windows 7 pro 64 bit. I have this beast overclocked at 3.8 with amd cool and quiet activated(turbo boost off). I am not gonna go for 4ghz cause i don't need it and i would get liquid cooling if i ever decided that i needed more speed. it runs at 28-29C idle. when i play games that run the chip at 3.8 for 30min  or more, the chip never reaches 40C (38C max for me) with room temp 72-73F. safe max temp for this chip is 61C. I am well below that.I will give a heads up in the summer. I do have 120mm silent fans on all 6 available case fan spots and my computer is still fairly quiet, quieter than my old case that had 3 case fans. A good case is crucial. i got the coolermaster 4 pack silent case fans for 12 bucks and some change here in amazon. Super bang for your buck. Don't listen to the bad reviews. this thing does bulldoze. I stressed all the 8 cores to %100 and the computer was still responsive :). This thing should be able to run better, but it still runs super fast. We'll see what happens in the future. I believe this thing is very future proof as software catches up to 8 cores. software just caught up with 4 cores. You will NOT be disappointed. Anther thing, don't be a goon and drop this thing in an incompatible motherboard, RAM and then give it a bad review like the others. It took me about 4 hours of reading product reviews and searching the internet to pick out the right parts just to make sure i wasn't gonna goof, but that is just me. I gave it 4 stars cause AMD couldn't download a copy of windows 7 ,from the pirate bay or something, to have all the angles of this chip tested.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very addicting and a good time killer with the selection of different types of games available for play.
B006ON41FC|4.0|I love this game LOL.BUT right when I was going to hit a tree it froze and it took me 1 week to fix it I cant believe that but you should buy that game its good.  GO NUTS
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was holding on the every word Collins wrote. I could barely put it down, there were nights when i got barely any sleep because of the book. I had to literally force myself to stop reading, and I am not the biggest fan of reading. She made you get attached to the characters, so attached you grow to love and hate them. Collins writes in a way that makes you feel like you are there with Katniss living out her adventures. From the reaping to the berries she sucked my in word by word. I was actually excited to come home and read. Some days I said the only thing I'm looking forward to is reading! I love the Hunger Games books, and hope that the movie is as good as they are.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|My title for this review says it all. Much in line with the Blu-ray version of the 25th anniversary concert of Les Mis, never for a moment will you think you were anywhere else than orchestra center seats at your favorite venue viewing the show. This concert presentation was beautifully staged. The principles and custumes were out of this world, the whole production wildly received by a sold out audience. Do your self a big favor and add this DVD to your collection. You'll never go wrong if you do so.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|You will not regret purchasing this album. It grows on you. Every song a deep view inside your soul. The songs meld into one another.  Another \\"Abbey Road.\\"
1451648537|5.0|For a rare and inconsistent reader like me, the book was captivating. Not just because of the hype created about Steve's health in the blogosphere and media but also because of the man himself. I for one never really liked Apple for their irrational pricing of their products, especially in India. This book has done to me what Steve had intended to do any curious reader of this book; convert that poor soul to Mac. I'm already doing research of buying atleast the cheapest available Mac Mini!<br /><br />Walter has got himself sucked so much into the Reality Distortion Field of Steve that made him let Steve tell the world what he wanted to. This is an amazing book about a person, both charismatic and despicable at the same time, who loved his company more than anything else, made someone like Walter write a biography and make him write what he wanted to write without even the letting the writer realize that.<br /><br />Even though this book is written in an excellent way which made me read and finish(!!) it within a few days, it'd have been better if more insight to Steve's early life is given, why he came to India, the spiritual side of him, an interview of Mr.Brilliant and so on and so forth. I'd agree with some of the readers of this book that this book seems like more of an Apple campaign rather than Steve Jobs' biography and would like to tell them that Steve did what he wanted to. No one can change that. Also, I'm starting to feel that anyone who calls himself marketing guru shouldn't really do so, because he should realize that he's been living in the era of Steve Jobs, the real marketing guru.<br /><br />And one more thing, this book is absolutely meant for Apple haters like me to know more about Steve and the others of his time and hence a must read.
B005PTQPU0|2.0|I've been a fan of Kate Bush for nearly 30 years, and I don't need to repeat here what so many have said before me, namely that she's innovative, wonderfully quirky, and completely awesome. I love her. I have every album, including a few of the hard-to-find imports and off-cuts. So I'm a bonafide fan. That's why it pains me to say that this album is really difficult to listen to. I've given it several runs, hoping that it would grow on me, but it hasn't. For the most part, the album consists of a series of overly-long tracks that never seem to go anywhere. I keep waiting for something to happen in each song, like a breakout or a transition, but it never does. With only a couple of exceptions, the album just seems to be song after song of Kate wailing and noodling on the piano. This album is sure to try the patience of even the most ardent fans.<br /><br />I can completely appreciate her desire to do something new, and I can also appreciate the difficulty of doing that while meeting the expectations of die-hard fans. Long-time fans never really know what to expect when a new Kate Bush album comes out, but for the most part we roll with whatever she wants to do and end up loving the results. I just can't seem to get there on this one. :(
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I loved the Scorch Trials! The Maze Runner was okay for me, however, the Scorch Trials for me was much better. I like the setting(s) much better in the second book. Much more action. Like mentioned in other reviews, Wicked is a little more involved in this book, although, not much more is revealed about them. The kids find themselves thrown out once again to defend themselves against some of the wierdest foes. Who to trust and not to trust, that is the question. Cannot wait to read the next book!
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Really worth watching it. Director showed both the value of a life and fragrance of love through a single shot.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I saw something about this book in a magazine about a month before it was going to come out, and I literally couldn't wait to read it. Diana was such an awesome leading lady, so independent and full of fire. And Matthew, don't even get me started on him, I loved him so much.<br />This was definitely not your typical witches and vampires book, it had depth and substance. When it ended, I screamed at my Kindle because I wanted more. I will totally be buying the next one when it comes out.
0439023491|5.0|i promise you're going to love the ending....I come out of nowhere, in a way.  Mockingjay unlike Catching Fire is powerful and sad rather then epic. fyi.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|After looking forward to this movie for some time I was really disappointed after watching. Nothing held my interest and there was so little fantasy in this fantasy it just crawled. And who decided Mickey Rourke should lead this film? As he claws his way through it in some of the most horrid costume design I've ever seen you want to run screaming from the TV.<br /><br />It seems the writers were given free run on rewriting mythology but then no one took advantage of it to make a decent film. You end up asking whose mythology is this? Why are the Titans stuck in a mountain? Why do the gods look like kids on their way to playschool? If they're immortal why are they dying in the end? Just one big IMMORTAL MISTAKE!
1118156315|5.0|Tim Clark has scored a home run with Business Model You.  In this age of career uncertainty and life transitions for a substantial part of the population the Business Model canvas approach presents a welcome and needed alternative in the personal improvement, life planning genre.<br /><br />Business Model You has several unique elements.  First, use of the Business Model Canvas for personal planning helps an individual understand how organizations and business operate.  Second, the book challenges to the reader to understand one's current life and career situation. Last, and most, important the approach permits developing a future \\"You\\" canvas of goals, aspirations, and dreams.<br /><br />This book is suitable for those at life transitions such as completing high school, starting college, changing jobs, or even planning retirement.  The high quality graphics make the book easy to read and use.
1592242863|5.0|I received this book yesterday and feel like I'm touching an important part of history. I love that it is a facsimile of the first edition from 1859.  In homeschooling my kids, I feel this is an important part of their educational resources, being one who believes the theory of evolution is spot on.  Another reviewer was unhappy about the blank space which surrounds the text, however, I find this to be not only a non-issue, but frankly, like the idea of having space on the pages for our own notes and observations.  Both of my kids like to pencil in their ideas and comments when reading anything, and this bonus space will be appreciated for years to come.<br /><br />Lastly, I'd like to add that I chose to purchase this book after reading the wonderful biography of \\"Charles and Emma, Darwin's Leap of Faith\\" by Deborah Heiligman, which I highly recommend to anyone, in spite of it being labeled for the \\"young adult\\" audience.  As a mother who watched my infants grow and evolve before my eyes (and continue to do so), I especially enjoyed learning how Mr. Darwin so lovingly cared for and \\"observed\\" his own babies and their many attributes and instinctual behaviors, which contributed to his growing theory of evolution.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is the best concert DVD I have ever seen and listened to.  I also have the CD and play it over an over.  The musicianship is top notch.  Clapton orchestrated the concert, and is superb!  George's music is timeless, and Eric's arrangements bring it to life all over again.<br /><br />Very heartfelt and touching performances throughout, with Ringo and Paul playing together for the first time since the Beatles broke up.<br /><br />Highlights:<br />1. \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" with Billy Preston on vocals and organ, builds to a moving chorus mixed with the \\"Hey Jude\\" chorus.<br />2. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" with great guitar licks by Clapton, and McCartney playing the opening piano intro... awesome!<br />3. \\"Wah Wah\\", with everyone on stage, four drummers, including Ringo, having a great time, makes you wish you were on stage jamming with them.<br /><br />As you can see, this got 5-star ratings from everyone.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.
B001LF347E|4.0|Really nice series except it really needs a spell to transform Gwenevere into a pretty woman. No disrespect for her quality as an actress but her look is seriously challenged...
B00511PTWM|1.0|First off this thing is way too big for any car, truck or SUV.<br /><br />Secondly, everytime I hit a bump, make a turn, roll down my window or the dog farts, the damn thing turns off. I have tried everything to get a tighter fit inthe socket but it just doesn't work. Sometimes I'll be driving and the damn thing just falls out of the socket and onto the floor. I drive a newer Honda Element so I know it's not the car. Most of the time, I won't know that it's come loose and stopped charging because the indicator LED light stopped working on it months ago. So when I get to my location and realize that the device I was charging never got a charge, it's a bit irritating.<br /><br />I plan on using it for target practice. The dog may want to take a leak on it too because it's fallen on his head a few times and he wants payback...I can see it in his eyes. It's been useless for charging anything consistantly without shutting off.

0307593312|2.0|Read almost all of the hardcover before having to return it to the library.  I bought the kindle version of this book to finish the last fourth, and I just missed the one week return window.  I would have finished it earlier, but the last quarter of the book was absolutely terrible.  For all the abuse that Fuka Eri gets about her bad writing style, Murakami could have taken a page out of her book (and roughly 300 out of his own).  How many times do we need to hear about Tengo grilling his nasty dried fish?  How many times do we need to revisit the time that Aomame and Tengo held hands?  How many times does ugly bug man need to curl up like an ugly bug?  Or worse, how many times will he recite the embarrassing names he makes up for the neighbors in the surveillance scenes that are so boring they feel as if you're also doing 24 hour surveillance in real time?  The saddest part?  Ugly bug man was still one of the most 3-dimensional characters in the book.<br /><br />I also liked the way that Murakami will break into the narrative, mostly towards the end of the book, to remind us of things that we might not realize are happening.  Guess what? These reminders are somewhat superfluous as these events have already happened, like, four times!<br /><br />At about this point, somebody will probably make the argument that this book has A Dreamlike Style.  I completely agree, but I think that this style comes less from repetition and more from echoes across chapters/between characters.  I was really excited when I started reading this book, the way that there were eerie similarities between events and characters.  For example, right after we hear about the Little People for the first time, the dowager describes her butterflies as being \\"like little people.\\"  But none of these creepy overlaps, which in my opinion were by far the best part of the book, ever go anywhere.  The little people are surprisingly tame.  They just come out of people's mouths.  They might as well be littleplaque monsters in a toothpaste commercial.  And most of the other foreshadowing/hints go unresolved.  At the end, I didn't really care about Aomame and Tengo (if this book had two paper moons, they were these flat characters), I just wanted some sort of awesome, creepy climax.<br /><br />I could have forgiven the glacial pace of the last few sections, the pages and pages spent describing the breasts of every single female character (except maybe the dowager?), the Twilight-ish pregnancy, the lifeless characters....if there had been a satisfactory ending.  But instead the ending is a boring cop-out.  It felt as if the entire novel was building towards something big, but then (Ho ho!) nothing is resolved.  Where were the Little People at the end of the book?  Probably they were too busy weaving together some magical strands of air to create another pointless dhota.  Oh that's funny, there's a big crow outside my window.  And a pregnant cat!  I can't see the moon because it's covered with clouds.  And my tongue is...Nope, just kidding.  I'm going to go brush my teeth and think twice about reading any long books for a while.
B003Y5HWMW|3.0|I had never seen this show before ordering the blu-ray discs.  I am a fan of well done fantasy and science fiction.  Sadly, this is neither.  I understand a lot of people like the show.  I'm only here to provide another perspective for the prospective buyer.<br /><br />This show is well done in that it seems acted reasonably well, and the sets and wardrobe are well done.  I think the expression is \\"production values are high\\".  However, I have watched two episodes and I am done.  First because I am bored, and second because this show is nothing but sexual titlation, which I can get better elsewhere if that is what I seek.<br /><br />Not sure what I expected, but this was not it.  I think it would have been a LOT more fantasy for certain (and not the sexual kind) and a LOT less sex.<br /><br />If I could, I would return for refund.  The near 5-star average review says that more people enjoy it than do not (of those who chose to rate it).  My rating acknowledges the quality of the production, but nothing more.  Your mileage may vary.
B005VTS4EY|1.0|Free apps with ads coming in over the internet connection?  I get it.  People often PAY for apps with the same gameplay content as their free counterparts to get RID of those intrusions.  This is normally a PAID app, and doesn't have ads.  But it DOES have built-in permissions for your phone's ID and the open network socket through which that information is sent SOMEWHERE.<br /><br />This is just simply double-dipping.  Seems they're asking you folks to pay for an app AND pay them just a little more via giving them information that this app has no business knowing.  Feint was removed in this Amazon version, and we all already know what kind of spyware THAT component is.  But I can't hand out any medals for that decision if OTHER spyware components are still integrated into the app.  Doing so would just be plain silly.<br /><br />Imagine going into a convenience store and buying a bag of chips for a buck and the proprietor says if you want to buy those chips, you first need to open your wallet and let me filter through it to see what's in there so I can judge what you have and where you've been so I can effectively market to you next time you come into the store.  Or asks to rifle through your purse for some data stating what area you live in so they could know who buys their chips and where.  Now imagine further what your face would look like if the gas station owner filtered through your wallet/purse without your knowledge while you used the restroom, and then he shared that information with the Lays Chips delivery guy who was there and was then paid a few bucks for supplying that information to said delivery man.<br /><br />Who thinks they would willingly show their driver's license as a condition to buying a bag of chips?  Perhaps some people might whip it out to get a FREE bag, who knows.  Think about this story next time you're at a convenience store.  What exactly is it that you would buy for a buck or two that required you handing over anything more than theprice of what you purchased?<br /><br />What a shame that what looked like a nice a nice little bag of chips for the price comes with the condition of whipping out my ID in order to purchase them.  Maybe the chips aren't that tasty after all if the manufacturer doesn't even think they can stand on their own in order to make a sale.<br /><br />At least today, you didn't have to pay.  But is that really why you came here today?  To download an app that contains what you can expect to get anywhere else in a normally FREE app?
1593272774|5.0|I love that this book doesn't spoon feed instructions step by step, and deliberately includes so many pieces that nobody (except maybe the author) actually has exactly the pieces shown in all of the book's models.  The whole point of LEGO is that kids learn to think and design, which is difficult to do when they  are trained to precisely follow someone else's ideas every step of the way.<br /><br />These models are IDEAS, to get creative juices flowing and maybe help bridge some areas where children aren't sure how to proceed with their own ideas.  There are many resources out there for people too lazy to figure out how to build their own model of \\"X,\\" but always following others' ideas destroys self confidence.  Children only learn that they could \\"never\\" design something so complicated, and stop trying.  It is much better to look at a great idea and then have to figure out how to make it work (or improve it!) with the materials actually on hand.<br /><br />Much more real world, and trains children to observe, think, and experiment, not just follow rote directions for snapping \\"tab A into slot B.\\"
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very User Friendly Love how you can highlight and love the reading plans It has so many versions which is very helpful
B004XZR63M|4.0|This was the book that started everything for Robert Kiyosaki.<br /><br />After I'd read a number of books in the series, I figured out Kiyosaki had dear ol' \\"rich dad\\" say whatever he wanted, but never mind.<br /><br />Reporters have never found \\"rich dad,\\" so he's almost certainly made up. And during the author's childhood he was still struggling to build his wealth, not yet rich. Kiyosaki's father advanced to the superintendent of education for Hawaii, so he was hardly \\"poor\\" or unsuccessful though if the author is accurate he did listen to poor financial advice. Possibly like many well educated people, he disdained to focus on money.<br /><br />So the real conflict was between a struggling entrepreneurial type and a traditional educator.<br /><br />You're not going to learn whatever the Kennedys and Rockefellers teach their children about money.<br /><br />But never mind all these facts.<br /><br />The author has rich dad say a lot of clever things such as \\"rich people don't work for money, they make their money work for them,\\" \\"I never say I can't afford anything, I ask how can I afford it\\" and so on.<br /><br />So I do like this book for its emphasis on having a positive attitude regarding money, and for alerting people to the entrepreneurial alternative to trading time for money.<br /><br />If you're past that, you need to focus on what you're doing to become wealthy.

1451627289|4.0|Stephen King 11/22/63 By Stephen King A Novel<br />When I received this audio ebook from Readers Favorite I could not wait to hear it played.  The best part is the ending which is something only the true Stephen King fan can enjoy!  The only other novel I have read of his is \\"The Stand.\\"  I have to say that this novel came close but \\"The Stand\\" is my favorite so far.<br />Of course I was born in the 1960's where I remember all too well the Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy Assassination which the media covered painstakingly over and over.  I remember that day very clearly in my memory, as I watched it in my parents' bedroom and as they were in shock explaining to me as a child what happened in terms only a child could comprehend.  Stephen King writes well and researches enough to keep the facts real and the story flowing for the reader's attention.<br />The main character is Jake Epping, and travels through time which leads from 2011 Maine to 09/09/1958. You can visit the past for as long as you like--years even--but when you return to the present it's always exactly two minutes later. Every succeeding visit is a \\"reset.\\" You can change the past (and consequently the present), but as Jake learns, \\"the past is inflexible.\\"<br /><br />Because with this portal to the past, Jake is set on a mission that would probably be the goal of most every person of a certain age--to stop the Kennedy assassination. I don't think it resonates quite so strongly with those of us who weren't around to remember Camelot, but, sure, 11/22/63 was one of the most memorable days in this nation's history.<br />© 2012 All Rights Reserved Jackie Paulson

1451683405|5.0|Let me disclose my biases really quick: I read almost everything that Sam Harris writes; I purchased Free Will with the intention of loving it, and I have finished reading it, prophecy fulfilled.<br /><br />As Harris mentioned via Twitter/facebook some time ago, he drew heavily from his blog posts covering free will. Nonetheless, he elegantly stringed his past writings together to make a very quick, accessible read on the topic. Media articles and academic papers galore address free will, and Harris really does broach the subject brilliantly and concisely. One of the many reasons I love reading Harris is that he's FUNNY. There were times reading Free Will that I had t put it down to let my smile die off a little. Also, as Harris does in his other writings, he points out the obvious points of a bad (or good) idea in a way that you can quickly reflect on it it and contrast it with whatever he his arguing. I guess that this is a hallmark f any good writer, but Harris delivers on this writing trait nonetheless.<br /><br />If you love or hate Harris, this book is at least worth reading because it is short and it's points of contention are laid out openly to evaluate and criticize. I laughed. I learned. I continue to ponder. What a great little book!

0452284392|4.0|Very impressed with this book on how people, organizations and other things are linked. We have all heard of 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, yet the author writes it is less than 3 degrees of Kevin Bacon. Using the internet to find the connections of networks, the studies have improved. The first study of the power of networking can go back to St Paul and the spread of Christianity. Later examples are the Air France Flight Attendant who spread AIDS, the many internet viruses and the 9/11 terrorists.  Using these, how do we use our own networks? The fact is the power is actually not from our primary network, but our secondary network. The reason being is that our primary network has too much ego and history built in for much change, but the secondary network does not. While this book was written in 2002 and is probably outdated in some reagard (as much more data has obeen accumalted since), it is very fascinating and worth the read.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|The songs are beautiful. Great pop album. The songs are relaxing, but not too loud, and peaceful. Just get it. I mean it's $0.25.
B0060MYNBY|5.0|This series is perhaps the first in years that has held my interest. I am a huge fan of the Arthurian Legends. Even though it's very different than the original piece (as it should be), the writers/directors/actors have done a fantastic job in the retelling of an old and loved legend. I highly recommend it.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This book is crazy, in a wonderful way :) Similar to the passing of time in the book, it took me WEEKS to finish this, but it felt like I never put it down once I started again. There were moments while I read it that I thought I'd never be able to finish it, or I'd read something and wonder what just happened, but a part of me, now that I've finished, feels like this is just part of the experience of the book. There's so much to take in, to process, to figure out. I'm glad I finished it; it's a great read. Gaiman has a wonderful style here that I'm looking forward to reading in other books. I would recommend this book to anyone :)

B005VTS4EY|5.0|just installed the game. took me a minute to see what it was all about. once I did it became great fun especially watching the facial expressions on the blocks - red is mad and stays mad but the greens look sad, then worried as they fall then surprised when they land or miss. if you win the level then the green blocks look happy. more fun than I thought it would be.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|The movie is excellent. The whole family love it. The only claim is the delivery from U.S. to Brazil is too long, more than 1 month. But all wait was compensated by the happiness of my son watching it. Very good.
0061537934|5.0|This book has been sitting in my night stand for almost a year. When I first bought it, I read the first chapter and didn´t read it again for months. Why? Because I knew where it was headed and couldn´t bring myself to reading it. I´m overly sensitive to dogs, and a crybaby en general.<br />So a few weeks ago I noticed the book collecting dust and I decided to read it. From then on, I couldn´t put it down!<br />The story is so engrossing and to read it from a witnessing dog is really enjoyable. At times funny, endearing, but most of the times really heart breaking.<br />Although I was prepared for the ending of the book, I was truly caught of-guard by the loveliness of it all. So much love, encouragement and determination. A story that I will never forget.

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|Good CD, not close to his classics but at least it is better than the weak Working On A Dream.  Some good songs (Jack of All Trades, We Are Alive and You've Got It), some not so good (Shackled and Drawn, Death to My Hometown and Rocky Ground) and a couple of classics (the not so new Land of Hopes and Dreams (sad when the best song is a repeat), We Take Caare of Our Own, and Wrecking Ball).  However, I do get soooooooo tired of pretentious millionaires preaching about how bad things are as they sit on their million dollar estates in their million dollar houses pretending to be regular guys with regular guy problems.  It is annoying and obnoxious.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|This is an excellent cover - extremely lightweight. Its rubberized feel helps your Kindle Fire feel secure. Also, a big plus is the eco-packaging in which it arrives - super smart idea. I would highly recommend this cover, however can't give more than 3 stars because the white color got immediately grubby and picks up every speck of dirt. So even after just using it for about a month, the cover in white looks really bad. Wish the material used had been more dirt and grime-resistant.

B005OOSPZO|5.0|A GREAT CLASSIC MOVIE WITH GOOD LOCATIONS (PRETTY), GOOD SOUND. MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS I WISHED THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS IN ENGLISH, INSTEAD OF SUBTITLES IN JAPANESE. I FOUND MY SELF LOOKING DOWN TO MUCH LOOKING AT THE WORDS. IN 1950 A MOVIE WAS MADE WITH JIMMY STEWART CALLED BROKEN ARROW. INSTEAD OF THE INDIANS SPEEKING THERE LANGUAGE. THEY SPOKE ENGLISH AND THE MOVIE TURNED OUT GREAT. JIMMY STEWART IN THE BEGINNING SAID THE INDIANS WOULD SPEEK ENGLISH SO YOU COULD UNDERSTAND THEM. STIL THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE.

B0071PS7AC|5.0|I downloaded this when it was free, even after reading the bad reviews. Did it take me a few times to figure out, yes it did but what fun is a game if there was no challenge?  First let me say in the upper left corner there is a little white arrow with two lines underneath it. If you press that it gives you the option of playing solo or with other game characters. The first few games I practiced just to see how the ball rolls, until I found my way of doing it. I now win almost every game.  Take your finger, put it on ball, put it between middle arrow and arrow to the right on lane,  pull back ball as far as it will go and just release.  Easy, there is also a redo button if you don't like your throw. (little white arrow)  Yes the game should had some directions but everything is there . Just play with it.
B00000G3I2|3.0|Any fan of The Big Chill would have expectations for finally seeing the \\"Alex Alive\\" scenes.  When I heard that an anniversary edition was being released with extensive interviews and deleted scenes, I hoped, even assumed, that the rumored and much-discussed college Thanksgiving scenes with Kevin Costner as \\"Alex Alive\\" would finally be shown to all Big Chill fans who have longed to see that footage.  When Lawrence Kasdan talked at length about those scenes in his interview, I felt sure that they would be included in the section of deleted scenes.  It was a terrific let-down to wait through some fairly blah, and understandably deleted scenes, only to discover that the college Thanksgiving scenes were never included.<br /><br />Even though I enjoyed seeing the movie re-mastered with excellent sound, and I enjoyed the script and acting as much as ever, I felt that any real fan of the movie would be terribly disappointed that the missing piece was still, after all these years, held back.  The movie fascinated me because it is my generation; I lived it and I wanted to see what these actors and that director did with the college scenes. I wanted to see Alex.  I wanted to see how they made the living, breathing Alex fit into this group.  It was a big disappointment.  I know that Lawrence Kasdan felt that when it was all said and done he thought he had told the story effectively without the need of the retrospective, but I still wanted to see whether I thought that was true or not.

0062082353|5.0|If you shoot, particularly precision rifles, you will thoroughly enjoy this book.  For me, an autobiography of one of the best ____ (fill in the blank) offers insight into their life and profession that others can't.  The book describes his time in combat bluntly and to the point.  His wife also offers her perspective and is very open.  I appreciate how difficult it must have been for them both to discuss their own and very personal feelings.<br /><br />Chris, if you are reading these comments, please know how much I appreciate your and everyone in the military's willingness to fight our enemies.

B006IDG2T6|5.0|Most people can probably recall a memory from their childhood where a<br />parent or other adult held our hand and walked us through some<br />seemingly scary place and showed us that there is nothing to fear. We<br />were then empowered to explore this previously terrifying area<br />completely with no fear. Sam Harris can (if you'll only let him) hold<br />your psychological hand and walk you through the illusion that you<br />have Free Will. You will then be free to explore your world without<br />the fear you once had about what it would mean to have the concept of<br />free will destroyed. Thanks again Sam!!!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Even though I've seen this movie three times, it still captures my attention when it shows up on Cable.  The characters are complicated but very believable.  There's a country music star who can't face life after a tragedy she caused made her self destruct.  Her husband/manager can't forgive her either.  In the middle of this attempt to jumpstart her career, there are two young singers who just might have a chance at not making the same mistakes.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Game of Thrones has got to be one of the best shows on HBO. Can't wait to see the newest season, and purchasing this was an excellent way for me to re watch what happened!
B006OB3K56|5.0|Naturally, not everyone will get this film. Likewise 'getting it' does not necessarily mean that it resonates. That said, dump me squarely into the category of those who have nothing but a long string of effusive accolades for both Mr McQueen and his apparent muse Mr Fassbender. For me it was purely etherial and hypnotic, the most affecting and memorable film I have seen in a very long. I got lost in some moments as if I was parked in front of a video installation in an art museum. The subway scene and the running sequence have somehow invaded my brain and left indelible after effect images...  I hope that this stands up on second viewing on Blu Ray - or rather, I hope I can surrender to the visual rhythm and moods of Mr McQueen's film at home - and that is just the continuation of a long career of collaboration (like Kinski and Herzog) between McQueen and Fassbender - which began with \\"Hunger\\".

B002TVQ4HG|1.0|This movie actually turned out to be more entertaining than I had thought  it would be. Still, I would advise people to see it on cable or rent it, rather than spend money to buy it. It is not a movie worth seeing a second time.<br /><br />The title of this movie \\"Triangle\\" is misleading.  Many people (myself included) expected a \\"Bermuda Triangle\\" type film, and this it definitely is not.  Nor is it strictly speaking a time travel movie. The title reflects the name of the boat that the characters are travelling on, and I think they should have changed the name of the movie to avoid confusion. This movie reminded me of nothing so much as an elongated \\"twilight zone\\" episode.  During the film, the viewer thinks that it is both, because at first the main characters are ship wrecked by a very creepy and unnatural storm, and then are saved when they board a strangely deserted old luxury ocean liner that cruses past them. One by one they are killed by a mysterious figure, leaving only the main heroine alive. After she stumbles around, in and out of the endless rooms of the ship, she suddenly finds herself looking over the ships rail seeing (amazingly) herself and her friends, standing on their overturned boat----just as they had been several hours before!  Obviously, the heroine has somehow jumped backward in time---and maybe has a chance to save everyone, right?  Not exactly.<br /><br />We now follow the heroine through a long and convoluted series of actions which she hopes will allow her to escape the ocean liner. It seems as if she is going through a series of time loops----repeating the same series of events again and again, trying to get a different outcome. (rather like the movie Groundhog's Day, but without the wacky comedy) But at the same time, there is chilling evidence that she is not exactly experiencing a time loop---at least not in the way that we are familiar with from science fiction. In several places in the movie, she comes across (impossible) physicalevidence that she has done this same thing,taken this same path many, many times.  One of these points was when she falls and her necklace drops off and it falls through a grating.  When she looks through the grating, she sees, in the compartment below, hundreds of copies of her necklace! I thought that this part was well plotted and very chilling.<br /><br />When the movie was over, basically coming in a full circle to begin again, I was put very much in mind of the old \\"Twiligh Zone\\" episodes. Close to the movie's end, we see the heroine after having suffered a terrible car crash. And she is untouched, unharmed, even her hair is not mussed. Even if she has somehow returned back through time, she could not have survived that accident. Is she dead? If so, it is not the common ghost that we usually see in fiction.  She seems to be fully flesh and blood. So what is the explanation?<br /><br />Suppose we are not seeing someone trapped in a linear storyline or a time loop? Suppose we are viewing the sufferings of a damned soul in hell? What hell could be worse than to forever relive the most terrible events of your life, trying in vain to change them, over and over and over, forever?  That is something worthy of the devil himself!<br /><br />And why would I think that the heroine might be a damned soul?  Well, we see reasons for it in her actions during the movie. She puts on an act that she is devoted to her small son, but the fact is she abuses the child both physically and mentally. And gives herself all kinds of excuses for it. And she is selfish in the extreme, showing herself to be fully willing to sacrifice others to save herself or serve her own purpose. Even at the end of the movie, when she finds herself once again at the beginning, ready to set sail with her four friends in the \\"Triangle\\", she does nothing to try to stop the series of events.  She could refuse to get on the boat, stop her friends from going, sabotage the boat, push everybody off the dock into the water, almost anything. But she doesn't.  I know people may say it was because she wanted to take the chance that this time around she could change things, and make her son alive again (her son having been killed in the car crash) but I don't buy that explanation. What about the four other innocent people, supposedly her friends?  She shows indifference to their suffering, their dying. She lacks a core of humanity, and again is selfish. She wants her own way, even though it means her friends will suffer and die in order to serve her purpose. Her soul is rotten. And the audience may be privy to her punishment.<br /><br />At any rate, that is my take on this movie, although I do not know if that is what the writers or directors considered.  You have to stick with the film, even when it seems to get bogged down, and stay through all the convoluted plotting. It turned out to be a lot more interesting than I had expected.  But not something that I would see again or buy.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I'm not much of a bandwagon jumper unless a book or movie really catches my eye and, to be honest, I had no prior knowledge of The Hunger Games before the movie started getting all of the hype. I had seen the books in stores but, figuring it was some tween lit that was too young for me to get into, I ignored it. I didn't even plan on seeing the movie until the first reviews came in after its release and gave some general inkling whether or not it was worth my money. Being accosted by two Hunger Games loving friends to read the book before the movie came out, I caved and borrowed a copy.<br /><br />My first qualm with the book was opening it up to find it was written in first person and present tense. Besides some poetry, I've never read nor written in present tense, and I'm not very fond of first-person. I don't need to feel \\"inserted\\" into a story to enjoy it, so first person is kind of meh to me. I'm glad I didn't let this deter me from continuing the book, as it actually lends itself very well to the nature of the story and Katniss' character. The Hunger Games reads like a journal, told from the perspective of a believably and well written 16-year old girl. You aren't reading the author's descriptions of events and places or presentation of dialogue, but rather Katniss' personal account of the things around her and the people she encounters. It is an interesting and appropriate choice in regard to style and perspective. A few pages into the book and I found I had grown used to it.<br /><br />That being said, because the book is written from the perspective of a 16 year-old girl and is meant for teens, the book is...very teen-ish. I haven't read a \\"for young adults\\" book since Harry Potter. The last few HP books never felt too young for me, yet in comparison I definitely felt like I was reading something from that section in Barnes and Noble I never tread into. The one of badly Photoshopped covers of angsty looking, too pretty youths that all look like bastardizedTwilight covers now. The narrative is of what's going on in Katniss' head as much as (if not more than) it is about the action. She's emotionally unsure and sensitive, defensively snappy, awkward, and second-guesses herself constantly in that way only a 16 year old girl can be. Which I appreciate, as it makes her a very realistic and believable character. Yet I found myself skimming the thick paragraphs of Katniss' inner turmoil and wishing there was more action in between. Collins' writing style is very succinct for the most part, and it showed in often sparse, quick descriptions when it came to places or actions. She likes to paraphrase and summarize. Katniss' inner thoughts, however, are always fleshed out and given much more page space than her battles with the other tributes. For example, Katniss often angsts over whether fellow D-12 tribute Peeta--one side of the necessary Teen Love Triangle, the other one being Katniss' childhood friend Gale--acts out of earnest kindness or cunning strategy toward her. Peeta gives her a brief meaningful look described in only a short sentence and we are afterwards subjected to a 3/4 page long inner monologue of Katniss thinking \\"Does he like me or is he really a murderous dick?\\"<br /><br />Not to say that this focus on Katniss' inner thoughts is a bad thing. You expect such in a book written from first person, as it makes sense. Yet there were times I found myself exasperated with the character (appropriately so?) and her paranoid angsting when all I wanted to read was more action between the tributes. It helped that Katniss wasn't an unlikeable character, I suppose, or I may have abandoned the book. She's strong, resilient and, later on, not resigned to just die in the Games as she thought we would. She's annoying sometimes, but she's a 16 year old girl. I think that is intentional. In regard to other characters, Peeta is likeable and sweet in the way a puppy in the rain is. You just feel so bad for the poor guy, which I suppose makes him appealing as one of the two possible relationship pairings. I can't say I'm fully on-board Team Peeta yet. The residents of the Capitol are equally interesting and loathsome, being that they are among the aristocracy that oppress the Districts, but I love the descriptions of their extravagant lifestyles and culture. Most of the other tributes are not fleshed out and I found myself wishing I knew more about them. But, again, that is one of the drawbacks of a first-person written book.<br /><br />Collins is a good writer, no doubt about that, but the pacing of the story was a little uneven at times. Sluggishly dragging on and a bit inane in focus at times, and then bam, the action I was craving for is suddenly over in a short paragraph. Some of her plot devices are a little snort-worthy and feel cliche even for a teen book. I suppose the reason for the hype around the book and its most admirable quality is her tackling of a very dark premise (dystopian government killing kids) and making it into a teen story that doesn't feel too macabre. The theme of an oppressive, dictating force (The Capitol) isn't too heavy and relatable to teens. The violence isn't too graphic, unlike Battle Royale, but the realism is there. Never did I feel like Collins avoided it for the sake of keeping the book PG-13. She does it well considering the young audience the book is intended for. I think it is less appealing to adults myself, though my two older friends adored the book series. The reading level of the book is just so obviously 13-16.<br /><br />tl;dr: Entertaining book with some plot flaws and a strange choice for point of view that gets better as you read further. Don't expect anything mentally challenging or thought-provoking, just enjoy the story and the angst and then get ready for the movie.

1401937519|5.0|Dying To Be Me is a book that I saw numerous times while I was looking around Netgalley.  I would look at it and pass thinking that I don't know how I feel about NDE (near death experience) and it's probably more of the same old, same old.  White lights, beauty, etc.  No not for me.<br /><br />After finishing Wishes Fulfilled by Wayne Dyer I was drawn to read it.  Dr. Dyer mentions Anita and her book numerous times.  He even wrote the forward to this book.  I still thought it would be the same old story but boy was I wrong!<br /><br />Ms. Moorjani does not take us on the same old white light trip, nor does she preach or claim to have any answers.  All she does it tell her story, her experience and take from it what you will.<br /><br />Dying To Be Me will get you thinking no matter where you stand on NDE or religion or the Universe.  You won't be able NOT to think and question yourself about your purpose.<br /><br />The book is about her life, growing up in a Hindu family while living in a Chinese and British society.  Going to a Catholic school and being hit by contradictions coming at her from all directions.  She is honest and open about her life before and after her NDE.<br /><br />I loved where she told us about a young boy and a nun in her school who told her she would not get to heaven unless she was catholic.  When she questioned her mother she was told that religion is not the truth, just a path to finding the truth and there are many paths for many people!  I have been saying that to my kids since they were little, there is no one right way.<br /><br />I also loved the way she looks at the world and all of the people in it.  She says that the Universe is like a beautiful tapestry and we are all threads in that tapestry.  We can't see each individual thread but together it creates a work of beauty.  Our lives are our own little tapestry that is part of the One, the Universe.  WOW.<br /><br />If you are thinking like I did that this is a book about Near Death Experience, you are wrong.  Yes, Ms. Moorjani had one, she tells us about it but that is only one small part of the book.  For me, the book was one huge message and in many ways reinforced how I already feel.<br /><br />Dying To Be Me is a beautiful story about love, sickness, truth and trust.  It is a book that should be read by everyone.<br /><br />~this book was provided by netgalley free of charge for an honest review~h Experience, you are wrong.

B0070Z4M4I|5.0|I watched the original The Thing and now this one and I really enjoyed both equally.  I will agree as with everyone else the CGI was used a bit to much.  If they had made some gore scenes without CGI showing the alien it would of added some additional fear factor.  I still at times got freaked out but there is just something about CGI which the mind can tell is fake and it detracts from the shock part of it.<br /><br />The movie over all was worth watching still and descently well done.  Now days they are bringing out so many bad movies that watching this was refreshing to finally be gripping my seat once again in suspense.<br /><br />Over all I would recommend this movie provided your not anal about every detail in a movie.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The 25th anniversary DVD/Blu-Ray of Phantom of the Opera (POTO):<br /><br />1) Is it worth your time and money?  YES!!!<br /><br />2) Is it comparable to other POTO productions?  BETTER!!! (Once in a lifetime event)<br /><br />3) Is the talent of the lead singers on par with other POTO theater shows?  YES & AMAZINGLY SO!!! (Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom & Sierra Boggess as Christine have teamed before in \\"Love Never Dies\\" (sequel to POTO) in Vegas and NY.  The chemistry between them sizzles like hot grease in this 25th anniversary masterpiece.  Ramin has played the Phantom and Sierra has played Christine opposite other actors as well.)<br /><br />4) Is the 25th anniversary production unique?  YES & EXTRAORDINARY!!! (It was beamed around the world. As seen on your TV, you have the best seat in the house, with camera angles and zooms bringing the spectacular scenes and actors' faces up close and personal for your enjoyment.)<br /><br />Sierra Boggess is THE Christine everyone has been waiting and hoping for.  What does she bring to the theater?  Well, for one thing, the selection by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh for this 25th Anniversary production of POTO in this coveted role, for they insisted on the BEST Phantom cast.  That in itself speaks volumes about her fantastic talent, both as an actress and a beautifully gifted soprano.  She has honed her skills as Christine on numerous stages, growing and improving her portrayal of this character with every performance -- Sierra IS Christine.<br /><br />Besides the aforementioned lead in \\"Love Never Dies\\" with Ramin, and lead as Christine in Vegas \\"POTO\\" stage productions, she has had other experiences on Broadway as well, including the lead role as Ariel in \\"The Little Mermaid\\" (she looks just like Ariel's cartoon character, by the way, which is a huge plus).  After the recent \\"Master Class\\" she was selected to star as female lead in a Broadway adaptation of \\"Rebecca.\\"  Do you see the point I'm making?  Folks, Sierra began her Broadway career in 2006 right out of college; in only 6 years she has risen to be the female lead in various wildly popular Broadway musicals.  Just look where she's been already and imagine where she's going!  I would love to see her as the lead in a filmed theater production of \\"The Sound of Music.\\"<br /><br />Sierra has a full array of talent.  Her infectious personality, natural acting abilities, facial expressions, appropriate emotions, gloriously clear and strong voice, and charming beauty all lend themselves extremely well to this masterful production.  She works hard to develop and maintain every aspect of herself as an actress and as a singer which clearly shines through during her outstanding performances on this DVD/Blu-Ray.  Watching various online videos of Sierra, she seems vibrant,  witty, silly, down to earth, and endearing; however, at the snap of fingers she is instantly \\"in character\\" and it's sometimes difficult to equate her \\"real\\" self with the \\"character\\" she's playing -- her transformation is that incredible.  I can think of no better inspiration for young females aspiring to perform on stage or film.<br /><br />When Sierra is taken down to the labyrinth by the Phantom and told to sing while she is in his controlling power, I was mesmerized by her vocals.  Her voice resonates on stage seemingly without effort.  Her unbridled passion she brings to every scene is striking, even when she is doing nothing but standing there in her radiant beauty, being seduced by the Phantom as he controls her mind.  Sierra is so focused and in tune with the emotional charge Ramin (Phantom) creates that her eyes brim with tears, rolling down her cheeks to add her own emotional, albeit silent, \\"punch\\" to the scene.<br /><br />She puts every ounce of energy into everything she does, meaning that every frame with her in it is a jewel.  Sierra's rendition of \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" at the gravesite of her father will most likely bringyou to tears.  Just relax and let your emotions flow with hers.  The way she sings this song is epic and unforgettable, better than anyone else has sung it, in my humble opinion.  The applause she receives brings down the hall and clearly demonstrates the audience's appreciation of such dynamic talent.  You will be moved in your own way, whether by tearing up, crying, getting gooseflesh, having your neck hairs tingled, or all of these things.  This song by Sierra, by itself, is worth the purchase price of this most pleasurable product.<br /><br />The phantastic performances of Ramin Karimloo (Phantom) and Sierra Boggess (Christine) are AWESOME (remember, they are two of the best hand-picked POTO performers in the world for this 25th anniversary extravaganza).  The scenes are splendid, the colorful and varied costumes of the entire cast are great, the up close & personal camera work is fantastic, and the orchestra is outstanding.  If you have a 5.1 or better home theater system, then crank up the volume for a total audio feast.  You owe it to yourself to watch this DVD/Blu-Ray over and over again, whether you're a seasoned POTO fan or not.  This is a once in a lifetime chance to see and hear POTO in all its glory.  You will not be disappointed.  Well beyond the point of being good, satisfying, great, or even outstanding, this unique DVD/Blu-Ray production is in a class all by itself, and will stand the test of time.  It is worth every penny and has excellent replay value for years to come.<br /><br />At one time I thought the original Christine, Sarah Brightman, as great as she is, was incomparable.  Not taking anything away from Sarah, I now feel that Sierra Boggess has just raised the bar much higher and is well deserving of all her accolades as the new Christine on the world stage.  Her emotional renderings made me tear up and quietly sob at times, and I freely admit being so deeply moved by this delightful and amazingly talented \\"Angel of Music.\\"  Well done, Sierra!!!
1451629184|1.0|I regret picking up this book. It should not be read by children of any age. I felt it was too detailed on the x-rated aspect of her imprisonment. This book could be used in the wrong way by so many individuals. She didn't need the money...why couldn't she have focused on the healing and counseled others. The info she put out was very healing for her I am sure but should have been between her and her therapist. I am not underestimating what she went thru but let's not give another person any ideas of how to do this. AGAIN not a young adult or children's reading material. It is regrettable that she had to experience this much less relive it for the book. I wish she would pull it off the shelves and start over.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Pete Townshend was once quoted to the effect that in rock and roll, if you don't have an axe to grind, you should get out. As a huge Springsteen fan for years, I enjoyed his last two CDs (\\"Magic\\" and \\"Working On A Dream\\"), but they both seemed like the work of a professional doing what he does (very) well, but only just that. \\"Wrecking Ball\\" reveals Bruce with an axe back in his hand (and I don't mean his guitar). This album has \\"character\\" (although not \\"characters\\", as many reviewers have pointed out, he's not a story teller here)that I haven't heard from him since \\"Devils and Dust\\". While the music is classic Springsteen with a few new twists, such as female backing vocals, some loops, and a rap interlude, this is clearly a party with a purpose and stays on message practically from beginning to end. And it SOUNDS great, without which the message in a song ceases to matter to me. \\"Wreckng Ball\\" is a fantastic anthem, \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\", despite what it sound like on casual listening, is a hell of a protest song, not a flag-waver. \\"Shackled and Drawn\\" and \\"We are Alive\\" are great additions to the Springsteen cannon, and the whole album enjoyable from beginning to end.<br /><br />P.S. I 've heard other reveiwers complain that he doesn't sound mad, just mad for us. What do you expect?He's part of the 1%. I'm just glad he hasn't lost his perspective on everyday lives that the insulation of living in that 1% can easily cause.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I always tell people about The Godfather, and being 29 a common response I hear is, \\"My dad loves those movies, but I've never seen them.\\"  Being a movie buff my entire life, It's my obligation to encourage younger generations to view this masterwork and in the Coppola restoration, we have the quintessential version, painstakingly remastered to perfection on the best format available... Blu Ray.<br /><br />These films deserve this treatment, and come with numerous fascinated documentaries exploring the making of the films, the impact it has on popular culture, and the impact it has on contemporary film making.<br /><br />I love this edition, the packaging is gorgeous, the menus are gorgeous, and the movies are gorgeous.  A definite buy.

B003Y5HWK4|5.0|It's HBO, it has all the quality of HBO shows, great writing, incredible sets, amazing actors, the works.  Your pretty much guaranteed a slam dunk when you see that it is also produced by Martin Scorsese who in addition to producing, directed the first episode which is much like a film in itself.<br /><br />A great start to what is sure to be an amazing series.  And of course it's in HD with great commentaries and documentaries for those who love special features.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Most of the games are simple pick-up-and-play games that are fun on their own. I really enjoy the surprising amount of depth.
0545425115|5.0|I downloaded this book on my Kindle Fire because it was in the #1 slot on the free read list for Prime.  I had no idea what it was about.  After the first few pages I was hooked and had a difficult time putting it down and read it in record time.  When I got to the end and it said end of book one - I realized there was more and have since read Catching Fire and Mockingjay in the last week.  The author keeps you entranced and it is like you are there watching the games first hand.  Now I look forward to the movie coming out in a couple weeks and can see it put to the screen - I hope it does the book justice.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|If you like Ryan Adams, then you'll like this. There are no curve balls or surprises here. It's a great album from beginning to end. More Ryan Adams goodness. That is all.

B005VTS4EY|4.0|Seems Matthew has returned as Brian. Well we still don't like you.<br /><br />Brian McGrath, annoying moron.<br /><br />Superman75 used to annoy me but he's a genius compared to the idiot twins mentioned above.
B006O5Y09C|4.0|This was a classical Woody Allen film.  The storay floats in and out of reality, touches of delight, quirky surprises, really good cinematography and a happy boy gets girl ending.  Throughout, the moving was a delight to the eyes.  We thoroughtly enjoyed this movie.
0439023513|4.0|The Final Book in the Hunger Games Trilogy takes Katniss full circle, returning her to the Capital to face President Snow as the rebellion of the Districts comes to a head. At this time Katniss is the symbol of the the rebellion, the Mockingjay.<br />Along the way the loss she suffers will be greater than all that have passed before and she is faced too often with the reality that the rebels she is aligned with are not that different from the dictator she faces.<br />The Mockingjay is an excellant novel that has the sustainability of its own story even separate from the first two but you will want to read them to get the full story and the growth and maturity of Katniss, Peeta, Gale and Finnick; children when the books began and now young adults much older than their years.<br />An excellant tale.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|Allow me to start off by stating that this is not a supernatural film as many reviewers seem to feel, many may find it slow and it requires the use of your brain to derive enjoyment from the many ambiguities the film leaves. Take Shelter is not so much about it's premise as it is the ramifications of it, with small town construction worker Curtis LaForche experiencing vivid apocalyptic dreams, what follows, and makes up most of the movie is how these visions affect his behavior and how those around him react to it. Much of the film is built around somewhat mundane phenomena such as Curtis fortifying his storm shelter or visiting a therapist, these everyday occurrences become engaging due to the constant sense of dread the film employs, the film is built up in such a way that there seems to be some great threat looming overhead, as if some great storm might be just around the corner. A well made intellectual drama, Take shelter is not for everybody, the film takes its time to build it's story in a way many will find boring and unnecessary, but those who are fascinated by human drama will likely be spellbound
B005VTS4EY|3.0|Beat the game on first play. But, it offered a little bit of a challenge: i had to try a couple levels more than a couple times, mostly due to movement that starts without user interaction when the level starts - this forced quick thinking - but the levels weren't very difficult for me to figure out. Significant challenge for kids, on some levels, which would make it more playable for them. Needs more levels, to justify being a paid game. No glitches. Moves to SD card. HTC Inspire 4G.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I really like this little physics puzzle game.  only 100 levels, but it will give you a hour or two of game play.  I recommend it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I've been a Michael Buble fan since the beginning of time.  Well, at least since I met him after a concert many years ago.  His music is timeless, classic and his voice is amazing.  This is one of my favorite Christmas CD's.
