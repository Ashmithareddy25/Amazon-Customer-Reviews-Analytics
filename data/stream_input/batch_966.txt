0061914177|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from a very authentic and practical entrepreneur. His energy is infectious and his willingness to give more than expected has made him very popular, especially among wine aficionados. I've heard him on seminars and he's always great for getting you pumped up. There is a practical and how-to aspect of this book that I liked and which kept it from being a predictable or sappy \\"If you do what you love, the money will follow\\" type of book. If you're considering--or operating--an online business or a business with an online presence, you'll find this quick-read book a gem.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061914177 Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion]]
B002H398M4|5.0|Wow, this book just resonates with hidden bits of wisdom and the story flows quite well.  Some people said they didn't really understand the story, but it is full of priceless metaphors about life and living to the fullest.  I really enjoyed the book and can understand why it has been a best seller for so long.    This specific edition is a very nice hard-cover book in a slipcase with an attached cloth bookmark.  There are color illustrations throughout.  The only thing that would make this book better is if it had been a leather-bound volume.    If you haven't read the story yet, you're missing out.
B002U6CJCE|4.0|Andre Arlovski should have played Michael Myers in the Halloween remake. Not only that but the director of Universal Soldier Regenerations, John Hyams, would have made a better director than Rob Zombie. He gets stalking and camera angles and kills in a Myers like way.     Just throwing that out there.    The movie itself is IMO the best of the series and it's the best by a lot not by a little. The action is great in this movie. It's brutal in the right amount and it's over the top just slightly so it never takes you out of the story it's set in. The origins (which go further back then we're shown in the first movie) of the Unisol's is told and it makes you wonder why they would even continue with these experiments (bad things happen). The thing about Van Damme's character is the idea of what does a Unisol do when it doesn't kill. Does it adjust to life? Does it have opinions or feelings. A somber brush stroke is painted over Van Damme's character and even on Dolph Lundgren as well and it's warranted.     A Unisol tries but for your own safety you don't want to be near one at any point. They're dangerous killing machines that shouldn't exist. That simple and when they don't kill well... it's just not who they are. It never hammers in their feelings but only brings them up at the right time as to make them compelling and not come off as an after thought.    Still the big thing here is the action and it's great. Overall as a film it's his most consistent as some of his flicks tend to waver a bit in terms of quality (in one aspect or another) I recommend.    This is probably Van Damme's best action movie.     7/10
B001TD1XWG|3.0|The at one point highly anticipated rock album by rapper Lil' Wayne was set to be released several times last year and to nobodies surprise...it didn't come out. The latest in high profile artists to not release their album, Lil' Wayne decided that the album was not \\"complete\\" and ditched the December 21st 2009 release of the album. This was due to several sources stating the single \\"Prom Queen\\" did not get enough praise when it came out a few months ago and quickly dropped off Top 20 radio stations. Wayne also released a few songs on the internet which did not receive very good reviews. With that, Wayne decided to scratch the release and possibly re-tune the album. However, the album was quite complete because not only did the record distributor for Cash Money Records (Priority Records) send the Cd's out for the official December 21st release, 500 lucky amazon customers received the CD thanks to Amazon not getting the memo in time from Priority Records that the CD would not be released. One of those Amazon customers...was yours truly. Here is the review.<br /><br />  First, I will state that this is not a 100% rock album, it is quite literally a rap/rock album. Every song he is usually rapping with the help of an 808 machine. Though that doesn't make it a dreadful album like many have already made it out to be. There are 14 tracks in total some of which are quite good and some are just awful. The opening title \\"American Star\\" is pretty standard not very catchy and the lyrics are pretty bland. As for the first single \\"Prom Queen\\" it is quite enjoyable to listen to but Wayne's voice really lacks depth which is why I think this did not last very long on the pop charts. The first 3-4 songs have very bad sound quality. At times the instrumentals rage over Wayne's voice and at times you can barely hear the instruments being played; almost as if you were in a different room where the music is playing.<br /><br />  \\"Paradice\\" the 5th song on the album is well done although it does have a sound you have heard before in many a album but to hear Wayne actually make a fairly descent rock song is impressive. The other two songs that really stand out are \\"On Fire\\" and \\"Drop The World\\". \\"On Fire\\" is a great song that is more rap than rock but has an excellent remix to Amy Holland's \\"She's On Fire\\". None of these songs compare to the greatest song on the CD and quite possibly one of my favorite Lil Wayne songs \\"Drop The World\\".<br /><br />  In \\"Drop The World\\", Wayne teams up with Eminem for an excellent song. Filled with synthesizers and a fantastic drum beat, this song brings back old school Eminem with the flow and lyrics of something out of Slim Shady through Eminem Show. Wayne is good on the song too, however when Eminem is at his best, it's impossible to compete and it does show (not as bad as it shows on Drake's \\"Forever\\"). If you don't bother getting this album, you should really buy this song on iTunes or Amazon.<br /><br />  Overall, Lil Wayne's rock album is fairly bland besides  3-4 songs that stick out. The instrumentals from the guitar, bass, and drums are all very standard, maybe even too standard. The lyrics and style of Wayne's voice is not really singing, just slower rap. I will give him credit for trying because some of the songs which I mentioned before were very good. As for when this album will come out well, it should today (2/2/2010) and I expect reviews to be quite harsh.<br /><br />VISIT OUR ETHOS REVIEWS WEBSITE TO CHECK OUT MORE WRITTEN REVIEWS ON CD's, MOVIES, AND VIDEO GAMES.

B0013RC3NQ|5.0|I undertstand that Wilkie Collins and Charles Dickens were contemporaries. Dickens was a good friend and mentor of Collins. The influence of Dickens is evident and is revealed in Collins' great ability to build an intricate plot and tell a story that holds your interest from beginning to end; his wonderful skill at rich characterization and his exceptional grasp of the English langage.    I highly recommend this mystery novel. I really enjoyed it. I truly felt as though I was transported to early nineteenth century England.
0452295548|5.0|This is the most amazing book I have read in many a year.  Jill Taylor an exceptional human being. Her insight, sensitity, and analytical ability far surpass any person that I have ever read about. This is a must read and difficult to put down.
0312370849|3.0|I am torn about how to review this book.  Sarah's story is truly moving and deep, but Julia's tale adds very little to the book and drags on and on.  The book starts off by alternating chapters between the life of Sarah and Julia until eventually the life of Julia takes over.  At that point, the book becomes extremely tiresome and boring.  I was disappointed that once we discover the tragic death of Sarah's younger brother, we are left to learn about Sarah's fate through the narration of Julia, who is not at all interesting.  It's hard to believe that the same author created both of these characters.  If only she had abandoned the voice of Julia and continued on with Sarah . . . .

009926689X|1.0|I read this story and thought it was some sick joke.  What kind of parent stalks their kid through out life?  You seriously could make this into a really creepy psycho thriller.  Read this book to your kid and (s)he'll learn to throw your watch in the toilet, you may sell him to the zoo, pull food out of a refrigerator, say bad words --Oh yeah there's also an image of a kid playing in a toilet. Read that to a three-year-old and see what (s)he'll pick up.    Now the premise is touching --your parent will love you forever.  Now hopefully that love will not cross boundaries that include breaking and entering and stalking.    I seriously am surprised by the positive attention given to this book.
051756338X|5.0|This author does for England, what Michener did for TEXAS, POLAND, HAWAII and other wonderful novels. I read this book years ago in paperback and have been looking though second-hand bookstores ever since for a hard-back edition.  I have this treasured addition to my home library now through Amazon.
B0013ND30W|5.0|On blu ray. Sleeping Beauty is a true classic and the colrs and sound on blu ray are truly amazing. The extra features are a great addition too. What I like about what most companies are doing is including the regular dvd with the blu ray...this way if your blu ray is a ps3 it is not being used all the time.

B00275EGX8|5.0|No Spoilers just an opinion and overall review...      The hurt locker helps you realize just what our soldiers do for our country, and eachother. it also really helps you appreciate our forces overseas and any person in uniform, I think the director took a note out of Jarhead and showed the audience a day in the life of soldiers in a hostile enviornment fighting a different kind of war.    This movie goes in depth with the three soldiers in the bomb squad and shows their characteristics, the hurt locker is not action packed, but it has many parts that keep you interested while feeling for each of the squad members. i highly recommend this movie!
B002SEW5WW|3.0|The Cd is good but nothing compared to their first in which I love every song.  I think if I listen to it more it will definitely grow on me.  Took a little effort though to have an open mind.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|My laptop couldn't play this HD DVD. Since DVD is being phased out, unless you have a HD DVD/Blu Ray player or HD DVD from before, U can't enjoy the HD DVD. Searched for DVD software to download to enable HD DVD but no such thing. Probably need certain hardware not just the regular DVD with appropriate driver to enable HD viewing.

0316067598|5.0|This book should be required reading for all Americans.  What an amazing story that shows how tough the soldier warriors are that protect and also a rare glimpse into their lives
B00275EGWY|3.0|This was a preachy movie -- not the obvious \\"War is Terrible\\" message, but something like -- \\"the main character is incredibly brave and selfless but it's only because he likes the adrenaline rush.\\"  That's a very strange notion and not convincing, at least not to me.  Still, the movie is somewhat entertaining . .

B002LE6XR2|3.0|I was expecting something a little different, but overall I am happy with it. I thought it was a separate lamp, no that it was attached  to a giant foot to hold movies. The idea of having your Pixar movies there is good, but eventually you run out of space. If you have all Pixar movies you will be out from the get-go.    Then theres the lighting... When the lamp is turned on the top of the lamp lights up too, because the plastic is so thin. This means that half the lamp is glowing plastic and the rest is dark, as it should be. This does not IMO look very good, so I keep it off.    The positioning of the lamp is also very limited because most joints only have spring action, but no fastener... So you can position it pretty much any way you want, but it will snap back when you let go.    Anyway. It does look good - off - and I'm happy with it. Just slightly disappointed, especially considering the price.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|The short list of what can be considered documentary film classics has yet another wonderful addition by legendary filmmaker Michael Moore. It is a visual spanning of the history of corporate influence over our political leaders and how this has poisoned the entire establishment nearly beyond repair. I will never forget the segment of a presidential speech, showed roughly around the beginning of this film, of a man standing behind president Reagan who leans in and says angrily in his ear: \\"HURRY IT UP; WE DON'T HAVE ALL DAY!\\" The camera then freezes on Reagan's shocked face as the narrator simply asks, \\"Who speaks to the president like this?\\" It graphically shows you how much influence is measured by the corporations over our political leaders. This film in particular strikes higher notes than Moore's previous films in that it takes you back to the roots of earlier documentaries and brings out more ample and articulate forms of evidence in support of the general thesis. Capitalism: A Love Story seeks to expose the corruption of our varied form of greedy Capitalism, and to replace it with a more democratized base system, typically referred to as Leftist-Libertarianism or Libertarian-Socialism.<br /><br />People in the United States generally speak of Socialism as something awful, pointing to Russia and China as examples of the dangers of far leftist thought. But if they would simply take the time to read into some of their literature of political theory, they would realize that there are branches within the movement which are infinitely distinct from those totalitarian nations. It is a category mistake to assume that socialism entails totalitarianism, as if what you see in Russia and China were totally across the board. To any of you interested in getting a thorough education on this subject, I would recommend you checking out the following books: [[ASIN:0853451753 Anarchism: From Theory to Practice]] [[ASIN:1904859208 Chomsky on Anarchism]]
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I think this album \\"need you now\\" is alot better than the last one \\"lady antebellum\\", It has alot more good songs on it. Need you now is my favorite song so far. I cant wait to see these guys in tour they are awesome!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|First, a warning: this series includes rough language, and one sex scene in episode 9. Therefore, not suitable for children. In fact, even an adult may want to keep the fast-forward button on the remote handy for that one fling in episode Naughty Number Nine.<br /><br />Now the good stuff: this series is an incredible true account of the sacrifices made by Easy Company during World War II. This dramatized documentation of their experiences is riveting - You WILL get caught up in it. Includes brief interviews with the real life veterans featured in the film before each episode.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone with interest in World War II era, or war films of any kind. I bought it as a gift for my husband, and wound up at his side, just as glued to the screen as he was. In my opinion, it's the best World War II film ever made.
B002YICN74|5.0|Wow this cd is great the lyrics are great.This has a completly different sound than the jonas brothers.I love it my favorite songs are Rose garden,Who i am,Tonight,Conspiricy theory,And stronger.i would reccomend this cd for people of all ages.
B00009YOQW|3.0|I was a little disappointed. The reviews were very good, so I thought it would be great for my 14 month old granddaughter to hear the different sounds. There is hardly any sound differences and it mostly all just sounds the same. It is very sturdy and maybe some day she will enjoy it, but I am not sure what age would enjoy this toy. It seems pretty boring for all ages. Her favorite part was chewing on the drum stick!
B001TD1XWG|2.0|Last year, Lil Wayne's No Ceilings mixtape, in which he took ownership of 2009 hits such as \\"Run this Town\\" and \\"Throw it in the Bag\\" away from his contemporaries, was highly regarded by critics and fans for its complete lack of auto-tune as much as its clever punchlines and obtuse metaphors. Wayne's newest release (as well as his first studio recording since Carter III) Rebirth is sort of an extension of the experimental side that was hinted at on that album and his other recent work. It's sort of like his inverse answer to Chris Cornell's Scream; it's am answer which no one asked for though, and sadly the ending result makes the comparison between the two albums uncomfortably appropriate.    Admirably, Wayne is anything but shy taking his brand in various unexplored directions on Rebirth, even doing his own instrumentation in some areas. However whatever novelty-factor that remains of hearing Lil Wayne singing thrash-metal or playing a guitar is quickly drowned out by its own outdated sound, running the gamut sonically from watered down and cheesy mid 1990s alternative radio jams to pre-Appetite For Destruction hair metal ballads. Production-wise, Rebirth is able to boast names such the The J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League and Travis Barker as well as other contributors, which makes it all the more disappointing that the songs seem to just run together.    Except of course for all of Rebirth's meddling excursions into new territory, which meet a similar level of mediocrity. The tragically corny \\"Get a Life\\" does a punk-polka dance in the dead middle of the album that doesn't need to be heard too many more times than once. \\"One-way-trip\\" has a light industrial influence and features a seething keyboard riff which sounds like a  rehash of something from The Fragile.    The worst part is that all the monotonous clutter makes very little room for any standout tracks. One of those being \\"On-Fire\\" in which Wayne croons over an Amy Holland sample that any fan of Scarface or GrandTheft Auto 3 will instantly recognize. However its the anxiously-worked drums that qualify this as a long standing club favorite. \\"Drop the World\\" features a dauntless Eminem, whose double time flow is a welcome relief from whatever Wayne is doing for the rest of the song-even if his verse is only about \\"walls closing in\\" and various other long clichéd subject matter. If anything, its a reminder of how out-of-place Wayne sounds with this material, and how uneven the rest of the album is.    Grade: D

0060763280|3.0|Got this book as a gift from a friend, who knew I was in the process of building a new business and was looking for motivational sources to keep me - well, motivated.  I found a lot of great ideas in the book, but as the saying goes, \\"Take what you like and leave the rest.\\"  There are several rather chauvinistic references to the author's unfortunate, \\"spendaholic\\" wife (as if men don't buy expensive toys like souped up sports cars, video games, golf clubs, Laker's tickets and the latest electronic technology \\"must-have's\\", thus spending far more on ridiculous purchases than we do).  OK, OK, getting to my point: \\"Millionaire Mind\\" is a limited phrase these days.  A millionaire isn't such a big deal any more.  Every time I was prompted to touch my forehead and say that I have a Millionaire Mind I had to edit and say \\"Ten Million Dollar Mind\\" instead, because I don't want to get stuck expecting a piddling million bucks.  You laugh - but after taxes, a millionaire is often just another middle to lower middle class person. Hey, nothing wrong with that, but I don't think it's what the author wanted us to believe about ourselves originally.  Also: he exhorts us to buy, buy, buy real estate, which, \\"even in a down market\\" as he claims, \\"if you wait long enough, it will pay off.\\"  Really? Nobody expected what has happened to the real estate market recently, in which banks began to charge exorbitant interest fees and thousands of real estate \\"moguls\\" went under, went bankrupt, are now having to try to get rid of what is basically worthless property at this point.  Is there such thing as \\"worthless property\\"?  Well, yes, for a long time to come, sorry to say.  Unless you are a twenty-something and can wait ten, fifteen, twenty years or more, without having to blink an eye about your losses, you are up the proverbial creek.  Otherwise, why are some of us  so happy we didn't invest in real estate?  Why do we feel so relieved?  Everyone (formerly) rich I know (and I know a lot, being a counselor to many of them) has new creases in their foreheads and perplexed, shifting eyes, as if they've just awakened from a nightmare, which they have.  So: now is the time to get going and do it YOUR WAY.  Take the author's basic ideas about working for yourself, good money managment and a new or continued savings discipline and go forward knowing that you were smart to give it a moment.  The stock market; real estate - don't completely rule them out - but they no longer hold the promise of instantaneous - or even future - wealth they once did.  Your creative mind is the only place from which that wealth is going to spring.  Bon appetit!

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Brilliant! Sensational! Exceptional! Words that tend to be associated with the name Pixar.  In blu-ray format and with the surround sound speakers turned way up it was just like watching it at the cinema. The picture was crisp and vibrant and the sound quality was superb.

B002YOKVU4|5.0|This is my all time #1 favorite film, I love Hunter S. Thompson's writing, Terry Gilliam's films, and Johnny Depp & Benicio Del Toro are 2 of my favorite actors, but what makes this movie my favorite is the combination of these 4 peoples talents.     \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" for years was considered to be an unfilm-able novel, in part because it's a true story about ungodly amounts of substance abuse, but aside from that, there really isn't any kind of normal story structure to it, and for years no one could figure out a way to fit Thompson's free-form writing style into a typical, 3-act structure, movie screenplay. The brilliant thing a but Gilliam's film though, is that he doesn't even bother with a typical 3 act structure screenplay, but instead uses weird camera moves, lighting and editing to create a kind of \\"visual approximation\\" of Thompson's free wheeling, start and stop, style of story telling, and Depp and Del Toro tie the whole thing together brilliantly.    But the end result is a truly unique motion picture experience, and in that way \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" my #1 favorite, is like a lot like my #2 favorite \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" because there's only one \\"2001\\" and there's only one \\"Fear and Loathing\\", and you should really see them in a movie theater, but if you can't see 'em in the theater? the Blu-rays ain't bad either.
B001AVCFJM|2.0|it amazes me how so many wannabes call this the best star trek film. they've been making star trek films for decades and now all of a sudden when they \\"dumb down\\" the story line, it becomes a big blockbuster. i remember one time while i was working and i over heard a customer saying how excited she is to see the new star trek and that soo many people have been saying how great it was. i asked her if her friends have watched any of the original films AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXISTED!!! i could already tell that she was going to come back and say how great it was because she was so naive and ignorant. when i watched the movie, it was a let down. captain kirk doesn't need to be playing beastie boys jumping out of cars!! we don't need some lame nickelodeon bar fight scene to establish that he's a rebel (it''s been done 10000000000000000000000000 times!!) and last but not least THE ROMANCE WITH SPOCK AND UHURU CAME OUT OF NO WHERE!! where in the hell did they come up with that idea!?
1402760663|5.0|Saw this book at the Smithsonian Indiian Museum in Washington DC. My husband couldn't put it down. This is the one with the illustrations which really brings home the story. Great read, great book. Anyone interested in learning the other side of the Indian story needs to read this.
B001W6S0C6|5.0|To all you \\"Dark Knight\\" band wagon riders who think that Tim Burton's film isn't like the comics or \\"true\\" Batman,you have no idea what you're talking about! This film was LOOSELY based on Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and Alan Mores \\"The Killing Joke\\", where Batman PROUDLY KILLS PEOPLE. The reason for this choice at the time was because that comic was (and still) is considered one of the best Batman comics ever written and it made Batman dark and grimey, of course this was in the eighties, while you all were still in your daddy's bag. Before you write a review and try to sound knowledgeable, do a wikipedia search or something, because this film is a masterpiece. AND. WHEN I SAY BASED ON THOSE COMICS, I DON'T MEAN LITERALLY!! I mean the style, mood, theme, and cinematography. The Dark Knight is based LOOSELY on \\"The Long Halloween\\". You fools that think your big Batman fans really aren't, otherwise you would know all this. This film impeccably creates that dark feeling that the comics had in the eighties. i hate all these people that see Dark Knight and now totally feel like disrespecting Tim Burton's vision. I loved the Dark Knight but this movie is just as good and deserves mutual respect. Jack Nicholson as the Joker was amazing and it'll always be debated which Joker was better Heath or Jack. Personally i liked Jack waaaaaaaaay better, but Heath did an awesome job too and did deserve the Oscar. I can't wait until 20 years have passed and they make another film with Batman and the Joker and all these wannabe fools that think they are Batman fans, start to praise the new film and bash \\"the Dark Knight\\" for being out dated and lame. I can't wait...
B000059GEI|5.0|If you don't love this movie, if you don't *adore* this movie -- well then, by gosh by golly, you're un-American.    And if you're French, you're un-French.    And if you're Hungarian, you're un-Hungarian.    (Catch my drift?)    This movie next to \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is like Babe Ruth next to Lou Gehrig in the Yankee lineup.  It's just great.    Everybody in the movie shines.  Even poor Johnnie Ray.  I mean, what was the idea there?  I suppose the producers figured that if every kid who bought a Johnnie Ray record came to the movie they'd make millions.      Johnnie Ray proves a theory of mine, that is: if the people who are making a film   are convinced they have a hit, they'll throw in a really bad, no-talent actor in the movie  -- for example, Cybil Shepherd in \\"Taxi Driver\\" or Troy Donahue in \\"Godfather Two\\" or George Hamilton in \\"Godfather Three\\" -- as a way of saying to the audience: \\"See, this movie is so good that it can shine even with this lousy actor in it.\\"     In other words, it makes everyone else, by comparison, look even better.    This movie also proves, at least for me, that Donald O'Connor is a much better, much more entertaining talent than either Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire.  Both those guys were way too studied, way too self-conscious in their performances.  Not that they weren't great talents, but Donald O'Connor has an \\"approachability\\" that both of them lacked.  The same is true of Mitzi Gaynor.  They engage the camera in a very amiable, spontaneous way.      You look at Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire and you say: \\"Gee, I could never do that.\\"  Whereas you look at Donald O'Connor or Mitzi Gaynor and you say to yourself: \\"Gee, it would be fun dancing with them.  I bet they'd be willing to show me how.  I bet they'd be interesting to talk to.\\"      Personally, I never felt that about Kelly or Astaire: that they were approachable.    I think there's something about film acting whereby approachability is a key factor in an actor's popularity.  Ithink it has to do with the fact that after you see someone in a movie you like you go to the Internet and you want to find out about them, professionally and personally.      Some actors are so talented -- for example, Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire --that even though they may lack \\"approachability,\\" their talent is so great that the audience can't deny them their attention.  And then there are performers such as, say, Donald O'Connor or Dean Martin or Jimmy Durante who are immediately likeable.  The audience adores them!             It was said that Donald O'Connor didn't get along with Gene Kelly on the set of \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" because Kelly, as co-director of the movie with Stanley Doneen, was such a tyrant -- and this comes across in Kelly's performances.  Whereas it's impossible to believe that Donald O'Connor was, in real life, anything but what you see on the screen.    Also, come on now -- dancing is supposed to be fun! -- and Donald O'Connor compared to either Kelly or Astaire looks like he's having much more fun than those two over rehearsed, slick-haired smoothies.       As for Marilyn Monroe. ... Now we speak of a force of nature. ... If you want to understand what there was about Marilyn Monroe that's so special, consider the beginning of her number \\"After You Get What You Want.\\"  She begins by coming onto a nightclub stage and, going from table to table, she flirts with the various male customers in the audience.  Now, when you're watching the pieces of business Marilyn does with the male customers, ask yourself: \\"What other female singer/dancer could do that like Marilyn does it?\\"  Bette Grable?  No.   Rita Hayworth?  No.  Jane Russell?  No.      Marilyn Monroe could instantaneously ingratiate herself to an audience.  As in the comparison between Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, or Fred Astaire and, say, Jimmy Durante, she doesn't have the edge or the hardness of a Jane Russell or a Rita Hayworth.  When she's flirting with the extras in the nightclub, she's flirting with all the guys who are watching the movie.  While, at the same time, the women in the audience, not jealous or competitive (I suspect), open up their heart to her.      You immediately feel her presence.  Even on a television screen! ... You can imagine what the reaction of an audience was seeing her towering above them on a movie screen.      Towards the end of the movie she comes onscreen in the middle -- in the *middle*! --of an extravagantly-staged finale, and she immediately revs up the already sky-high energy of the scene.      It's technically and metaphysically impossible for anyone in a movie to steal a scene from Marilyn Monroe.  In her best films, she owns the camera.  And \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" is, quite likely, the pinnacle of her professional and personal life.  What happened afterwards is, quite simply, an American tragedy.         Presumably Marilyn Monroe was just as ambitious, just as single-minded, just as tenacious in her quest, in her struggle for fame and fortune as Bette Grable or Jane Russell or Rita Hayworth; but the difference between Marilyn Monroe and those also-rans is that Marilyn Monroe was all heart, all simpatico.  You never saw her ambition.  You never saw her lust for fame.  You never saw her one-mindedness, her toughness, her \\"professionalism.\\"  All you saw was the woman-child.  As Elton John put it: \\"The candle in the wind.\\"       When she kisses Donald O'Connor in \\"There' No Business Like Show Business\\" and kissed Tommy Noonan in \\"Gentleman Prefer Blondes\\" and kissed \\"Tom Ewell in \\"Seven Year Itch,\\" you see sex itself in a unique way!  In most other actresses hands, \\"Seven Year Itch\\" would have been nothing more than a male chauvinist yuk, a locker room joke.  Can you think of any modern-day actress who would dare try starring in a remake of \\"Seven Year Itch\\"? ... Angelina Jolie?  Reese Witherspoon? ... Who? ... Nobody.      Stars are all around us, but comets are indeed rare.        I always felt that what defined Marilyn was the fact that she was not just an orphan but an orphan who before being sent to an orphanage lived with her mother, only to be given up by her mother at about the age of 9.  It was that emotional trauma/vulnerability that was so close to the surface in everything she did.  Put another way: no one else was like Marilyn Monroe because no one else was like Norma Jean Baker.    Marilyn Monroe always wanted to do \\"serious\\" work, and yet the joy and vitality she created onscreen in her musical roles was, in my opinion, a far greater contribution to the harmony and well-being of the human race than any success she might have had as a so-called serious actress.      \\"Tragedy is easy, comedy is hard and love is damn near impossible.\\" ... I don't know who said that but when I see Marilyn Monroe and she brings joy to my heart, I take exception to the last part of that statement -- I think anything is possible.      For all the pain and all the suffering \\"The American Empire\\" has brought to the world (to the slaves, to the American Indians, to countless Third World countries), still, it shouldn't be forgotten that America also produced people like Marilyn Monroe, and Louis Armstrong, and Babe Ruth, and Billie Holiday, and Charlie Parker.  All life-forces that, while they may not redeem the rest of us, did still walk amongst us.            It's interesting that two of Marilyn Monroe's husbands, Joe Di Maggio and Arthur Miller, both lacked a sense of humor.  They were *serious* men; both of whom felt themselves to be inherently superior to Marilyn.      By accepting that judgment, Marilyn only added to her woes.  She was, in her work, not only their equal but in many ways far, far more sustaining a life-force.  What, after all, did someone like Van Gogh try to do on a piece of canvas?  Create a vitality, life-force, no?  Excite the viewer.  Engage the observer.  Reveal something about the human condition -- love, longing, sadness.  Perhaps, above all, vulnerability. ... And who did this onscreen better than Marilyn Monroe? ... Who turned her sense of humor into a sense of humanity better than Marilyn Monroe?         Sure, her talent was far greater than any of the vehicles Hollywood could come up with for her, but her sheer presence was enough.  She didn't steal scenes from other actors, she blew them away.  As talented as they were, she turned them into props, satellites.      And now, in retrospect, knowing her sad fate, she adds yet another dimension to her onscreen presence -- she reminds us of our mortality.      Because Marilyn Monroe was not just our Sun-Goddess, the Embodiment of Life.  She was also the Dean of Death.      She was Van Gogh's \\"Sunflower\\" -- but she was also Jack Kerouac's Dean Moriarity, his \\"fabulous yellow candle ... mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time.\\"  Her first song in \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" is entitled \\"After You Get What You Want You Don't Want It\\" is not only an ironic comment on the tragedy of her life, it's also typically American, isn't it?  Indeed one might say that Marilyn Monroe ushered into the America culture the notion of \\"rampant individualism\\" -- the all-consuming, demon-loving idea of being \\"desirous of everything at the same time.\\"  This was her undoing and, as it could quite possibly turn out, it may be America's undoing as well.     Say goodbye to what you left behind, Marilyn.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|this movies is awesome and i love all indiana jones. i don't understand why people can't wrap their minds over this story line. most people seem to think that lucas pulled this story out of his ass but the crystal skull mystery is real!!!! the myths surrounding extraterestials and latin america are real!!! i'm a latin american and i really loved this story because their definitely is speculation into how the mayans, incas, and aztecs created some of their artifacts. THIS STUFF IS REAL MYTHOLOGY PEOPLE, WAKE UP!!! also, it seems people didn't understand the concept of the anti-communist/post nuclear/50's era they were going for. to me, it's not lucas that doesn't have an idea or clue but YOU CLOSE MINDED PEOPLE!!!

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Please keep in mind --this is entertainment.  It does just that IF  seen at a TRUE Imax 3D Exeperience Theater.  Most theaters consider   themselves 3D and they are--But not the REAL EXPERIENCE with a 6 STORY   TALL SCREEN and 12,000 Watt sound system.  Seen it both ways making   ALL the difference!!! It is a WOW seeing it in the RIGHT Theater.  It is a blast with a good story--lots of color,exciting scenes, and  great music.  I was still in Pandora leaving the show.    Theaters having this big screen is:  Regal Pointe-Orlando Florida; Cinemark Imax Galleria-Tarentum Pa;  and the Boeing Complex-Seattle Wa. The worlds biggest theater screen  (8 stories) is in Sydney Austrailia.  Could be more--always best to call  being sure how big screen is.  Ticket prices too reflect what  the screen is if cost is $15 or more--it is.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|This 2008 Western has all the classic elements - good guys vs. bad guys, lots of gunfights, action, suspense and a beautiful woman.  But under the fine direction of Ed Harris, who also worked on the screenplay and stars in the film, it is not just formulaic.<br /><br />The plot seems simple. Harris and Viggo Mortensen are two gunfighters who are hired by the town merchants to clean up the town and go after the bad guy played by Jeremy Irons.  Harris and Mortensen are more than just partners though;  they are true friends who have been together a long time.  And even though Harris is supposed to be the leader, it is obvious that he depends on Mortenson, especially when he gropes for words to express his thoughts and lets his friend finish his sentences for him.<br /><br />All goes well.  Some bad guys are justly murdered.  But Jeremy Irons has still not been brought down.  We all know he's a cold blooded murderer because we've seen that in the first scene.  He's even in jail awaiting trial.  But we also know it's too early in the film for justice to be done yet.  Enter another character - Renee Zellweger.  She's a widow who has come to town looking for a man.  Harris is immediately smitten.  But there are certain aspects of Zellweger's character that show that all is not what it seems.<br /><br />How it all plays out is full of surprises.  And there is more to the characterization of the main characters than meets the eye. The story moves quickly and kept my attention throughout as the plot twists and turns and sometimes made me just laugh out loud because of its outrageousness.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film.  And give it a high recommendation.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Fun, fun, fun. Upbeat and highly entertaining. Note the people watching Michael perform and note their enthusiasm and their admiration and awe.  This was put together very well. We see Michael's professional awareness of his talent and we see how hard he worked to deliver a great performance.    Just an aside: If you decide to open this DVD at midnight, anxious to watch it, consider the kind of DVD it is. Blu Ray doesn't work in your computer! Then, if you email Amazon in the middle of the night pitifully complaining, be assured they will answer you (within a half hour tops in my case) and send another one your way immediately. And then, the next day, when your husband informs you of your technological shortcomings, you will have to humbly return the new, unopened copy back to Amazon and hope you haven't totally messed up the billing. Beware!

0743455967|5.0|I really love this book!     I bought it originally out of curiosity when I was on holiday, and was immediately hooked. The first part is autobiographical, specifically dealing with his growth as a writer. The second part gets down to the nuts and bolts of language and writing.     So far I have read my copy at least three times (some parts more often) and have bought it for two other friends who are interested in getting started with their writing. It also inspired me to write my own book - I found his recommendations really useful.     I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is considering writing a book. It is a friendly, very funny and inspiring book that will take you through the process and help you to avoid some of the common mistakes.
B002N8A14M|3.0|I bought the Griffin iclear for my 5th gen. ipod because you are supposed to be able to plug in your headphones or put it on an ipod player without taking off the clear shell.  With my ipod I still have to take the iclear off, otherwise the music cuts in and out.  I've tried it all different ways, but it's staticy.  So for me, it wasn't an effective cover.  It looks good though and you can move the dial with the cover on.  I was disppointed and don't use it.  Can't return it without all the original packaging.  Save your packages until you're certain.
B000IKHNT8|5.0|i just want to clear one thing up right here and now.regardless of what anyone else says,the theatrical original versions are included with these movies on disc 2 of each movie.i know they are the unchanged original versions from before Lucas changed them,and not because i have a great memory,I'm from the 60s after all,but i played the dvd version and my original 1992 VHS version at the same time side by side and they played in sync throughout the entire movie second for second.if there were any changes made then one of the movies running would have fallen out of sync.my 1992 versions are from way before Lucas changed them and added new parts.you should be able to find these versions included with these best buy tin versions on the normal [paper] box set 2 disc versions also,as long as they are from 2006 or beyond.the VHS version looks alot worse than the DVD could ever look.the DVD looks great!however,in my opinion,the sound on the VHS is clearly superior to the DVD.its much louder and the stereo separation is much more defined.there is also a touch of extra re-verb in the sound on the VHS which gives it a movie theater feel.anyway let the debates continue and may the force be with you!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Amazon was great with a low price, free and timely shipping, and the product was in great condition as promised.  I love the complete series with the complete episode guide and guide to gilmoreisms.  I'm so glad I bought the complete series but also very glad I waited for the price drop.  Well worth the $99 I paid for it!
B00005221M|4.0|I saw this movie when it came out many years ago. I watched it for the story then. This time, as I'm more interested in pre-1840's things and this movie is supposed to be fairly accurate (but of course parts fit Hollywood entertainment needs and not historical accuracy), I watched it for what they were wearing, how they were interacting, equipment, etc. It is an enjoyable movie, good story, moves along well, well acted. I don't recall a lot of extras (if any) with this DVD. One may actually just want to check it out of the local library (and I suggest that with almost all movies). I purchased it for future reference.
0812973992|3.0|I initially enjoyed this book, but I found it to be more tedious and uncontrolled as it stretched on.  Some of the characters and vignettes are very well developed, but some lack something real and relatable.  I think it's worth a read.
0596009208|5.0|I am using this book as part of a graduate-level beginning Java course.  This book is both a fun and easy read, guiding you through the fundamentals of the language at a pace you don't even realize until you're done with a chapter.  I have taken Java before, so it made the book even easier for me than it would be for most newbies, but it's still highly accessible for anyone with a basic programming background.  I like doing puzzles, so the challenges they put at the end of each chapter, and within the chapters, were awesome!  One tip:  read the Intro section of the book--it lets you understand the approach the book takes a lot better, including that you can enjoy the experience!

0061122092|5.0|This book was really good, i really enjoyed it. im a male, big macho man all my life, kunfu student, my self identity was based on others not being able to do anything to me. it sprouted from trauma to my spirit in early childhood. the process caused me to not expose myself for fear of pain, thus...kunfu... i'm giving this information to explain where i am coming from so the audience can relate to me. i relatively recently became very spiritual, it was recommended as a book to help me connect back with my feminine, with my \\"goddess\\". i enjoyed the read, its relatively easy read (compared to other books)and it emphasizes on letting go, following you intuition, and self-forgiveness. who you are is different in every moment, always evolving, always new... id recommend this book

Absolutly a must have for any rock affectionaro
1567184855|5.0|All the ultimate questions asked, and answered. Many before Dr. Newton have made claim to this, however as a Doctor and scientist Michael Newton treats the statistics and data as just that and compiles and sorts and then slowly draws conclusions! All the while the fact that this incredible insight and knowlegde can be had by all dangles like a carrot as you absorb what others experience! As a Hypnotherapist, Journey and then Destiny of Souls prompted me to both have the experience myself, and then become trained by The Newton Institute for Spiritual Regression! Fascinating to the curious and confirming to the believers, a great read!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|excellent book. I could not stop reading. the words the characters were captivating and engaging. by reading the pages I felt I was no North Korea witnessing the famine, the death, the love, the migration. though the poverty stripped the North Koreans of their dignity, Ms. Demick was capable of showing the increadible resiliance they  exhibited. Despite the death of loved ones and the continues pain they moved on and continued to live the best they could.

The youngest sings Soul Cake, Soul Cake all the time.<br /><br />A nice change from the traditional America Christmas songs or when you want a winter scenary blast, sipping a nice mug of Joe or hot chocolate.<br /><br />Awesome!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Just terrific. Not a weak track on the cds. The music is infectious and stays with you. This is the real deal and with her writing, singing, dancing and presentation it is a superior Madonna in spades. Now, for the nitwit cry babies who want their money back, gasp, because certain swear words have been omitted and they want to hear them as if it makes a difference. Flash, it makes no difference and you have to laugh at these crybabies immaturity as if the swear words changed the power and character of the song. Of course, the average age of the crybabies is about 16. If swearing makes a difference then tracks with epitahs would rule the day. This is the new era of glam. What a talent and complaining about a missing word or two is ludicrous. Let them show their immaturity and demand a refund and be deprived of a listening to two cds jam packed with outstanding music. What a hoot these nitwits are. Let them rant about being short changed because swear word were omitted. What a hoot!
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I wanted this video collection as it covers almost every video Madonna ever did, not all but most.  I read the negative reviews here and decided not to get it.<br /><br />After a few weeks I read more of the reviews and realized that most of the negative reviews were from blu ray owners.  THIS IS NOT A BLU RAY DISC PEOPLE!  Its a DVD!!!<br /><br />Anyone should realize that if they have a 1080p high def tv and a blu ray or upscaled dvd player that most dvds will not look very good.  1080p is a BLU RAY display device, made for high def discs-NOT DVD!<br /><br />I played a few of the videos last night on my five year old Sony lcd projection 720p tv last night and the sound/pictures are EXCELLENT!!  Very clear and smooth images free of any problems.<br /><br />Perhaps with all the upset 1080p folks Warner will release a blu ray of this collection.  Im sure they just wanted this collection to be perfect, like the rest of us who love Madonna- a passionate bunch.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|In order to be different from previous productions, the director has decided to make the female lead a shopkeepers daughter rather than a Baronet's daughter. She seems to be in pain all the time, the costumers appear to have decided that two or three outfits (dowdy ones at that!) were adequate and that the director thought it was perfectly normal to have a Baronet's daughter sprinting the streets of bath as though a pack of dogs were after her.<br /><br />If one wants an elegant production, one that matches the novel then I recommend the 1971 BBC version.

0321146530|4.0|Before this book, I was doing unit testing - test-after - and had not done any TDD. As a result of reading this book, I am now writing new code in a test-driven fashion - writing my tests first, as a sort of spec, then writing code to pass the tests. It's a great feeling, writing code and knowing that it is correct.    Test-Driven Development by Example is an introduction to the practice of test-driven design. The book explains the what, when, where, how, and why of TDD. Through some running examples, Kent Beck steps through the thought process of adding code and changing functionality after writing tests. The steps are explained clearly along the way.    Now for some minor nitpicking. Kent regularly shifts into mentioning things that aren't related to the subject matter; this gets a little annoying, since you're reading about TDD, not personal antics. Also, this book is very slim, and reads quickly. This is in some ways a good thing, but from another viewpoint it ends too soon. I was left wishing for more chapters. That makes this book an introduction to TDD, not an in-depth exploration of the subject.    The nitpicks aside, the book is a great read, an easy one, and it is a success in my view. I recommend it for anyone looking to start with TDD.
B000000WA4|5.0|When i first heard this album in my early 20's i knew it was something special. Having picked up an old pre-loved copy in the bargain bin of a second hand record store I wasn't expecting much really. For me it's quite simply a roller coaster ride of emotions, evrything from heavy rock to pop metal coupled with poetic lyrics. Some 10 years later I still can't get enough of this album. Aural bliss!

B002ZHKZEC|3.0|I love DOCTOR WHO. It never mattered to me about the horrendous special effects from the old days, as one's imagination made the monsters far scarier and, dare I say, faster than seen on screen. The New Who is quite a feast for the eyes, though. And, as always, there are the occasional script/story-line problems. But, as others have coined, DOCTOR WHO is [now] 11 times better than anything else on telly.    Next, please be warned that neither the DVD or Blu-ray versions of episodes 1-4 contain cast commentaries. Why not? you might ask, especially since they exist (some are downloadable through iTunes or BBC on-line). To me, this is a terrible blunder that should be corrected with trading in these sets for 'fully-packed' sets in the near-future. The final two-part finale does contain audio commentaries.    Also, for the Blu-ray version, it is a total mis-use of the medium. Heck, all 5 stories could fit on one Blu-ray disk, still with high quality. Very silly.    And speaking of 'silly', the first two specials are just that. Loads of fun, please don't get me wrong (again, I am a huge DW fan), I really enjoyed them, but moments and scenes were forced and poorly scripted. They needed polishing. Still, I agree with others who opine that these two were average but delightful adventures.    WATERS OF MARS appears to've benefited from being later in the schedule, as the script is both simple and powerfully devastating. This story stands alone as the best of all of these 5 specials.    Now, the two-part finale. Begins well, but one should definitely wait a few hours if not a day or two after watching WOM before tackling this one. Mostly because of how we first see The Doctor in his first scene. It would abruptly halt the resonance of the preceding episode. But soon after we get on our way, again it feels as if Mr Davies is dropping some of the balls he's trying to juggle, and we're waiting patiently s he goes about the room picking them up so that the story can push forward.It's a basic pacing problem, very difficult here, trying to lay out ground-work while refreshing our memories and making the story move forward. There are a few things here which simply do not satisfy, though the smile on one's face is quite contradictory. Cohesion and flow missed the tram, got left behind.    While fans will debate many issues of these episodes, the fanboy wankiness of the final 15 minutes is lovely and fairly easy to forgive. Still, it might have meant more had there not been SO MANY BLASTED REMINDERS that the 10th Doctor's 'song would soon end'.    But go on, enjoy the shocks, the surprises, the hope, and the sorrow of David Tennant's last bow.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|I got this because it was cheap and people were really hyping it up, it's nothing fantastic. I have big hands and I've never had trouble with my controller. I added this to the controller I use the most but I wouldn't buy another one for my other controller. This is just something I guess for people who want to rest a finger on the controller I don't think its something you really need to have.
B002ZG997M|5.0|The Book of Eli was a really well done movie with good visuals, and good script, and good acting, and also good action.<br /><br />The visuals fit it was sort of like the visuals in I AM LEGEND OR RESIDENT EVIL APOCOLYPSE.<br /><br />The script was good but don't want to tell to much about it because I read pretty much every scene in the movie before seeing it and it lost a little of the surprize.  To be as vague as possible the movie is about a man in this wasteland where there are gangs of scavengers trying to kill and steal from everyone.  He is trying to go west.  He has a book that is very important to him and he seems to not be a thief or a murderer and will kill only when it is in self defense.  There is a town that he arrives in that is ran by a guy named Carnagie played by Gary Oldman and he sees that he is different and able to dispatch his gangs of raiders with ease and want to recruit him.  That is as far as I will go with the plot.  To me anything else would spoil it.<br /><br />The acting was very well done.  I was surprized that the girl from the 70's show that was kelso's girl friend was so good.  I think her name is mila kunis or something like that.  Denzel was very good to watch and was as fun to watch when he wasn't speaking as when he was.  His facial expresions and mannerisms were acting he didn't have to tell you how he felt.  Gary Oldman was good as a guy trying to be powerfull and be in charge of the towns people and was a little crazy and mean.<br /><br />The action was well done too.  There was violence but it kind of showed shadows of the men after the first bloody limb being cut off as to avoid it being sick or some sort of twisted black comedy like kill bill.  The action was frantic and there were probably a well placed action scene about every 15min or so.  I would recommend the movie but if you don't like violence and are offended by language you may not enjoy yourself as much even though there is a positive message to the movie.<br /><br />Kevin

B000H1RFKU|5.0|Training Day is an awesome movie hands down. The fact that I can watch it with my sweet new blueray player on my sweet new HDTV makes it even better.

0470477237|5.0|Facebook and Twitter are both big right now and it appears they're only going to get bigger.  With their growth, the overall reach of social media could cause a shift in how businesses market their products and services over the internet.  The reach for the top spot on Google may soon be replaced by having as many fans or friends (or followers if we're talking about Twitter) as possible.  As an example, having a testominial on your Facebook fan page might mean way more then having a testimonial page on your website.  This shift is one of the primary subjects covered in the book Socialnomics: How social media transforms the way we live and do business.  In the book, Erik Qualman (a fellow Spartan) provides examples and case studies into why you want to jump on the social media band wagon.    Nornally I tell you my thoughts after I run down the book but this was such a great read that I might as well get to the point.  I'm highlighting five books on my website that I consider required reading for any business owner.  Some of these are older books (with one yet to come that was written in the early 1900s).  Not all of the books have to do with marketing as much as developing a mind set for owning and operating a business.  This book probably doesn't belong with those five but it's definitely one of the top five marketing books I've read (which is something for another series).  If you're a business owner right now and you want some ideas on taking your business to the next level, this book is a must read.    Here's what you get.  We start out with several answers to some very important questions.  Why is there social media?  Why has it gotten so big?  Another underlying premise of the book is that surfing the web is going to be a thing of the past.  With social media, everything is going to find you, whether it's news, what your friends are doing or updates from the company's related to the products you buy.     He also discusses the downfalls of social media, namely that you have to be careful what you put up on your Facebook page.   Likewise, if you're business owner, you have to be very careful about what you do or your shortcomings could go viral in the blink of an eye.    It also highlights how people will now go to their friends on Facebook to get advice on making a buying decision  before (or even if they do it at all) they go to google to read reviews by random people.     One of the longest case studies is a look into how President Barack Obama used social media to help win not only the presidential election but the democratic nomination over Hillary Clinton.   There are also several case studies through out the book from how ESPN is getting their advertiser's messages across on their radio shows to how television networks are adjusting to how people watch their shows (on the computer versus on the television).     The book then wraps everything up with how things might look in the future.  The general message is that company's need to adapt or see their revenues shrink.  Interruption marketing could become a thing of the past and social media is here and it's here to stay at least for a while. The sooner you can jump on the train, the better of you'll be.    Another cool thing about the book is at the end of each chapter, there's a summary of all of the key points.  It's great to have that so you can go back and find something you wanted to go back and read (or if you need to find something to help you write your book review).  Overall, I give the book a ten (out of ten) rating and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to further their marketing efforts.
B002I5E8TO|5.0|Good Ole Jethro Tull.  When I heard the cut \\" Inside\\" on the radio I thought it was one of his newer releases, then found out it was on one of his first albums, \\"Benefit\\".   What a musical genius, to be that consistently great - over the decades.
B001BJ6918|5.0|Una Thurman is a fine actress, and shows it in this Hi action movie, she swings a mighty sword for sure.Can't wait to see the second half of the movie
B0010OMXKA|5.0|What I ordered is what I received and the product was great.  It shipped on time.
B001MYIXAW|4.0|I wish to order \\"Let the Right One In [Blu-ray] (2008)\\" But, I only want it if it the edition that has the corrected subtitles. The back should say \\"English (Theatrical)\\" as opposed to the old version that only says \\"English.\\"    Some people have said they have contacted Amazon & were assured that they would get the correct version & others have said they were told it is a gamble.    I called Amazon & was told they have no guarantee & if I got the wrong version I could return it but, I'd have to pay S&H.    I'm considering the UK version which always had the correct subtitles and has the English commentary track but may have some picture glitches, may not have lossless audio & doesn't have one of the short features & or galleries that is on the USA version.    Seems the US version with the Theatrical subtitles is the best bet all around. Now how do I get it?
B0026P3G12|3.0|Love the music but the CD had several places that seemed off, or had a skip and the sound was not proper for a short period? Maybe just a bad CD??
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|Giving it 5 starts, to balance all the negative ratings.  I thought this was a very entertaining movie, with some awesome special effects and stunts.  Had a good story/polt.  Yeah, it is all science fiction, and hard to believe, but it is a Movie!  For entertainment.  Highly recommend for a good evening os escapement and wanting of a good action flick.
B002RVZV9U|4.0|Gives you the background of three different generations of guitar heroes. Would have liked a little more of all three jamming together.  But still worth the cost if you are a rock music person.
B001UV4XUG|1.0|Although beautifully acted and had potential promise to spare, my review of this movie is relegated to this:  (maybe it's because I'm a guy and can relate to how women change their minds about relationships on the whim of the wind...)<br /><br />The entire PREMISE of this movie is more like a \\"reality\\" (NOT) TV show than anything that could - or would - happen in real life (you would hope). If this girl was willing to go a FULL YEAR, having \\"shower sex\\" with this guy, etc, etc, and then just decide that \\"you're not the one\\", then she needed to be on meds. At the VERY LEAST, this would be extremely cruel and unusual punishment to the person trying to love you. Of course, in the highly fantasized and untypical world of movies, anything goes. I'm not a violent person, but I would certainly want blood from a person that manipulated my feelings and took advantage of my good nature the way that this woman did to this guy.....  Just because there's a \\"Hollywood Happy Ending\\" does not mean that the treatment by Summer should go unpunished...
B001U9BRNE|4.0|Really a great disc, and for demoing as well.  The Chris Botti concert is slightly better video and sound quality, but this one is certainly worth purchasing.  Brian McKnight performance is great, he does a nice job with Earth Wind and Fire cover.
B0036EH40Q|1.0|There is no information as to whether this Blu-ray is the theatrical cut, or the far superior Director's Cut.  If it is not the DC, I will not be purchasing this.

B0025KVLV0|4.0|I just picked up the latest remastered LIB cd and I dont think it is near as good as LIB Naked.  Naked is cleaner sounding, drums and bass come through better and with solid punch.  The vocals shine on Naked, they really do, trust me.  There is a little hiss I pick up on the remastered LIB, compared to Naked, which is absolutely clean, with great separation between instruments.  Removing Spector's special effects really opens up the true LIB.  Plus, his effects actually date the recording, where with Naked, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday.  It is really that clean, and punchy.  It was truly a revelation to hear Naked again.  I much prefer it.  The only thing I miss is the guitar solo on the song Let It Be, and the better drum rythm on the last verse.  All the vocals have never sounded better.  They really come through crisp and clear.  Great mixing job on Naked.  Okay on remastered LIB.  Plus you get a better song order on Naked and you lose two lousy songs to make room for Dont Let Me Down.  A great trade off.  Get Naked, you won't regret it.

0385504225|5.0|I found this book to be very engrossing. It was hard to put down. The book had numerous details about the Masons, the U.S. Capitol, etc. The ending was a complete surprise.
0385737947|5.0|The Maze Runner is a thrilling read. I first listened to this book on audio and it was awesome! From beginning to end I felt the mystery of the unknown. I have been obsessed with reading since I discovered the chapter book and I am always looking out for an awesome story. I found myself constantly wondering what would happen and trying to predict what was coming. I couldn't and I loved it! There's no fun in a predictable book and James Dashner didn't disappoint me. I have read comments that Thomas was whiny, complaining alot, or demanding. While this may seem overdone, Thomas is a genius 16 year-old kid who had his memories wiped and woke up in a place that is unknown and dangerous. I imagine that his responses could be how anyone might act in such a situation. Teresa is considered by some to be a \\"flat\\" character. I would agree with that statement, but I would say that she was really only part of the end of the story. She spent most of the time unconscious. There wasn't alot of time to develop her character in this book. I hope to see growth in the next book. It will be interesting to see how Dashner develops his characters throughout the trilogy. I do hope to see growth in all of the characters. It wouldn't be realistic any other way.<br /><br />While I could make a few predictions I could never have guessed what was coming. Even now at the end of the first story, there is still a mystery of what is to come and and the feeling of \\"What in the world is going on!\\" I love it! I cannot wait to continue with the next book. I also have to say, I sincerely hope he doesn't kill off Minho! He's my favorite character other than Thomas. Anyone who loves sci-fi or even fantasy needs to read this book. I would not recommend this to anyone under the age of 12. This is not Harry Potter or Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Dashner isn't afraid of blood, death, or pain. It brings an element of reality that many authors avoid. I'd put this book on my shelf right next to The Giver by Lois Lowry (another awesome book).owry (another awesome book).
0316017922|5.0|This is a totally unusual, yet practical view at some of the aspects that lead to success. I had never thought of outliers from the perspective of the author. Very good read and I got my entire family hooked on it.
0740785508|5.0|This book is both beautiful and functional. It's a brilliant tutorial on making the imaginary real; it's also a thick compendium of beautiful images of the author's successes in this endeavor. The examples are built around real, serious drawings and paintings; no flimsy pedagoguery here. The text is informative and the writing style is natural and comfortable to read. I'd recommend this to any would-be fantasy artist, at any level: there's so much between these covers that every practitioner, regardless of experience, will learn something from this book.
B0000AEKAW|5.0|Dangerously In Love is a perfect solo album debut by Beyonce. Crazy in Love is a totally enjoyable introduction. Beyonce and Jay Z compliment each other perfectly. Naughty Girl with it's belly dancer rhythms is a total delight. Baby Boy with it's reggae theme is such a delight. This album is like eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,it is good to the last bite.
B001N26GFM|5.0|The story is excellent.  With a great ending.  The dvd is fine too.
B003629IPW|5.0|I purchased \\"This Is It\\" the first day it was out...I really enjoyed watching the \\"Special Features\\" on the disc..We never got to see how Michael would end this concert...In special features they include what would have been the ending to the greatest concert that never was...When I saw this 2 disc Ltd. Ed. with one disc devoted to the dancers, the band, the singers, the aerialists and a bit more never seen footage, with two more songs, I had to watch it...It did not disappoint...If the 2 disc edition had been available at the store I would have purchased it but it was not ....The 2 disc set with bonus features was well worth the price...RIP MJ you are loved and missed
0312370849|5.0|This book really gets you from all angles.  From the past with Sarah who is having troubled times to the present with the Americane have troubled times.  It will make you feel empathy for others and even yourself.    Really great book - great for book club readings.
B002BW7A58|4.0|This album is nothing near what I had expected, it's very very different. I track for track, I just prefer hip hop style beats. The first two tracks are my favorite apart from the one with Em. He definitely wanted to try something different, which people should respect. I think that if you're looking for a Carter 3 part two, don't buy this album.
0307454541|5.0|One of the most compelling mysteries/thrillers I've read.  Extremely well written and fascinating in its details, the desire to read its sequel was overpowering.
B001HBX8NC|5.0|This is too brief to be called a review, and I intend to come back with something more substantial. But for the moment.<br /><br />We are in a period where directors far too often want to modernize the setting; sometimes it works, other times it is terrible misjudgement. Then there are productions geared to display a star performer. And so often producers/directors forget that if the composer wrote a work in the form of an opera, it was intended to be seen, so the acting, both visual and through the singing, is an important part of the production. This has, in the past, not always been given its due.<br /><br />Well in this production, none of these failings are present. First, let me say, a composer wrote his opera for the stage, and that is where it should be performed. This production boasts a cast of uniform excellence, where the beautiful singing of Verdi's great score rates among the very best. But the performers, soloists and chorus have been directed to fully bring out the dramatic aspects as well, i.e., to act as well as sing. Musically, both chorus and orchestra are in top form, under a conductor who has a full grasp of the total perspective of the score, both musically and dramatically.<br /><br />Sets and costumes cannot be faulted, and all is enhanced by excellent lighting design. All of this gushing is due to the fact that it is rare to find all the elements of an opera production at such a uniformly high standard and unified so that not one thing stands out  and hits you as \\"not quite right\\", and nothing emerges above the totality to warrant special praise. There are operas I have reviewed with enthusiasm, but few have created the impression this performance gives (and it isn't even one of my favorite Verdi operas).<br /><br />The icing on the cake has been expressed in most of the reviews. If ever you wanted a demonstration disc for your Blu-ray, this is it. Most people are unaware that Blu-ray does not necessarily equate with stunning quality, and there have been Blu-ray releases that were little better than DVD, although this seems to have been a passing phase. But in this release we have Blu-ray at its best: unsurpassed clarity, the greater depth and subtlety of color that is another of the advantages of the format, and sound quality that is an audiophile's dream - and what better production on which to lavish these high standards.<br /><br />Please forgive my gushing, but this is a near-perfect release . Watching and listening to it was literally a revelation, and provides a \\"you are there\\" experiience if viewed via a good projector on a 100\\" screen with sound facilities that can do justice to what is on the disc.<br /><br />In my planned rewrite, I promise to try and stand back and review this much less emotively.that were little better than DVD, although this seems to have been a passing phase.

B002ZHKZEC|5.0|This was an amazing way to end the epic journey of David Tennant through his seasons as the timelord.  Yes he is the best doctor so far, but this still doesn't mean that the next one wont be good, yeah he wont be a david tennant but it still will be an amazing show still.  Now about the 5 episodes.  I loved them all, deffinetly a good way to end David's reign as the timelord.  I love the end of time part 1 and 2, (spoiler) I love how they brought the time lords back, i think they should of made it so gallifrey still came back but didn't take over the earth, so the timelords would be back for the new doctor to make up for the fact that tennant is leaving, but thats just what i think.  I love these, and I have ordered them on blu ray, and i know they will be amazing quality because bbc is amazing at putting there shows onto blu ray with amazing quality.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|I consider myself a lucky man for many reasons, and one is this box, which I nearly a year ago, and have listened to it perhaps ten times in that year with many hours of pleasure. To begin with, it got me through two of the least uncomfortable trans-Pacific flights I've had. What's amazing how fast the nearly eleven hours of this music pass. At this time the nine disks are available here for under $60, and I'd say that is a very worthwhile use of your cash, hard-earned or otherwise. The question for most of us isn't whether we can afford this, but whether we can devote the kind of time to this music that it deserves!<br /><br />I cannot compare this box to many other recordings; the only alternatives I have heard many times are the late sonatas by Pollini: [[ASIN:B000001GXB Beethoven: Die Sp&auml;ten Klaviersonaten]], and I'd definitely say you should get that set before you get this set. (I have a few recordings of other Beethoven sonatas by Pollini also by DG, but though I enjoy them they for some reason aren't as highly regarded by the experts.)<br /><br />I'd also say you might consider a complete set of the sonatas (this box by Gilels is not complete), but I have only got one, included in the [[ASIN:B00062FLHE Beethoven: The Masterworks (Box Set)]]. That box is fine for me, but there are more famous complete sets available, such as [[ASIN:B0000DB55A Beethoven: The Complete Piano Sonatas; Bagatelles Op. 119, Op. 126 [Box Set]]], which looks to be the best bargain among those that are highly recommended. (I haven't heard it; I'm just letting you know.)<br /><br />I've listened to some of these Gilels recordings with a few of my friends who appreciate \\"classical music\\" even less than I do, and they appear to please everyone. One thing I appreciate about the set is that each time I go through it, new movements reveal themselves to me, as it were, and I think almost anyone would have that experience.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|The second highest grossing film of 2008, \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" took 19 years to make. Critics loved the movie, but ardent fans of the franchise were dissapointed in the script and the finalized film. However, being one of Indiana Jones' biggest fans I loved the movie. Action-packed with a great script, I enjoyed the movie the four times I saw it in theatres and I was extremely satisfied by what I saw. In this version Indiana is teamed up with his first love Marion from the original movie, played by Karen Allen. They also have a son who teams up with them in their battle against a beautiful evil agent, played by Kate Blanchett, who wants the rare crystal skull. The movie would ultimately gross nearly $800,000,000 at the boxoffice becoming the second most popular Indiana Jones movie of all-time. The DVD contains am informative featurette entitled \\"The Return of the Legend\\".

B009K5257M|5.0|If you liked the the first 2 Halloween movies well here is the sequel to the first 2 movies. 20 years later Michael comes back to haunt his sister but not only his sister, also her son and his friends. The way they made this movie was great because they finally have a sequel that lives up to the original. The ending was great and their was a line in the movie that caught me off guard and it was Go and that's what Laurie said when her son and his girlfriend escaped and that's when Laurie turned the tables and she fought back against Michael which made the movie to be a collector in the Halloween series. The way the ending was, To be honest made me so shocked, Spoilers: She chopped off his head. Finally he died after all those years and this is the last movie and even if they made another one i don't care because this is the ending to a perfect franchise.

1561007773|3.0|I'll make Sword of Truth fans mad with my review, but so be it.  I listened to the audiobook version.  This is the fourth book in the series I have read, and although the storyline was enough to keep me attentive and following along, I probably won't finish the series.    The chapters with First Wizard Zed I found the most entertaining, but elsewhere the author just waxes on about Richard Richard Richard, his greatness and ever increasing powers and talents, and his unending, undying love for Kalen Kalen Kalen.    The book follows Wizards First Rule.....in which a huge amount of time is devoted to torturing Richard in captivity, followed by this episode where the major gist of the book involves his capture and captivity again by the Sisters of the Light.  The themes cycle between violence (usually involving doors being blown apart and bodies hacked or thrown), Richards sword rages (different flavors of rage, changing his sword different colors, etc), brief interims of strategy-planning, followed by the next wave of violence with occasional droning ons about how much Kalen and Richard love each other, may never see each other again, can't live without each other, etc.    The author imagines a 'world of the dead' run by a Keeper (sort of like Satan or at the least, Sauron from Lord of the Rings), where people basically go to when they die.   But those who die still exist as active characters in the story; some barrier called a Veil keeps them from coming \\"back\\", which is always in danger of being damaged and rendered ineffective.  This complicates things as the bad guys who are killed aren't really killed, and the main nemesis in this book is essentially King of the Dead, and therefore unkillable either.    Nevertheless a whole lot of attention and time is devoted to killing regardless.    I found the book entertaining but I wearied of the continual violence, I imagine if this were ever made into a movie it would literally wear the actors out.   How Richard could endure all the physical pain by this point and not be entirely numb, every bone in his body broken and his nervous system completely destroyed (as well as some of the other characters....)  is something that would have to be considered.   Lucky for him even if he were killed, he'd still be alive, just in the dead world, of course  (??)
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This is a nice addition to anyone's library. This takes place in a ancient ruin. The footage is great, the interview clips are great, the music is awesome!
B002VKE0XA|1.0|Ill keep this short. This movie is basically a group of clever camera tricks strung together with a half hearted storyline. The creator(s) do not know how to create an engaging movie. Had I seen some of these clips online or something, I would say they were cool looking and clever. But as an actual theatrical movie? It does not hold up. Not to mention the fact that there is talent out there that has worked their entire lives to make movies, just to have a nobody acidentally create something like this and have it catch on for some reason. Blair Witch was three times the movie this is.
0810982862|5.0|If you like films, if you liked this one, if you're an artist like me, or not, you're probably going to buy this. Period.    I would have liked it to be a few hundred pages longer, but then it would have cost more than my starving artist budget would allow.    I read one review which muttered about the roughness of some of the art. Hello! It's pre-production art! The film is fantastic photorealism, the concept art is a whole 'nother style, or set of styles.     As in the \\"Survival Guide\\", you get a closeup look at many things that go by in a flash in the film. You get insights into the creative process. Like many movie production art books, it would make a good teaching tool in an art class; showing the progression from idea to finished product.

B002QW7ALM|4.0|So close.... This movie had alot going for it, it really did. Could have possibly gone down among the greats, however, a few flaws kept it back. The biggest problem with this guy is the creature design. First off they are a re-hash of the creatures featured in the descent. They have that jerky camera trick movement which has not only been done a million times before, but actually takes you out of the scene because of it's implosability. Secondly, they somehow, even though they are carnal creaturs, fashioned a unified mad max uniform. No idea where they got this gear, or how they all got together to approve of the design, but apparentrly they did. Some of the characters are forced and don't really make sense, namely the fighting amongst themselves. The main female character starts off as a farrel amazon woman who attacks everyone, then almost instantly turns around as a likeable scientist, all anamosity forgoten. The atmosphere is great, the concept really good, I love how they presented the hypersleep thing, and the twist ending is executed very well. I just wish that the creatures were handled better.

0446560065|5.0|As one who is \\"owned\\" by four cats, Simon's Cat would certainly fit right in here.  Whether videos on his website or experiences printed in this book, this is simply the cutest and funniest cat around.  As the saying goes, \\"every picture tells a story\\".  It's easy to tell Simon Tofield knows and loves cats.  Yes, they can be demanding and sometimes almost more than you can deal with.  But they can also be the best idea God ever had.

1423113497|5.0|I bought these books on a whim.  My daughter (10 years old) mentioned that her friend liked them.  I bought these for a Christmas present for her and she loves them!  She has read all three books and has almost finished the 4th book in this series.  I started reading them and they are really good books.  I am finishing up the 3rd one myself.

0132350882|4.0|I really like this book except for one thing: there isn't much new material here.    This book is a very good summation of:  - Code Complete by Steve McConnell (I recommend the second edition)  - Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C# by Bob Martin  - Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests  by Steve Freeman    On the plus side, it is well-written, concise, contains a nice balance of theory and practice, and does an excellent job of communicating the principals of Agile programming.    But if you've already bought the other books you don't really need this one.

B002U6CJCE|5.0|With stolen top-secret technology, terrorists have created a next-generation Universal Soldier, an elite fighter genetically altered into a programmable killing machine. With this \\"UniSol\\" Former UFC Heavyweight Champion Andrei \\"The Pit Bull\\" Arlovski leading the way, they seize the crippled Chernobyl nuclear reactor, threatening to unleash a lethal radioactive cloud. The only one who can stop them is Luc Deveraux, a UniSol who's been decommissioned for years. Reactivated and retrained, Deveraux must make a full-out assault on the heavily armed fortress. But inside, he'll discover not one but two of these virtually indestructible warriors. Andrew Scott, Deveraux's vicious UniSol enemy from the original Universal Soldier, has been secretly reanimated and upgraded. Now, these elite fighters are locked, loaded and programmed to kill; and the fate of millions hinges on this high-action showdown. In the third and by now the last Universal Soldier series, both Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are back for one last showdown together. Universal Soldier: Regeneration is an enjoyable movie, and leaves you with a sense that it's not over yet.
1400052173|5.0|I'm sitting here and really striving to find the right words to do justice to The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. This story, and the way the author told it, is everything I hope for in a non-fiction book. Rebecca Skloot brings the story of Henrietta and her family to national attention, and allows tribute to be paid to a woman who died too young, but who unknowingly changed the world. Her diligence in tracking down the story and earning the trust of a family with good reason to be wary is commendable.<br /><br />The story is not just about Henrietta, but also about her family, including one daughter who was institutionalized and was also treated poorly. It's the story of one son who, as he was going in for surgery, is told by the doctor how important his mother was, but wakes up $125,000 in debt due to lack of insurance. And, it's a story of a daughter who wanted to know what happened to her mother and sister, but was too young to remember either one. It's a story about race and about poverty and about a lack of education, and how these things factor into quality of life. It's also a story that raises the questions about informed consent and if anyone has a right to test and experiment on your cells, your DNA, without your knowledge.<br /><br />Whether your interest is medicine, science, ethics, history, race, or a combination of several of these elements, I believe this will be a fascinating and memorable read.
B00000J7J4|5.0|SUPERNATURAL is a testament to the stylistic breadth of Carlos' musical world, to his dynamic communicative abilities, and to the fact that rolling stones truly gather no moss. The man makes a guitar wail like no other. SUPERNATURAL offers a winning context of musical fusion that highlights Santana's unique ability to make that guitar of his cry expressively. Whether he's spraying lyrical notes over a soulful Lauryn Hill composition, trading molten licks with Clapton, or playing spacey blues with Everlast, Santana still has that old 'Black Magic Woman' thing goin' on.
038533348X|5.0|I ordered this book as a Christmas gift for my sister, she gave me instructions to purchase a \\"used copy\\" because a new copy would be a waste.  When the book arrived, very quickly by the way, I was pleasantly suprised.  The \\"used\\" copy that I purchased<br />looked like new.  My sister scolded me on Christmas morning for purchasing a new copy, only I new that it was used.

B001TOD92C|5.0|This is a drama about an aging professional wrestler, decades past his prime, who now barely gets by working small wrestling shows in VFW halls and as a part-time grocery store employee. As he faces health problems that may end his wrestling career for good he attempts to come to terms with his life outside the ring: by working full time at the grocery store, trying to reconcile with the daughter he abandoned in childhood and forming a closer bond with a stripper he has romantic feelings for. He struggles with his new life and an offer of a high-profile rematch with his 1980s arch-nemesis, The Ayatollah, which may be his ticket back to stardom.  In this movie Mickey Rourke doesn't just play a wrestler, he is a wrestling star, he is Randy The Ram in every way. 'The Wrestler' is great. It's a rich, round movie that smoothly weaves together pathos and comedy and soul. It's funny and dramatic, tear-jerking and tough. Definitely a must see.
1416550534|4.0|The House at Riverton reminds me of a well worn comforter.  Rich and tattered, warm but with holes, this novel is a blend of good story telling and average writing.  It is an entertaining saga that spans a decade well written about, the Edwardian era from WWI - the twenties. Ms. Morton has created a novel that tells the life and secrets of the Hartford family and the narrator, Grace a house servant, who is the last remaining person alive who knows the truth about a stunning set of events occuring at a family party one summer night.  Ms. Morton really pushes the mystery envelope by making the reader endure more than 400 pages before revealing the facts at last in the final pages of the book in a movie-esque type of ending.  Is it worth waiting for? Yes and no.  This book provides the reader with  interesting, lushly written surroundings and mood.  Unfortunately the characters are all to predictable and well told already. This novel is enjoyable but is, to me, a good imitation of a great novel such as Atonement by Ian McEwan.  Cheers to Ms. Morton for a well done readable effort that did surprise me in the end.
B00005QGAX|5.0|This CD is definantly MJ's greatest work in terms of the fact that he wrote 9 of the 11 songs. This CD is as good as Off the Wall and Thriller. I like all three equally for different reasons. So, if you don't have the original album like I do, I got the CD to play all the time. I would highly suggest that you buy them. Michael Jackson was unquestionably the biggest pop star of the '80s, and certainly one of the most popular recording artists of all time. Jackson always remained bigger than life.
0780626966|3.0|Extremely happy with the shipping time of delivery. Was estimated to arrive in a months time but got it a week later.  However the product itself was not so satisfying. Each of the 8 discs have marks and scratches on them. I have watched 3 of the discs and so far all is good. Also the inside of the dvd covers were all broken. Poor effort I must say.  Besides that, Nightmare on Elm Street is a great collection!
0307266303|4.0|Somehow get past the first half of the book, and you'll like the rest. McDougall attempts to build a lot of suspense leading to what might be regular everyday experiences in the Copper Canyon and nearby area - I reached a point saying - oh! here he goes again getting 'almost' killed by drug thugs - glad that I didn't put the book down, it turned quite absorbing from there on. I especially liked the anthropological perspective on how and why running became so important for survival and played an important role in human evolution.    Kudos to Mc for sharing the Tarahumara viewpoint on running and diet - I actually had to go out for a run after reading this book. Especially runners would love this book.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|My wife and I liked the first season although she found all the killing a bit disturbing.  The second season was even better.  The characters seemed more real, the plot was nice and thick.      The third season takes the cake.  Jimmy Smits was outstanding and brought a whole new level of suspense to the show.  Almost impossible to watch just one episode a night.  Can't wait for season 4.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Personally, I don't care to listen to swearing when I have my headphones on. There's enough of it already. I like that it's sensored and Lady GaGa has some really good tracks on this cd.    Good:   \\"Teeth\\" - I love the beat of it.  \\"Telephone feat. Beyonce\\" - has a nice cocky rhythm that gets you dancing (admit it or not)  \\"Bad Romance\\" - a very good single  \\"Alejandro\\" - a little repetitive on the Alejandro part but other than that it's great.    I recommend this cd if you're the kind of person who doesn't mind sensored cd's.

B00004VW0V|3.0|While in his creative and commercial peaks as an artist, Cat Stevens was feeling both an artistic and spiritual restlessness that culminated in \\"Foriegner\\" in 1973. He chose to produce himself, composed an 18 minute single side \\"suite,\\" added a string section, more keyboards than acoustic guitars, female singers, and took artistic aim at the likes of [[ASIN:B00000AOUD Thick as a Brick]] or [[ASIN:B0025KVLUQ Abbey Road]]. Folks looking for the delicate folk-songs in the vein of \\"Peace Train\\" or \\"Wild World\\" were caught off guard by ambitiously orchestrated \\"Foreigner Suite\\" and the sad, lonely man singing \\"How Many Times.\\"<br /><br />Since this wasn't a rehash of [[ASIN:B00004T9VY Tea for the Tillerman]] or [[ASIN:B00004T9W4 Teaser and the Firecat]], there was a lot of confusion and outright hostility towards \\"Foreigner\\" at the time. Of the four more conventional songs on side two, only \\"The Hurt\\" entered the Top 40. Given the benefit of a quarter century, the album has in fact aged nicely. The suite has obviously remained a favorite of Stevens/Yusuf over the years, since his most recent recordings ([[ASIN:B001TN1EDO Roadsinger]] and [[ASIN:B000I5X82O An Other Cup]]) have used some of the musical motifs found therin. He may have been growing weary of the rock star game, but you can't fault him for wanting to stretch out.
0670021652|2.0|I find it insulting (maybe insulting is a harsh word...disappointing, maybe?) to readers that Ms. Gilbert or \\"Mrs. Brazilian Felipe\\" can change the way she portrays herself in two memoirs and expect the readers to embrace it.<br /><br />In Eat, Pray, Love, Liz portrayed herself as a spiritual person looking to better herself after self destructing (although I didn't feel that way about her situation until reading Committed) her first marriage.  The readers loved her yearning for self discovery; some to the point where they tried to copy her exact route in order to find the same balance at the ending.  In Committed, the only way Liz portrays herself is as a selfish, childish, feminist, nonconformist who can't fathom complying to any set of rules.<br /><br />The first half of Committed is mostly history and statistics which being a history and religious buff, I highly enjoyed... and then Liz seeped through.  Not in a spiritual, guided way; but that of a 3 year old child having a temper tantrum because she can't have things her way.<br /><br /> This book was a disappointment.  Not just in her obsessive quoting, statistics and random ramblings about things she has read on the history of matrimony but a disappointment to readers who read EPL and mistook her childish escape to these countries as a search for self discovery.<br /><br />Liz didn't go to Italy, India and Indonesia in EPL for spiritual guidance or to better herself.  She went to hide in these places from the difficulties of divorce and didn't go back until she thought the \\"coast was clear.\\"<br /><br />Then after she left it all behind, she once again found something else she could rant and complain about....Marriage.  Which is exactly what this book is:  A childish rant, trying to justify her reasons to avoid conforming to the norm of marriage and parenting.
0307408833|2.0|This book is beautiful.  Beautiful pictures, beautiful lay out, beautiful people in the pictures, and Good looking food.    However, I didn't order a picture book; I actually wanted to make the recipes in it.  So far, all of the items I've made were under cooked (since many of the oven temps are too low), too salty, or needed tweaking so much that now it's my recipe.  So I called the bakery, when I ask about baking temperatures, was told that they bake at a much higher temp than what I said the book noted.  I was told that I'm \\"probably not used to gluten-free baking\\".  Actually I am a professional Pastry Chef with a past boss who has Celiac as well as a husband who is sensitive to gluten.  So I do/have done much gluten-free baking and cooking.  Look at the pictures; don't waste your time with the recipes.

0767811070|3.0|Great film, i remember seeing this when i was a teenager myself, while some of the movie may be a little far fetched there is quite a lot of plausibility here. Young upstart Cuba Gudding Junior mad a fine performance as did Ice Cube. The only problem with the film is the language is way to overbearing and at times makes the film difficult to watch because of the constant f-bombing in about every other line. The story is great, and the emotions are powerful, as with when i was a child though the girl i went out withs mom had a hissy fit and kept saying if i hear that language again its going off. Well the same could be said now as an adult. But its still great no matter how much you slice it, because especially during the early to mid 90's there was a huge influx in street gangs and extended amounts of violence especially in parts of L.A, and the low lying areas of California. So if your ears don't bleed from four letter profanities then pick it up, if not you'd better pass on this one, much like the movies Scarface and Phone booth, very overshadowed by fowl language, but great classic movies none the less.

0882709194|5.0|By including Mr. Comfort's lengthy \\"introduction\\" with Darwin's Origin of Species (albeit an abridged version of Darwin's monumental work) in one book, readers are afforded an excellent opportunity to examine and compare the relative merits of the creationist viewpoint advocated by Comfort and Darwin's theory of evolution. Interestingly, this format promotes a struggle between conflicting viewpoints and can be seen as an illustration of Darwinian principles applied to the evolution of ideas. Darwin can take comfort in knowing that careful readers of even this abridged version of the Origin of Species will appreciate that his is a robust theory based on a lifetime of careful study, keen observation and reasoning that is both logical and extremely insightful. Comfort, for his part never actually makes a case for creationism. Rather he first attacks Darwin's theory largely using the same arguments that Darwin, himself, laid out and blunted 150 years earlier in his original work and then attacks Darwin's character. Comfort follows this with a strange discourse using a parachute analogy to attempt to prove that only through Christian beliefs and practice can men be delivered from eternal damnation at the hands of a wrathful God. There can be no doubt about which of these conflicting vewpoints will survive and continue to evolve and which will become extinct in the minds of fair-minded and intellectually mature readers of this important book. And with the extinction of creationist views based on a literal read of Genesis, one finds that just as a multitude of life forms successfully share this earth, Darwin's theory can happily coexist with all of the mainstream religions and theologies.

1400095204|4.0|I was inspired to read \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche after listening to the author interviewed at the BBC World Book Club.  She was a charming young interlocutor.  The subject matter is big-- love and loss in war-torn Biafra, civil war with Nigeria in the late 1960s--and she handles her material with grace, insight, and aplomb.<br /><br />It occurs to me that in the last year I've read at least two other excellent books which could fall under the general framework of 'love and war':  Birdsong, by Sebastian Faulks, and Cold Mountain, by Charles Frazier.  The framework 'love and war' is a distortion, because at their roots their not about war, or even, necessarily, love, though these elements suggest easy characterizations.<br /><br />Half of a Yellow Sun involves an ensemble of characters, and the war tests their relationships.  At some point, this could risk descending into soap opera.  At its broadest, this novel is 'about' colonialism, ethnic allegiance, class, race, moral responsibility, amidst the complications of love and conflict.  The book is at its best when most particular, most vivid, both in physical description (Ugwu senses \\"the acridness of hot metal\\" even though he can't see the bullet), or emotional.  \\"It was a tiny moment, brief and fleeting, but Olanna noticed how scrupulously they avoided any contact, any touch of skin as if they were united by a common knowledge so monumental that they were determined not to be united by anything else.\\"<br /><br />Now is the time to get in on the ground floor of this remarkable talent, so you can say you were reading her 'back in the day' when she accepts the Nobel Prize.

The 2nd unit worked but every channel was distorted before you could reach and acceptable output level.  Output volume actually decreased significantly when running a mic through the unit, compared to the direct mic input on the amp.  I requested a refund and returned the unit.  The refund was received shortly after that.  All in all, the buying and returning process was excellent. Too bad the product wasn't built that way.
0061719544|3.0|Craig Ferguson is always entertaining and the best monologist on Late Night TV.<br /><br />Reading of his beginnings one is taken by the squalor and ugliness of his early experiences with drugs, alcohol, multiple marriages, and aimlessness. It is a testament to man's ability to change that he has risen to the echelon that he enjoys today in show business.<br /><br />I missed the positive narrative side of his origins that enabled him to see the humor and quirkiness in the mud of his early years. Surely there had to be something profound that cut through all the tawdriness.<br /><br />At the conclusion of reading this account all I could summon was \\"Thank God he made it through the shadows of his personal Valley of Death.\\"<br /><br />I very much look forward to reading a sequal that celebrates a second half of a life on the right track with a sober personality loving family, children, and a sui generis talent that continues to soar.
159448385X|5.0|It's a heart-wrenching realization to know that there are so many women like Mariam and Layla in this world. Women  that have harships and a life that is seldom fair to them.  I knew next to nothing about Afganistan or the Taliban prior to reading \\"The Kite Runner\\" and now \\"A thousand Splendid Suns\\".  It's so unimaginable to know all the misery Mariam and Layla had to endure at the hands of that monster Rasheed.  How can anyone live like that? How can women be treated in such an inhumane despicable way?  These are questions that plagued my mind as I read.  I have nothing but deep admiration and profound respect for women that survive such horrible lives, such deplorable treatments bestowed upon them by insecure men that in order to feel superior, ridicule and abuse their spouses. These women are my heroes. Khaled Hosseini is a gifted writer and I consider this book his masterpiece.

B0006N2EZ0|4.0|This movie is a nice, little relic of the 90s.  Kevin Costner gives a stunning performance.  Whitney is also great.  The music is great.  Onscreen, the chemistry between the two is tangible.  Great 90s throwback.
0064410935|5.0|Charlotte's Web is a very fun book. It is about a pig named Wilbur; he is loving , kind. He is raised by a girl named Fern. Now he is a barn pig, and a spider named Charlotte tries to save him. I recommend this book to people that are kind and lovely like Charlotte.

0786838655|5.0|This book is so good! I recommend this book all the way. The main characters are Percy Jackson, Anabeth, and Grover (a satyr.) Percy is the son of Poseidon. Anabeth is a daughter of Athena. And Grover is just a satyr. The problem is that Zeus's master bolt is stolen. And they accuse Percy of it. This zapping tale will keep you on the edge of your seat. I give this electrifying story five stars. On the way to retrieve this magic item, they meet a few Greek foes like Medusa, the minotaur, and the Fates. My favorite part is where Percy battles Ares. It's kind of confusing. Ares is Percey's cousin. The setting is Mount Olympus. The time is present.  I love this book. by Abby, age 8

B00007LTIG|5.0|Speedy, punky, joyful, occasionally dissonant and very bluesy - this is one of the very best Dead albums. Check out the storm of ecstatic noise at the end of Viola Lee Blues. Sonic Youth would be proud. And this version is packed with blistering live bonus tracks.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is by far the greatest rock CD ever created. It really captures the spirit and essence of rock and roll. From the moment you hear \\" Welcome to the Jungle\\" blast through your speakers you know your going to get your ass kicked the whole ride. Axl and Slash don't disappoint either. Slash, Axl, Izzy,Duff Mckagan and Steven Adler all have a a chemistry that is like any other. EVERY song on here is a hit and no filler found. My personal faves are Paradise City,Sweet Child O Mine, Nightrain and Rocket Queen. Slash and Izzy are a great combo on guitars and Slash is on fire on his lead solos and lead guitar. Adler's drums are a great fit for the hard and fast rock of this group and Axl has one of the best voices of all time. Duff shines on Rocket Queen and Its So Easy. If you care at all about music and rock you must own this album. This album as it all and should be in anybodies top 5 albums and everyones collection.
0375815260|5.0|It's classic Roald Dahl for pity's sake.

If you are an adult and have only seen the movie(s) do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|Irritable? Frustrated? Bored or depressed? Here's the cure; in an unassuming comedy about Murray's Phil Conners, the Weatherman, who solves those problems when he relives the same day over and over. Seminal film transcends comedy, romance, fantasy and  spirituality; working as an attitude adjuster filled with healthy belly laughs. Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliot and twice Murrays are shining with every extra.<br />If you had a day to live ; would you be very good or very bad? Phil tries it all; for worse and better. This is a Sci-fi Horror, Comedy Drama with a boogaloo beat and it will aid in all moods.<br /><br />Recommended dose: 1-2 a year.<br />BD is full strength. All versions are OK. BD better, clear and powerful. Best taken with a meal.

B000Y9Q59W|2.0|I have to say that this is one of the absolute worst blu-ray transfers I have seen.  I am not one of those that hop on the bandwagon of this transfer stinks and so does this one and so on...  I usually am pretty forgiving when it comes to these types of things.  I enjoy this movie, but the blu ray version is a major disappointment.  I echo the chorus of those who have said to stick with the dvd version. I give it four stars for the movie and one for the blu-ray transfer.  Buyer beware.
1878424505|5.0|Instead of putting this quote towards the end, Don Miguel Ruiz`s book should have started  with \\"I want you to forget everything you have ever learned in your whole life. This is the beginning of a new understanding, a new dream.\\"  Reading \\"The Four Agreements\\" is that beginning of a new understanding and a new dream - one of a life without fear.    It is not just any fear that stops us from growing, but it is the fear that grows from how we allow others to control us, as well as fear we create within ourselves. Ruiz observes that human society is ruled by fear.     Religions describe hell as a place of punishment, suffering, pain, and fear. However, when we allow fear to rule our lives, our state of minds put us in a living hell. We search for those bohemian ideals of truth, justice, beauty, and love, but because we are blinded by fear and lies we cannot see ourselves and our world for the loving place it is.    While the terminology of the book embraces traditional religion, magic, computer terms, and profuse analogy; the wisdom in this book is sound.    The book's premise is that everything we know is basically an agreement. We didn't choose our beliefs, but agreed - out of love or out of fear - with information we were told. \\"As soon as we agree, we believe it, and this is called Faith. To have faith is to believe unconditionally.\\" Ruiz further explains that \\"95% of the beliefs we have stored in our minds are nothing but lies, and we suffer because we believe all these lies.\\"    To better live our lives we must have the courage to challenge our beliefs, which is where the 4 Agreements come in. The agreements sound simple enough, however they are anything but simple. Ruiz deftly walks us through specific examples of how refusing to make these agreements with ourselves poisons our lives, and the lives of those around us.     Following these simple steps will ultimately lead us to higher self-esteem, more effective communication, a greater insight into the motivations of others, closer relationships, and the ability to live a life filled with love.     Here's to a new dream for all of us.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|It is a universal rule that to give an objective review, you must see the film at least twice. Well, I received my DVD last weekend & I've seen the film 3 times now.    Considering that these are only rehearsal footages, Michael Jackson's artistic & creative vision was evident and it was nothing short of brilliant. I am a very spiritual person and I believe that nothing here on earth happens without God's knowledge & control. I'm in awe that before He took Michael's life, He allowed the filming (that were so clear & so well captured) that has now enabled the world to see the musical gifts & the genius of this man. This is a man that has been so maligned by the media and it just makes me wonder - what if he died before the filming of those footages. If that happened, then he would go down history as a fallen superstar. And may I also add this - before he died he sold out the 50 concert dates, which is unprecedented. That's remarkable! Something historians will never overlook.    Now, with this movie, especially the DVD with extra features will ensure Michael Jackson's legacy will forever continue. The priceless interviews of all the top calibre production people (that were hired) will give viewers a true, clear understanding of how great & how good a person he is. This to me is a clear vindication for Michael.      I stronly recommend this DVD....the Special Features alone is worth the price - they will give you a clear picture of how awesome this concert could have been.
B002ZHKZCY|1.0|I'll be the first to admit that this review is less to do with these specific Bourne movies and more related to the Blu Ray conversion however I feel that one needs to understand the issues with these discs before addressing the movies themselves. Let me cut to the chase, do NOT buy these discs! They will frustrate and annoy you every time you attempt to watch them, allow me to explain.    I have a Samsung Blu Ray player with updated firmware (don't get me started on that process) connected via HDMI cable to Samsung LCDTV, generally Blu Ray discs work fine on this set up, there are occasions when on other discs the movies will pause for a brief second and then continue however these Bourne movies were impossible to watch. To begin with they seem to feature their own unique controls meaning that trying to scan forward or backward would cause the disc to lock and seemingly stall, never did get the movie to scan properly. Then there were the issues with the movie in general, the picture repeatedly froze, in car chases and in Chapter 11 (and multiple points thereafter) while they are sitting talking in the car, the sound was then out of synch with the picture and more freezing and stalling, it was so bad that I ejected the discs and watched the old DVD versions of the movies. Utterly unacceptable, beyond annoying!    As for the movies themselves, what this experiment did show the dramatic improvement of the Blu Ray versions, the picture was much crisper, the colors richer and more saturated and certainly less noise in the picture, also the sounds was much better, more full and dynamic, too bad that the technology rendered the discs unwatchable.  The irony is that I had \\"upgraded\\" from an HDDVD when that format lost out and I had this movie on HD, there were NO problems, same outstanding picture and the player had none of the issues that I attribute to Blu Ray. For whatever reason I believe that Blu Ray is simply not ready yet, too many glitches, I don't want to have toconstantly monitor my firmware to watch a movie! That same kind of updating madness is what got me to migrate from a Windows PC to a Mac!    The bottom line is this, the movies are fantastic! Honestly one of my favorite trilogies and WHEN the disc is working the picture and sound really are phenomenal, the problem is in the \\"when\\", it is frustrating and unacceptable to deal with these glitches, yes, the movies are being returned to Amazon and a formal letter of complaint is being registered with Universal Home Entertainment. My advice to you, skip these for now or at the very least try to hunt down the regular Blu Ray versions, not these dual discs and save yourself the frustration.

B002ZG997M|5.0|The Book of Eli is a vastly underappreciated film that mixes martial arts swordsmanship, a post-apocalyptic setting, and a biblical narrative.<br /><br />A war, over thirty years ago, killed off many people in the United States. Others were blinded from the blast.  This creates an interesting disparity between those over thirty years of age who received an education and those under thirty who know nothing of the modern world (at one point, one of the thugs asks, \\"What's a television?\\").<br /><br />This is an unpleasant world. Cannibalistic brigands ambush unwary travelers, identifiable by their shaking hands. Water is at a premium.  Batteries are hard to find.  The Book of Eli makes it clear that there's no currency, only barter.<br /><br />Roaming the land is Eli (a subdued Denzel Washington), carrying a book with a cross on it.  This book is greatly desired by Carnegie (a greasy Gary Oldman), who is also old enough to remember the power such a tome can have over the people.  While Eli has been wandering for thirty years in pursuit of such a destination, Carnegie has been sending illiterate henchmen to retrieve every book he can find.  The encounter between the two has all the fire and brimstone of a battle between heaven and hell.<br /><br />Thrown into the mix is Solara (played beautifully by Mila Kunis, who finally sheds her trademark accent), a young, attractive girl who has grown up under Carnegie's protection but, as she flowers into womanhood, is about to become a bargaining chip, a piece of meat, and a lure.  When there's no one left to protect her, she becomes a wanderer in Eli's footsteps.<br /><br />From a religious point of view, it's educational to understand who Eli was in the Bible. In the Bible, Eli's children are cursed for behaving wickedly, a parallel for the war that destroyed civilization in the movie. God's curse assures that all men will \\"die by the sword\\" - in the movie Eli expertly cuts a bloody swath through his enemies with his machete. In the Bible, it was the job of Eli's sons to guard the Ark of the Covenant - the pact God made with man - just as Eli guards the holy book in the movie.<br /><br />There's a twist ending that's not a twist of all if you read up about Eli in the Bible. But don't - watch the movie, then do some research, then watch the movie again.  Like Eli's quest for spiritual fulfillment, the experience will be rather eye-opening.sons to guard the Ark of the Covenant - the pact God made with man - just as Eli guards the holy book in the movie.

0061876747|1.0|To say I was disappointed with this book is an understatement. It is hard to believe that this was written by the same person who wrote Restless. The book has no suspense, it has no character development and the writing is maudlin at best.  It posits a mystery that the writer seems to forget about mid-way into the book. To be charitable I can only assume that Boyd was hard up for money and was under time pressure from his publisher. If this was a first novel a reader would find little reason to look for future work by the author. Save your money.

B000W7JWUA|4.0|I have played Settlers of Catan 3 tims now at a friends house.  I never once thought that playing a board game on a Friday night would be fun, but I was wrong Setters is fun and a nice way to spend an evening at home.<br /><br />First you need 4 players to play so it is ideal for couples.  2nd there is some stragey involved at the start, you pick where you want to build on based on the likelyhood of the dice being rolled for your number.  For example if you own the rights to the #7 you will be more sucessful than the person who has #3.  Once everyone get their starting #s you than hope to build rescources and these cards are available for trade (if someone is winning you will not trade with that person)much like monopoly players trade properties.  Than you have the robber which is both chance and stragey come into play.  You also can earn special cards that can alter the outcome.  Best of all is there is a set ending to the game and most games end after an hour.<br /><br />This is a fun game that has some strategy involved, the game is never the same twice so its fun to play over and over again.  A bit pricey for what you get in the box but the game itself is great time for about an hour to an hour and a half per game.
B001TD1XWG|2.0|As the title of my review suggests, I am pretty disappointed. Of course some fans will like it, however this \\"crossover Rock album\\" just doesn't do it for me.    You have to give Lil Wayne credit for personally exploring new areas and styles, but this album is completely counter to his previous releases and what has made him popular/prolific. You no longer have Lil Wayne with catchy beats and explosive/clever/raw freestyles or verses. Instead you have a simple guitar tune with him whining the entire time.  There are very few freestyles/actual verses... he just seems to mostly repeat the chorus over and over and over in what sounds like an Akon or Kanye West (808 album) wanna-be whining noise. I just don't understand...    The only good song in my opinion is the track he performed with Eminem during the Grammys... and even it is iffy.

B000ZELISO|5.0|This was originally supposed to be my wife's christmas gift however there was a BD-Live event held with the procuder and main actor of this film. Which basically allows you to watch the movie and listen to them talking. A bit distracting from the movie itself, it was still a treat to listen to them give behind the scenes secrets and tales of how the actors and actresses are on set. Very magical and only happens once a lifetime. As for the movie itself. It is quite brilliant and the darker these movies get the more Im willing to pay for Blu-Ray copies of this series. Great Movie..but as my wife explained, the book has more details. Of course!

0316069906|5.0|I first heard of this book on the radio, when the author was being interviewed. That interview alone shook me, and I knew I was going to stop eating meat. After reading the book, I became a vegan. The book is so well written and so convincing for the following reason: It isn't biased. I never got the feeling that Foer was exaggerating or on his high horse. He was being honest, sometimes harsh, but always thoughtful. He really explores all aspects of the ethical, moral, cultural, physical, and animal rights aspects on the issue of eating animal products. And the conclusion is clear to the reader, although not spelled out by Foer.    I've recommended this book to everyone I know with an open mind. It's life changing. I even started a blog to document my path to veganism, in hopes of showing others it's possible, and rewarding on so many levels. [...]    Buy this book and share it with those you love.

B00275EGWY|1.0|My other half is in the military, so I was anxious to watch this movie with him. Boy, were we disappointed! We were also stunned to discover this movie got nine Oscar nominations. It was absolutely not representative of the reality of how EOD missions are done (was obvious even to me as a civilian, let alone those who serve our country), and I didn't think it was even well made. I was disappointed and saddened to realize that some people will believe this is how our soldiers conduct themselves. But of course Hollywood loved it, which only makes sense when you see it and realize it was more Hollywood than military. This could have been a great movie, and the topic hardly needed the additional and fictional drama they added for effect. It's little wonder why people have such stereotyped thoughts about our soldiers when movies like this only only portray the negatives. According to this movie, they are mostly rogues going out on their own, or else about to break from PTSD. Yes, PTSD and other stress-induced issues are very real among those who serve. Yet only one soldier is portrayed as mostly sane, which was rather disheartening. I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
B0026IQFS0|5.0|These books aren't just fun, they re-started my whole appetite for fiction.  O'Brian is a master stylist, humorist, scene-setter and (almost incidentally) a great historian.  \\"Historical novel\\" is a potential ghetto of bodice-ripping one step removed from romance novels; O'Brian's Audrey-Maturin series is anything but that.  These have the same relationship to history as \\"War and Peace.\\"  You can learn a lot of history from that book, but that's not why you read it' same here.  (And, compared to \\"War and Peace,\\" O'Brian's books are honestly more readable.)    Actually a better comparison is with Jane Austen -- comedies of manners focused sharply on a specific class, with characters openly focused on specific goals.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennett marrying off their daughters are not so different from the admirals of the Royal Navy plotting how to get their captains to sink the French.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|I avoided exposing myself to Taylor Swift's music for a long time (until yesterday) because I thought she would just be another Hilary Duff, Miley Cyrus, etc. (all talentless hacks, in my opinion).  But there is something about her music that makes it so different from that generic kind of teeny-bopper music that Hilary Duff used to churn out (she only had 2 good singles, in my opinion, one of which was \\"Come Clean\\").      Maybe it is because Taylor's music is influenced by country music, though it couldn't be called country music itself.  Taylor Swift's music on this album sounds mature and timeless, and the teenybopper quality is at a minimum, making it appealing to people of all ages.  I'm so impressed that she writes some of her own songs, and co-writes others.    Sometimes her voice sounds like Avril Lavigne's and Lily Allen's, but most of the time she sounds like herself.  I honestly don't care if she can't sing live - I love this album! She has such a sweet singing voice on this CD.    Every song on this CD is highly listenable, but my favourites are Love Story, The Best Day, Hey Stephen, and You Belong With Me.     - from a 22-year-old reviewer who can't stand Avril Lavigne's music (I cringe when I am forced to hear Avril's \\"hits\\", such as Complicated and When You're Gone. Ugh. Over-played rubbish.)

At times I felt this approach humanized the situation, as the story was told from an employees perspective. Yet at the same time I didn't understand why his entire upbringing was included. I was impressed with the obstacles he overcame during his journey to Lehman Brothers, but that wasn't the reason I bought the book.
B00129H7VS|5.0|What can you say about Band of Brothers? It's incredible. While not completely historically accurate (what film can be, there has to be some liberties taken) it gives you a solid well documented account of what young men see in combat. By this point, you all know the story....the 101st Airborne takes the fight to the Germans. It chronicles the grueling training they received prior to deploying for war, takes them to the skies above Normandy, through the vicious house to house fighting in France and Holland. Then the frozen forrests of Belgium, then finally to Germany itself. It's a fatastic story that should be passed on from generation to generation to remind them how everyday men like these (as well as all the other men of all the other allied countries) fought to preserve mankind.     The blu-ray edition is phenomonal. The video and audio quality is untouchable. One of the best bluray releases in my collection. I am a grain hater lol, there are scenes where heavy grain is prevalant, but thats how the film was meant to look...old, gritty with the bright colors washed out of it. The detail on this bluray is excellent. You can see the stiching on uniform patches, sweat dripping from the foreheads of the men as they push forward. The audio is outstanding. The bass from explosions will rock your living room. The soft gentle sounds of the peaceful wilderness while Maj. Winters is enjoying a swin in Austria will make you feel liek you are there. The supplements are great, I really like \\"in the word of easy company.\\" This option is additional footage from the first person accts taken during the original production. It comes to you in the form of pop ups on the screen while watching the episodes. I've seen each episode 20 times easily, so getting this fresh addition made it seem like i was watching it again for the very first time.     This is a must have bluray.
1151736961|5.0|The American reading public seems to reduce `classic authors' to one-hit wonders: The Stranger, Catcher in the Rye, Vanity Fair, Frankenstein, Catch-22, Oedipus the King, etc. One great work seems to exhaust us and we move on. The only real exceptions are situations in which the author has two great works of moral equivalency: Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-four, Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Iliad and The Odyssey.    A victim of the one-book limit on our memories is The Beautiful and Damned. No, it's not as good as The Great Gatsby. But then again -- to paraphrase Joseph Heller -- neither is any other American novel. If it weren't for Jay Gatsby, however, this other work by F. Scott Fitzgerald would likely often be raised up as a candidate for `the Great American Novel'.     I was blown away by it. It's divided into roughly three parts, following the third decade of life of a useless Harvard alum living in New York City named Anthony Comstock Patch. The first period is youthful exuberance. It reads like it was written by a kid who woke up one day being after being anointed the Chosen One by the gods of literature. It's got this `Wow, I can write beautiful prose about anything!' euphoria to it. The prose bedazzles and astonishes, careening as it does from one pointless bit to another as it lampoons the East Coast elite. It shifts tenses for no reason, abruptly goes into the format of a play for couple of pages at a stretch and generally dances its way through the nonadventures of several extremely wealthy young men. The words on the page are relentless brilliant. Even getting up to leave is memorable: `Anthony arose and punched himself into his overcoat. . .'    This first section is hilarious. Typically, when I discover something from before WWII that was meant to be humorous, I cringe to myself because it's not funny anymore. The opening of this book, after a slightly drydescription of Anthony Patch's familial background, satirizes the wealthy, their pretensions, their sense of entitlement, their superiority, with unerring accuracy. It's laugh-out-loud funny but never mean-spirited.    I hate spoilers. Suffice to say that the second and third sections get uglier as relationships get more serious. What we forgive in the young we find more disappointing in people as they age. (A Peter Pan with a puffy-eyed hangover at thirty is not a pretty sight.) The prose, however, loses little momentum as the story flirts with disaster.    In addition to the writing itself, what really struck me was how Fitzgerald could create a sense of empathy for such appalling characters. If Anthony Patch was a real person, he'd be the poster child for Marxism. Yet Fitzgerald can get us to care about him and his ilk, people who are in truth little more than lazy, absentmindedly racist, decidedly misogynistic alcoholic snobs. (Indeed, this novel could be read as the parable about the consequences of misogyny on men.) If someone told me that it would be possible to write a novel in which you feel for a character who jokes about kicking a kitten -- we're left hoping it was a joke -- I would have said it was impossible, but there you have it.     The novel also makes the time period covered, from shortly before WWI to the Roaring Twenties, come vividly alive. Anthony Patch becomes the embodiment of America, starting in innocence, becoming disillusioned with war and ending in the boozy disillusionment of Prohibition. (And no, that's not really a spoiler.) It's not simply Anthony that oozes a sense of time and place: the novel is animated by consumer products of the period, suggests a critique of suburbia forty years head of its time and is filled with fascination with those new technologies, the car and the feature-length film.     In short, The Beautiful and Damned probably offers more per page than just about any other novel you might read. Except The Great Gatsby.    This review is based on an out of print hardback from the library, not this particular edition.

0307473465|5.0|Bought this book together with the Spanish edition of the same title¨for my Spanish study. Because the story is cut in short sections, it was great and covenient for my language study. However more than my initial intention, the story of The Reader touched my mind at the deepest place. For one reason, I witnessed a similar incident in a war tribunal in Japan after the world war ll. It is a part of irony of human history, but the book described well while helping my Spanish study.

0385504225|3.0|The premise seemed far-fetched and not as realistic as I expected from Brown's other novels, all of which I read and enjoyed more than this one.  The plot twists and suspense seemed forced at times and not enjoyable.  Still, he is a good story-teller and researches his material well.  Some of the characters are amusingly described, if not attractive people. On balance, it was worthwhile buying and reading, even if it's not on par with his other work.

B002M2N9JI|5.0|This is the most bouncy, fun and important record of this era. I thought In For The Kill was a long forgotten single from the early 1980s! Then came this full album, full of bouncy, retro modern electronica from a very promising new talent. Its as if Elly Jackson is single handedly reviving a lost genre-the pop single! Its now outdated to put out a record album, much less by one. Well, thankfully here it is!    Every song is good. If this was 1985, it would produce a chart clogging plethora of #1 singles-Quicksand, Bulletproof, Im Not Your Toy, Facination and As If By Magic. Here in the U.S.A., it will be largely forgotten, lost by our paranoia of British imports. If our now dead music industry would reinvent itself and discover new music, maybe radio(it was once used for something other than talk) could start playing tunes that get people singing along once more.
0439023483|4.0|This is  not the type of book that I usually read. It's considered dystopian fiction, science fiction, futuristic. I was on the fence about reading this book, even after reading many rave reviews. I have to say that I did like The Hunger Games..a lot! I found the story very entertaining and at the same time disturbing and brutal but gripping. It's a book that is hard to put down. The story is told sometime in the future, you don't know the time period as a reader. The world as we know it has ended and there is only a Capital and twelve districts. There was an uprising and a thirteenth district was destroyed. As a reminder to the tributes (the citizens) that the Capital has the power, they hold the Hunger games each year. A girl and boy aged 12 and up are chosen randomly from each district to fight for survival in a televised event called the Hunger Games. It's like a futuristic reality TV show of our time. There are 24 girls and boys and only one is allowed to be the winner.  That means you must try to survive and win which means killing your opponents and honor your district or lose and be killed.     The book is told from the perspective of 16 year old Katniss who has volunteered to go into the games in place of her younger sister. She knows that she must use her skills and survival techniques that she has learned to survive in her own district.  Things become complicated when she realizes the connection she has to Peeta, the boy chosen from her district. Their connection brings up mixed feelings and emotions that she never realized until the process to the games begins. What she doesn't count on is the brutality and emotions that accompany this game. It is a fight until the end and the story holds you as a reader immersed in the world of the Hunger Games until the conclusion. Then, you realize that it is not over yet as there is more...a second book Catching Fire.     This is a unique book, one that I really enjoyed even with the darkness and brutality. The sheerwit and determination of Katniss and the tributes makes you want to keep reading. Now, I have to find a copy of Catching Fire and there is a third book in the series that is to be published later this year. Exciting stuff, I have more to look forward to.  Personally, I wouldn't recommend The Hunger Games for anyone under twelve unless you think that your child has the maturity to handle violence.

B002WY65W4|4.0|Finally! Another great Horror movie to put on my shelf...right next to [[ASIN:B000A3XY9Q Evil Dead 2]], [[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]], Tom Savini's remake of [[ASIN:B00000K3TO Night of the Living Dead]] and Zack Snyder's remake of [[ASIN:B001CW7ZW6 Dawn of the Dead]]. Zombieland is also one of the best Dark Comedies to come out in years.<br /><br />Director Ruben Fleischer who's know for, well, just about nothing, gives fans of the genre a scary, tense, thrilling, action packed and really funny gift of a movie with Zombieland. The cast is top notch and they all put in top notch performances. And when I say \\"the cast\\", I mean pretty much just the 4 leads that don't share much screen-time with anyone other than zombies.<br /><br />The dialogue and chemistry between Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg is priceless. I dare suggest that it rivals that of the Travolta/Jackson pairing in [[ASIN:B000068DBC Pulp Fiction]]. 99% of the movie is carried solely by Harrelson, Eisenberg, Emma (her hotness will turn you to) Stone and Abigail Breslin (remember that little girl with the tin foil on her head in [[ASIN:B0016CP2O0 Signs?]]). And they all do a great job of making the movie fun and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />The movie deals in the 28 Days Later virus-stricken zombies versus the Night of the Living Dead risen from the grave zombies. The cast meet up while traveling across a country, our country, decimated by a zombie plague. The movie offers an explanation for why the zombie outbreak happened, and includes a hilarious flashback to the time of the outbreak with Eisenberg's character.<br /><br />What's really cool is most of the characters do what you'd expect them to do if this zany situation ever really occurred. The movie is mostly absent of those moments where you say out loud, \\"Oh c'mon, no one would ever do that!\\"...That is until the final moments of the movie where the ladies make a pretty stupid move contrary to the smarts that they showed in the previous 75 minutes of the movie. And in the same sequence the actions of all 4 cast members get a bit silly and over the top.<br /><br />Still, all in all, it's a great movie. I'm one to complain loudly about Hollywood's addiction to making movies that go well beyond the 2-hour mark. But I was crying for more when the realization struck me that Zombieland was over. The credits were rolling at the 1 hour and 24 minute mark.<br /><br />When the rumored release of Zombieland 2 comes out in 2011, I might just have to venture out into the Zombieland that is my home town to see it in theaters instead of waiting for Blu Ray. Add Zombieland to your cart...well worth the price of admission!showed in the previous 75 minutes of the movie.

I saw it twice in the theater and bought it the day it came out on DVD and watched it again.

0812550706|5.0|I recently found a list of the top 100 greatest sci-fi novels of all time. I've been on this massive sci-fi kick lately so I made it a point to read all of the books on that list that I haven't read already. On the top of the list is Ender's Game. This has been hailed as a classic many times over so I couldn't help but read it right away.    The story follows Ender Wiggins, an extremely brilliant child. All of the children in the Wiggins family are well above brilliant but Ender was ultimately chosen as the one to train, so he can potentially save the world from the 'Buggers'.     This book focuses primarily on Enders training as well as the alliances and rivalries that form at the training academy. Ender has a knack for being the best and that annoys some of the other children. Much of the book focuses on the zero-gravity games that Ender plays. It's pretty clear right from the beginning that Ender is a mastermind. Meanwhile back on Earth his brother Peter and his sister Valentine have their own plans.    I do have a few minor complaints. The story is incredibly predictable, I saw the major twists coming from a mile away. Also, even though the games are fun to read about they do tend to dry up a little towards the end because you pretty much know exactly how each one is going to pan out. I am being a little nit-picky here because throughout most of the book I was quite engaged, even if I did know what was going to happen.    Overall this book is very good. It is a very easy read that doesn't provide a whole lot of detail; instead Card lets your imagination fill in all the gaps, which I did like quite a bit. In the end I would give it 4.5 / 5 but since I can't award half-stars I'll round up to 5 because it was a really fun read that kept the pages turning well into the wee hours.
097747609X|5.0|I was already familiar with Murphy's translation and then I saw this OFFICIAL translation. I was more than a little curious so I had to get it. I found it fascinating and frequently compared it to my existing Murphy translation. The publisher shows several differences in the introduction but I easily found many differences myself. It was rather fun.    The publisher says in the introduction that this book was created from a newly found copy of an original edition published in VERY small numbers from the NAZI PRINTING OFFICE. They also include photos of the original book. This is clearly a rare treasure because it is the only version officially sanctioned by the NAZI PRINTING OFFICE and printed in Germany. I did not read the entire book because I had already read the Murphy translation but I did go through most of it and it was an enjoyable refresher. It was also very interesting to go through the OFFICIAL version and not a version aimed at British or American markets filled with bias.    The publisher of this edition is also the publisher of the Ford translation which I also have. They are both excellent versions and much better than Manheim's hack job.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|I think this film is intended as a warning against the Christian fascism that has currently taken over so much of our country, especially during the Bush admistration.    All the scenes about scalping, what the Indians did when the white man took them over, were intended to show what the Jews (wish they did?) when the Nazis took them over.  What they did in fantasy, through a movie.  What will happen to modern-day Nazis if they try it again....    It is impossible to miss the parallels between some of our current far-right politicians and far-right religious leaders and the fascists strutting around in their uniforms covered with crosses, so arrogant, unwilling to be told \\"no\\" by a woman, getting what they wanted through fear, intimidation, and manipulation.      It reminds me of Sylvia Plath talking about how \\"Every woman loves a Nazi\\"--- until they see what is going on, that is.    Brad Pitt was great; he reminded me of Clark Gable.

Stuff like this should come with a label:  \\"Warning:  Intended for Right-Wing Christians.\\"  I might as well have invested in a Tim LaHaye book rather than wasting my time and money on this.<br /><br />It is post-apocalypse.  There was another world war, caused by religion, and after it was over (after the \\"flash\\" which burned almost everyone), people burned all the bibles, so that religion could never again destroy the world. Or so they thought.<br /><br />Eli, played by Denzel Washington, is walking west across the United States, carrying a copy of the last Bible in the world.  A \\"voice\\" told him to \\"go west\\" and carry the Bible.  During his quest (when he's not proselytizing), God protects him, enabling him to repeatedly chop off the heads and hands of his enemies.  He encounters the ruler of a town who seriously wants the Bible, because if he has it, he can become all powerful. With the Bible, this ruler will be able to get people to do anything he wants them to do.<br /><br />Eli escapes, however, and continues west to Alcatraz, where there is a group of people hoarding books and artifacts from the pre-apocalypse world.  They have a printing press, of course, and promptly print thousands of copies of the Bible, to be re-distributed to the religion-damaged world--- proving, once again, that you just can't get rid of stupidity and superstitution.

So after seeing it so many times, I decided to give it a read. wow. Talk about juvenile. Perhaps, that is what this is: Juvenile fiction that should be placed with the teenage titles--the Young Adult section, but it's considered serious spiritual fiction. I found it laughable for all the wrong reasons. Cliche upon cliche. I almost winced at certain parts, embarrassed for the author--who is probably not embarrassed at all--as he must be making money hand over fist with such shallow fare. What can I say? Romance fiction sells well,too.     If you're looking for pap, pulpy, sugary feel good, gook, this read's for you.

0307386872|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

B00138KKLC|5.0|Most of the previous reviews have praised both the performances and the wonderful vibrant sound of this CD and they are correct.There, in my opinion, are only two other recordings of the 5th which are in the same class as the Reiner/Chicago CD: Toscanini with the NYPSO (!936) and Carlos Kleiber on DGG.  I first heard this recording on LP and while I had been listening and enjoying both the Munch/Boston and the Walter/NYPO, I felt immediately that this was spot on. The Tempo,dynamics and balance sounded right. They still do today!  The sound is even better  and it now comes with a brilliant performance of the 7th and two overtures [The Coriolan is superb). If you don't have it grab it before it vanishes.  The control that Reiner had over orchestras is almost mystical. His rudeness and almost superhuman demands were legendary. Being from Cincinnati where Reiner began his American career, I have heard many many Reiner stories from former musicians of the Cincinnati Symphony. One that has made the rounds of both Cincinnati and Chicago, is of a bassist who had trouble seeing Reiner's minuscule beat and brought a spy glass to rehearsal. After Reiner saw it he stopped the rehearsal and asked the purpose of the gadget. The bassist told him. For the remainder of the season the musician was absent. At any rate get this CD.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Jason Mraz's songs are unquestionably better live than the studio recordings. I saw this set live, and the cd captures that incredible experience. Bushwalla makes an exciting apperance as mc and sings Fall Through Glass on the dvd. You have to check him out on the bonus features with Jason. (If you havent heard Bushwalla before check out [...])Bottom line: dont buy this cd/dvd, buy two.

0307454541|4.0|I had some trouble getting into this book, but since I was reading it for a book club, I kept going.  As the stories unfolded the various unknowns became more compelling.  The author skillfully moved the characters into each other's lives and uncovered their intertwining destinies.  A thriller!

0671027344|3.0|My reaction to this novel is skewed, I admit. I was not able to give it due attention befitting of any work of literature: after reaching the halfway point, I just stashed it back onto the shelf and decided to finish it for some other time.<br /><br />And, of course, when I did deign to pick up where I left off, I knew I already lost the momentum of what Chbosky was trying to convey.<br /><br />And that's the crux of the matter: the fact that I was only able to bring myself to finish this after a...sabbatical, so to speak, speaks loudly of what I really felt about this story.<br /><br />The young 'Charlie''s forays into the painful, sublime, befuddling, and intense world of adolescence is a bit of a stereotype--in the sense that the imageries evoked by the author are not that radically different from those that I have seen in Hollywood high-school movies (whether it's authentic or not need not be duly problematized): there is always the jock, the artsy, bohemian clique, the mousy spectacled-girl, the pretentious do-gooder, the depressed misanthrope, and other personas making up that stage of the teenage 'drama'.<br /><br />I agree with some of the reviews stating that the lead character is not really a wallflower. In my opinion, 'Charlie' is just exceptionally observant, with a healthy level of genuine curiosity and introspection I barely find in people nowadays.<br /><br />Anyway, I did feel a little cheated by the novel. I consider myself a wallflower (and perhaps one could understand if I'd rather not go into the embarrassing details) that's why I was excited about reading this book--I thought I would be able to form a sense of affinity with 'Charlie', to discover the \\"perks\\" touted by the title, if any.<br /><br />But then, of course, he's not really `outside' of what is deemed the active 'experiencing' of life. He is actually brought into the fold of the 'infinite'--with 'Patrick' and 'Sam' he is able to experience a plethora of emotions--without having to take a step back into the shadows in order to blend with the woodwork.<br /><br />He became at times drunk with heady giddiness, or morose with excruciating guilt, and sometimes simply patently confused with the boy-girl shenanigans that preoccupy the average teen's waking hours. Certainly, of course, the bit of popularity he earned well into the story, as well as the dramas that unfolded with him at the epicenter, are not symptomatic of someone who lived his life with his back stuck perpetually to the wall, watching everybody else cut a rug out in the middle of the floor.<br /><br />And so, to (belatedly) make a story short, I was not that engaged with the story. There really was nothing striking or new about it--teenage dystopia is practically a transient rite of passage, whether experienced in seclusion or with a group. 'Patrick's homosexuality, the drinking bouts and drug-laced sessions of the 'infinite' trio, and whatever other highs or lows explored in this novel that are so controversial to so many readers...should really not be all that surprising. However, I am not saying that this is the norm, or something that should just be tolerated. But it is the unflinching reality in many places in modern societies.<br /><br />I really did not feel uplifted in any significant way after turning the last page. Hence, I found difficulty in what the author was trying to convey to me. If his overall message was profound or infinitely inspirational to *you*, then all well and good.<br /><br />In my case, I was unsure if Chbosky was simply getting in line with the countless other writers or artists who tried to give concrete form (read here as a piece of writing) to societal reality. Or was he simply depicting (again, like so many others) nothing more than another instance of teenage life seen through the eyes of someone purported to be an introvert?<br /><br />Or was the message really only at the end: that despite the ridiculously horrid things in life, sometimes the only thing that one needs is to ride the back of a speeding pickup truck and feel the rush of wind on one's face.<br /><br />And that whatever tears are shed while speeding down that road are simply the same ones that have cleansed one's soul.<br /><br />What I did enjoy in the novel are the bits of practical curiosities 'Charlie' asked himself (and told the unnamed recipient of his letters) as he observed his family and friends. These observations were so simple and familiar that I did ask myself at times, \\"why indeed?\\"<br /><br />(And, of course, there were the Beatles tunes the author was kind enough to pay homage to.<br /><br />Sorry. Couldn't help myself.)of wind on one's face.     And that whatever tears are shed while speeding down that road are simply the same ones that have cleansed one's soul.

B00243FQFA|5.0|Awesome! I watch all of it including the extras the first week I got it! It was one of my favorite seasons.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Wonderful CD. I wanted to support Susan Boyle and her efforts to become a true star. Not only is this great to listen to, but her inspirational writing is well worth it.

B002PMV9FG|5.0|What a surprize at who is the half blood prince. Never gave it a thought and the more I thought about it, it became obvious. But I'm not going to give the outcome away. I have all of the previous Harry Potter movies and recommend this one highly!!!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food, Inc. is a must see film which is extremely well done and informative.  I had to read nearly 24 books to get to the information in this film and the film is easier to watch than reading all those books!  This is a message that will assist individuals in making important decisions about their nutrition and the foods that they purchase.  It is about how to rebuild our own communities and our own health one bite at a time.  It is about assisting our neighbors who are less fortunate right now and strengthening them for healthier lives too.   I see that Oprah talked about this film on her show and interviewed Michael Pollan about his new book.  I want to share this with everyone I know...I have shared it with nearly 50 friends so far and I see one online DVD service is offering it free for viewing.    This is vital information for us all - very positive and honest look.
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|This is our second copy.  Our first somehow got lost.  This is one of my family's favorite.  We can watch this over and over again.  Highly recommend this movie!!
0061655554|5.0|Wow, I am forever fascinated by financial history. This is behind the scenes tale of some of the leveraged buyouts of the 80s. It's a book along the lines of Michael Lewis's book called Liar's Poker, another great book. I figure this book will appeal to \\"finance\\" types, whether you are trader or into business finance. After reading the book, I realized just how much is generally known by the public whenever mergers and acquisitions are announced. It's a fascinating book that I truly enjoyed.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|Wow, are there a lot of music geeks that post on Amazon :)  I purchased this set for my 8 year old budding rock star as he is a Beatles fanatic!  We are perfectly happy with the sound quality of the discs, but appalled at how poorly the packaging is constructed (especially for the cost of this set).  The CDs are packaged in paper sleeves, but not the nice eco-friendly cases that a lot of my favorite bands are using now.  They are basically glossy, low weight card stock that are glued together on some of the edges.  Right out of the box 3 of them where not even glued, just folded around the CD, so when you picked the sleeve up, the disc fell onto the floor.  Several others had the glued parts pop open the first time I took out the disc.  The double discs are in the same pocket vs two separate pockets to keep the discs from rubbing against each other and scratching when you take one out.  I am really glad that I looked through the set for the first time with my son, otherwise I would have thought he had caused the breakdown of the sleeves by being careless with them. The sleeves are nicely printed with great images, so I don't want to abandon them by placing the discs in plastic cases (plus then they wouldn't fit back into the storage box).  I have tried a couple of different adhesives to stick the sleeves back together but even though I am careful with how I line it up before a press it back together, it makes the opening too small to fit the disk back in (luckily all the adhesives have been removable). Although of course all the detail to sound was very important for the assembly of this set, it is really disappointing that no one gave any attention to the functionality of the packaging.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Cranston's fantastic.  This is a riveting, raw account of a man on a dangerous mission... absurd enough to be true. Hugely entertaining... can't wait for the second season.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I cry every time I watch this movie. What an inspirational story! Truly a triumph  of the human spirit! And Julie Andrews is remarkable and amazing!
0061537969|5.0|I'm a big dog person, I foster dogs, I volunteer where I can.  So it was pretty obvious when I saw this book I had to read it.  Enzo is just a funny and lovable narrator.  Stein makes him so perceptive and combines philosophy \\"That which is around me does not affect my mood. My mood affects that which is around me.\\" with humor and a great story.  Yes, it's incredibly sad, but so worth it!

B001VLXNLU|4.0|So far, I have really enjoyed this series. I am an adult and a mother. Although, I wouldnt recommend it for a young teen, I thought books 1-3 are funny and interesting. I cant wait to read the rest of the series. For those of you who are looking for other vampire stories, Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse novels are also very good.
0385532458|5.0|I own and have read every book John Grisham has written. I used to think that his lawyer novels were always my favorite but with time I realize that his non-lawyer books are just as good if not better.  This collection of short stories in Ford County is really amazing.  I takes you right into that little town and you almost feel part of it in every story.  I highly recommend this book.  You can't go wrong.
B000063UR2|2.0|i saw this movie just one time, i dont dare to put it again in my player , it`s so long that becomes really boring, talking is always  extended and kind of poetic too much for me.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|Very disappointed. I usually like most things with Sandra Bullock but this just was not up to any standard. A real pot-boiler or as they once were called \\"a B-movie\\"
B0030BYWKK|5.0|Even though the Trials of Van Occupanther was one of my favorite albums of the past five years, after hearing The Courage of Others I'm having trouble listening to Van Occupanther as a complete work.  Courage sets the bar THAT high.  I'd been waiting for Midlake's new album for well over a year and had read that they were moving in a new direction, but that didn't prepare me for what FELT like a transcendent experience (I don't trust that I'd recognize actual transcendence unless I started to levitate).  After just a day it was like I'd known these songs most of my life. It's a beautiful thing - epic in scope and relentlessly textured - that gets even better with revisitation.  Really stunning.
B002C6A6FY|5.0|Great movie. One of my all-time favorites. Everything about it works, characters, filming, storyline, even the ending.
B001VG4LKW|5.0|Great book - loving it. How a bunch of guys changed the world just by thinking about it... Nobel prizes, bending space and time and warping reality ...
B0026P3G12|5.0|Am happy to report Susan Boyle is a delightful songstress - having nearly a pure voice. I really enjoy listening to her sing - again and again. And that's what a CD permits. I believe this is her first one - can't wait till the next...
B000KJU1HI|5.0|A wonderful concert film about a musical tour of Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Donovan etc. in Europe, 1965.  Bob sings wonderful songs and his voice is in top shape.  The songs and performances are a dream and this film is terrific.  They also show Dylan and friends drunk and behaving badly and Bob Dylan tormenting the press.  It's very amusing to see these reporters crouching down in front of him listening to him seriously ramble on about nonsense and putting it up with it as if he was really saying something profound.  I guess it's the blessing and curse of being rich and famous in your 20s and being able to torment others and see how much they will put up to speak to you.  Simple, straight forward film with no special effects!
078322933X|1.0|I am completely annoyed with this company. I ordered a movie and they sent the wrong one. Instead of just sending me the right one, they are making me go through this ridiculous process by sending the other one back before they send the right one even though it was their mistake. It was supposre to be a christmas gift and basically it was ruined.
0786868724|5.0|What a wonderful book, full of wisdom, hope and inspiration. It is so thoughtfully written that the words radiate from the page. Albom's eight year journey began when his rabbi asked him to do his eulogy. What began as a few informational gathering meetings, soon became a remarkable journey of soul searching questions.    Intertwining the stories and lives of two incredible unique men of God, Albom writes of Albert Lewis, his aging, elderly rabbi and of Henry Covington, a former drug addict, prison inmate, who became a minister to the poor and homeless.    Without over dramatizing, Albom's message is loud and clear -- There are many paths, and faith can indeed move mountains.
0451228731|5.0|I just started front to back and read both this and the sequel Freedom. I cannot recommend these two books enough for any technology / fiction fan. These are the first novels in recent memory that are exciting as stories, yet technically accurate and eerily close to reality to stimulate your fears. All in all, a great read!
B002OR18HQ|5.0|Why I was sceptical about this DVD:   After being disappointed by the Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again CD, being a devoted fanatic of CCR / Fogerty music ,  I thought that this was the end.      I really didn't care for some of that album and was really disappointed that his wife chose many of the albums' selections.      I was thinking: \\"John has given up...He's riding off into the sunset with wife and kids\\"!  Nothing wrong with that, but, I just thought he was getting lazy with his music.    It wasn't a bad album, it just didn't contain the blood, sweat and tears that was put into Blue Ridge Rangers # 1, or much of his other work.  No FEELING.         I got the Royal Albert Hall DVD today.    I had already learned the documentary that was promised was not added, nor the rare studio version of Comin Down The Road.  More disppointment!    So I have to expect another concert film of the same selections rehashed.       WRONG!!! This DVD rocks! Perfect audio and video production.      The band was super tight.       Everyone knows most of his songs so I really don't need to elaborate on those.    But EVERY song was fresh.  You can hear that he had been working on making these songs sound better than ever.    Even some of his weaker album material (IMHO) such as \\"I Will Walk With You\\" and \\"Don't You Wish It Was True\\" sounded better than the studio versions.  I still can't believe it!  Tastefully done and flawless!!   My  favorite selections included Commotion (they pounded this song out like there was no tomorrow) , a smoking jam on Ramble Tamble from the Cosmo's Factory album.     The mandolin intro to Southern Streamline was excellent and made the song sound brand new!   Not a weak song in the entire concert.    The transition from Rock to country and even a little Csjun was flawless.  You didn't notice one song was a rocker or this song is a country tune.  They were all FOGERTY tunes!  Probably the best concert DVD I have ever seen.    His singing is much better thanon his other Concert DVDs and his guitar playing is perfect.  He seems to just keep getting better with age. And he was already one of the best!         So , I apologize Mr. Fogerty, you have proven once again that you are one of the great pioneers of Rock.  You still have every bit of talent as you had \\"back in the day\\".   So take the kids to Dairy Queen, hug that wife and Keep On Chooglin'  I am convinced....you still got it!   You can finally sleep now. ;)

B001DD63UO|5.0|Great CD ---- Pink is a great performer & I think there can be no doubt of that after her 2010 Grammy performance.  It was the most unbelieveable & entertaining of the entire show.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This headphones is just great.There very light and the sound coming out of them is just awesome!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|The movie was not as true to the book as I would have liked.  I think they spent too much time on the \\"romantic antics\\" of Ron.  That part of the story was very brief in the book and hardly worth all the time spent on it.  I would have like to seen more action and more of what the author wrote about like the other Potter films.  I understand they have a different director than the other films, and although it wasn't a bad movie, it was rather far fetched and away from the book.
B001YB29HG|5.0|I feel like if was possible to take a peek inside the mind of Joss Whedon, this is what you would see. Once again he proves to be a master entertainer. The DVD was fun, funny, and had the classic Joss Whedon ending. If your a fan of his work you will love this. Nathan Fillion is one of my favorite actors and he does a wonderfull over-the-top performance in this one. Neil Patrick Harris is in it, need I say more. Watch this DVD. Buy it and watch it now. Stop reading this and get out your credit card. I'm not kidding.
0470449748|4.0|I recently took my GMAT (first and only one) and had a score which exceeded my expectation. I purchased this book and the Kaplan guide. Between these two, we have a pretty good coverage. I used Kaplan for test strategy and this OG for actual problems. One thing I found useful was I would take 10-20 problems at a time and timed myself to see if I can average under 90 secs per problem. It's been 20 years since I finished high school (ha it's been that long!) so I rented a math review book from local library and it was a good refresh but Kaplan book also has a decent review section. Having said that it would help if you had a strong education background in math.   Regarding the sample computer tests (two of them) that you get from [...], as the other reviewer said, please do not waste them. My two scores were 20 points apart and my actual score was right in the middle!  Finally on AWA, if you care, there are some templates out there on some web sites and this is a good starting point, you don't have to copy it exactly but it will give you a good idea on how to structure your essays.  Now that I am done, I have to figure out how to get rid of these books :-)
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have been waiting for something recorded by Susan Boyle ever since I heard her sing on \\"American Idol\\". What a beautiful voice! The first time I have heard anyone that could compare with Kate Smith. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to own such an amazing collection.
1846168864|5.0|I love this book. Charlie gets his little sister Lola to eat foods she won't normally eat by renaming them - peas are 'green drops from iceland', mashed potatos are 'cloud fluff', fish sticks are 'ocean nibbles' that mermaids eat, etc. My kids (ages 3-5) love this book, and it has gotten them to try new foods - they try and think up names themselves, and this amuses them enough to at least get past the initial aversion...
B002KSPKRS|3.0|The headphones are a fantastic alternative to annoying your sleeping family. The surround is fantastic and works surprisingly well. The mic is it's downfall. It sucks!  Also, the battery life is not great, especially if you have long gaming sessions. I burned through a set (2AAA) in a seven hour game fest.  Worth the money if you need a lot of sweet sound and do t want to disturb others.
B000001GY9|5.0|Bernstein conducted performances of Schumann's symphonies in Germany I believe shortly after World War II so these performances represent about 40 years of experience on Bernstein's part. He personally thought he was a great Schumann conductor if no one else did and I certainly affirm his opinion. Others digress. He's either over the top or dull, too fast or too slow. Same complaints about Solti and others. If you like Schumann and have faith in Bernstein to deliver, it's a great set to own. Enjoy.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The perfect complete collection for anyone who's a real fan of the show.  Comes with great behind the scenes stuff--over 24 hours of extra material!  The presentation is even pretty nifty, with each season in it's own little dossier folder inside of a package that looks like a document file.  The episode review book is great for spurring your memory when you can't quite remember what was in a particular episode.  For me, the clincher was the ridiculously low price.  Way to go, Amazon.com!
B000001GOZ|5.0|I absolutely love this performance and cannot find fault with it. Bernstein's 60s recording with the the NYP actually seems a little restrained compared to Boulez, fancy that! I've been listening to the Boulez on my iPod for quite some time and recently downloaded the Bernstein recording so very close in quality and tempos to Boulez performance. Boulez is pretty much imprinted on me but I grew up on Lenny's Mahler. Haven't heard Bernstein's late recordings but the point I'm actually making is the absurdity of stereotyping either conductor. Boulez is not a cold cerebral analyst and Bernstein is not an undisciplined out of control extrovert. Boulez may actually bring out the heartbreaking beauties of this score even more than Bernstein but let's remember that Boulez is conducting a few decades later and it was certainly Bernstein who upped the ante on conducting Mahler. I well remember Klemperer and Walter's slightly slower if not plodding tempos and I believe Bernstein set a new standard of appropriate intensity and exitement and most conductors jumped on that wagon. Neither performance will disappoint but you might want to have an extra hanky for the Boulez. That slow movement's a heartrending killer.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This was a great sound track and the price was fantastic. Amazon had a free shipping deal that made it totally worth waiting a few extra days!

031606792X|1.0|Ok, the one star rating is not for the book itself, it was actually an enjoyable read. However, my main issue is the fact that this book is targetted at tweens and teens, and I find this fourth book to be completely inappropriate for tweens... I do not need my 12-yr old reading about the multiple scenes alluding to the characters having sex on their honeymoon and after Bella is a vampire, as well as the violence that accompanies it in this book. It was heart breaking to tell her that she would have to wait a few years to read the last book of her favorite series (as most tweens, she s a mega twilight fan!).....

B001G1ACVY|4.0|What can I say, just buy this special edition. It's worth it because of the extra material on the extra CD. Plus you have the DvD aswell. The extra CD with the EP's on it is great. This is your only chance to get it for an reasonable price. The Dvd is worth having too, it gives you the chance to enjoy Jason playing live.  To be honest, if it was just for the normal CD I would never have bought it. I recomment this one for non-fans of Jason.....you'll become one after this.
0066620996|2.0|This book was written and researched during the roaring 1990s when profits piled up faster than leaves in the autumn where I live. Jim Collins, who wrote another book thousands have read, led the research team that set out to find out why the highest performing companies outperformed their competition. He did this by saying it was the result of a laundry list of characteristics from having humble CEOs recruited from inside the company to not particularly paying attention to technology to hiring the right people to get the job done.<br /><br />While all these attributes may contribute to succeess, the falure of this book was presaged in its first chapter, on pages 14-15 of the hardcopy version, where it asks and answers the mock question: \\"Will your findings continue in the new economy? The truth is, there's nothing new about the new economy.\\" Anyone that had money in the stock market in September 2008, especially those that held stock in General Motors, knows the \\"new\\" economy is much different than the one anyone's seen going back to 1930. And all Collins' exemplars in this book bit the dust -- most doing so long before 2008.<br /><br />Collins proof is in the pudding exemplars are 11 corporations whose stock values shot up at twice the rate of their competitiors during his period of research in the bamboozled economy of the 1990s that burned white hot. Today, less than two decades later, two of those companies are out of business, one has been liquidated, another had been bought by a bigger corporation, and all but one of the 11 had serious stock value declines by 2006, before the market meltdown of autumn 2008. Wells Fargo, the hero of chapter three, saw its stock value decline so greatly in the 2008 market meltdown that it became the poster boy company for federal bank bailout money the next year.<br /><br />This chapter, and this company, are highlighted as successful leaders that bought out a similar bank, then got rid of all its employees. While such work was commonplace in the takeover mania of the 1980s, it was rarely heralded as find business practice anywhere but in this \\"study.\\" Collins crew says Wells Fargo handled it properly because the people from the other bank wouldn't fit into the new company's business culture. The expeditious departure of long-time employees reminded me of Jimmy Hoffa's line in the movie of the same name [[ASIN:B00013RC2U Hoffa]]. Once elected international Teamsters president, Hoffa (nee Jack Nicholson with a bad haircut) turned to his assistant and told him, You're going to fire half these yokels tomorrow. Don't put it off so the other half will be secure and stay loyal.\\" While this happens in business all over the world, there's no reason to suggest it is a good practice.<br /><br />The bigger failure of the book is what actually happened to Collins' 11 exemplars of rising stock markets values. I looked at the stock values of each of the companies (the ones still in business) and all went backwards less than 15 years after this famous book -- and its recipe for success -- were written. Maybe the research team would say the management teams changed; otherwise, how can this book still be relevant as a model of business success in 2010? I think probably because the advice given is superficial, contradictory, and be can interpreted differently enough by any reader that is can be germane in the post-9/11, post 2008 recession world.<br /><br />Fortunately, you don't have to read this book to understand what these are. The precepts of success in business are the same today as they were in the earlier days of the free market -- hard work, market segmentation and differentiation, effective capitalization, high risk/reward ratio, and dedication to customer service.

B002PMV9FG|3.0|Being a fan of the books it's hard to fully appreciate the movie adaptations.  I love Harry Potter through and through but this movie seemed to be more focused on romance rather than the rise of Voldemort.  But it's still Harry Potter and I will always be a devoted fan.  For people who haven't read the books this movie will be quite enjoyable!

068484267X|5.0|The memoir Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt takes place in Brooklyn, New York and in Limerick, Ireland in the 1930's and 40's. The protagonist, Frank McCourt, is the oldest of eight children. His parents are Malachaly, who is described as \\"shiftless, loquacious, and alcoholic,\\" and his mother, Angela, whom McCourt calls, \\"pious, big-hearted, and overwhelmed.\\"  The big Irish family soon has to leave their home in Brooklyn and moves to Limerick after the tragic death of their beloved daughter, Margaret, just as the Great Depression takes hold in America. Their home in Ireland isn't ideal to the family; their rented flat is a complete rat's nest and they share one bathroom with all their neighbors. For years, the family only eats bread and tea because that is all they can afford on their welfare money, when Mr. McCourt doesn't take it all and use it to get drunk. Eventually, the kids have to steal food just to get through one more day; they even become beggars on the streets at times. Life in Ireland for the family is very brutal and harsh as the Great Depression and their own father's self-destructiveness swallows up their hopes as well on the other side of the Atlantic.  Though the storyline is sad and heartbreaking, Frank McCourt does an amazing job brightening up the memoir at times. \\"Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael . . . wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.\\" This is an example of McCourt taking a deep and dark moment and using humor to lighten it up. This moment is very symbolic to Angela's dreams and shows how the family struggles for food on a daily basis. As I was reading this passage (insert a comma here) I tried figure out why the title is Angela's Ashes, I think I've figured it out but I won't ruin it for you. While reading Mr. McCourt's remembrance, it was clear money was always an issue for the family, but after finishing the book, I realized that money wasn't the real conflict. Family, loving one another, and being together are the true conflicts that the family endures the entire book. The father is unable to find a job in Ireland and travels far away to work, he promises to send money but he is never heard from and trying to feed eight hungry children is difficult for Angela. This broken family sticks together and battles their miserable lives in multiple homes that they stay at throughout the town of Limerick.  At first, this book was both depressing and sad, but as I read through it, I saw more than that and discovered that it has more of a deep and a more underlying meaning than I thought it would. From reading this compelling memoir, I got a better understanding of how life can be so cruel but yet the McCourt family managed to carry on with little food and thin clothing during harsh winters. At one point, I got sucked into the book and I felt like I was one of the eight kids searching through dumpsters trying to find any scraps of food, and yet I managed to laugh at the funny and naïve things the younger kids say. I don't think I've read a tome that has ever made me feel so many different emotions.  As one reviewer wrote when McCourt's book came out, \\"It brings tears and smiles together as close as they can ever be.\\"

1577312082|5.0|This book is a fascinating and motivating guide on how to live in the moment.   It did not contradict my religious beliefs but gave me additional insights and practical steps on reaching a state of inner peace and hightened consciousness that I could start practicing immediately.  I feel all of us can benefit from the teachings of Eckhart Tolle.  Having already heard \\"A New Earth,\\" this book goes back to how to live in \\"The Now.\\"  With relevant references to the Bible and other theological works, Eckhart brought me to a fascinating place where serenity exists.  It can be available to anyone willing to listen.  I plan to review the book repeatedly so I don't lose this new and wonderful tool, being in the mindful present state.

B0014DCTI8|5.0|A short review of the vinyl edition - I have a clear/blue-tinted vinyl with blue/grey splattering.  I understand there is also a solid blue pressing with gatefold jacket; this has no gatefold.  In any case, this is a nice pressing on heavy vinyl.  Some quiet surface noise that I can't get rid of, but you'll only hear it between tracks.  Otherwise dead quiet, no inner-groove distortion, which I can't say for any other modern extreme metal records I have.  I did spectral analysis and there are frequencies above 22 khz - looks like mostly drum transients, which would be killed in the CD mastering.  It should come as no surprise, then, that the drums sound great, especially John's snare work.  Overall, a nice metal LP. I can't say if it's a big improvement over the CD, but as a record it's well done.  If you have a decent turntable (read: not Sony/Pioneer/AT LX crap) and half-way decent cart and are into extreme metal, the LP is recommended.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This was a gift for a very serious WWII scholar.  He was delighted to receive the uncut/unedited copy as he hadn't seen it since the 1970's.  The World at War Special's equal treatment of both sides is something that is sadly missing in most of today's WWII documentaries.      The hardest of the segments to watch is of course the one on the Holocaust. I had seen that particular one as a freshman in High School many years ago, my World Studies teacher had included it to start the discussions on the Red Army's march to Berlin. It made me cry then and it did when we watched it again.    Unless more people see this uncut/unedited 30th Anniversary Edition, our ignorance will only grow worse as the generation who fought and died in these faraway places for us disappears forever.    Two Thumbs Up for making it available again for those who really want to know what happened.
0307266303|3.0|Christopher McDougall is to be commended for taking a remarkable movement and producing a solid book about it. It is hard to not read this book and not drink at least some of the Kool Aid. Running SHOULD be fun, long distance runners do seem to have something figured out, and maybe the running shoe industry HAS in fact profited by creating shoes cause more harm than good.<br /><br />My qualms were: a)that the race that he hangs the entire book around revealed itself to be more of a plot device  b)the overly dramatic writing that pushed me out of the story again and again(although I did love the World According to Garp line) and c)the back and forth structure of the narrative often felt very forced.<br /><br />At times it's a great read, but after all the accolades I admittedly expected something much more impressive. You can feel the editors hands trying to pull it all together all over this.
1591843162|5.0|Anyone who's had to deal with the obstacles associated with surving and thriving in corporate America will gain an enormous amount of insight from Seth Godin's wonderful perspective; indeed, striving to become an indispensable part of any organization is the best way to stay focused and create real value, whether it be on the job, in a relationship, with friends, family members, or in school.  That's the beauty of Godin's advice; it's applicable in a wide range of scenarios and can form the foundation for consistently doing the right things throughout one's life.<br /><br />Life is rarely a smooth journey for even the most successful people in any endeavor.  We live in an imperfect world filled with economic peril, bureaucracy, treachery, and outright foolishness.  Inside the pages of this terrific book lies the perfect strategy for dealing with whatever life has in store for anyone who has a desire to excell.  Failure to heed Godin's pragmatic advice could lead to an unwelcome early retirement or disappointing outcomes to a variety of challenges.<br /><br />In essence, this book itself is indispensable.
0143144901|4.0|\\"Juliet Naked\\" (Audio Book edition)  Written by Nick Hornby  Read by Bill Irwin, Ben Miles & Jennifer Wiltsie  (Penguin Books, 2009)  ------------------------------------------------------  This review is specific to the audio book version \\"Juliet, Naked\\": for some reason Amazon aggregates the reviews for the printed and the spoken versions of their books, which seems kind of silly, but there you are.     Anyway, I enjoyed the story, but I wish I had read the book myself rather than listened to the audio edition -- the voice work, particularly the male voices, did not do justice to the story. The characters came off as flat and dull, and many of the voices were indistinguishable, particularly of minor characters such as Tucker Crow's various children, whose lines sounded uniformly horrible. Voice actor Jennifer Wiltsie is the exception -- her portrayal of Anne's inner voice was frequently compelling; the male performances were awful, though, particularly the schlumpy, inert portrayal of the music-obsessive Duncan... He could have sounded livelier... and it would have been great if he actually sounded British! This audio book was a disappointment, but oh well, they can't all be great. (Axton)
B00133KFGW|5.0|The \\"August Rush\\" video is perfect for families.  It is a joy and very encouraging for children.  I really enjoyed it with my family.
0061564893|1.0|I won't say much, because most of the negative reviews are right on.  As a History major and one interested in things of this sort, I believe I can provide a good review.  This book is absolutely absurd.  He makes his claims based on speculations, false evidence, and speculates some more.  He uses a fake map to present his claims, he talks of statues erected in Africa (not America), and he says he knows about these things because he was a military sub person.  WHAT?!  All in all, I would say stay away from this book.  Don't waste your time.  If you are interested in nonwestern or Asian exploration and discovery, there are plenty of scholarly works out there: When China Ruled the Seas: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne 1405-1433 by Levathes,The Making of the Chinese State: Ethnicity and Expansion on the Ming Borderlands by Leo Shin, and The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty by Henry Shih-shan Tsai to name a few.  Just please, stay away from THIS junk!!!!!!!!
B002Y0MQ6A|2.0|This is possibly one of the most dissapointing \\"Zombie\\" movies I've ever seen.  Very rarely are any \\"infected\\" seen, and the characters make possibly the worse decision any logical human could make.  The remake of Day of the Dead is so much better in so many ways.      It's unfortunate since the trailer painted this as a original and compelling virus flick, but it ended up being flat and boring between the cliched writing, poor character decision, and lack of anything compelling visually.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, If your a fan of Shaun of the Dead you will LOVE this one as well. I found myself laughing from start to finish. This is going to become a cult classic imo.
B002WY65VU|3.0|when i found out that this was originally written as a television pilot, well, the whole film then makes sense.<br /><br />this IS NOT nearly as funny as Shaun of the Dead, it just isn't- nor is it 28 Days Later!<br />but it is silly and quirky with excellent performances from all 4 cast members.<br /><br />the blood&guts are NOT over the top, and it is semi-believable.<br /><br />overall, because it doesn't really go anywhere, I am only giving it three stars because, while it is good and i enjoyed it, and the performances are solid, it is just a pretty average film.
B002L5810I|5.0|I have seen this movie when I was a child however to see it agian and on DVD is really a treat.

(I've never done that either!)<br /><br />Please see this on a GOOD TELEVISION, it deserves it!

141690977X|5.0|I read this book years ago when it first came out and I find myself returning to it at least once a year, be it to clarify something, or to advise a friend. I've given copies of this book (and extracts too) to friends who have needed them at different times and it does help to heal a lot of wounds and to understand how things should go in a relationship. In this day and age, when self-esteem issues are quite escalated, it is good to see and hear that a healthy relationship does not mean we have to be doormats to anyone... Or even to question why certain men act the way they do... And I believe EVEN A SHY GUY will act a certain way when he likes a woman, and get over his fear (fess up eventually, work on how to handle things). This book is a great read ladies, so go on and get it :-)<br /><br />It would be nice if it could be published in other languages.

B002BZDK8Q|2.0|There are currently three items here in Amazon that are all this same book. I recommend reading the reviews of the other matching items, because there aren't any reviews on this one yet, and the reviews are worth reading.  I can't really recommend this cookbook.  I at least expected that each recipe would be reasonably yummy.  They weren't.  I made the chocolate devils food cupcakes.  I expected rich and dark - like devil's food.  It wasn't rich, or particularly moist - not even that chocolatey.  Tonight I made the Chai Latte Mini Cupcakes, and they're a little boring.  If I'm going to take the time to make cupcakes, and spend some of my fats and sugars quota to eat some of them, I want them to be Really Good.  What this book may turn out to be good for is the creative ideas and presentations.  There is a ton of inspiration in this book.  If I make any more cupcakes, though, I'm going to add more of certain ingredients to make them richer, moister, ... tastier.  I had the same reaction as another reviewer - I wondered how much they really tested these recipes.
B002TSIMEC|4.0|Dan Brown has a knack.  He knows how to write a book that is a pleasure to read.  For us geeks this book has just enough of science fact, conjecture and fiction, to make it thoroughly entertaining.  I also like the short chapters.  They keep you moving along and also provide great breaking points.  You retain a thought for the next time you pick up the book.<br /><br />This book has the usual cast including, the professor, potential love interest and bad guy that we are familiar with from most of his books.  Then there are the characters that we are not sure if they are good or bad, nor even what that means. This book takes a relatively positive look at the Masons and their role in US history.  Most of us know there are many famous Americans that were members of this organization. However much of their meetings are secret and the brotherhood is known to be quite selective.  In other words an ideal group to further shroud in mystery.<br /><br />As usual Dan Brown, discusses the symbolism of the architecture and its part in the story that he weaves.  Given that this architecture exists, the basis for the story is fact. In a nutshell without spoiling the story the professor has a friend that is in danger.  The bad guy threatening this friend thinks the professor is also a key to the puzzle and is manipulating him to get this information. Unfortunately, this friend's sister is also in danger, so there are two fronts to be concerned with. The professor needs to consider who he can trust and what the puzzle is that he must solve and we are taken on a romp through Washington DC as the professor puts this all together.<br /><br />If you want to invest in it, there is a magazine out, that actually provides pictures and a bit of info on the areas covered by this book. Mind you there are a ton of other interpretation books, but the magazine is a cheap addition.  It makes an interesting read after you have read this book.  I'm sure Washington DC will receive its share of visitors due to this as well.<br /><br />Regarding the ending. without revealing anything, this struck me as a bit soft.  I was a bit disappointed not to find more intrigue at the end (thinking of DaVinci code).  There is one comment that makes it sound like things were left open, but it was early enough in the story, I'm not sure if it refers to what was later found, or that the secret was maintained. Regardless, it was a fun read and I'm sure will make an equally entertaining movie.Regarding the ending. without revealing anything, this struck me as a bit soft.

B002GY9F9K|4.0|I finally got the complete first season for Christmas and have been rewatching the entire first \\"chapter\\" before I begin season 2. Although the DVD transfer is fantastic, and I love this series, I have a few gripes about the packaging. It seems that a lot of shows are now switching to cheaper, thinner packaging, that while economically convenient, are rather disappointing for the fans like myself who'd rather pay the extra expense for a few inserts or even a few more interesting bonus materials.    The original pilot episode was a 90min movie now split into \\"Prophecy/Destiny\\" in two separate acts, and as they cover on the producers/actors' commentary for this episode, there was a bit cut out during Richard's \\"naming\\" ceremony when they had to split the episodes for syndication. I would've liked to have seen it in its original form and was very disappointed that they did not do so for the DVD set. They could've at least offered the extended cut of that scene in the bonus materials, but most of what we get are extended scenes from other episodes (which are a bit confusing unless you've just watched the whole thing in a small amount of time like I have). I wish the deleted scenes had been paired with their respective episodes or at the very least been offered with optional director's commentary stating why they were cut (although I imagine it's mostly to do with time restraints).    I rather feel like the first season release was just completely rushed and thrown together, and I'd've rather paid $30+ for a fuller \\"Seeker\\" experience. Hopefully if sales are good, they'll consider taking customers' suggestions for improvement.

When working with clients on resistance exercises, the book provides easy-to-understand graphics of how the exercises should be performed and which muscles, muscle groups, and bones are involved in each exercise.  The result is a better understanding of why certain exercises are being recommended and how exercises, when done properly, complement one another in meeting specific fitness goals.

0385737424|5.0|Other people have described this book far better than I could. But, I just wanted to make sure to lend my opinion in that - this is an amazingly magical book that turns what seems to be a child's ordinary life into something quite extraordinary.

0385340575|3.0|Lee Child has an undeniable knack for describing otherwise mundane events with an offbeat precision that forces you to see them anew.  And Jack Reacher is a delightful fabulation in the hard-boiled tradition of Philip Marlowe or Mickey Spillane.  But after all these years of wandering to and fro, Jack should by now have started asking himself a few questions about his inability to sustain relationships or to find pleasure in the experience of community.  He started out with a life founded upon an existential act of radical freedom, and he's now sleepwalking through a not really pleasant existence that seems to have chosen him, rather than the other way around.      All of the Jack Reacher plot cliches are on display again in this book. The mysterious and bottomless malevolence and desperation of the Other, the enemy's consistent failure to properly estimate Jack's resourcefulness and physical power, Jack's insane exposure of himself to untold risks of immediate extinction, and the victim whose demise kicks off the proceedings.      I read and enjoyed this book despite its formulaic structure and average dialogue.  Something inside me responds to Reacher's desolate honor.  It's time for Lee Child to let Reacher see inside himself, and to evolve in an interesting new direction.
0786852550|5.0|After reading all the reviews here on Amazon I decided to give this book a chance. I'm so glad I did because this book is an absolute gem. I know some people will be turned off by the magic used through the summoning of demons, but its light hearted and if anything the humans are far worse than the spirits they summon. That's one of the things I loved so much about the book was how no one was perfect. Most of the people in the book including the boy are selfish, cruel and arrogant, it's hilarious reading Bartimaeus's notes on his many observations of human behavior that oh so true. So if you're looking for a fresh and original book with a great story, and characters I highly recommend this book.

Combining fascinating, hand drawn Venn diagrams (my favorite is on page 43, showing how Charm, Talent and Perseverance can combine to create a Linchpin while each, on their own, creates a Princess, a Prodigy or Frustration, respectively) with numerous examples of famous and not so famous people who made the decision to be artistic and generous, Godin makes a cogent argument for why giving gifts is the only way to become indispensable in the new economy.<br /><br />Linchpins are described as having seven key abilities: 1) they provide a unique interface between organizational members, 2) they deliver unique creativity, 3) they manage in situations of great complexity, 4) they lead customers, 5) they inspire staff, 6) they possess deep domain knowledge and 7) they possess a unique talent.<br /><br />Ever the pragmatist, Godin closes this fascinating tome with what to do \\"When It Doesn't Work,\\" His summary chapter wraps it all up into a neat bundle. I found his advice on page 234 to encapsulate his plea to the reader:<br /><br />\\" ...every day a few people (more than a few people) change everything. You can do it. You can embrace a new path and take it. Don't settle. You're a genius and we need your contribution.<br />Do the work. Please.\\"a few people) change everything. You can do it.

0385737424|5.0|I just love this story. The careful interweaving of \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\"; the naked man; the notes that will creep you out; the sandwich shop; the piggy-bank; the penultimate scene; the game show...    One thing I want to see emphasized more is that these books are suitable for those ages 12 and up. And when I say \\"up\\", I mean \\"up.\\" I'm 51, and I could not stop reading this book.    The books these days for middle-schoolers are far better than when I was in middle-school, even with writers like L'Engle.    Rebecca, I'm looking forward to your work in the future. You have an old man as a fan now!
0756655730|5.0|I like this book very much. It has something I always wanted to see in one place: fauna, flora, climate and some geology throughout the ages. The material and photos are very good indeed. It has now a captive place in my bedroom's library!
0316166685|3.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold was a little bit of a let-down for me. The narrator is a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon. The story begins with Susie getting raped by her neighbor on her way home from school.This scene is a little difficult to read, as it does go into detail and might be a touchy subject for most people. (especially mothers) Her family is devastated and begin to fall apart. Her dad becomes obsessed with discovering the secret behind Susie's death because the police have failed to do so. Her mom slowly falls away from the family, leading her to regret some decisions she makes in an attempt to cope with the sudden tragedy. Susie's sister eventually takes sides with her dad and helps him in discovering who Susie's killer is. Mr. Harvey, the villain, struggles at some parts trying to cover up his tracks. The point of view is actually Susie's herself. She is watching down on her family and friends from Heaven (or the spaces in between, she wasn't sure of where she was). It is an interesting way of portraying the story because you know things the characters don't, and only share these secrets with the girl who was murdered.  For the most part of the story, I was involved and did enjoy it. However, I don't believe that this book deserved all the hype it got. Many of my friends were telling me \\"You have to read this!!!\\" So, I listened. I didn't regret reading it, I do recommend it, just advise you not to expect it to be as good as it was named.  For me, the ending was the biggest let down. The story sets up some big climatic scene at the end of the book. yea.. didn't happen. I was very disappointed with the ending-it was very odd, and not at all what I thought would happen. (not in a good way.) If the ending had been more climatic I feel like I wouldn't have such a negative attitude to the book.

0099456761|5.0|My son has been diagnosed with autism, and I feel like the author really does get what autistic people are like.   But the thing I liked most was how he managed to portray Christopher as the only character with real depth and texture. Where Christopher has his very obvious and real limitations, his parents are enmired in equally debilitating and more stupid squabbles and jealousies. Christopher's issues come across to me as more real. He doesn't like people to touch him for a very good reason - because it hurts. He was certainly the most sympathetic character in the book, but also the bravest, the most honorable, the smartest, the wisest, the fairest, the one with the most interesting life. Everybody else in the book was sort of flat and predictable by comparison. He was the hero. He had a future you wanted to know about. At least that's how I saw it. And in real life, as I experience it, it can really be that way. For that reason, autism isn't this gigantic tragedy to me. Yes, you wonder who will hire him and love him when you are gone, and no, he wasn't prom king. But there are plenty of compensations if you can get past all that.  I've read some reviews about how Christopher fails to understand the tragedy of his parent's divorce, because autistic people have no empathy and so on and so forth. I beg to differ. Christopher is initially motivated by his love for a dog, and a sense of the injustice done to the dog. But his other big move is to go to London, which wouldn't have happened if he hadn't cared about his mother. He explains that the reason he has an easier time with animals is that they don't lie to him. He understands their minds and can trust them to be faithful and honest... it's not about lack of empathy for people. Every autistic person I know well is deeply empathetic. Because of (for example) the stupid fights he sees his parents go through, people have to do more to gain his trust. Autism is seen as a disability, because people like Christopher don't get some really big things, like that his father isn't going to kill him. But Christopher doesn't get his father for the same reason his father doesn't get him - because their brains are wired differently. In this sense, Christopher isn't any dumber or less empathetic or less rational than his father, and Haddon conveys this beautifully.   Christopher and his father are thrown into this world with different brains, but with the same desire to create a meaningful life. The mind of Christopher's father gives him certain advantages toward this end, but Christopher's mind gives him equally big advantages, and Haddon leaves you genuinely wondering which mind you would rather have. It was just great.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I loved this movie/documentary.  I was actually surprised it didn't get any Oscar nominations for sound, editing or just best picture at least.  RIP Michael!
0316096199|5.0|Before beginning this book, you should consider what you expect to get from it. The subject matter of this book is difficult. This is not a book to be read for entertainment or escapism; it is not fiction, nor is it The Lovely Bones II.     This book tells the story of a woman's rape and what happens afterwards. There is no neat and happy Hollywood ending. The beauty of the book is its honesty. I read this book at a time in my life when I was dealing with a personal trauma (NB not rape or a physical assault), and I found Sebold's sensitive handling of the subject of recovery superb.     In my opinion the real strength of this book is how she sets the 'recovery' from the rape in the mundane everyday activities of her family life in Pennsylvania and her social life in Syracuse. There is a lot of detail about the relationships between herself and her family, both before and after the rape. I am a bit biased in this instance because I am from the same area as Sebold, thus I suspect I may have been more interested in the details of her suburban life than other readers. However the way she tells the story articulates the often-neglected aspects of the recovery from a trauma. A 'recovery' happens within the social context of our (usually imperfect) families, friends and neighbors. She doesn't tell an action-packed gun-slinging story of revenge or redemption. She lays out the difficult details of her reality.     This memoir is beautifully written. It takes you to dark places, but in going there with her, somehow it makes you feel less alone. There are also important insights related to how others treat victims of violence. Highly recommended, however this is difficult subject matter and if you are a victim of rape or physical trauma you may want to look at numerous reviews before starting this book.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary confirmed my suspicions about the state of the U.S. food industry.  But I didn't realize how bad the poultry industry is, too.  Wow.    If you are interested in this topic, then I also highly recommend \\"In Defense of Food\\" and \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" by Michael Pollan.    After reading Pollan's books and viewing this documentary, I'm starting to think that the current food crisis (or as Pollan calls it, \\"edible food-like substances\\") is actually more urgent than climate change (both are urgent, but this food crisis is creating an epidemic of diabetes, obesity, cancer, and more).    It is also outrageous how U.S. policy is helping fuel this crisis.    In short, you are what you eat, and what you're eating right now is pretty disgusting.    (This review contains no corn and no sugar).
B002ZHKZCY|5.0|I purchased this Bourne Supremacy single disc blu-ray/dvd combo on the release date (Jan 19, 2010). I played it twice already, each time it played very well on my Panasonic Blu-ray player. The Blu-ray picture is fantastic, so much crispy clearer than the DVD. I love the movie and now I can enjoy the superior picture at home whenever I want to.
B001675YQ6|5.0|A quirkly, sexy, and likeable heroine, a little sexual confusion, hunks both gay and straight, a happy ending for everyone...What more can you ask for in a romantic comedy? I loved this little movie when I first caught it on cable and so purchased it for my sister. I was looking forward to keeping track of Brittany Murphy, who gave a lovely performance, so I was especially sad to hear of her own unhappy ending.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|I bought this Bourne Ultimatum single disc Blu-ray/DVD combo on the release date. I can't wait to have an affordable Blu-ray Bourne movie. The Blu-ray disk plays very smoothly on my Panasonic Blu-ray player, not a single problem at all. The picture quality is very very good. I am very satisfied.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a great CD by such a new up and coming singer.  This CD arrived in a quick time frame.  Amazon always comes through with great values and great service.     This is a beautiful collection of songs with so much meaning and it shows from the artist..so enjoyable to listen to.
B002ZHKZCO|5.0|I bought all three Bourne Blu-ray/DVD combo movies. All three of them play very well on my Blu-ray player. The picture and sound are fantastic. I cannot find any flaws or problems, and I am so happy to be able to get affordable Bourne Blu-ray movies.
B00005JM02|4.0|I purchased Finding Nemo for a friend. Her Dautghter liked the movie so much she watched it until the disk she had was scrathed.She recieved this copy of Finding Nemo on Christmas Day and enjoyed it as much as the last copy of it she had. The special effects are great and a treat for both adults and children. There are elements of the plot that adults would understand and enjoy. The darker parts of the the story,such as what happened to Nemos's mom were handled very well. I would reccomend this movie to an adult who wished to get a child a nice movie they could enjoy together.
B000TEVFPQ|4.0|There is only one good song I like from Mr. Bowie.  Young Americans.  To me, it's a Beatle song on steroids.  I also like his \\"Ground control to Major Tom\\" song and \\"Fame.  But, that's about it.  \\"Young Americans\\" is one of my favorite all time songs, sung as only David Bowie can sing it.
0307245306|3.0|I found this book while searching for something to read after the Harry Potter series.  I got the story from the library on audio CD because the wait was so long for the book.  While I really liked the story, the narrating was terrible.  The guy who narrated the story read it like he was reading to a 5 year old.  Yes, I know this is a YA book, but the narrator was really ridiculous.  It was hard to get into the story sometimes because I kept replaying the sentences in my head in a more interesting way.  I really ended up liking the story, but I think they made a big mistake with the choice of narrator.      The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the narrator.  The book probably would have garnered 4 stars from me.  Good book, bad narrator.  Next time I will read the book myself.
B0013GH9AO|5.0|What more can you say about 2001 other then it being a cornerstone of West Coast Hip-Hop. A work of art from the one and only Rapper, Record Producer, Dr. Dre. The album has went platinum many times over, the tracks on here will live on for years. It's a legendary album. 'Still D.R.E.' is almost the anthem of So Cal. The intro instantly makes most people say in their heads \\"Ohh S**t\\". It's the prize at the bottom of the cereal box, the diamond in the sandbox. The only album that could ever surpass it could be Detox. But until then, bump 2001 and join the rest of the Hip-Hop world while we all wait patiently (or impatiently) for Dre's next multi-platinum album.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I have quite a collection of CD's and the Hailstorm CD is one of the best.  It has a fantastic lead singer and it rocks!  I am definitely recommending this to anyone who likes great lyrics, rythym, and rockin' music.  I look forward to buying another CD from the group and adding it to my collection.  A definite AAA+ to rock lovers!
B002NPY7FE|5.0|This movie is incredible. I love it so much. I have both read the book by stephen king and seen the movie. Ive seen the movie several time and its very good. Of course looking back on it now it isnt so scary like nightmare on elm street isnt so scary now as it used to be or the original dracula with bela lugosi, but this film is a classic like the ones i just listed. It was very scary for its time good acting. Well written story and the movie almost exactly copies the book which is incredible. Not many stephen king horror movies does that besides misery which ive seen.
0783225857|5.0|This is a poignant and heart warming story told from the point of view of a little tomboy, Scout, & her older brother, Jem, of growing up in the South during the depression.  It is fairly faithful to the book although much has been omitted as one would expect.  Their father, Atticus Finch, a widowed attorney, takes on a the defense of a Negro wrongly accused of raping a white girl.  The colorful neighbors, their antics and their opinions, show the audience just what stuff this family, especially Atticus trying to raise his children alone, is made of.
0439813786|5.0|This is a story of intrigue and heartfelt feelings, with no hidden meanings or implications. It is filled with incidences of characters choosing to act with integrity, kindness and strength. Hugo's need to steal provides opportunity time and again to see that he would not do so if he had the choice. It might be easier to say what this book lacks: it lacks negativity. It is a story of struggle, the instinct to survive while maintaining one's humanity. Highly recommended!!  [...]
B002TYZKIM|5.0|After the tragic death of a pop icon, I was skeptical of the motives behind this DVD. Were they squeezing money out of a canceled concert? Taking advantage of a bad situation? And would the movie focus on the tragedy, with scant footage of the actual music and dancing? For these reasons, I had low hopes when my wife talked me into getting this. We both experienced the phenomenon of \\"Thriller\\" in the early 80s, as teens, but I doubted this could capture that same excitement.<br /><br />\\"This is It\\" was a wonderful surprise. We get a close up view of the planned tour in its final days of rehearsal. We hear the enthusiasm of the dancers, and marvel at their abilities. All of them, of course, are inspired by Michael himself, and the King of Pop delivers here, showing that he had lost none of his form even in the days before his death. He pops, locks, sings, squeals, with all the energy I remembered. There are a few stumbles, which is why they call it a rehearsal, but overall, I felt I was catching the vibe of the intended show.<br /><br />Not only do we get an intimate look at the rehearsal process, with some incredible effects for \\"Thriller\\" and others, we hear some of Michael's creative process. Particularly impressive, in light of today's tendency toward pretaped sounds and music, the entire show is done with a cast of musicians on stage, producing tight sounds and heart-pounding beats.<br /><br />If you're looking for insights into Michael Jackson's death, you'll find none of that here, but if you're looking for his passion, imagination, and musical skills, \\"This is It.\\"
B00007KWHN|4.0|The Yes Album - Yes (4.11 stars)<br />Original Release: 2/19/1971<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Yours Is No Disgrace (4 stars)<br />The lyrics seem to be about the folly of the efforts of the human race; and so your personal folly is no great matter.  Staccato melody on guitar, bass and drums, then nice counterpoint from the organ.  Then this shifts to a synth sound that is atmospheric.  The guitar wraps around the beat like a rhythmic fairy.  The bass swings away in the background with the same energy as previous albums but not so much in the foreground.  At one point the guitar makes little melodic whines in counterpoint to vocal rhythm.  The song returns to its original theme repeatedly in subtly different forms.  In a more extended instrumental section after a guitar solos oscillating in left and right channels various progressive instrumental melodies play out which compliment the main theme.  The guitar is heard in various ways.  Although the overall variety of melodies is not great this long song does not seem long.  Each section contains subtle variations which present and represent the themes in every changing ways.  The overall groove is engaging and yet somehow stately.<br /><br />Clap [Live] (4 stars)<br />This is a guitar solo played live somewhere to a small group of people.  The genre seems to be country or folk.  It has a good pace, rhythm, the chords and plucking blend together gracefully showing up the great dexterity of the guitarist's fingers.  The song acts as a kind of palette cleanser between the two longer songs which flank it lightening the tone a bit.<br /><br />Starship Trooper: Life Seeker/Disillusion/Wurm (5 stars)<br />The lyrics seem to be invoking a familiar Yes theme of the \\"hidden glories\\" of life.  Contrasting qualities of summer and winter (as in \\"Yours is no Disgrace\\"), the visible and invisible help to describe a mystical perspective which is self-consciously realized by the vocalist it seems.  \\"Life Seeker\\" begins with a heavy bass theme and lighter guitar counter theme.  At first this first movement of the song avoids settling into a beat.  Then an instrumental bridge brings us into a rhythm and a different lyric with nostalgic references.  The bass plays with muscle under the melody.  In \\"Disillusion\\" the acoustic guitar takes over and the vocals are rhythmic.  This second movement finds its way after an instrumental bridge to a melody from the first movement building until it releases into the third movement \\"Wurm\\".  \\"Wurm\\" is a repeated series of three minor chords which seem to descend and ascend with a kind of dark, demonic quality.  Gradually the various instruments build up an intensity which eventually erupts into a furious guitar solo.  The first two movements of the song seem to joyfully anticipate the third movement like an extended joyful prophet announcing the coming of an awesome power.  The way the instruments represent this arising/descending power is a wonder to behold and if you are caught by the deep mystery of this song you probably forever hold it in high esteem.<br /><br />I've Seen All Good People: Your Move/All Good People (4 stars)<br />In the politics of life you may not be well respected but make your moves as you would make them and karma and your love will prevail...so say the lyrics.  More rhythmic vocals create a stark and energetic intro to this two part song.  Soon the acoustic guitar and a heartbeat bass come in for a relaxed vocal section.  There is a pan flute or synth flute sound as well to add flavor.  The vocals harmonize and there is some doo-wap that adds further punch.  Layered vocals with lead and a countering background are also employed.  Eventually a cathedral organ comes in to darken and intensify the mood.  The organ climaxes and then there is a silence...after which the second part of the song kicks in with a swing-rock rhythm.  The same single lyrical line with which the song began is now repeated...a very long sentence sang in a rhythmicway.  The guitar lays down a blues flavor.  Once again the organ and bass come in with dark intensity and the same vocalizations fade away with a more profound energy.<br /><br />A Venture (3 stars)<br />The lyrics seem to be about living your life and not separating yourself from others; to control your passions utterly is to breed addictive behavior.  The Beatlesque rhythm of this song passes quickly and ends with an interesting off kilter instrumental jam with the guitar and the bass and the piano frolicing around each other.<br /><br />Perpetual Change (4 stars)<br />The vocalist seems to be having a discussion with someone who thinks that consciousness is everything...that we control ourselves, even our destiny.  But deep inside we are moved by forces greater than us.  This song also features a staccato instrumental intro, a strong hammering fanfare.  Then is shifts down into a laid back bluesy rock rhythm where the vocalist comes in.  The song flows even as it changes through matching shades of color; from militaristic to swing to blues and back again perhaps reflecting the title of the song elegantly.  Then comes a brief instrumental section which suddenly transforms into a march-like, complex, clock-work like phrase that winds up and builds energy.  A keyboard sound comes in to tie it all off.  Then back to vocals with a heightened sense of energy applied to a repeated lyrical section.  Then seems to breakaway from its twists and turns with a atmospheric vocal/instrumental coda of yet another flavor although this too is playfully interrupted a couple times with another staccato phrase.<br /><br />Your Move [Single Version] (2 stars)<br />Cut down version of the album song.<br /><br />Starship Trooper: Life Seeker [Single Version] (2 stars)<br />Sounds the same as the corresponding portion of the same song on the album.<br /><br />Clap [Studio Version] (2 stars)<br />Slightly longer version of the album song.  It is enjoyable to hear the song more clearly in a studio context.  There are some differences in the song showing that the song would be played slightly differently at times.  For me the live version flows more naturally, but this may be due to that version's greater familiarity.<br /><br />Album:<br /><br />On Yes' third album there is an elegant coordination of the various instruments.  The guitar is a stronger player in the mix with a wide variety of styles.  Somehow the sound of the album is more open making each instrumental contribution more approachable.  The songs themselves have an improved sense of craft in that the musical ideas within a song seem to fit together more coherently.  Admittedly, I've heard this album so many times that at first it was hard to really hear it, but taking a critical approach to it has reawakened some of my original appreciation for it.<br /> This album shows how Yes has taken a leap of confidence in their song compositions as they seem to have combined simplicity with complexity in an optimal way.<br /><br />Yes seems to have left their 60s pop sound far behind and defined a new level of sophistication within their own repertoire.  With this album they join Genesis, King Crimson and Emerson, Lake & Palmer in what is fast becoming the then new genre of Progressive Rock.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />I have no good MP3 highlights to recommend.

B002VEB228|2.0|I rented the flick due to one of the positive reviews (\\"Pleasantly Surprised\\"). I'll know better next time. Zahns character is the biggest whimp that frets like somebodys overbearing mother. No woman (especially a Milla type) would ever marry this guy, hes a total whuss. I couldn't take anymore and had to turn it off.
B001UV4XX8|5.0|I didn't see a lot of hype for this film nor did I have any strong desire to see it aside from it's intriguing premise. I finally caught it recently and have to say I really enjoyed it. The story begins simple enough but as the film progresses it becomes more involving and mysterious. A unique Twilight Zone-esque tale with fine performances and creepy moments. It's not on the level of Donnie Darko but it's still a fine film. Recommended.
0439023491|2.0|Let me retrace back to late September 2009 when I first heard of this series in general. I was in a bookstore and when I glanced over at the teen section, I noticed the two books, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Both had interesting looking covers, however I put off reading them because of the hype. It wasn't until November 2009 when I gave up trying to hide from them and got the first book from the library. So I read it and loved it! It had tons of action, suspense, and dark humor in it. Think Battle Royale meets Death Race- it's that good.<br /><br />Yesterday I borrowed this from the library and sat down to read it. And was the book good? Unfortunately it did not.<br /><br />Unfortunately I will have to place the blame for this book's weakness on \\"sophomore syndrome\\"- that is, when an author writes a first book that is fresh, exciting and new, and then when she writes a sequel she feels that the first book is such a bestseller that she doesn't have good enough ideas and just writes what she can, and in the process, has us thinking about her editor, who was probably sipping wine coolers on a beach somewhere.<br /><br />So yeah, basically, this book picks up right where book one left off. Peeta and Katniss are in love. They have just returned from the Hunger Games, and, well, what do you know. They're famous. Oh! And Peeta proposes to Katniss. Awwww!<br /><br />So basically, the first 2/3 of the book is nothing but just that. It's not until at least page 230 or so where the real action begins. Peeta and Katniss have to go back into the game for a second round. And while this may sound good and like it is a good plot device, unfortunately it isn't. The whole thing is rushed, sloppily written and too many unnecessary character changes. Unlike the first book it's not exciting, and it just feels like the first book all over again.<br /><br />I'm really sorry to write this review- I wish I wasn't. The first book was a MASTERPIECE. Sure the concept wasn't the most original but it was a fun read and had me on the edge of my seat. Tons of suspense and excitement was in the book, likeable characters, and a good ending that had us excited for book two.<br /><br />Whereas this... what happened? Did Collins get really bored while writing and just decide to fill the pages with enough filler so that a book could be released?

Tons of suspense and excitement was in the book, likeable characters, and a good ending that had us excited for book two.<br /><br />Whereas this... what happened? Did Collins get really bored while writing and just decide to fill the pages with enough filler so that a book could be released? Did that also mean turning characters like Peeta into a sociopath, and turning Katniss into a whiny and angsty ditz? Did it also mean just not editing?

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I had enjoyed Dan Brown's other two books Di Vinci Sode and Angels & Demonds they both kept you turning the pages. The Lost Symbol has been a disappointment to me it is slow to get started and I find it fragmented. I bought it when it first came out and it is still not completly read. For me it doesn't hold my interest. I am 35% into it so hopefully it will get better.

0385504225|3.0|Symbologist Robert Langdon is once again called out on a mission, but this time it seems for an innocuous reason. Of course, it can't be, or there would be no new novel. There is not much new here, other than the setting in DC and its monuments. Langdon is plunged into a maelstrom of a hunt for a deranged, sadomasochistic villain who is close to learning the Masonic secret of the universe and will probably use it for no good. Because \\"symbologism\\" is such an intellectual topic, every time a new clue pops up, it's necessary for Langdon to run a mini seminar, which breaks into the action and the tension. As usual, his cohort on this wild chase is an attractive, brainy woman, but at least in this go-round, she's middle aged like Langdon.<br /><br />If I hadn't already read Da Vinci and Angels, I'd probably have enjoyed Symbol more than I did. This book is better than most of the clones cranked out by others have been, Langdon is a very engaging protagonist, and lots of the material he deals with is fascinating. For that reason, I was tempted to rate it 4 stars, but settled for three.  But I do hope that Brown breaks out of this mold next time around.

B002XTBE6K|3.0|I didn't think this version of 'Emma' nearly so good as the one starring Gwyneth Paltrow. The problem, for me, lay in the casting of Emma herself. The actress portrays her a bit like a first year undergrad. just arrived at college...all excitement, gossip, giggliness, and (to my mind) lacking a little depth. She also looks like a first year undergrad. just arrived at college! Lacking grace and poise. For me, Emma is far more self-assured and haughty, and I think Paltrow captures her character far better. I was also not in love with Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley, though he is better cast than Emma, and brings some gravitas to the proceedings. But I didn't really believe in his love for her...she's just too irritating (!), unlike the Emma in the book.
0446567337|3.0|\\"Dear John\\" is your typical sappy-love story. The book is very entertaining but it isn't anywhere as memorable as \\"The Notebook\\".      If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan there is no doubt that you will love this book. It has the same way of drawing you into to as the other novels. However, \\"Dear John\\" doesn't have as much of the love-ey details that the other novels do which makes it not as memorable.    Dear John is a quick read. This love story is about an army sergeant who falls in love on one of his leaves from the army. Then 9/11 comes around and changes everything for them. This novel takes you through their journey of love and what true love can endures.     Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking into some light reading. But if you are looking for a big tear jerker or a novel that once you put it down think \\"wow, that was a good book\\" you might want to look for a different Nicholas Sparks book.
0553382152|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS SIMPLY AMAZING! I HONESTLY COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! BETTY EDDIE DID AN AMAZING JOB IN WRITING HER NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE! THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY A MUST READ!
B0025KVLU6|2.0|They had a chance here (hear) to make this better than the original CD release but instead of remastering the multitrack tapes they chose to send the original two track master through a modern AD converter and call it good. So the bass is a little better, but that's about it. They could have cleaned up the individual tracks and really made a difference with \\"The Beatles\\" but they didn't.   The mid period albums have shown the greatest improvement from remastering. Revolver is the stand out.  Overall I'd say that the remastering  effort come's up short of expectations.  .
B002U6CJCO|2.0|Who ever wrote this screen play, didn't see the first two movies.  His character in this movie was screwed-up.  Why was he being reintroduced back into society again? This movie could of picked-up after the 2nd movie.  He could have been asked by  the government for help, because of his past encounters with his two adversaries?
B0026P3G12|5.0|I anxiously awaited the release of this album as all of the TV snippets showed Susan to be a wonderful singer. The album did not dissapoint as it contained a myriad of songs which demonstrated her range and overall abilities. This is a MUST Have if you enjoy music.

B002C6A6N6|4.0|I loved this tv show as a kid and was excited to start watching them again. These seasons were great! The extra features could use a little work, but if you like the show it's a great buy! Much cheaper than I saw the entire seasons in stores.
B0017CW5J4|3.0|First off, this Blu Ray looks and sounds great.  Likewise, it contains exactly what it advertises- the touring, \\"Megastar Live\\" Blue Man Group show.  The extras alone are worth the price of this disc.    Where I was very disappointed is that in translating Blue Man Group from the 'installed' shows in small theaters to a touring production for a large-capacity stadium, much of the comedy, charm, and excitement has been lost from the original.  The result is a perfectly cromulent movie of a (fairly generic) rock concert performance, with about 15 minutes of really good Blue Man Group material scattered in.    If you haven't seen Blue Man Group live in one of the cities where it plays all the time, you may not know what I'm talking about.  But if you have seen Blue Man Group in NY, Chicago, Vegas, etc, be aware that this concert tour is a completely different show, with very little of the physical comedy and props, and almost exclusively BMG as accompaniment to a very large rock band complete with vocalists.  With the exception of 2-3 tracks, the music is much different and (IMO) not nearly as good.  If, like me, you are looking to relive that show: look elsewhere.
031606792X|3.0|I loved Twilight! I became even more involved with the characters and could not put down New Moon or Eclipse (I read them both in one weekend). Unfortunately, Breaking Dawn just did not do the same for me. I actually enjoyed the first two parts (this is a three part book). The last part was kind of blah-I didn't feel the connection to the characters and honestly I only finished because I had put in so much time with these characters I felt like I at least needed to read to the very end. Otherwise, I would have put this book down. It kind of reminds me of movies that have sequels. The first movie is great-the second and third might be able to stand on their own-after that it goes down hill. I was hoping for much more! Oh well-I still loved the first 3 books and cannot wait until Eclipse is in theaters.
0385342020|5.0|I've read all(almost all) of Kinsella books and this one is my number two choice after Shopaholic. \\"Twenties Girl\\" is an uplifting, funny, good spirited book! i couldn't stop readying it for 2 days! The best part of it that you until the end don't know what's going on :) Lara is the main character and she resembles Shopaholic by being kind, funny, warm, adventurous, etc.. i highly highly recommend this book! I wasn't a big fan of \\"can you keep a secret?\\" or \\"the undomesticated Goddess\\". those books are good, but they didn't make me to flip one page after another... \\"Twenties Girl\\" is a must read if you don't feel lucky enough or stuck in a bad relationship or stuck with a horrible job.. trust me this is the best antidepressant :) This is one of the most uplifting, inspiring books i've read! If you didn't have the best experience with anything after Shopaholic, this is the book that will change your view. Tally-ho! and, good luck reading and enjoying swizzle stick with this book
B00000IFWE|5.0|I have always loved this album, especially the title track \\"Echo\\".  Thank you Tom!
B0029O08WA|3.0|The reviews I am reading are older, and I am just a newcomer to the Twilight phenomenon, and now a fan of the movie's soundtracks.  However, I bought the original soundtrack from movie one two months ago, and play it every day and have not gotten tired of it yet.  When I play the songs, I remember the scenes they belong to and because I love these movies, it makes me feel good to hear the music from these scenes because they arranged the music to fit so well.  It is impossible for me to imagine the Cullens playing baseball without the Muse song with it.  The song fit the scene perfectly.  As for the New Moon soundtrack, I am fairly disappointed.  I only like about 4 of the songs, the rest blend into nothingness.  I cannot remember their tune or words within minutes after hearing them.  One that I like is Monsters, because it was played when Edward was walking through the school parking lot toward Bella, sexy as ever and the music fits.  Also the song Possibility, very strong and also a perfect fit for when Bella is suffering her loss, it pulls you into what she is feeling.  Soooo different is the sound of Hearing Damage, used for the scene when the wolves are chasing Victoria, I love the unique sound and again, the song belongs there.  I also favor Roslyn, another unique song.  But that's it.  Not enough for me to want to spend full price for the CD, so I will buy a used copy at Amazon.  I do want the ones I like.  I really appreciate the fact that I would probably not ever have heard these songs without getting into the Twilight craze, and I am 60 years old!  So wonderful to have a great love story, we have all been waiting too long since the last one.  I did not get into Twilight's saga because I thought it was a teeny-bopper type movie, but decided to rent it one day just to see why it was so popular with such staying power, but the director of the first movie added cool stuff(like the floor ripping apart in the fight scene, wow!) and more humor and made Edward even more charming and sexy than the book did. How can we not be taken over. Hey, why isn't Robert Pattinson nominated as Best Actor for an Academy Award, and Taylor Laurent best supporting actor?!  Write to the Academy!!   Oh, also once upon a time, my teenage son, at the time, dragged me into Lord of the Rings too, and I became a bigger fan of that series than he was.  So do not pre-judge the media info or friend's opinions, go see it or hear it for yourself, then see if it fits you. As always, it is wonderful there is something for everyone, showing we are unique individuals unto ourselves, so do not criticize someone who does not like what you do.  Thank God there is enough variety for us all to enjoy. So live long and prosper, oh yeah, I love that series too.  I am having so much fun in my old youth.  Thanks for listening to my opinions and views.
1594481717|5.0|My boss made us read this for work, and I was not excited about it.  However, once I got into it, this book grew on me.  Twice now I have lent this book to a friend and not gotten it back.  So, this will be my third copy.  I read it again each time.
B0020EK4QY|5.0|It still never ceases to amaze me how this high-spirited action-packed gem escaped me for all these years. My earliest recollection of this film is when I was still in grammar school catching the trailer's most infamous and notorious Harrison Ford moment when he quotes, \\"Get off my plane\\"!. (Priceless) Now, after all of these years have passed I can at least say that this film did not disappoint as the solid acting and fast paced action held my attention throughout the film in it's entirety. Upon viewing this film in the Blu-Ray format it made me regret not seeing it in theaters in a sense. On a more positive note, this blu-ray disc truly utilizes it's full potential of technology; moreover, it's patriotic epic score composed by the one and only Jerry GoldSmith which is also accompanied by a great sounding lossless audio track will really satisfy the home theater buffs. On an even more positive note, I feel this Blu-Ray disc was not far off or short for that in matter in delivering a true realistic theater experience because it was quite superb on many levels. I will elaborate more on these technical specs later but for now I will give a very brief summary here.<br /><br />President Marshall, played by a more youthful looking and middle-aged (Harrison Ford) is held hostage along with his family and staff members on Air Force One after American Special Forces capture general Rodek who is the leader of Kazakhstan. President Marshall leaves a gorgeous and enormous looking Moscow dinner hall after delivering a very brief subdued and yet powerful speech concerning terrorism and foreign policy. Upon boarding the plane we are introduced with Ivan Korshunov who is played by the versatile and ever so impressive (Gary Oldman) While Air Force One is in flight, the audience discovers a mole in the secret service that is able to board Ivan and his other supportive terrorists companions. The secret service wastes no time in starting the bloodshed as he fires two bullets into twocabinet member's heads while they were discussing and briefing on important foreign policy matters. Soon the trails of a smoke grenade released by the secret service man signal Ivan and his ultra radical friends to unleash hell on the president and everyone else on the plane; and, that is exactly what they do because they are incredibly vengeful, bitter and quite keen on releasing General Radek.<br /><br />Since we are dealing with Blu-Ray technology I always feel it is appropriate and mandatory to analyze and review the technical specs because that is what we are paying top exorbitant dollar for right? If we weren't receiving an upgrade we might as well be buying VHS right?<br /><br />Well I am astounded to announce that, Blu-Ray fans won't be disappointed in this department either because the picture and sound looks and feels incredibly sharp, precise and most importantly very consistent. Despite the film's age, this disc completely revives and revamps it to a more recent looking film even with the sparse and light 90's grain subtlety prevalent throughout. Fortunately, this minor set back hardly retracts or dilutes any of the overall quality of this pristine transfer. More importantly, flesh tones are smooth and detailed throughout; hair and fabric emit some fine detail particularly in the darker interior shots of the control panel sequences. The blue colored control panel scenes are quite remarkable in the sense that it really enhances facial hair and flesh tone depth to a more elevated level of clarity in any parts of the film. Personally, no other scene compares to this high level of detail in my opinion. This attribute is more specifically shown when Gary Oldman is losing his patience when he frustratingly articulates his demands to the vice president with impunity and anger. Apart from the control panel scenes, the rest of the film does not fail to deliver in expressing some vibrantly smooth scenes in the conference rooms, bag storage area as well as the smaller private rooms (Bathroom, lounge rooms). The majority of the film takes place in the interior of the plane during the night with some interwoven scenes of the white house conference rooms so you will have to keep this in mind in order to regulate any misguided expectations. (In terms of settings, not an entire amount of variety here)<br /><br />The Sound is excellent, as the flawless lossless 5.1 audio will give all your speakers quite a bit of attention; the dialogue is crisp, articulate, clean and very pleasing. I was able to make out every spoken word without any complications. You will truly appreciate the opening-firing scene at the headquarters in Kazakhstan when general Rodek is captured. Moreover, AK-47's, Mp5 and Mp5k's fire and pierce with unbelievable force and dominance, but that's not even the bread and butter here folks. The automatic sub-machine guns truly immerse you in its breath taking firepower during the first plane shootout when the terrorists kill the majority of the President's staff on board. Listen carefully to the bullets ricocheting off metal stairs or penetrating through bathroom doors. I fully appreciated the gunfire sounds in the bag storage area where President Marshall hides; it is quite impressive and mesmerizing actually. One will also quickly observe how much attention is given to the sub-woofer and rear channel speakers during the exterior night shots of the plane in fight; engines will roar loudly and thoroughly producing a strong vibration in any floor of your house. As a result, this creates a very strong acoustical sound range leading the front channel speakers and gradually dissolving to the rear. The introduction of the F-16 fighter jets following Air Force One leaves no speaker unscathed; the incessant accelerating engine power might cause one to grip on to their seats. (Well, at lease for me it did) These types of aerial vehicular sounds are nicely calculated in between scenes of dialogue and dominate the last half-hourof the film. Even though I have never seen this film on standard dvd I feel it is appropriate and safe to say that this is a serious upgrade for home theater fans. Although I wouldn't say this is an outstanding Blu-Ray film, I will say it is a solid one because it delights and pleases wherever possible. In that regard, it is worth the purchase.<br /><br />In regards to the acting, Harrison Ford Fans or in my case die-hard Gary Oldman fans will be impressed here. A multi-talented and quite younger Gary Oldman emits a more vengeful and retrained type of villain here as opposed to some of the former impulsive, unbalanced psychotic characters he plays. His anger is explosive and expected when provoked and his calmness is professional when in control; he practically has zero empathy for anyone on board as he kills relentlessly with his crew. Harrison Ford, on the other hand, plays a very likeable president; his assertiveness and confidence in times of panic and danger will definitely satisfy his plausibility as an authority figure as well as a favorable president. Besides the main actors, Glenn Close ( The Vice president) along with William H. Macy and Wendy Crewson (the first lady) are serviceable to say the very least.<br /><br />In conclusion, Air Force One will definitely please most fans of far-fetched action packed high explosive films while simultaneously satisfying the technical crowd who thoroughly enjoy seeing their films being treated in a careful and respectful manner.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I think the first time I ever saw this movie was when I was eleven or so, long before the DVD format was even conceived. My dad borrowed this movie on VHS from a friend and subsequently copied it for our own viewing pleasure. Quite apart from the fact that the main movie disk features two movie tracks, one with superior sound quality and even slightly different narration from Michael Palin, there's also a French language track which I watch for just as many laughs as the English ones despite not speaking a word of French myself. And then of course there are two commentary tracks from the various Pythons, minus Graham Chapman for obvious reasons. The story is often way over the top but what else did you expect from the Pythons? Favorite scenes of mine are Arthur's encounter with the Black Knight, the plague scene, the self-abusive St. Benedictine monks, The Tale of Sir Robin, the Knights of Ni (both encounters), and of course Tim the Enchanter and the Bridge of Death. The Special Features disk includes such gems as a documentary explaining how one can obtain and use one's own coconuts for use in fake horse riding and, my personal favorite, a snippet, narrated by Palin if I'm not mistaken, explaining in gory detail how one can sing along with the chant of the St. Benedictine Monks (see the review title), by explaining the proper technique to whack oneself over the head with the DVD box. All in all I'm glad I bought this.
0810993139|5.0|My son is 9 and would, quite honestly, do anything under the sun to avoid reading.  I don't know what sparked me to buy this book other than the title being cute, but it was the smartest thing I did.  My son picked it up and immediately took to it.  What impressed me was that he actually read the whole thing within a day or two and was excited.  He would actually take the time to talk about it to me and my husband.  How great is that?! He then went to the library to find the other books and asked me to buy the ones he couldn't find.  He has now read them all.  My only problem now is...now what?!  What do I get him interested in next to keep this flow of reading going.  So for those of you who are looking for a book for a kid that hates to read...this is your book.  Just be prepared to buy the whole series!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This will be short and to the point. If you have a wild imagination, this is the movie to watch. It takes you to another life and world you can only dream of. Being that man destroys everything on planet earth, this movie shows that only people from another planet can appreciate and value true nature. The graphics were wonderful and the acting was phenomenal and believable. It was a very long movie, and yet still I wanted more....A +++
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Ok so i was expecting an Alien rip off. I got something else. The main charactor was the best lead i have seen since Avatar in Wizards. hes a charactor who you get his intentions but you dont realy care for cause he is kind of usless till the end. some other charactors where thrown in for meat for the grinder and for a nice ass. Denis Quade, like samuel l. they put him in every thing...Legion? but any way the *Spoiler* mutants were cool but reminded me of the cave men bat things in the Descent. big sets and realy dark lighting and some fun twists make for a good sci fi movie, but you cant expect to much when it has paul ws andersons backing behind it. i mean look what he did to avp.

I thought for a minut i was watching something from the creator of ninja scroll. this was a movie, man this was entertaining. blood, awsome f/x, good script good acting, and there is a little somthing in there for you female friend too. this was in all honesty...the s!@t.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I already had this title on standard DVD (single disc), but I couldnt pass up the opportunity to get this on Blu-ray when Amazon dropped it to 11.99.  I wasnt going to replace any of my standard DVD discs with blu-ray versions as the upconversion displays them well enough. But upon seeing Batman Begins in blu-ray, I was confident that the 12.00 was worth it.  Excellent 5-star transfer.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|do not watch if you want a historical movie. watch if you love QT! this is one of his best, actually yeah no i was right the fisrt time. its long and awsome. it builds so much suspence. i laughed i laughed i....hm. this movie was funny and it was bloody and the charactors where awsome and you cant realy say to much cause i dont want to ruin the movie for you. but get the 2 disc, its worth it.
B000002UAX|4.0|Don't let the minimalism of the all white album cover fool you. The content is anything but that.<br /><br />What a prolific album and musical group. Their hiatus in India brought new found awareness to their writing and creativity. So much so that they ended up making the album a two record set. The content was so extensive and fresh that they didn't want to leave anything out. Some very raunchy and rough rock-and roll (ie: \\"Why don't we do it in the road\\" which is one of my least favorites on the album and \\"Helter Skelter\\")to 1920's Vaudeville (ie: \\"Honey Pie\\")not to be confused with \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" which is nothing more than a 52 second dity of scales. Yet the beatles somehow make the most simplest melodys and hooks sound great. This album contains ballads (ie: \\"The Continuing Story of Bugalow Bill\\" and \\"Rocky Racoon\\") and some country. Yes, Beatles play crountry ie: \\"Don't Pass Me Buy\\" a la Ringo.<br />Some Blues \\"Yer Blues\\", a mix of a lot of fun songs \\"Obla De Obla Da\\", and what would the Beatles be without their Love songs: \\"Julia\\", \\"I Will\\" (my personal favorite).  With so much content the album still manages to have some sort of cohesiveness. They shared their personal lives with us through their music.<br /><br />Political statements with \\"Revolution\\", \\"Blackbird\\" and Harrison's \\"Piggies\\" and their addictions with drugs, ie: \\"Happiness is a warm gun\\", \\"Everyone's got something to hide except for me and my monkey\\" and if you want some fun, take Ob-la-de, La-da.  Ob-la-de, Ob-la-da is also asking you to see things from the other side as our rolls in life change. The psycadelic and erie \\"Glass Onion\\" does the same in a mix of political statements (see how the other half lives) and their own lives. Let's all look through a glass onion.<br /><br />I think that what the Beatles had that no other group has been able to accomplish is to get to the roots of Rock and Roll.  Blues, Country, and Jazz = Rock and Roll.  And they don't forget that! With the likes of \\"Birthday\\" and their own tribute to the Beach Boys with \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\"  As a matter of fact, i originally thought it was the Beach Boys when it fist came out.  This CD has it all!  Listen for the classical strings they add to their songs.<br /><br />My original white album has the ware and tear of endless hours of listening fun. And it has the scratches to prove it! With this CD i hear much more than i ever knew was there. So i'm experiencing this album all over again. But it does seem a little forced by the computer age. The cleanliness of the music makes it sound too contrived.  That's my own personal feeling.  There's something about siting on the floor crossleg and going through the album's paraphanailia while it's playing on a stero phonograph that is missed these days. Good luck trying to play the end of \\"I'm so tired\\" backwards to hear john say \\"Paul is dead man\\". LOL  Why didn't they make a seperate section on the CD for that kind of stuff, that would be really cool, all cleaned up, we'd be able to clearly hear what john said.  Or maybe the mysterious words should probably stay that way.<br /><br />Overall the CD is great! There's a little documentary about them which is nice but i thought it could have been more detailed, longer, and more creatively done.  But that is a minor setback compared to the content of this massive collection of creativity. I like it better than Sgt. Pepper, because its raw and not as finely finished as St, Pepper was.  But they were always about change and moving foward. And that they did.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy \\"The Beatles\\"ute to the Beach Boys with \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\"  As a matter of fact, i originally thought it was the Beach Boys when it fist came out.

0743571975|2.0|To each his own.  If you can bare the sound of the reader's voice and monotone intonation then this is a good audiobook.  Otherwise you will find that you cannot focus on the material because of the strange voice.  It's not the monotone quality that bothers me the most... but there seems to be a nervousness and almost whininess- something very unpleasant about the voice used to read this.  For me it was like nails on a chalkboard and it literally brought chills up my spine listening to him.  I can't focus on the actual material like this.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Pixar films has done it again! Released in 2007 and directed by Brad Bird, \\"Ratatouille\\" is just another film to add to the \\"five star\\" list. With creative animation and inspiring, rich, and universal themes, this movie has something for the whole family!  The story begins with a rat named Remy from the country-side of Paris who has big dreams of becoming a master gourmet chef. Having been raised by a typical, non-chalant, garbage looting rat family, Remy realizes he is different from the others, so he sets out to pursue his dream. This dream of becoming a master gourmet chef takes Remy on a wild adventure with many twists and turns along the way. His greatest adventure, though, is seeking to live above the status quo; he steps away from the world of the conventional and ordinary into a world of uncertainty and risk.       Remy is drawn to his passion by his own palate. After finding a cookbook by the famous French chef Auguste Gusteau and believing his famed motto \\"anyone can cook\\", Remy seeks to find a restaurant that will let him do just that. With little luck, Remy stumbles into Gusteau's restaurant and encounters Linguini, the restaurant janitor, but there's a catch: Linguini can't cook. By striking a deal with Linguini, Remy's dream comes true, but not in a \\"happily ever after\\" kind of way. What happens next is rather clever and comical. Remy houses himself in Linguini's chef hat, making Linginui's every move look like that of a puppet. By twisting and turning pieces of Linguini's hair, Remy creates delicious dishes. Not only is Remy a huge asset to Lingini's success in the kitchen, but the sous-chef Colette cannot be forgotten. Colette and Remy become rivals, both vowing to fight for Linguini's allegiance, but in the end, they both come out on the winning side.       Not only is Remy's greatest goal on the line in this movie, but the sacred heritage of Gusteau, whose restaurant is on a downslide, is as well. Part of the problem for the restaurant is thatGusteau's descendant Skinner takes over and uses Gusteau's name and reputation in order to market frozen dinners. This soon changes when it is discovered that Linguini is in fact Gusteau's son and he, along with the help of Remy and Colette, seeks to take back the restaurant for the sake of Gusteau. In doing so, Linguini, with the help of Remy guiding his puppet like moves, recreates classic recepies with artistic implementation. The culmination of it all takes place when Ratatouille is prepared for a food critic. After an agonizing visit from the critic, the three characters are scared as to what may appear in the newspaper the following day, but to their surprise it gets rave reviews. Mr. Ego, the food critic, sums up the movie very well when he says, \\"Not everyone can be a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.\\"       As a viewer sits and watches this movie, there is one main theme that can be seen and taken away. The theme to be noted is the moral conflict of family commitment versus individual aspiration. Throughout the entire movie, Remy struggles to understand his identity as both a part of his family and a part of himself; one part of him is telling him to forget about his dream and follow his family, while the other part cries for him to embrace his passion and go for his goal. The lesson that Remy learns in the end is that he can do both. This lesson speaks to culture today because it allows us to see that life isn't always all about the individual; there are others to consider, too, and when this happens, success is achieved. Remy learned that sometimes the biggest things in life aren't easy or free, but he also learned that he couldn't achieve his dream alone. As a culture with a firm belief in individualism, this movie speaks volumes to the old saying, \\"there's strength in numbers.\\"
B001TD1XWG|1.0|Please believe me, I am not saying this is one of the worst albums ever made because I'm a Wayne hater.  I really do like Wayne as a rapper.  But this album is just plain messy and should never have been made.    The concept for this album clearly came about while Wayne was on an extended weed, ecstasy, and syrup binge, and he truly believed that he could become the next big rock star. He couldn't have been more wrong.  There are some artists that can expand beyond their original area of expertise and become successful in other artistic endeavors (Will Smith and Jamie Foxx for example). Wayne is not one of these artists.    Everything about this album just doesn't work.  The music and lyrics are the embodiment of the most obvious of rock cliches, the mixing and sequencing are beyond sloppy, and Wayne's auto-tune-aided \\"singing\\" is downright horrible.  Wayne decided to take the most superficial elements of mainstream modern rock radio, puree them in a blender, and record the result.  Except instead of a delicious smoothie we're left with a glass of vomit.    Rebirth is an embarrassment, for the listener and especially for Wayne.  This is truly one of those \\"WTF was he THINKING???\\" moments that comes around every few years when a successful artist vastly overestimates his abilities. It is a disturbing example of what can happen when an artist becomes delusional to the point of borderline psychosis and is given free reign to unleash his confused, drug-induced ramblings on the public.    Rebirth does have one redeeming quality, however.  There is the William Hung novelty factor of listening to this.  The album that is so horrendous that it becomes comical.  Listening to this album, I couldn't help but laugh and laugh HARD.  Rebirth would fare much better as a comedy album, and it should be marketed as such.  The novelty factor is what elevates Rebirth from 0 stars to 1 star.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|Well what can I say... I like the movie the first time around.  I was expecting some better quality on the picture but I guess since it was not filmed with HD (BluRay) cams I was expecting too much  Overall made for a good replacement for original Matrix. BTW I used a Samsung Player and a Mitsubishi 73\\" HD DLP for playback
0143117025|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is a series of mystery stories set in the late 19th century. The main character is Sherlock Holmes, a detective who lives in London. In each of the stories he solves a mystery. For example, he solves mysteries about blackmail, murder, robbery, and deceit. He is very observant which allows him to find clues that others miss. The book is narrated by Dr Watson ( Sherlock's best friend and colleague), who helps Sherlock on every adventure.<br /><br />  If you are still reading this, then it is probably a book that you will enjoy. When you read it you will find suspense at every turn, plus it doesn't have all the nonsense that most modern literature has since it was written in1892.
B000KX0IOK|1.0|I, like another viewer, found this movie \\"reprehensible\\".  If the \\"teacher\\" had any morals, any courage, he would have voluntarily left the classroom at the beginning of the film. That would have been proper, and it would have kindly ended this movie.
B00354Y9ZU|1.0|I'm really stunned by Seth's lack original thoughts. Nothing in this book is unique in terms of challenging the landscape. He seems hell bent on communicating like a cheap version of Tom Peters. Tom and others have written on this topic for many years with much more thought and charisma. A linchpin without values is a very dangerous thing my friends....
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This book always kept me interested, this is one of the best books i have ever read!
0312370849|5.0|I have always loved reading from an early age. From the Bopsy Twins, Nancy Drew right up to James Patterson and Mary Higgins Clark but never have I found an author who was able to put me into the body and mind of a 10 year old innocent child who lived through such upheaval for her entire cut-short life. I felt her pain and her fright and could not imagine myself having her courage. I couldn't put this book down. The author's way of bringing together two families from different backgrounds and joining them at the finish was so compelling that I cannot stop thinking about this story.<br />Bravo Tatiana!  I can't wait to read more of your novels.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This movie was absolutely hands-down the WORST rip-off I have ever seen. It seems to be squarely aimed at those who think The Hills is a \\"reality show\\". It was just so dumb and so horrible that words truly escape me. I want my money back, I want my time back, and anybody who told me this was a good movie has lost all their credibility. This movie is for 13 year old girls at slumber parties, and definitely not for anyone with an IQ over 95, or over the age of 21.<br /><br />They were trying to steal the magic from \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" which was, and forever will be, one of the best horror movies. People thought it was REAL, and that was what made the movie so deliciously frightening. This movie didn't have the same soul.<br /><br />DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT watch, buy or waste your time on this horrific and lame attempt at a horror movie.
B001B51B9M|5.0|The previous DVD releases of The Music Man were basically OK in terms of sound, color, brightness, and contrast. But MY! Did they ever mess up the picture with edge enhancement! I don't mean just a little ghost line to the right, but also to the left. At times, the \\"enhancement\\" made it difficult to make out facial details on a large-screen TV. My guess is that it was transferred using a 19\\" monitor from a distance of a couple of feet, where the enhancement wouldn't be as noticeable.    Fortunately all this video gunk is corrected in the Blu-Ray edition. The colors are bright, the sound noticeably better, and the movie just comes more alive in blu-ray.    But - there always seems to be a flip side. In this case it's noticeable in the opening train scene, where blue matte artifacts around people, and slightly off masking at the windows clearly shows that it was shot against a blue screen. But, what you see is what people saw in the theaters when it was released. If the artifacts didn't bother moviegoers at the time, they shouldn't really bother us in the present. Little glitches like this are just part of the technology available at the time, and shouldn't be used to rate the movie...    ...and I'm really not, just pointing out that seeing more can mean seeing more of the bad, as well as more than the good.    Aside from little things like this which caught my eye - and don't really bother me - I hope you'll consider picking up the best release of an old favorite. Improved sound, improved picture - what more could you want. I doubt it'll look better unless George Lucas gets involved in cleaning up the blue-screen artifacts. And who knows what he'd feel like adding!    Fun. A couple of hours well spent. And for me, a new appreciation of Hermione Gingold as Ms. Eulalie Shinn. Her looks and voice in \\"Pick a little\\" really steal the show, as she does in other scenes she's in.    It's hard not to enjoy such a high-spirited musical as this, end even harder not to like it in Blu-Ray. A real gem.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|Usually if a studio dumps a film into a handful of theaters with no press screenings, it means the movie is a dog. NOT SO with Carriers, a surprisingly good thriller about a handful of survivors driving across the desert after an unnamed pandemic has decimated the country. Chris Pine, Christopher Meloni, Piper Perabo and Emily VanCamp all give very strong performances in this film, that although positioned as a horror film is really more a character study of what people are willing to sacrifice in order to survive. This movie is not filled with cheap direct to video tricks - there's no gratuitous violence, profanity or sex. Instead the film is unflinchingly bleak, well shot, face paced and filled with several quite poignant moments.
B0036HZEM8|5.0|In reply to the other reviewer...  Just so you know L.J. Smith is a woman, the initials L.J. stand for Lisa Jane.  There are other books in the sereies as well.  The published volume so far is titled The Vampire Diaries: The Return: Nightfall.  The Vampire Diaries: The Return: Shadow Souls is set to come out in March 2010 and the third volume will be titled The Vampire Diaries: The Return: Midnight.    But as far as the tv show itself it is very good in and of itself even though I wish they had done some things differently.
0099413140|5.0|This is a super sweet story.  I love it when this story comes up in the nighttime rotation with my two year old.  The clever story will be most meaningful to readers familiar with the Queen from some of the references, but otherwise is still a very delightful story for any little girl to enjoy.
B000NA28I4|3.0|What I liked about this story was how dazzlingly original the characters and plot elements were.  A young farmboy who finds a secret weapon and becomes the savior of the land?  A bearded wizard who guides him to maturity?  A spunky princess in need of rescuing?  A besieged group of good guys who triumph unexpectedly when all seems lost?  The henchman's evil right-hand man who is killed, beyond all hope, at the very last moment?<br /><br />Truly groundbreaking.
0061968579|1.0|Okay, maybe I am the only one who doesn't know this, but a graphic novel is a comic book! So now I am returning it and ordering the paperback.
B0006399FS|2.0|Really not very interesting at all. Socially conscious lyrics sans ooooomph. I really haven't liked much U2 has done since \\"Achtung Baby\\".
B002YICN74|4.0|This is a body of work that is far from perfect, but is ambitious in its scope.  The vocals of Nick Jonas are definitely reminiscent of his stated inspiration for this album, Prince.  However, many other artists seem to have influenced this album.  It pulls from a range of genres spanning from funk-blues to alternative rock.  And it reveals the unique stylings of a budding artist, and, if nothing else, his potential to thrive beyond the demographic to which he has been cast.  But something about the entire album comes of as disingenuous.  It's as if he is attempting to prove something instead of letting the music flow.    Nick Jonas is a talented vocalist, but this body of work comes off as forced.  However, I have no doubt that over time, the music will keep getting better.      It's definitely worth the listen, if nothing else.
0312360266|5.0|This book is the start of a remarkable series. I will admit that i actually had this book on my shelf for a little while before i read it. But hey in my defense i had just started school and Organic Chem was kicking my butt. Well over Christmas Break i started this book and i finished all six books whithin that week. I loved it and could not put it down. When i finshed this book i drove to Books A Million to pick up the other six. Hey i couldn't wait for it to come in the mail when i could just drive and pick it up. I will not reveal anything important(i got a comment the last time about my spoiler alert so you'll have to read the books), but what i will say is that this book holds a group of friends that will turn your world upside down. There will be crying, laughing (rib-cracking), yelling, and frustration throughout this book series. What it really boils down to is that you really, really, need to just pick a weekend or a day and start this book, because once you do it is guranteed that you will not be abloe to put the book down. Like i said i drove to Books A Million to buy the rest of the series and i have already pre-ordered the seventh book.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|It was an excellent item for this Christmas, I see it several times. Really good, Love it.
0440178002|5.0|Don't let the length of the book deter you from reading it.  I was highly engrossed in this novel, loving learning the culture and language, history, and courageousness of the characters of this book.  It made me want to go visit Japan and experience it for myself.
B001ECQ6PG|3.0|For 120 dollars you can enjoy all the high fidelity sound of vinyl, and portable design allows you to show it off to your friends.  I bought this because it seemed like a good deal, and for the most part, it was. Sound quality was nice, there's a variety of sound controlling knobs and output lines, and the vinyl-digital transfer wasn't too bad either.    My biggest problem: The platter and needle arm. Maybe I bought a defective model, but I found that the platter was slightly off-level, causing all of my records to skip (I tried this with my 33's, my 45's, and everything else in between with the same result). I wouldn't mind that too much if I could adjust the record arm to compensate for the fluctuations, but for $120 all I got was a plastic arm with no weights or counterweights to balance out the arm. I wound up taping a tube of chapstick near the cartridge, which worked for the most part, but even then the vinyl would skip from time to time, prompting me to weight it oh-so-slightly with my finger to keep it going. Needless to say, the extra weight won't help the life of your vinyls.    Another problem lies in the fact that the arm has no auto-return at the end of a side. This means that if you want to convert your vinyl library, expect to do so with an eye on the player at all times. The included software (EZ Vinyl Converter) works fine but lacks a lot of options (noise reduction would be nice) and the auto tracksplit feature only works with several seconds between tracks. That all can be avoided by using the included Audacity download, it's more complicated but worlds better than EZ. Also important to mention: The gain knob on the USB out line can be boosted unnecessarily high, but hits its lowest point still far higher than you'd want the gain set.    So, I'm returning my player. The sound is just fine through headphones,but the speaker is rather faint (my Grado SR-80i's were nearly as loud as the speaker at full blast). If you get a unit that works like it's supposed to and can deal with the Spartan design, then it's great for the price. But if you end up with something like mine, you may want to trade it in.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|A one star here -- or FIVE BLACK STARS for STAR BLECH !  (It's obvious why.)
B001AVCFJM|1.0|No actors no nothing. In a time, when titanic brought more idiots to the big screen shows the movie industry has not made a movie in about a half of a century. Pathetic, geared for retards.<br />Thank God for classic DVD's and old movies.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I never considered the writing of a review of a CD (or set of CDs) to be a daunting task.  Nonetheless, I have been sitting on the idea of writing this review (my first for Amazon) for some months now as I absorb these remasters, Mono and Stereo, and fully collect my thoughts on them.    The enormity of what the Beatles accomplished and their musical legacy have been well documented, and I will not presume to try to educate the reader.  My assumption is that if you are reading these reviews you already have a firm appreciation for the importance of the music contained on these discs and want to determine if these \\"new\\" remasters (they're already almost 5 months old) are worth buying.    The simple answer is a resounding yes.  If you are a fan of the Beatles, a fan of Pop music or just a fan of late 20th Century culture, these remasters are essential.  Even if you already own these recordings in one or another of their previously released forms you have never heard the music like this, and there are many earlier reviews posted here that detail all of the reasons why:  Improved sonics across the board.  Clarity.  Detail. Punch.  Dynamics.  The accolades read like a high-end speaker manufacturer's website.      There is really no way to describe in words the job that the engineering team did on these remasters - Clichéd as it sounds, you simply must hear them to believe them - and it should be underscored how fantastically they performed given the overwhelming task they were assigned: Take the canon of popular music, the foundation upon which all Pop since has been built, and improve it sonically whilst simultaneously leaving the original mixes intact.  And they did this brilliantly.    But that brings us to the not so simple answer.  Mono or Stereo?  Or Both?    But before I get to that I want to say a few words about the packaging of the remasters:    The Mono box is exquisite.  I can find no fault in either the decisions made about how to do the packaging or the production of the packaging.  The end product is truly befitting the music contained inside and the limited-edition nature of the set.   Five stars.  The Stereo box is a more pedestrian offering, but still impressive.  The individual packaging of the CD's is overall very good for the mass-produced nature of them.  There are some functional flaws as I see it, however, with the box containing them.  The shape of the box is unusual and does not conform to a standard size for CD's, so it either goes in a bookshelf or you remove the individual discs from it to put into your CD rack.  Which, on inspection, may not be a bad idea as the discs lay flat on top of each other inside the two sections of the box and are removed, en masse, using a fabric pull that is attached to the bottom of the box and hangs out the side.  So, for example, if you want to listen to Revolver (which is near the bottom of the top section) you tug on the fabric to pull everything in that section - from Please Please Me through Sgt. Pepper - out of the box, and then retrieve the disc you want to play.  Not at all efficient or easy.  The Stereo packaging gets only 3 stars.    So on to the question of which to buy, and as I said, not so simple.  Not so simple at all.    You see, despite the fact that Mono was the prevalent and preferred format for most of these releases at the time they were recorded, it remains a fact that the Stereo versions were originally released concurrent with the Mono and so we have two different but equally legitimate versions of most of these recordings.  In some cases three, but more on that later.  That being said, my goal here is to compare the Mono and Stereo versions side by side and offer my opinions so that, hopefully, you can make a marginally more informed decision about which set is right for you, or maybe you will feel that you really need to have both.  I'll go through them now and give a quick rating for each as we go, and suffice it to say that the Beatles music catalog, taken in whole, gets 5 stars and these reviews are strictly for the quality of the remasters vis-à-vis the original vinyl and '87 CD issues.  One caveat - I don't think the 5-star rating is comprehensive enough to really compare them side by side, but I will conform to this standard as it is the Amazon convention.  Off to the recordings:    Please Please Me  Mono: 5 stars Stereo: 3 stars  The stereo retains the hard panning of instruments left/vocals right.  But instruments and voices are more defined and have much more openness and bloom.  A vast improvement, however the Mono just kills it: here, the band is cooking.  This thing thumps and is an absolute revelation.  Where the Stereo is polite, the Mono shouts.  Where the Stereo purrs this one growls.  Mono is definitive for this album.    With The Beatles  Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 3 stars  Again the stereo has the hard panning, but the same attributes as PPM apply with overall improved sound.  The Mono version loses some of the immediacy you hear on PPM, and the band does not come across as strongly.  There is also a bit less definition between the instruments than on the stereo, but the Mono still easily wins.    A Hard Day's Night  Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 4 stars  With the advent of more sophisticated recording techniques, we now get to the point where we hear a more balanced stereo mix and begin to get some sound stage out of the recording.  Here, the distinctions are less clear between Mono and Stereo and both definitely have their strong points.  The stereo is sweeter and you can track individual instruments better while mono is more tightly layered and rocks a bit harder.  My overall nod goes to Stereo, but this one is very close.    Beatles For Sale  Mono: 3 stars Stereo: 4 stars  Most all of the comments regarding AHDN apply here, the most significant difference being a loss of midrange clarity and dynamics on the Mono version.  Both of these have a nice, round, tempered sound to them and it will come down to preference, but I think the space between the instruments on the stereo version gives it the edge.  Stereo wins.    Help!    Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 5 stars '65 Stereo: 4 stars  Of all of the recordings, Help! Is among the most transformed.  And we have the added bonus of the original 1965 stereo mix (contained on the mono disc) to make things even more interesting.  The Mono mix is a great improvement and has a lot of slam and power that didn't exist in this album before.  It is an electric blast to listen to at volume.   But what the Stereo mix lacks in force it more than makes up for in musicality and detail.  There is a groove to the whole album in stereo that is just a bit lacking in mono, and also better than the '65 stereo mix, which while a really nice curiosity, can't compete with the new (1987) mix for overall musicality.   Here, the stereo version is definitive.    Rubber Soul   Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 3 stars  '65 Stereo: 4 stars  Recording techniques couldn't quite keep up with the Beatles creativity, and on the stereo release of Rubbber Soul we are back to hard panning.  It's slightly distracting, but with this album it definitely doesn't take away from the listening experience. The vocals and instruments have a vibrancy and tactile \\"feel\\" that wasn't present on any previous Beatles album.  With the '65 Stereo mix (included in the Mono remaster disc) we get a slightly \\"softer\\" and more \\"delicate\\" presentation that on the '87 version.  This is the likely the best choice for rainy afternoon listening, and I think it is an improvement when it comes to stereo, but where Rubber Soul really shines is in Mono.  Here we start to understand what the fuss is about, and the mono version gives us a first taste of the remarkable dynamics and subtlety contained in much of the Beatles catalog.  The mono is the clear winner here.    Revolver   Mono: 5 stars Stereo: 5 stars  Both the Mono and Stereo are so strong as to make any comparisons essentially moot.  The main strength of the mono version is the weight of the mix and the overall power the band managed to get across in the recording.  The dynamic range is also intact here, so we get more emphasis of that power.  But at the same time, there seems to be more detail in the presentation of the instruments in the stereo version, and we start to get our first taste of swirling psychedelic soundspaces.  My subjective preference tends toward the stereo, but the truth is I can't get enough of either version.  A draw.    Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band Mono: 5 stars Stereo: 4 stars  What they've told you is true:  You haven't really heard Sgt. Pepper until you've heard it in mono.  Trust me, the stereo sounds great - fantastic, in fact, compared to the previous releases.  And there is definitely some merit to the swirling effects you get with stereo, but mono walks all over it.  This time it's all in the mix as sonically they are very similar. But this mono mix is astonishing and is without question the preferred version.   Mono is definitive.    Magical Mystery Tour  Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 4 stars  As an underrated gem in the catalog, not even conceived as a real album, I don't think this one has ever gotten the treatment it deserved, and the original release was horrible sounding.  Here we have a staggering improvement in both mono and stereo, on par with the quality of the Revolver remasters.  There is new found detail and emotion, and I find myself being drawn to this recording as if I had never heard it before.  The two versions are close, but despite some panning issues with the stereo, it exudes a warmth and sense of musical detail that I think put it slightly in front.  Stereo by a hair.    The Beatles (White Album) Mono: 5 stars Stereo: 3 stars  Both are improvements over the '87 CD release in sonics and musical detail, especially in the vocals, but in comparison the stereo seems only marginally improved, while the mono is another revelatory experience.   As amazing as the Sgt. Pepper mono mix is, this may be the most unexpected of the mono enlightenments.  I never really thought that The Beatles was inferior in either mixing or sound quality in its previous stereo releases and therefore wasn't necessarily looking forward to listening to this mono mix as much as some of the others - in fact, it was the last of all of the albums that I played.  Big mistake.  This thing is just plain amazing, and it is as all over the board as the music on it.  One moment huge sounding and the next stripped down and quiet.  Everything is better, everything is amazing.  Mono in a landslide.    Yellow Submarine  2 stars  Never mixed for mono, this is also the odd man out.  Not a \\"real\\" Beatles album, not all-new material, no real purpose assigned to this other than a possible cash-grab.  But these are still Beatles songs, so by pop standards in general they are worth a listen if only for the historical perspective.  Here we don't get a huge sound quality improvement over previous releases, but it is packaged nicely and makes the Stereo box set complete.    Abbey Road   4 stars  A stereo-only release, so of course that's all I will deal with here.  This would have easily earned a 5 if compared only against the previous CD version, however I am also comparing these remasters to vinyl, and in this case specifically to the early `80's Mobile Fidelity release.  Here, they have managed to finally capture much of the essence of that seminal release and this is an absolutely fantastic remaster.  One of the best remastering results in the set, in fact.  A must-hear.    Let It Be   4 stars  Another stereo-only release.  Much more detail has been brought out in this version and it is finally superior to the original vinyl, but again the overall rating is hamstrung because in comparison to Let It Be...Naked, we just don't have the same level of involvement and musicality.  Also, depending on your viewpoint, Naked may just be the definitive version of this album, leaving this to the purists and completists.  I personally fall into this category, but I have indeed enjoyed listening to this remaster due to its overall quality and historical significance.    Mono Masters/Past Masters Mono: 3 stars Stereo: 5 stars  No, they are not identical in track listings, but the idea behind them remains the same and they contain largely the same material.  In either case, these are vital to telling the whole Beatles story and should be evaluated in context.   Personally, I prefer to listen to the songs with the album release from their era and this helps me to appreciate them more.    From the point of view of the remastering, the same care has been applied to these singles as to the albums themselves, and my thoughts on the quality of the job done are much the same as those for their contemporary album releases.  All in all, these are standout, but the stronger track listing and overall quality of the included material make the Stereo the better listen, and I would judge the stereo set to be essential.    So there you have them... I hope that this can be of help as you evaluate them yourself.  Taking a look, the final tally is as follows:  Of the 11 recordings that were mixed in both Mono and Stereo (including mono/past masters), I have entered a vote for 5 better in Mono, 5 better in Stereo, and 1 draw.   Then there are the three albums that were only released in Stereo, two of which you should also purchase if you choose the Mono box (Abbey Road and Let It Be).     So which would I recommend?  The Stereo box if you can buy only one.  For virtually all listeners in virtually all scenarios this set will serve them as well or better than the mono box.    That being said, if you have the means you really should think about acquiring both.  I bought both and I am very glad that I did.  I do prefer some of these recordings in mono (but I will also confess that I play the stereo versions almost exclusively when listening \\"casually\\" or whileworking and save the mono for critical listening) and it was worth it to have not just the recordings but the incredible packaging.    (One note about the hard-panned albums - It never really bothers me much when listening to vinyl, but I find it somewhat distracting with the CD releases.  I realized somewhere along the line in comparing them that it is because of the inherent crosstalk present when listening on a turntable vs. the absolute channel separation you get with a CD.  For this reason alone I \\"generally\\" prefer the Mono versions)
B00111YM5G|5.0|.... that the first time i watched it, i went out and bought it on DVD the next day. I dont do that with many movies. Some may slam this movie and say its been done befor or blah blah, but really, hasnt most every other movie that has been written? personally, i loved it, you might to. I havent enjoyed a movie this much in a long time, i think this one beat out underworld for me, it didnt drag at any point, kept me wanting more, cant wait for the next ones to come out (its ment to be a trilogy)
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I never considered the writing of a review of a CD (or set of CDs) to be a daunting task.  Nonetheless, I have been sitting on the idea of writing this review (my first for Amazon) for some months now as I absorb these remasters, Mono and Stereo, and fully collect my thoughts on them.  The full version of this review was posted under the Stereo box heading and includes thoughts on the stereo-only discs.    The enormity of what the Beatles accomplished and their musical legacy have been well documented, and I will not presume to try to educate the reader.  My assumption is that if you are reading these reviews you already have a firm appreciation for the importance of the music contained on these discs and want to determine if these \\"new\\" remasters (they're already almost 5 months old) are worth buying.    The simple answer is a resounding yes.  If you are a fan of the Beatles, a fan of Pop music or just a fan of late 20th Century culture, these remasters are essential.  Even if you already own these recordings in one or another of their previously released forms you have never heard the music like this, and there are many earlier reviews posted here that detail all of the reasons why:  Improved sonics across the board.  Clarity.  Detail. Punch.  Dynamics.  The accolades read like a high-end speaker manufacturer's website.      There is really no way to describe in words the job that the engineering team did on these remasters - Clichéd as it sounds, you simply must hear them to believe them - and it should be underscored how fantastically they performed given the overwhelming task they were assigned: Take the canon of popular music, the foundation upon which all Pop since has been built, and improve it sonically whilst simultaneously leaving the original mixes intact.  And they did this brilliantly.  But that brings us to the not so simple answer.  Mono or Stereo?  Or Both?    But before I get to that I want to say a few words about the packaging of the remasters:The Mono box is exquisite.  I can find no fault in either the decisions made about how to do the packaging or the production of the packaging.  The end product is truly befitting the music contained inside and the limited-edition nature of the set.   Five stars.    The Stereo box is a more pedestrian offering, but still impressive.  The individual packaging of the CD's is overall very good for the mass-produced nature of them.  There are some functional flaws as I see it, however, with the box containing them.  The shape of the box is unusual and does not conform to a standard size for CD's, so it either goes in a bookshelf or you remove the individual discs from it to put into your CD rack.  Which, on inspection, may not be a bad idea as the discs lay flat on top of each other inside the two sections of the box and are removed, en masse, using a fabric pull that is attached to the bottom of the box and hangs out the side.  So, for example, if you want to listen to Revolver (which is near the bottom of the top section) you tug on the fabric to pull everything in that section - from Please Please Me through Sgt. Pepper - out of the box, and then retrieve the disc you want to play.  Not at all efficient or easy.  The Stereo packaging gets only 3 stars.    So on to the question of which to buy, and as I said, not so simple.  Not so simple at all.    You see, despite the fact that Mono was the prevalent and preferred format for most of these releases at the time they were recorded, it remains a fact that the Stereo versions were originally released concurrent with the Mono and so we have two different but equally legitimate versions of most of these recordings.  In some cases three, but more on that later.  That being said, my goal here is to compare the Mono and Stereo versions side by side and offer my opinions so that, hopefully, you can make a marginally more informed decision about which set is right for you, or maybe you will feel that you really need to have both.  I'll go through them now and give a quick rating for each as we go, and suffice it to say that the Beatles music catalog, taken in whole, gets 5 stars and these reviews are strictly for the quality of the remasters vis-à-vis the original vinyl and '87 CD issues.  One caveat - I don't think the 5-star rating is comprehensive enough to really compare them side by side, but I will conform to this standard as it is the Amazon convention.  Off to the recordings:    Please Please Me  Mono: 5 stars Stereo: 3 stars  The stereo retains the hard panning of instruments left/vocals right.  But instruments and voices are more defined and have much more openness and bloom.  A vast improvement, however the Mono just kills it: here, the band is cooking.  This thing thumps and is an absolute revelation.  Where the Stereo is polite, the Mono shouts.  Where the Stereo purrs this one growls.  Mono is definitive for this album.    With The Beatles  Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 3 stars  Again the stereo has the hard panning, but the same attributes as PPM apply with overall improved sound.  The Mono version loses some of the immediacy you hear on PPM, and the band does not come across as strongly.  There is also a bit less definition between the instruments than on the stereo, but the Mono still easily wins.    A Hard Day's Night  Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 4 stars  With the advent of more sophisticated recording techniques, we now get to the point where we hear a more balanced stereo mix and begin to get some sound stage out of the recording.  Here, the distinctions are less clear between Mono and Stereo and both definitely have their strong points.  The stereo is sweeter and you can track individual instruments better while mono is more tightly layered and rocks a bit harder.  My overall nod goes to Stereo, but this one is very close.    Beatles For Sale   Mono: 3 stars Stereo: 4 stars  Most all of the comments regarding AHDN apply here, the most significant difference being a loss of midrange clarity and dynamics on the Mono version.  Both of these have a nice, round, tempered sound to them and it will come down to preference, but I think the space between the instruments on the stereo version gives it the edge.  Stereo wins.    Help!    Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 5 stars '65 Stereo: 4 stars  Of all of the recordings, Help! Is among the most transformed.  And we have the added bonus of the original 1965 stereo mix (contained on the mono disc) to make things even more interesting.  The Mono mix is a great improvement and has a lot of slam and power that didn't exist in this album before.  It is an electric blast to listen to at volume.   But what the Stereo mix lacks in force it more than makes up for in musicality and detail.  There is a groove to the whole album in stereo that is just a bit lacking in mono, and also better than the '65 stereo mix, which while a really nice curiosity, can't compete with the new (1987) mix for overall musicality.   Here, the stereo version is definitive.    Rubber Soul   Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 3 stars  '65 Stereo: 4 stars  Recording techniques couldn't quite keep up with the Beatles creativity, and on the stereo release of Rubbber Soul we are back to hard panning.  It's slightly distracting, but with this album it definitely doesn't take away from the listening experience. The vocals and instruments have a vibrancy and tactile \\"feel\\" that wasn't present on any previous Beatles album.  With the '65 Stereo mix (included in the Mono remaster disc) we get a slightly \\"softer\\" and more \\"delicate\\" presentation that on the '87 version.  This is the likely the best choice for rainy afternoon listening, and I think it is an improvement when it comes to stereo, but where Rubber Soul really shines is in Mono.  Here we start to understand what the fuss is about, and the mono version gives us a first taste of the remarkable dynamics and subtlety contained in much of the Beatles catalog.  The mono is the clear winner here.    Revolver   Mono: 5 stars Stereo: 5 stars  Both the Mono and Stereo are so strong as to make any comparisons essentially moot.  The main strength of the mono version is the weight of the mix and the overall power the band managed to get across in the recording.  The dynamic range is also intact here, so we get more emphasis of that power.  But at the same time, there seems to be more detail in the presentation of the instruments in the stereo version, and we start to get our first taste of swirling psychedelic soundspaces.  My subjective preference tends toward the stereo, but the truth is I can't get enough of either version.  A draw.    Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band Mono: 5 stars Stereo: 4 stars  What they've told you is true:  You haven't really heard Sgt. Pepper until you've heard it in mono.  Trust me, the stereo sounds great - fantastic, in fact, compared to the previous releases.  And there is definitely some merit to the swirling effects you get with stereo, but mono walks all over it.  This time it's all in the mix as sonically they are very similar. But this mono mix is astonishing and is without question the preferred version.   Mono is definitive.    Magical Mystery Tour  Mono: 4 stars Stereo: 4 stars  As an underrated gem in the catalog, not even conceived as a real album, I don't think this one has ever gotten the treatment it deserved, and the original release was horrible sounding.  Here we have a staggering improvement in both mono and stereo, on par with the quality of the Revolver remasters.  There is new found detail and emotion, and I find myself being drawn to this recording as if I had never heard it before.  The two versions are close, but despite some panning issues with the stereo, it exudes a warmth and sense of musical detail that I think put it slightly in front.  Stereo by a hair.    The Beatles (White Album) Mono: 5 stars Stereo: 3 stars  Both are improvements over the '87 CD release in sonics and musical detail, especially in the vocals, but in comparison the stereo seems only marginally improved, while the mono is another revelatory experience.   As amazing as the Sgt. Pepper mono mix is, this may be the most unexpected of the mono enlightenments.  I never really thought that The Beatles was inferior in either mixing or sound quality in its previous stereo releases and therefore wasn't necessarily looking forward to listening to this mono mix as much as some of the others - in fact, it was the last of all of the albums that I played.  Big mistake.  This thing is just plain amazing, and it is as all over the board as the music on it.  One moment huge sounding and the next stripped down and quiet.  Everything is better, everything is amazing.  Mono in a landslide.    Mono Masters/Past Masters   Mono: 3 stars Stereo: 5 stars  No, they are not identical in track listings, but the idea behind them remains the same and they contain largely the same material.  In either case, these are vital to telling the whole Beatles story and should be evaluated in context.   Personally, I prefer to listen to the songs with the album release from their era and this helps me to appreciate them more.    From the point of view of the remastering, the same care has been applied to these singles as to the albums themselves, and my thoughts on the quality of the job done are much the same as those for their contemporary album releases.  All in all, these are standout, but the stronger track listing and overall quality of the included material make the Stereo the better listen, and I would judge the stereo set to be essential.    So there you have them... I hope that this can be of help as you evaluate them yourself.  Taking a look, the final tally is as follows:  Of the 11 recordings that were mixed in both Mono and Stereo (including mono/past masters), I have entered a vote for 5 better in Mono, 5 better in Stereo, and 1 draw.   Then there are the three albums that were only released in Stereo, two of which you should also purchase if you choose the Mono box (Abbey Road and Let It Be).     So which would I recommend?  The Stereo box if you can buy only one.  For virtually all listeners in virtually all scenarios this set will serve them as well or better than the mono box.    That being said, if you have the means you really should think about acquiring both.  I bought both and I am very glad that I did.  I do prefer some of these recordings in mono (but I will also confess that I play the stereo versions almost exclusively when listening \\"casually\\" or while working and save the mono for critical listening) and it was worth it to have not just the recordings but the incredible packaging.    (One note about the hard-panned albums - It never really bothers me much when listening to vinyl, but I find it somewhat distracting with the CD releases.  I realized somewhere along the line in comparing them that it is because of the inherent crosstalk present when listening on a turntable vs. the absolute channel separation you get with a CD.  For this reason alone I \\"generally\\" prefer the Mono versions)
B003204MQS|5.0|I like movies that seem real. This one seemed real because it used no background music [just like Blair Witch Project] and had a small cast of ordinary people. Like the Algernon Blackwood classic story The Willows, this tale of the supernatural gradually led to it's climax, which is a thing I like. The Invisible Nemesis from Beyond used to be a premise of stories of the supernatural a hundred years ago, but very few films are done these days to depict such a thing.    I believe in everything, especially things I cannot prove and cannot observe directly. This film deals with such subject matter. A nice exploration into the quantum world where impossibility is impossible if it has an probability at all.
B001G9FFM2|5.0|The live dvd(11 tracks i think) and two bonus songs(Maiden and Metallica covers) are worth it alone!
1401323820|4.0|I was really looking forward to reading `Heat Wave' but when I finished I wasn't that impressed but on the other hand, I wasn't very disappointed either.    The story was okay, no new element, no oh-wow moment, no unexpected twists or turns. The characters were lacking. They weren't bad but that little spark that would have made them great characters was missing.    The story followed to a logical ending and any person who has read their share of mysteries will figure it out.    The TV series works because of the characters, the way they interact. However, the book is not the actors, directors or other the people behind the scenes that make all the difference.     Just remember, don't expect a replay of the series, if you do, you'll be disappointed. Judge the book on it's on merits not as a TV series.    Would I recommend the book? Probably but then I don't expect everyone to have the same likes or dislikes as mine.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|So many items are useless without batteries, and they don't last forever.  So why am I surprised to find the batteries are dead in something?  Often it's an unusual one that requires a search through stores to find, like my flameless candles.  I'm so happy to find a place that has what I need - and  gets it to me fast.
B001KRVLCI|5.0|I have watched the movie before and was quite pleased with how quickly it was delivered, the fact that the packaging was adequate (proper protection without being bulky) and the features included on the DVD.  I would recommend this DVD sold by Amazon.
B002HNA9LS|5.0|This may be the single most incredible value I've ever seen on the web. Considering the selection of music, the performers, the recording quality and the packaging, you're getting what could be $500. worth of recordings for $70. or less. No MP3 download deal could come close. Every single album in this set is perfection. No amount of hype can do this set justice. You're buying essentially an entire history of music, a collection few others will have, immaculate performances, canonical works (and some lesser known gems). Take advantage of the plummeting prices in CD collections (you can't buy \\"used\\" MP3s) and go for it!
B000FBJF3M|5.0|i suprisingly liked this historical fiction novel.   when i started it was very dry (haha) and boring. but found myself liking it and taking it out more often. i do recommend this book and think it does, like the dramatic epruption, kick ash :)
B001TD1XWG|1.0|What is this? OMG im sorry but Lil Wayne is falling off. Somebody hit me up when the Carter 4 comes out, cause I enjoy rap IDK what this was. I can't stand when rapper turn into singers I just don't get it. O and whats make its worst he pushed the album back so many times and look at the outcome. If your a fan of Lil Wayne I don't blame you for supporting him, but if you are not a Lil Wayne fan don't buy this album. Prom Queen was wack and the new single On fire is worst.
1400052173|5.0|If you mention \\"HeLa cells\\" to most people, you are going to draw a blank look or a \\"what did you say?\\"  But HeLa cells are the basis for some of the most amazing science discovers in the field of molecular biology and medicine today.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot's work is not a dry review of what the cells are or how they were used.  Skloot uses this magnificent line of cells as the spring to dive into the live that created them, that of Henrietta Lacks, a black woman who ultimatly died from the cancer that was created by these same sells.<br /><br />Skloot digs deep into a life shrouded in mystery - a woman who was deeply loved and missed by her family members once she died, and the science industry that took her cells, propagated them in the name of scientific discovery, and then used and confused her family in the years afterward.  The poverty of Mrs. Lacks childhood, and her family plays a significant role in how communications and silence between blacks and whites, males and females, educated and under educated occured leaving Lack's children - especially her youngest daughter - feeling as if the world had a better grasp on who Herietta was than they do.<br /><br />What emerges is the painfully poignent story of a family left behind and used and tired of people calling them up to tell them who Henrietta Lacks was, and defining her only as a vessel by which the HeLa cells were created.  The author diviates from that one track thought process by involving the reader with yearning that she had to know the woman who made these things possible.  As the reader I wanted to know this woman, to have coffee with her, to hear her talk about her thoughts, her aspirations and her fears.<br /><br />The prose of this book is readable and it is compelling.  In all honesty, the last book that grabbed my attention as this book did to me was the DaVinci Code.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks will give a greater appreciation for the woman that she was and will raise ethical questions in your mind about life, race, education, poverty and our own control over what happens to tissues taken and examined in our own lifetimes.<br /><br />This is a great book!ife, race, education, poverty and our own control over what happens to tissues taken and examined in our own lifetimes.    This is a great book!

0062502182|5.0|Very interesting read, I ended up finishing the book on the same day ups delivered it. Loved reading the adventure, wish it didn't end so soon.
B001FB55L2|4.0|This is one of those times that I wish Amazon let us use half stars as I think this is more 3.5 stars than 4 full ones.  I have not seen the Danish film and now I wish I had.  This is because I just read here that in the Danish movie, the wife does start an affair with her brother-in-law.  This film lost a lot of its punch when the director shied away from letting that happen in the American remake.  As a result, it's as if someone punctured the air out of the movie past the halfway point. This should be a very taut, sharp drama throughout , which I suspect he Danish one is. The American one simply cannot sustain the same tension when the guts were removed from the script.  The actors are very good, both the brothers and the wife.  I think they make the best of what they've got.  So the problem must be that director Jim Sheridan was worried about losing audience if he kept the film as stark as the Danish version (that a film is Scandinavian and stark borders on redundancy). This almost always happens in American remakes.  We seem to do better when we use our own original source material.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001DHXT6G|3.0|I really loved the collectors edition packaging that were originally made for the 40th anniversary remastering of Star Trek: The Original Series, but HD-DVD's totally obsolete now, so other than looking funky they're pretty well useless. That is of course unless you wanna buy them as collectibles for they will become quite rare in time, otherwise I suggest you buy the Blu-Ray editions. And moreover as seasons two and three are only available in standard edition DVD it's even more pointless an idea to purchase them, as the extensive interactive special features are only available on high definition formats such as Blu-Ray. Also if you live outside of America and don't happen to own a multiregion DVD player then you won't be able to watch them at all, as they're only available in the NTSE format. Well then to sum up I just feel it's a damn shame indeed that the Blu-Ray editions of The Original Series didn't reuse this truly cool design for the packaging because then they would've rather neatly fitted in with all of the other collectors edition series box sets that were issued some time ago now, oh well. I even don't mind the fact they are a bit clunkily designed like some other reviewers have said, because as a completist it would have been cool for them to sit alongside my other Star Trek series.<br /><br />I also don't have much of a problem with the remastering of this series for the fact is that Paramount didn't give them a drastically overdone makeover like George Lucas did with Star Wars but were very respectful, careful and subtle with the whole process. And anyway The Original Series (as first aired in the 1960s) is already available on DVD with only a basic remastering of the sound and picture for transfer to DVD so honestly I don't know what some fans are complaining about because at least they're both available if you decide you don't like these updated versions, and I think that shows a certain respect for us loyal fans.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I think this is one of the best quality blu ray movies out there.  The picture is phenomenal and looks about as real as it possibly could.  This is quite simply Pixar at it's best.  The story is very simple and easy to follow.  I had seen previews and heard that this movies was conceived back when Pixar was finishing up on Finding Nemo.  So, they obviously put a lot of thought into it.  This is good enough writing to keep adults entertained and to wow children into sitting still.  It is just all around a great clean movie that the whole family can enjoy.  I am still in awe of how real it really looks.  Hope Pixar makes a habit of more movies like this one. Well worth every star I gave it.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I took my title from a Gemma quote in the first episode. It sets up Jax's conflict between two rival visions of the club: his long-dead father John Teller's and his step father Clay Morrow's. The Jax-Gemma-Clay dynamic dominates the show, my favorite since its debut in Sept.2008. You've got bikers, crooked cops, white supremacist, the IRA, rival street gangs, junkies, and even a new baby in this family-street justice saga. It's the street justice aspect that I love the most, exemplified by the club's castration and execution of the child rapist clown in episode 3, \\"Fun Town.\\" The ficticious town of Charming is not for the timid.<br /><br />This is Hamlet and Macbeth re-told in modern northern California. The constant references to backstories draw out the maximum from each character and add to the ever-increasing tension. This is very well acted; I cannot overstate this. The characters are in constant turmoil searching for the right balance and the right path for their lives to follow, and the viewer cannot help but be drawn into each conflict.<br /><br />I'm deducting ½ star for the DVD extras. I enjoyed them somewhat, but they don't play continously. They include chapters on the bikes, the tattoos, deleted scenes, etc. which are good but could also be more customer friendly. Long Live SAMCRO.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing this on the big screen when it came out.  I got this as a gift and was very pleased with the transfer to blu ray.  It is obvious that JJ. Abrams put some heart and soul into this movie, and the casting was spot on in my book.  I thought that Karl Urban was perfect as Bones. The rest of the cast did their role to carry this movie, and it was the \\"last\\" performance of Leonard Nimoy as \\"Spock Prime\\".   This was also a well thought out way to re-introduce the original series and breath new life into an already explored universe.  This leaves a blank slate for the writers and directors to do with what they like, and managed to do it well enough to appeal to Star Trek fans.  This is one of the best movies to come out of 2009.  Shame it did not get a nod from the academy awards.  Though this movie may not be for all, it is definitely worth the rental.
B002Y5FKUE|1.0|I have had a passing acquaintance with La Sonnambula, dating back to Met radio broadcasts in the 1960s, with Joan Sutherland and Nicolai Gedda, and later with Sutherland and John Alexander.  The Sutherland/Pavarotti recording has been in my collection for some time.  But, passing acquaintances do not make for visualization.  With this background, I was excited when I heard in 2009 that the opera would be streamed in high definition to movie theaters.  Needless to day, I was greatly disappointed with what I saw, which is the transmission that is reproduced on this dvd.  Nowhere in any libretto or synopsis have I read that La Sonnambula takes place in a warehouse type rehearsal hall.  Nor have I read anywhere that the heroine of the story is an opera diva.  I left the theater feeling that I had wasted $40, and that I was no more closely familiar with the story.  This production was booed at the Met, something extremely unusual for that house.  Critics, en masse, soundly panned the production as well.  (And, say what you like about critics, players stay up half the night to read their reviews.  When they agree with us, we want to world to know.  When they disagree, we call them pompous.)  I can not and will not fault the musical aspects of this performance.  They match or exceed any that I have heard.  The problem is with Mary Zimmerman's (and, from what I have read, Natalie Dessay's) production.  La Sonnambula is a simple story, set in a simple Swiss village, of a simple Swiss miss with simple problem.  There is no logical, or illogical, reason to present it as it is here.  Throw good money after bad by purchasing this dvd?  Not me.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I have to start off by saying that I was a fan of all 3 movies.  I enjoyed and understood all 3 of them fully.  Although the impact of the 3rd film took me a few days to wade through.  Oddly enough, I was not a fan of the Animatrix movie until I sat down and watched it all the way through.  It did help to fill in some of the gaps from the movies and add a bit more to the back stories.  Although parts of this movie are much more about the computer graphics than others, all in all I thought it was well done, and the ending makes sense if you approach it from a mathematical view, which I think some people have a hard time grasping.    In the second movie, the \\"Architect\\" tells Neo he is the remainder of an unbalanced equation.  The way I see it is that over time this remainder grows in size and strength (due to the equation being and incomplete one).  And in order to then balance out that equation (and cancel out the remainder), the agent Smiths are brought back since they somehow were affected (or possibly even infected) by the remainder(Neo).  This is where the end kind of adds up (no pun intended).  Neo then realizes that he is part of this equation, and can never really defeat the Smiths as no matter how powerful he becomes, they will balance him out.  So in the end, his sacrifice for Zion, (that also helps out the machines because it saves them from being taken over by the Smiths, or Smith infection) creates peace between the real world humans and machines.  This also sets the equation back into its balance by canceling out Neo, the Smiths loose all their power and cease to be.  Once I understood this, it gave the movies a whole new meaning, and really made sense.    Oh and by the way, I have watched them all now as it was a gift, and they look incredible on blu ray.  There are some scenes in the first movie where you can tell is a bit fake looking, but it is a vast improvement from regular dvd.  And if you are not noticing a huge difference from this and the dvd,please check your set up.  You must have done something wrong.  I would definitely say this is a 5 star boxed set of a great movie trilogy.  Hope you enjoy the review.
B000001ZS5|4.0|I knew I liked Jarre's tunes from finding them on Youtube and my own explorations into digital music (mostly the cheap home computer side of things, the Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari ST music). I was not around when he got his start, but I expected that his rise to fame (Oxygene) would be a great place to start, particularly since reviewers called it 'classic' and recommended I do so.    Well, that wasn't such a good idea. My favorite track off this album is Magnetic Fields 1 (particularly the first and third part), followed by Magnetic Fields 2; there's nothing like them on Oxygene and Equinox 3 and 4 are close, but again, nothing quite as complex as here. This is the Jarre I was looking for. The tunes are really catchy.    That said, I was a bit surprised at how sterile and clean Magnetic Fields (other than Part 1) sounds, especially compared to the grand, sweeping atmospheric effects in Oxygene and Equinox (and concert recordings of Magnetic Fields on Youtube, where he seems to use theramins and other analog synths). There's a lot less space in these recordings than there were in Oxygene and Equinox. I assume this is a result of the digital synth technology he was using, since it sounds like those Commodore 64 and Atari ST home computer tunes where it's the computer speaker in front of you GENERATING the notes.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|This is one of the best Batman movies to come out of DC yet.  Yes I think it had one of the best Jokers yet.  Ledger was so good, that I did not even recognize him in the trailer.   Bale is quite possibly the best Bruce/Batman ever on the big screen.  He really pulls you into his character, and differentiates Batman with a growling almost feral demeanor.  The writing was good enough that the movie did not have to depend on special effects.  Why then the 4 stars?  I think this was a horrible transfer to blu ray.    In the opening scene it is full screen, and after the robbery scene, we get the black bars at the top and bottom.  This switches back and forth several times throughout the movie!  And it is very annoying.  I kept trying to play with my buttons on my remote to fix it, and to no avail.  IMO, if you are going to show something in one format, stick with it throughout the movie!! Do not keep flipping back and forth.  Yes the picture looks very sharp and crisp, but it drove me nuts when they kept switching the format in the movie.  Sad thing is that this is not even Bale at his best though.  For that you can watch the Machinist.  It was done just before Batman Begins.
B0028NSE00|4.0|[[ASIN:B00192IV0O THE E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies)]]    The energy REALLY never dies! I know they've been around since '95, but I would date their real fame back to their 2003 Elephunk album. Ever since that album, The Black Eyed Peas have really captivated the music world, both by commentating on culture today (\\"Where is the Love?\\") and by influencing it with new electronic hip-hop sounds and ridiculous phrases we're all embarrassed to say out loud but love listening to nonetheless. This band is one of the #1 guilty pleasure listens of the decade, not just because of their creative sound that changes with each album and keeps us all dancing, but because of their hypnotizing lyrics. Sometimes they're so off-the-wall you have to laugh at them, and then sometimes they take a break from absurdity to say some really brilliant truths, especially in the form of social commentary (surprisingly similar to many pot-head art students I knew in high school). \\"Now Generation\\" couldn't be more on-target when it comes to youth today, and the style of verse and even the sound is entirely reminiscent of Billy Joel's \\"We Didn't Start The Fire\\" - which I'm sure was no accident. This band has got it all, ranging from the ludicrous and openly vulgar \\"My Humps\\" to sweet love-songs(Alive), emotionally moving songs like \\"the APL Song,\\" and aforementioned petitions for brotherly love in this world-gone-wrong.     While \\"Now Generation\\" talks about how today's society just wants everything immediately, they don't appear to be judging it too harshly, considering the lyrics to \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" and \\"Missing You\\" are tainted with wishes of instant gratification. \\"Imma Be\\" continues to encourage the pursuit of fame, power, and gratification (wrapped up in a great beat, of course) and \\"Party All The Time\\" encourages the pursuit of the party scene...shocker.    \\"One Tribe\\" is another \\"Where is the Love?\\" type song that encourages world peace and unification of the world's peoples -- a great feel-good song, to be sure. Pretty simple, but sometimes those are the best to sing and repeat. (And when you think about how quickly political slogans catch on, it may be a work of brilliance to create a simple song with a good message)    Of course, \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" is the ultimate going-out-on-the-town song, and basically sells this CD with no further aid necessary. The lyrics are fun to sing, and you get the feeling just by singing it that tonight really WILL be a good night! Who doesn't love that?    \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" is a fun song to dance around to or sing in the car, but again, it promotes the addiction to cutting-edge technology that's been enveloping culture lately -- the lyrics \\"I'm so 3008, you're so 2000-and-late\\" really couldn't say it any better - there's apparently great value in being the most up-to-date. If so, the Black Eyed Peas are a goldmine, because they're constantly coming out with more chart-topping hits. For a band that's been around 15 years, I really am impressed with their ability to change with the times and still be \\"the newest thing\\".      I would say, on the whole, this CD is party/club music. Not really a change for the Black Eyed Peas, I know. But the fact remains, they do danceable beat and strange electronic melody even better than the 80's, and that's pretty impressive. Philosophical moments aside, I really wouldn't recommend this to anybody looking for insightful (or clean) lyrics or messages that will encourage you to become a better person. I would, however, recommend this CD for playing in the car, for \\"pump-you-up\\" getting-ready type music, and for parties where you want to encourage dancing and just have a great time.

B002TSIMEC|2.0|This book is certainly a page turner, but the whole book rests on premises that are even flimsier than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", despite Dan Brown's usual preface that everything in the book is true. New Age conjectures and the Masons are glorified to the point that one has to ask if Dan Brown doesn't have some personal stake in any of it for giving them such stellar treatment. I found the style of story telling of this book often irritating. Much of the book is based on the character getting some sort of awesome revelation... but we'll have to read a few chapters to know what it is. That may  work once or twice, but when it's used as a main narrative tool, it becomes tiresome. I was very glad that Brown, in this book, mercifully spared us the contrived romances of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\". The final revelation of the Masonic treasure was a let down for me, much worse than that of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". I found the twist about the villan of the story to be much more satisfying.
0786856297|5.0|This book is a worthy addition to young magician in training genre - only in this case the twist is that the magician is actually a demigod, a son of a classic Greek Olympian.<br /><br />This is the guiding premise of this book, that the Olympians and all the other gods, etc from Greek mythology are real and exist today in the 21st century. But instead of ancient Greece, the Gods are now making life interesting for contemporary Americans.<br /><br />The author has clearly done his research and his updating of Greek mythology is worth the price the book by itself. But there is also an interesting and exciting story here with characters that the reader quickly comes to sympathize and care about. The book is very fast paced and reads quickly. I sat down to start the book an hour before dinner and was on page 200 before I set it down again. The book is told in first person by the twelve year old hero and the author has the preadolescence viewpoint almost spot on but the excess sophistication can be explained by reminiscing.<br /><br />Comparisons to the Harry Potter books are inevitable. Clearly it's cashing in on the whole \\"young person with supernatural powers comes of age\\" genre that the Potter books have made so popular. The three friends (title hero who just learned of his heritage, no nonsense smart girl, and loyal sidekick for comic relief) are clearly recognizable. But the originality overwhelms the similarities.<br /><br />So if you enjoyed the Potter books and are disappointed no more will be forthcoming give the first book in this series a try. Highly recommended for all ages.

1400052173|5.0|Rebecca Skloot does a brilliant job of weaving together the sad tale of the life of Henrietta Lacks, the mystery of her cells, and Rebecca's own efforts to win the Lacks's family trust.  It's engrossing on so many levels; very hard to put down.  I would say that Skloot has given Henrietta another shot at immortality--this time the immortality of the written word, and the public acknowledgment (at last) of Henrietta's great gift to us all.  Definitely one to read and savor.  --V. Morell
B0015DROBO|5.0|I confess I had a bit of trouble getting into this book.  It started rather slow, all the references in Sweden were not familiar, and i wondered if I could keep going or give up.  The lesson for me is that while it takes a couple dozen pages to get into it, once you get past about page 50, I was hooked.  It is carefully and thoughtfully crafted plot.  The key characters are quite unusual and demand a thoughtful read to 'get'.  But it is well worth the time to get into it.  I have subsequently read the next in the series, and my strong recommendation is that you MUST read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo before reading The Girl Who Played with Fire.  I am now anxiously awaiting the third in the series when it comes out on Kindle.<br /><br />Not your usual protagonists, but fascinating in their psychological profiles.  The characters fit well with the storyline.
B002WY65W4|5.0|After MONTHS of anticipation, Zombieland is FINALLY in my possesion. What can I say? I LOVED this movie! I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it (shame on you for missing it in theaters!), but I must say, what an impressive work for a first time director! As a horror fan, Zombieland had everything I wanted in a Zombie movie and then some.    And people, remember this is really not a horror movie at all. Sure there's plenty of blood and guts and a healthy dose of jumps and surprises. But rest assured, this movie is a comedic coming of age story set in a stark Zombie Apocalypse backdrop. It's got laughs and plenty of 'em. It's got brains. It's got guts... spilled all over the place.     The Blu-ray version is amazing. Sure, it could have done a little more to pack in more fan-boy masturbation material, but hey, let's not forget that it's the MOVIE you're buying. All of the special features are typical of any Blu-ray disc. Sound quality is superb! If you have a good 5.1 surround sound system, crank that sucker up to 11!    So go get yourself some twinkies, pop this bad boy in your PS3 or Blu-ray player and ROCK out to the best Zombie slaying action since Zack Synder's version of Dawn of the Dead!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|While others are remaking STRAW DOGS or cranking inane teen comedies you can count on Jim Cameron to push the envelope to the very edge ,and with it, achieve a film experience unlike anything you've ever seen.  I saw this in Digital 3-D and can honestly say that I have NEVER seen anything like it.  Pandora, it's people, the story and spectacle ... they stay with you long after the movie is over.  Though partially hidden by CGI, great performances by Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang.  That is has rocketed past TITANIC as the largest grossing movie of all time, not a surprise.  That it is up for Oscars, great.  No matter.  This is one that will live with audiences for generations to come.  The only question is, what does Cameron have up his sleeve next and how long will we have to wait?
0823013626|5.0|I'm a professional researcher at heart so when I delve into a topic I dive into the deep end and don't come up until I've exhausted the field. True to form this is what I've done with polymer clay. My thinking: If I'm going to spend a lot of money on tools and supplies I'm going to research the heck out of the topic so that I technically understand what's what.  As with most artistic mediums, success and high quality results are dependent upon the artist/crafter's understanding of the technical issues.  This is where Donna Kato comes into my life (so to speak).<br /><br />I purchased Kato's first book 'The Art of Polymer Clay' and was blown away by the depth and breadth (underline that last) of subtopics presented. Her writing and step by step explanations are clearly presented without being too pedantic. The side by side pictures detail the techniques being discussed and don't omit that critical step which makes the difference between success and failure. Some authors don't edit their own work very well and when omissions of this sort happen it drives me crazy.<br /><br />From my experience with her first book I purchased Kato's `The Art of Polymer Clay: Creative Surface Effects' and again wasn't disappointed (remember my expectations at this point were high). This book is an outstanding tool. With Kato's help, and admittedly the help of other well qualified author's  my overall appreciation of polymer clay techniques has grown leaps and bounds and I look forward to years of expressing myself in the millions of ways this particular medium allows.

0394580613|3.0|Imagine how Noah would have felt if after spending years building his ark in anticipation of the great rain that was to come, instead got only two hours of a good soaking.  I imagine he would have been a bit disappointed.  That's how I felt after reading Barnes' A History of the World in 10-1/2 Chapters.<br /><br />To be honest, I may have come into the book with some unrealistic expectations of my own doing.  You see, I read History for the first time back when it was first published back in the early 1990s.  And from that day until now I've always told people (and myself) that this was a very good book.<br /><br />One of my reading goals for this year is to re-read some books I haven't read for a while.  And having fond memories of History made it a natural selection (Darwinian reference = )) for this year's reading list.<br /><br />What I discovered is that the last 20 years were not kind to History.  I was pretty underwhelmed by the book.  Some of the short stories were fun/interesting, to be sure - Noah's ark from the perspective of a stow-away, unanswered letters from a lover, and an interesting take on heaven.  But as a total package, the collection was only so-so.  I even reluctantly removed it from my Amazon Listmania Must Reads List - sad, but I can't really recommend this book anymore.<br /><br />Now I'm concerned that some of my re-reads this year will flop as History did.  I sure hope not.  It's not fun to have a fond memory ripped from your heart and stomped flat.  Maybe I should rethink this year's goal...<br /><br />Bottom line...History is a nice hard rain but it isn't enough to float my ark.

0679735909|4.0|I am neither a poetry nor a romance fan, so I had difficulties with staying interested in this book in the beginning.  But I must say that the quality of writing is so different from most of contemporary fictions, alot of which are too simplistic, even fluffy.  This book requires serious concentration and a good dictionary, all worth because only the ones with literary discipline, integrity, and knowledge can write such a beautiful and ambitious book.  This book has so much to offer and the author manages beautifully to put writings--epic poems, myths, letters and critics etc--by different characters without creating distraction.  Totally worth struggling through.  The only problem with me was that I totally predicted one of the main mysteries, which was a little bit anticlimactic.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|My star rating is for the BluRay, not the film itself.  As much as I love this movie (and I do love this movie), I had to settle for the standard DVD version because of the sudden aspect ratio changes for the IMAX footage. I found this amazingly distracting and it constantly kept throwing me out of the movie. Hopefully someday they'll release another BluRay version that has the option to disable the IMAX ratio switch and I'll be able to upgrade, but until then I must make do with 480p when I watch this wonderful film. It's a shame, too, because other than the annoying ratio swapping the film looks amazing on BD.

B000FA5TTW|5.0|I really wanted to read this book before I saw the movie - I always want to read without the movie mucking up my vision of the author's words.   What a great read! Having the dead girl narrate the story in such matter of fact tones... It made the horrible details of her death all the more horrible, and yet bearable.  Hers was the perfect voice - a calm constant throughout.  Seeing the whole family struggle through their loss and grief was all too real and painful. I cried many times, as Susie detailed how she and her loved ones learned to deal with the terrible hole left in all their lives. Different in size and shape for each family member, but inescapable. It is not a perfect family and they are not perfect people. But they are good people, in spite of their stumbles.  I hope the movie can do justice to the story...
B0015ABRE2|4.0|The third season of Dexter was good, but not as good as season 2.   Season 2 had a better flow and narrative to it, but season 3 is still a very good season and Dexter is one of the best shows on TV right now.    What I like about it is that it's original and don't uses typical cliches. What you think is going to happen doesn't always happen. This unpredictability is a plus for the show.    Can't wait for the release of season four.
B00000J7SS|1.0|The original album was great music in any genre. Although largely improvised and then spliced together by Miles and Teo Macero, the finished product was finely crafted, because \\"Miles knew what he wanted once he'd heard it\\", as John McLaughlin said.  One advantage of the ensemble playing, is that even when one instrument takes the lead, everyone else fits in behind - it's not one person going off in his own direction for 5 minutes. This was an exceptional double LP on initial release, and the music is still a work of genius.    So why one star? The first 6 tracks were a balanced whole. If you want to listen to the outakes, buy the Complete Bitches Brew Sessions. Even then, you probably won't listen to CD's 3 and 4 more than once. Sony have trashed it with the addition of Felo. I'm ticked because I wanted to buy it as a present, but the extra track is an artistic disaster. How soon can we go back to the 24-bit version without someone messing with perfection?
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|....I don't know.  Once again, it seemed less like a movie and more of a long episode of the television series.  The plot in this movie just seems too small for a feature film.  The film reminded me of two TNG episodes, Who Watches the Watchers and Journey's End.  The movie's effects aren't really up to par either.  I know this was right after First Contact, which had, in my opinion, the best special effects of all the Star Trek movies, but still, these effects were bad.  Effects like these would have been okay for an episode, but not a movie.  But let me go into greater detail.    The movie starts out with Data being part of a Federation science team observing the Ba'ku, a peaceful race of people on their homeworld.  Data malfunctions, and reveals the team to the Ba'ku.  Data is later captured and repaired by Picard and the Enterprise.  He doesn't remember what happened to him or why he malfuncioned.  Picard and his crew go to visit the Ba'ku people and find the Federation science team being treated very hospitably by the Ba'ku.  Picard and the Ba'ku retrace Data's steps and find that the science team have hidden a holoship near the Ba'ku village.  The holoship has a program of the Ba'ku village.  It seems someone was planning on beaming the Ba'ku away while they were asleep.  The next morning, they would wake up in the holoship and assume they are still in their village.  Now that's the first big plot point I have a problem with.  They thought they could trick the Ba'ku by putting them on a holodeck of their village, fine, but what if some of them wanted to leave the village?  Like, say, the children going somewhere to play, or the adults gathering food and crops.  Did they program the whole planet into the holodeck?  Were they actually planning on keeping the Ba'ku on the holoship forever?  The charade wouldn't have lasted long.  Eventually the Ba'ku would have figured out what was going on.  And the Federation would have had to forcefully keep them from returning to their planet.  So why didn't they just go down to the planet and order them to evacuate the planet in the first place?  And how did they know that all the Ba'ku would be asleep at the same time?  What if someone wanted to stay up and read, or talk with someone, or maybe they were just having trouble sleeping?    Anyway, once Picard learns the Federation's plans, he contacts them.  Now, it was established earlier that the Federation is working with the Son'a, a strange and as of this moment underexplained race of aliens.  They have skin that has been stretched over their faces, and try to hide themselves underneath cloaks.  They are mentioned in passing as being a violent and aggressive people, which makes you wonder why the Federation is involved with them at all.  It is then explained that the region of space that the Ba'ku homeworld is located in, called the Briar Patch, contains metaphasic radiation particles which rejuvinate you and keep you from aging.  The Federation and the Son'a are working together to collect the particles for the rest of the galaxy to use.  Picard then discovers that the Ba'ku are not native to the planet they live on.  They were a group of people who migrated to the planet several hundred years ago.  The Prime Directive, which states that the Federation cannot interfere in other cultures, does not apply here.  The Son'a and the Federation want to use a large harvester to collect the particles.  But doing so would leave the Ba'ku's planet uninhabitable.  If the particles were harvested while the Ba'ku were still on the planet, it would kill them all.  That's why the Federation wants to move them.  Picard objects that that goes against the Prime Directive, and the Admiral responds (correctly) that the Prime Directive doesn't apply here.  He says that they are only moving six hundred people, and they will be able to halp billions of people.  Picard responds with the following question:    \\"How many people does it take before it becomeswrong?  One thousand?  Fifty thousand?  A million?\\"    Dude, were you paying attention?  It's not their planet.  No one said they could have it, and moving them would not be wrong.  It is kind of selfish of the Ba'ku people to keep all the radiation for themselves.  The rest of the galaxy should be able to benefit from it.  But on the other hand, why couldn't they just ask the Ba'ku people to get up and move?  The Ba'ku might refuse, but at least the Federation tried to be polite.    I want to bring up an episode from the series, called Journey's End.  That episode had to do with the Federation and the Cardassians signing a treaty.  The treaty sets a boundary between the two groups.  A planet that had been given to some Native Americans was on the Cardassian side of the line, and so the inhabitants had to be moved.  While sympathetic to the Indians plight, Picard agreed to go along with the Federation's decision.  Not in this situation, though.  Picard decides to try to stop the Federation from beaming the Ba'ku off the planet.  The rest of the crew (who have also been experiencing the regenerative properties of the briar patch, but I don't want to go into it because all the scenes are just so stupid and corny, except maybe Geordi's) decide to help him.  Here we get possibly the stupidest exchange I've ever heard in my life:    Data: I feel obliged to point out that the environmental anomalies may have stimulated certain rebellious instincts common to youth, which could affect everyone's judgment, except mine of course.   Crusher: Okay Data. What do you think we should do?  Data: Saddle up (cock's phaser rifle).  Lock and load!    Picard sends Riker and Geordi along with the rest of the Enterprise crew to contact the Federation and explain the situation to them.  Even though the Federation are the ones who ordered the evacuation, and obviously know what is going on.  The Enterprise heads away from the Briar Patch, but are intercepted by two Son'a ships.  A battle ensues in space.  The Enterprise, being the Federation flagship, easily destroys the Son'a.....no, wait.  Enterprise runs away, pursued by the Son'a.  During this scene, we get so many stupid lines, like:    Riker: (after the Son'a fire on them) a photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?  Geordi: I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like somebody.    Or:    Riker: let's get closer to that cloud.  I want to collect some of it with the ramscoop.  Geordi: the purpose being?  Riker: the purpose being, I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat.    These corny lines, combined with the silly scenes of the crew being affected by the Briar patch, have some people branding this as the worst Trek movie.  These stupid scenes and exchanges make the crew look like total idiots.    Picard, Data, Troi, Crusher, and Worf set up transport inhibitors to prevent the Son'a from beaming the Bak'u off the planet.  So the Son'a send isolinear tags to beam the people up.  Just picture Darth Maul's probe droids, and they shoot darts which enable the transporters to get a lock on you.  Most of the action scenes entailed the crew shooting the tags.  It got so boring after a while.  Eventually, Picard and Anij are tagged and transported to the Son'a ship.  Picard then reveals that, due to a blood scan, he has deduced that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race.  Years ago, a group of Ba'ku children tried to take over the planet.  They were unsuccessful, and were banished.  Now, it seems that Ru'afo, the Son'a leader, wants to expel the Ba'ku from the planet in an act of revenge.  When the admiral learns this, he tries to stop the mission, but Ru'afo kills him.    From this point on, I liked the movie.  There is only about twenty minutes or so left, but I still like it.  Picard breaks free, and he and Worf, along with one Son'a who has had a change of heart, attempt to stop the collector from collecting the particles.  The res of the movie is just cheesy action scenes and catchphrases, but to me it's still entertaining.  Picard destroys the collector, and Ru'afo is killed.  Riker successfully contacts Starfleet and explains the situation to them.  A full investigation is begun....which doesn't really guarantee that the Federation won't decide to do the same thing with the Briar Patch all over again.    Star Trek Insurrection is definitely one of the weakest Trek movies, bt it's still entertaining.  Just like Generations, it suffers from a small plot that wasn't really up to film standards.  It's basically just a long episode of the show.  And just like Generations, it has some serious plot contrivances that almost, but not quite, make it a bad movie.  Insurrection is a fairly entertaining movie, and I do re-watch it ocasionally.

0810970686|4.0|This third book in the \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" series had a lot to live up to, since the first two were so clever and funny. And in truth, this one isn't quite as good. It's just a little less funny, and the main character, Greg Heffley, shows some flashes of cockiness that make him a bit less likeable (\\"I'm pretty much one of the best people I know\\").    Having said that, it's still worth reading, and you'll definitely get some laughs out of it. It got better in the second half, as Greg's clumsy infatuation with Holly Hills produces multiple embarrassing moments.

B002VECLVO|5.0|So glad they're long over.  This is a beautiful and moving film that deftly captures the decade and the claustrophobic closet of a professional gay man.  Colin Firth breathes such life into George that you feel you know him and feel his loss so deeply.  Julianne Moore is, as always, fabulous.  Matthew Goode is the perfect Jim.  The performances are true, the visuals are sumptuous and the score by Abel Korzeniowski is excellent.  This is a film you can watch again and again and still find subtle nuanced meanings.  Kudos to Tom Ford!  Hard to believe it's his first film.
0446567337|5.0|I had this book for a while and I finally finished reading it.  I have to say right off the bat that I loved this book.  I remember while reading the words of John that I was going to be let down somewhere. I loved the way John and Savannah met. I enjoyed reading John's path to love.    The ending of the book really killed me. I felt like I was stabbed in my heart. I hated the ending. After everything John goes through.. and I mean everything. He still does not get to be with the one he loved. I really felt for him. As I started to read that last letter Savannah sent john, I started to tear up because I knew what was coming. Thats a terrible way to end it with him. All that I could think of was that she didn't wait for him. When John sees her again after his dad passed away. she mentions how she thinks about it everyday what would of happen if she waited and married John. You don't know how much I wanted to strangle her    I know that John knew Tim loved her and all but what I don't understand is why be with someone you have to learn to love than be with someone who it was easy to love right off the bat. Even Tim acknowledged it in the hospital during his talk with John. He knew that Savannah didn't love him the way that she loved John. You could tell that Tim wanted to have that kind of love with Savannah.      In the end this book made me feel like the guy I loved the most in the entire world left me for someone else. That is how broken my heart felt after finishing this book.  I do recommend this book to everyone who wants to go through the motions.
6304806418|5.0|madonna really worked her butt off in this movie and it shows. she was really determined to show everyone that she could really act and it really paid off when she got a golden globe. she looked her prettiest at the golden globes. she spent months doing extensive vocal training which i kinda think it put a strain on her vocal cords causing her to sound deeper in later years. she and antonio banderas looked great together. i love \\"don't cry for me argentina\\" and \\"you must love me\\". her voice sounds really sincere and heartfelt. bravo!!!
0679805273|5.0|Such a great book at such a great price.  It shipped super fast and was in perfect condition.  The reality of life thru Dr.Seuss eyes.
B003204MQS|1.0|i liked blair witch - unique, spooky, suspenseful. paranormal activity was dull from the start. Katie Featherston was terrible - very unconvincing and that distracted from the whole movie. i liked the amateur feel of the cinematography, but that didn't make up for bad cast selection.     i think i've been more scared (and certainly more entertained) watching Baby Einstein Videos.
B000I2JKC4|4.0|DVD was HD and didn't realize it would not play in a regular DVD player, but this was my own fault, not the seller's, in overlooking that the DVD was advertised as Hi Def.  Emailed seller, and seller was very prompt in responding & explaining why the DVD wouldn't work for me, and very willing to please me & even offered to give me credit toward another purchase.  Therefore, would recommend doing business w/seller and would not have reservations of purchasing from seller again in the future.

0439023483|5.0|So I knew the book was going to be good, but I had no idea it was going to be this good. A piece of advice: try and have the second book ready whilst you're reading this, because even if you think you'd be able to wait or spread your reading, you won't be able to.<br /><br />Set in what used to be North America, a new world order is created. The Capitol Panem rules its 12 districts ruthlessly. Each district is famous for something: fish, crops, electronic devices, etc. District 12, where the protagonist Katniss is from, produces coal.<br /><br />Katniss hunts illegally in the woods behind District 12 to earn money and find food for her family. At 16, she takes care of her mother and younger sister and has been doing so ever since her father died a couple of years ago. She learned almost everything she knows about hunting from her father and her friend Gale, whom she met in the woods one day.<br /><br />Panem devised a plan, or punishment for the districts when they rebelled 70+ years ago. The Hunger Games were put into motion and in these games, 2 tributes (a male and a female) from each district were chosen randomly and made to participate in the event at Panem. In the games, the tributes were ordered to kill each other until a lone survivor remains. The age group for the tributes had to be between 12 and 18.<br /><br />Not only could the people of the districts not complain about the unfairness of the games, and the killings of children, but they had to celebrate the games and be jolly about it. On the 74th year, Katniss is the female tribute from District 12 and is sent to Panem along with the male tribute, Peeta, a fellow classmate that she barely knows but is indebted to because of his help when they were kids.<br />\\"
B001FB563E|2.0|I had loosely read some of the book but was never terribly interested in it. I found it to be atmpospheric and poetic in writing but it lacked a basic storyline. Having read other post-apocalyptic books like 'on the beach', 'alas Babylon' and 'Earth Abides' I was truly astonished this book was favoured on the big screen.    The setting in which each scene took place often took the book an entire section to describe. This was the book's most important quality because of the way the writer spun his words to make such eloquent visualisations of the environment and relate it to the chilling moments that ensued. But as a film this was realised in just one single frame. The vivid experience of words is lost on the movie screen and we are really left with only a basic story about a man and his son trying to survive in a dark and desolate landscape.    It leaves one to realise just how insignificant the grand story really is. Where is this story going? And the ending is as contrived as one would expect when ... well... when there is nothing to expect.    And for all the little moments we invest our time with, I never truly felt involved. I just didnt feel it necessary to realise the romance, the helplessness, the desperation, the survival, the loss, the destruction, the decay, the gruesomeness, the fear, the father's anguish, the son's loneliness, their relationship... all of it.. I knew it was there to be admired... but it was all a bit formulaic for some reason. Mostly because I realised this very early on, and the story doesnt do much in the way of character progression and arch-lines. What we start with is what we end with, and in between are but a few incidents.    Right up to the end, I simply walked away exhausted yet untouched.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|The movie was great and I received it in the time frame was better than expected.

B002U6CJCE|4.0|I honestly don't know what I'm more shocked by, the fact that I gave Universal Soldier: Regeneration a chance, or the fact that it turned out to be as good as it is.  When a group of terrorists take over the Chernobyl nuclear reactor and threaten to release a radioactive cloud, and with an uber-advanced UniSol (former UFC champ Andrei \\"The Pitbull\\" Arlovski) at their disposal, former, deactivated UniSol Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) gets called back into action.  However, there's a surprise in store for Luc, in the form of his once deceased nemesis Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) who has been cloned and reanimated, and looking to bring some pain of his own.  While all this sounds like the recipe of a low budget, direct-to-DVD, schlock fest featuring two action stars way past their primes, Universal Soldier: Regeneration ends up surpassing both of the films to come before it, thanks to the great directing from John Hyams, who not only manages to put together some just plain brutal action sequences, but also manages to coax some great performances from Van Damme and Lundgren, as well as take advantage of Arlovski's cold menace.  John's father Peter Hyams, who directed Van Damme in 90s actioners Timecop and Sudden Death, serves as the film's cinematographer, and helps give the film the surprisingly great look that it has: this certainly doesn't look like a low budget, direct-to-DVD film.  All in all, Universal Soldier: Regeneration deserves a look at the very least, and if and when you do chcek it out, be prepared to be surprised with what you get here.
1881273156|4.0|Fabulous insight into the ways men and women think when it comes to love.  This book gives hope to relationships in trouble. Both parties must read  the book and discuss their interpretations of the information with an open  mind and a willingness to change.
076781326X|1.0|What is it with all this running and jumping, tumbling and spritzing?  All these little cockers, why weren't those children in school?      I, Yasha J. Banana, your 96-years-old Amazon movie reviewer, while I don't go back as far as Charles Dickens, I can assure you that in my day little children weren't running around the streets picking people's pockets, rolling on the ground, leaping from furniture and running into buildings.  Ho boy!  After I watched this movie I was out of breath.  It took me 15 minutes to get my heart started again.      Didn't the people who made this movie ever hear of child labor laws?      When I was a kid, do you think I picked pockets?  Never!  NEVER!  These kinderlekhs, these litle brats, they couldn't learn a trade?  There wasn't anybody in London back then who could teach them to block hats or maybe fix yo-yos?      A decent trade, that's what they needed.  A decent trade, a cup coco and an orange, that's what every boychick needs, minimum.      Later on they can take in a partner.      Also, these kids never heard of Barney's Boy's Town?  A pressed pair of pants they couldn't steal?  A bar of soap was locked in a vault?  A decent pair of shoes weren't invented?      Listen, I don't mean to be picky, and far be it for me to insist on realism, but all these people living in a hovel -- Fagan, the Dead End Kids, rogue elements of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir -- and how many bathrooms were there?  Huh?  All you feency-schmeency movie reviewing maven, did you ever think of that?  No sir!  I didn't see one crapper in the whole movie.  Not a flush or a fart in the entire show.          Kids love to fart, but I didn't hear a-one.  Not a peep, not a titter.  Where's the realism?  Where's the verisimilitude?  Let just two of my great-grandchildren come over and what happens, they immediately start farting and then they blame it on me.  \\"Grandpa Yasha is farting, Mama!  Grandpa Yasha is farting, Mama!\\"      Charles Dickens, I doubt very much, hadkids.  Maybe one or two, but a hovel full?  Who's kidding who?  And then what, a senior citizen takes them into the streets to pick pockets all day?  Listen, take it from me, your typical senior citizen gets tired watching paint dry.  Besides which, once he got them all outside, I guarantee you, half of them would have to go tinkle.      Or worse.    Job himself would have started throwing those kids out the window.  Alphabetically.            And the woman in the movie who's supposed to be the mother-figure, Nancy.  Oh, what a grand old time she had!  Dancing around the place with the kids: singing, laughing, carrying on.  Do you know the only time I danced with my mother?  It was back in 1921 when I was seven-years-old; right after she gave me an enema.  Such dancing on the way to the crapper you never saw in your life!         And, mind you, this wasn't no Fleet's enema.  A Fleet's enema couldn't clean out a chicken, believe me.  This was an enema bag she held over her head like the Sword of Damacles.  Big as a Voit basketball.      But what do you care about my bowel movements, past or present?    Getting back to this Nancy dame. ... She didn't care if any of the kids married outside their faith?  Okay, okay, so who am I to express an opinion; but a real mother would have asked a question here and there, don't you think?       And poor Charles Dickens.  When did he write a musical about crazy people dancing in the streets in the slums with the rats and the dreck?  And what about his descendants? -- did they make a few dollars from this movie, from all the hocking and schlepping and tumbling and spritzing?        In conclusion, and so that I shouldn't say another word on the subjecte ... Ron Moody, the fellow who plays Fagan, a nice Jewish man.  Almost as old as me.  And Mark Lester, the boychick who plays Oliver, also a Jew.  But, boys, fellas, you need this?  You couldn't get into a movie where you sit in front of a computer and blow up half of Manhattan; or else knock off a bank for a few billion dollars?  Since when do Jewish boys spin and do cartwheels and throw thmselves against walls, already?        I don't know, maybe life has passed me by; at 96-years-old if it wasn't for my two martinis and my Rosary I'd never make it through the day.     ... Rosary, get dressed and make me two martinis!
B002Q9MZHE|5.0|These are two of my favorite performers, and I love Puccini. The theatrical rendering of this opera is fine by me; the music falls a little more into the background in this kind of production because one tends to focus intently on the action, so that the lip syncing really wasn't a problem for me.      I'm also happy with my Blu-ray disc. It certainly doesn't resemble the very negative description given by the reviewer in Australia. Probably he's not aware that US Blu-ray discs are different from those normally used in other parts of the world.
0743437497|5.0|I just finished the audio book. It's the first time I've read it, though everyone knows the basic plot. I actually really liked this book, though I accede there isn't much \\"horror\\" here. I thought Jack and Wendy, in fact all of the characters, were much more richly portrayed than the movie. I enjoyed this a lot more than Kubrick's \\"Look What I Can Do\\" show off fest. I thought this was very well written. King has an incredible vocabulary. I had to look up all sorts of words. What the hell does denuded mean (stripped bare)? What is a freshet (a stream)? More favorites include: scut- a contemptible fellow; Luddite-early 19th century workman who fought against machinery by trying to destroy it. Lush (n.)- drunkard. Gavotte- a French peasant dance. Tine- prong (like of a fork). Triptych- a three paneled painting/carving placed side by side (ohhhhh that's what those are called).     Also, he is quite adept at turning a simile, though at times his prose can get a little flowery because of it. He himself admitted that he felt his prose was a bit too show-offy in this novel. It is very forgivable though since he does such an amazing job.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|Nothing worse than a poorly done music concert DVD but fortunately this is not the case.  Very well filmed,no herky jerky camera antics,superb musicianship by all.    A must have for Vai fans. Other people I like have often put out a shoddy product wich winds up just sitting  on a shelf. I have played this numerous times and always enjoy it. Buy It!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|We just finished watching as a family. Not sure it was appropriate for a 5 year old, but nonetheless educational for all of us. Spread the word. The reviews sum it up nicely here. It was an amazing appetite suppressant, and I'm not sure what I am going to eat tomorrow. We have a limited selection where we live, and it was amazing to see how EVERYTHING was intertwined. I can't wait to share this video with friends and family.

B000000WGL|4.0|after mick jagger had all but abadoned the stones,keith richards decided he had no choice but to make the music himself and thats just what he did with his solo debut,this record is a great display of richards guitar skills and shows off how truly essential he was to the stones,standout tracks for me were \\"take it so hard\\" and the anti jagger \\"you dont move me\\" which tells you how far the betrayal keith felt went.in any event this is a great rock record and if you like the stones sound you will find this enjoyable, though keiths sandpaper voice may be hard to swollow,I've come to enjoy it,I highly reccomend this album and its succesor album \\"main offender\\" which I think is even better
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|I admit it-i used to be a true hater of the Backstreet Boys because their classic pop hits from the 90's were so popular and so overplayed.  Well, i finally decided that i needed to listen to their work - REALLY LISTEN to their work - and i found out how and why the Backstreet Boys are indeed a phenomenon.  Their voices are amazing, their style is fun and uplifting. This album is feel-good powerpop and harmonized ballads - The \\"mod\\" BSB at their best.  Please get this album.  I don't care about old prejudices - open your mind, and you will be amazed at the quality, style, and the MUSIC!!!
0446567337|5.0|This story was amazing, being a military wife I could really relate to the characters struggles and deep love for one another.  This story made me wonder how my relationship would have turned out if I didn't marry my husband before he left for the service. What a scary thought, thankfully we have been married 16 years and have 4 year's until retirement from the USAF and supriningly are still in love. A ture love story! Did not want it to end.....  Can't wait to see the movie, although it wont be as good as the book~ Poor John!
B0030BYWKK|5.0|It's different, and a little less accessible than The Trials of Van Occupanter, but it is a superb album. For Midlake fans, it just needs a good half a dozen listens and you will love it, trust me! If you are not a Midlake fan I suggest buying The Trials of Van Occupanter, and once you love that - buy this!
B001ED7C58|5.0|great cd, i loved almost every song. however i do agree with other reviewers in that more soundtrack should have been included along with claire de lune. bella's lullaby was so ethereal in the film and it doesn't lose that magic on the cd either.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|After listening to Taylor Swift's most recent CD, Fearless, I have come to the conclusion that she is affecting society in a positive way.  The lyrics of her songs are filled with some powerful and important messages.  In her song, Fifteen, a warning, and a sad truth, is given to high school freshmen.  Just because a boy says, \\"I love you\\" does not mean he wants to marry you.  Swift encourages her audience to be careful and that if you give yourself away, you will regret it.  Along the same lines, in the song, You Belong with Me, she uses a bunch of images and the stage is high school.      I would say that Swift's average fans are teenage girls still in high school.  These young girls can relate to the lyrics of the music.  However, the situations that Swift paints are common situations that I, a 22 year old can relate to.  Everyone has had their heart broken once or twice.  I think that Swift is open, honest and down to earth.  This is a great characteristic trait to have - it makes Swift that much more real opposed to a celebrity.   I love the fact that she writes her own songs instead of hiring someone else.  It would be easier to pass that responsibility off to someone, but she does not.  To me, it shows that Swift's heart is in the music.  She likes what she does and is not just doing it for the fame and fortune.      I do not like when the music is overpowering the vocalist.  I love how there is a blend.  I can enjoy the beat and rhythm.  At the same time I can enjoy the lyrics without having to strain to hear what is being said.  The music is light and catchy.  I find myself still humming the melody hours after listening to the song.  It is hard to find music in today's society that does not speak of sex nor has any words in it that needs to be bleeped out when played on the radio.  I appreciate it and will allow my children to listen to it.    While listening to the CD, I was looking through the album cover.  All her pictures are decent modest pictures.  She has all her clothes on and nothing is showing.  In my personal opinion; this is the way anyone should dress.            When singing, Taylor Swift tends to be a tad nasal, but this reason alone is not a good enough reason for me to stop listening.  I think that her acting skills in the music videos are super.    In conclusion, Taylor Swift is an awesome role model for young teenagers.  She is modest and clean, does not curse, shows responsibility, has heart for what she does and provides wonderful advice.  I love this CD and encourage others to listen to it with an open mind.      ~Amanda Friedman

0439023483|5.0|My sister, mother and I have all enjoyed the first of this series.  Personally, I felt that though the story line is very dark and troubled, the characters acted with appropriate outrage and empathy.  There were moments of true sadness, surprise and horror which I have not felt from a book in a long time.  I would recommend it easily to younger adults and adults. I don't know if I would recommend it for 13 and under, it would depend on the child's maturity.
B002MW50KO|3.0|Probably for diehards or completists only but worth it for Must Be Santa track alone.  My 87 year old Mother listened to it all the way through and then replayed a couple of tracks. She thought it was the funniest thing she had heard for a long time.  Check out Bob's pronunciation on Adeste Fideles, aah Bob.  A little disapointing that there is no pic of Bob anywhere but if you haven't already watched the video of Must be Santa you must do it now. My pick for video clip of the year. Hope it raises lots of money for Feeding America.
1400052173|4.0|This book tells the story of how the author became acquainted with the family whose mother inadvertedly provided HeLa cells, the first immortal line of human cells. Skloot, a journalist and science author, first became interested in the origin of HeLa cells when she heard about them in a biology class.  In this book, she traces both the origins of those cells and her own story in learning about the people connected to the cells. Along the way, she encounters the changing ethical standards for research involving human subjects and human tissues and delves into the reasons African Americans have for distrusting  the medical research community. For all the important medical developments that HeLa cells have made possible, Skloot reminds us that they began with a tragedy, an  aggressive invasive tumor that destroyed a woman's life and haunted her family for generations. And although HeLa cells were the foundation of a multi-billion human cell industry, Henrietta Lacks' family  never gave permission for those cells to be used for research, let alone received any financial remuneration for the cells.<br /><br />This is a very intense book, hard to put down.  Through patience and perseverance, Skloot uncovered facets of Henrietta Lacks' story that family members themselves were unaware of.  It is an excellent investigation of the human consequences of medical research and ethics, why human subject committees, pesky as they are for researchers, are an absolute necessity. The book is primarily focused on the origins of the HeLa cells, rather than on the science of the HeLa cells, so a reader would need to look elsewhere to learn more about how the HeLa cells have been used.  The book has some rough edges, where the constant timeline jumps cause a few continuity problems, and includes some irrelevant details about characters' lives.  But the overall picture presents a compelling examination of medical research and ethics, as well as a fascinating look into the personal history of HeLa cells.a cells.
0394900189|3.0|I purchased this book used for a baby shower gift.  The theme was books instead of cards and bring your favorite baby book.  It was well recieved in general and a good book for a baby to grow up with and destroy, as babies do to their books.    The book was writen in and somewhat tattered/not mentioned in the description.  The book was decribed as being in good condition.    The shipping took three weeks. Somewhat longer than I expected, however I did recieve it in time.    All in all...a good product for the great cost!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I first heard of Florence and The Machine in Nylon Magazine and was hooked when I heard the song The Dog Days Are Over. Her voice is amazing and their is not one song on this CD that I don't like. I swear it is like the drums and instruments are part of my beating heart (lol). Her songs have you moving your feet and shaking your body and even has you wondering what these songs really mean to her. I would love for her to come to concert in the Chicago area so I can get a chance to see her live. I had to buy this CD when it finally came out in the U.S. The only problem I have with this CD is the fact that the deluxe dc was released after I bought the original, because I feel deprived of her full talents(lol) If you don't have this CD, I have no idea what you are waiting for, GET IT NOW! My favorite songs are You've Got The Love, I'm Not Calling You A Liar, Dog Days Are Over, Cosmic Love, Hurricane Drunk, Blinding, and My Boy Builds Coffins. Just when I thought that You've Got The Love could not get any better another group named The XX, who I am also obsessing about remixed the song and it is amazing so make sure to check that out too on youtube! This has to be one of the best cd's of 2009, and I feel as if many people are overlooking such a talent. :-)

B0026P3G12|5.0|I absolutely loved it. Her voice is just beautiful and the lyrics and music gave me goose-pimples. This woman is a diamond in the rough. We will be hearing a lot more from this gifted woman.  She has a great sense of humor and she is so funny and so for real.  Got the shipment in good time and was surprised that I got it so fast. Good service and fast shipment makes for ordering from these people over and over again.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I purchased three of Susan Boyle's CD's, two for presents, and one for myself from Amazon.com.  The CD is awesome, and I have been playing it in my car since I purchased it.

B002SF9YNO|5.0|Daigo Kobayashi needs to grow up fast. When his dream career of being a professional cellist falls through, he has some difficult decisions to make. Although he is already in his mid-30s, he still behaves irresponsibly by hiding the cost of his prized cello from his wife, Mika. She puts up with his immaturity and even agrees to leave Tokyo for the Yamagata countryside to save costs as he looks for a new job, and he sells his cello to pay off his debt.<br /><br />Once back in his home town, Daigo continues to act childishly. He finds a job that pays well, but he hides its true nature from Mika because he knows she won't like it. Things seem to be going well, and he takes solace from playing his childhood cello as he learns to be a nohkanshi (encoffiner). Eventually Mika discovers his deception and gives him an ultimatum-- give up his dirty, embarrassing job or she's leaving. He finally feels like he has found a job he can do well, and he lets her go. Even his old friend snubs him and tells him to get a \\"decent job\\". Coming back to his home town also brings back memories of the father he has hated his whole life for abandoning him when he was 6.<br /><br />By persevering in the difficult, socially unacceptable work, Daigo grows up by learning responsibility and empathy. When his boss (who is the closest thing to a father figure he has ever had) explains it, his job makes sense. Mika comes back when she learns she is pregnant, and his determination wins her over to see that he can be a solid husband and father. I won't spoil the ending.<br /><br />Director Yohjiroh Takita presents us with a rich film that is a study of calm minimalism. Rather than trying to keep the audience's interest by packing the movie with loud dialog, action, cheap laughs, special effects and intense sounds, he pulls us in with a moving soundtrack, likable characters, good acting, subtle humor, beautiful scenery, and a gripping story. An example of doing a lot with a little is seen in the endingof the film in the exchange between Daigo and Mika. All he needs is eye contact and gestures to pull it off. Jo Hisaishi's score carries the film in a good way, as did Basil Poledouris' carry \\"Lonesome Dove\\".<br /><br />I watched it 3 times in one week, and I was in tears every time. The first time I watched it I found myself critiquing the subtitles more than enjoying the film, so I viewed it again with subtitles off. After digesting the story for a few days I gave it one last look. The boss' (Sasaki's) quip, \\"Ikimono wa ikimono wo kutte ikiterun da\\" (literally \\"Living things eat living things to live\\") didn't seem well served by being translated \\"The living eat the dead.\\" That being said, I know it's a lot easier to criticise a completed translation than to actually come up with one oneself. I highly recommend it, and I know I will watch it again in the coming years!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Yes, it is a bit weird. I liked that. And the characters are beyond great. They are all quirky in entirely different ways. Emma Thompson, as the tortured author, was, to me, astounding. Will Ferrell's understated performance (SO unlike most of his stuff!) made his emotions - when they finally surfaced - just that much more aching. And Dustin Hoffman, with his matter-of-fact (okay - ruthless) assessment of Ferrell's plight was almost shocking in its coldness.    This is a movie where people change, because their lives touch. An emotional thriller, a comedy, a drama, a rollercoaster - all rolled into a movie that is content to appear unassuming. A true feel-good movie.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I'll keep this short, I live in the UK and this full version of the film has still not been released here. Thankfully Warner Bros and Paramount do not region code their Bluray discs, so this will work fine on UK RB players.  This is the fullest version of the film and the most like the original graphic novel. Snyder is rabidly faithful to the look, the feel and most of the plot. Everything looks amazing and feels lifted straight off the page. On BD the film is gorgeous and sounds outstanding. One of the best transfers out there. The whole thing works, with the Black freighter and the deleted scenes edited back in, it really is a director's cut and not just a cash in. You really understand the plot and the characters far more deeply. The extras are mindblowing in just the pure amount of them. The motion comic in full and the viral videos are a high point. One sticking point is that the digital copy Mac/iPod version can't be accessed in the UK as it is for the American and Canadian iTunes only. Also that it is the theatrical and not the extended cut. But this is not a big enough gripe to drop a star. An excellent package of a great movie of a peerless story.
0670021652|3.0|I love memoir, so of course I have read and enjoyed EAT PRAY LOVE.  Gilbert herself addresses the difficultly of publishing a follow-up to the kind of blockbuster success that EAT PRAY LOVE became.  I wasn't necessarily holding her to that standard, but was hoping for more of the kind of personal exploration that she shared in that book.<br /><br />COMMITTED is instead written like a project memoir (which I also like).  Books such as [[ASIN:0743291476 The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible]] or [[ASIN:0061583251 The Happiness Project]] where the author is on some sort of personal quest and he or she supplements it by researching the subject etc.  Gilbert approached this memoir this way -- sharing her personal experiences, yes, but mostly explaining or reacting to other studies she's read on marriage (and divorce), or laws, or social commentary on the institution.<br /><br />She's not trying to change the world (well, she might be trying to sway thoughts/laws) -- she's telling her story.  She's telling why she chose love, and why she had chosen to be unmarried and child-free.<br /><br />If you are looking for information on the institution of marriage -- particularly if you feel disenfranchised from it, either by divorce, or singleness (by choice or circumstance), or exclusion (by the legal definition of marriage), this is a good book (4 star at least).<br /><br />However, I give this 3.5 stars NOT because it's not EAT PRAY LOVE, because that's not what I expected, nor even what she promised.  I wanted more of Elizabeth Gilbert's personal searching, and perhaps more of an afterward about the reality of how marriage has been a good (or bad) thing, but the book didn't go that far.
0061703257|1.0|Yar be aware that spoilers abound below....<br /><br />Up until the last chapter, this was perhaps one of the top books I have ever read. The plotting was tight, the suspense perfect. The setting - absolutely ideal. The characters were amazingly well constructed. I could \\"see\\" Ashecliffe & Shutter Island in my mind.<br /><br />The author spends 90% of the book crafting a tightly plotted suspense thriller. Set in 1954, Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck are sent to Shutter Island's Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane to investigate the sudden and unexplainable disappearance of a woman who murdered her own children. Not only do they encounter mystery and opposition in their investigation from the very beginning, but a \\"perfect\\" storm Hurricane is bearing down on the island. Quickly Teddy suspects the european doctors who are now americans after WW2 are conducting top secret or even illegal medical experiments on the patients. He and Chuck begin to think they may never be allowed to leave the island alive!<br /><br />The problem - its all a lie. Its a sham. None of it actually happens for real. The entire story is imagined.<br /><br />I'm going to save you a very frustrating experience. Its all in Teddy's mind. We find out literally, with no warning, (in the last chapter) that Teddy is the mental patient and has been for 2 years. He murdered his wife and then lost his mind. The whole plot and intrigue of the book are a plan of the actually very kind & caring doctors who are trying to \\"shock\\" Teddy back to a semblance of normalcy before they consider more radical solutions such as a lobotomy.<br /><br />Why is this bad? Because it feels like the author couldn't think of a better way to end the book. He creates such a suspenseful and detailed plot that its a shame the only way to end it was to make it \\"all just in Teddy's mind.\\" It feels like he either (a) ran out of patience or time and just said - hey this is a clever ending or (b) he just wanted to create shock and awe on purpose - so rather than actually end the book and tie up all the plot lines - he went for an ending that was sure to cause a stir and get people \\"up in arms.\\" Or maybe he just couldn't figure out a way to end it that made sense - so he decided it didn't need to make sense.<br /><br />If the author had actually crafted an ending that made sense, that would be a different story. No where along the line does he give you any indication that Teddy is imagining it all. Not only that, but there are glaring plot holes that can't be explained away by this rushed and insulting ending. Basically, anything that wasn't \\"staged\\" by the doctors trying to cure Teddy was simply \\"imagined\\" by Teddy as happening. That means a vast portion of the book, the characters, the details, and the emotions they evoke - aren't real events in the book. Its just Teddy withdrawing from the psychotic drugs. Its essentially a giant waste of your time.<br /><br />The entire book is a \\"gotcha\\" waiting to happen. The sole point of the book is for you the reader to sit back and go \\"Whoa! Teddy IS the missing patient\\"! That's it. I imagine when the movie comes out people are going to be pissed. Unless the movie changes to give the audience \\"some idea\\" that its all in Teddy's mind.te shock and awe on purpose - so rather than actually end the book and tie up all the plot lines - he went for an ending that was sure to cause a stir and get people \\"up in arms.\\" Or maybe he just couldn't figure out a way to end it that made sense - so he decided it didn't need to make sense.<br /><br />If the author had actually crafted an ending that made sense, that would be a different story.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|This movie is excellent...a real eye-opener in many respects. Even if you are aware of the current state of our country to some degree, this movie will shed much more light on the history behind it. It is an absolute travesty. I'm currently taking a college class called social stratification and so much of what is in Moore's movie is in my textbook. Moore sticks to the facts; there is no need to lie or embellish when the facts are bad enough. Every single American should see this movie. If you are moved by it, then share it with others. Buy it as gifts, loan it out, do whatever you need to do to encourage people to watch it and wake up. We need a revolution!!!
B0035OTPEK|4.0|When I saw the product description saying that this is recommended for fans of Interpol or Joy Division, I was highly skeptical. There are a lot of people who try to draw parallels to bands that they think sound like Interpol, or worse, Joy Division. But the fact that a band is also from NYC, like Interpol, does not automatically make them *sound* like them. I am fiercely protective of the sartorial foursome and don't take comparisons lightly.<br />However, previewing these songs I was pleasantly surprised. It does sound like one walked into a karaoke bar and heard Paul Banks covering \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart.\\" I lack the technical musical expertise to describe how it draws parallels, but I would say that the lead singer \\"bends\\" his notes like Paul's singing style (a la \\"Mammoth\\" on Our Love to Admire).<br />I give it a 4 star because on some of the songs it doesn't quite sound like the lead singer can nail the higher notes. But for 3 bux it's a good listen.<br />Also, check out 24 Hour Party People, starring the incomparable Steve Coogan, which shows how Joy Division was discovered.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I waited until this month to purchase the mono box and I am simply blown away. Now I have both the stereo and mono boxs. There are different takes and mixes throughout the box making it a must buy. The only thing that angers me is why mono is limited edition. The first two albums in mono blow away stereo hands down. I was shocked by the difference. There is no left right vocal issue and the mixes are tighter. They should have kept the first four albums in mono like the 87 cd's. I never realized what a mess the Beatles catalogue is. Between the American versions and mono and stereo. Certain songs on Magical Mystery Tour are much heavier and fuller. Sgt. Pepper was like a religious experience. I have to admit, I didn't understand what the big deal was about this album until I heard it in mono. Lucy in the sky with diamonds is so much more trippy and With a little help from my friends sounds much more complete. The mono booklet states songs like Please please me and If I fell are inferior takes in stereo, yet these are the definitive versions now? Even the booklet in the stereo Please please me states mono was the main focus and stereo was just to back up the mono mixes. So now these inferior stereo mixes are the only version you can get? Does that make any sense? They need to create a new stereo mix staying true to the original sound of the Beatles.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought 30 Day Shred and Banish Fat, Boosh Metabolism after reading the reviews and trying some of the exercises for free from (...). I love JM's no-nonsense style; she really is a personal trainer! She explains the logic behind all the moves. If you like variety in your exercises and get bored easily, this is definitely for you. I hate exercising, but realize that its a must if I want a healthy toned body. Both DVDs deliver variety, interval training, modified moves for beginners, and results. I only started them 3 weeks ago, so can't say much about losing weight yet (plus I haven't stopped eating sweets and carbs, although I have upped my fruit and veggie intake) but I feel that my endurance is getting higher. The strength training in 30 Day Shred is a bit tough to do for beginners but stick with it. The cardio in BFBM is awesome! I did 20 minutes the first time, and the full DVD the second time. By the time I had finished, I was purple in the face and totally soaked! I highly recommend JM's DVD's.  Some caveats/tips to get you thru it:  1. wear thick soled trainers while doing these exercises to protect your knees from all the jumping moves.  2. Put on some of your favorite dance music while doing the exercises. After listening to JM's instructions once or twice, you don't need to listen to her but just follow her while listening to your favorite tunes.  3. Do keep imagining your body as you want it.  4. I keep repeating to myself: Transformation requires sacrifice and effort. This helps me pull through when I'm desperate to stop.  5. You don't have to do the entire DVD in one go. Take it slowly, according to your fitness level. Also, its ok to cheat and not do all the exercises in one circuit if you can't. For instance, if a circuit has 6 exercises and by the time you come to the 5th one and are exhausted, sit out the next moves for 10-20 seconds then join back in.    I used to do Billy Blanks Tae Bo, but left it pretty soon. It didnt inspire me to go on, it didnt offer variety in moves, and BB doesnt explain the logic behind the exercises. But I definitely recommend JM's DVDs. Go get them, and you won't regret it!

B002T9H2MO|4.0|\\"Moon\\" stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, an employee of a moon-based energy company called Lunar.  Sam lives in an isolated base that controls three massive \\"harvesters,\\" which travel across the surface of the moon to collect rocks containing Helium-3.  His only companion is a large robot named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) who looks like a copy machine suspended from the ceiling.  Gerty also has a screen that displays emoticons to express his feelings.  With his three-year contract nearly up, Sam is preparing to return to earth and the loving arms of his wife and new-born daughter, both of whom we see in video calls.  However, Sam has an accident while trying to attend to one of the harvesters, and he wakes up confused in the infirmary.  Gerty tells him that he was unconscious for only a short time; however, Gerty is acting rather oddly (his emoticon's eyes do that darting back forth thing that cartoon characters do when they lie).  Is he lying?<br /><br />First time director Duncan Jones (AKA Zowie Bowie - the son of David Bowie) helmed this indie sci-fi flick with a meager $5 million dollar budget, or roughly the amount \\"Avatar\\" spent on bagels for the craft services table.  Nevertheless, the film's look and effects are quite believable.  Scenes on the moon were filmed with models overlayed with CGI, which gives them a fairly realistic look.  Written by Jones with Nathan Parker, The plot has some predictable elements (a meddling evil company, a lying robot).  However, the story manages to hold some surprises and intelligently explores Rockwell's predicament.  To borrow a line from his father's first hit single, Jones \\"really made the grade\\" with his debut.<br /><br />Jones wrote the movie for Sam Rockwell.  I'm not a fan of Rockwell's work but he definitely brings something different to the role as a twitchy astronaut who (to borrow from another song) finds that \\"it's lonely out in space.\\"  [Actually, now that I think about it, Elton John's \\"Rocket Man\\" is much better description of \\"Moon\\" than is \\"Space Oddity.\\"]  One of my favorite parts of sci-fi films is the robots, and I loved Gerty and his emoticon face.  Spacey's vocals strike the perfect balance between a human-sounding robot and still sounding vaguely ominous (apparently his vocals were altered slightly).  Another major strength is the haunting score by Clint Mansell, which manages to highlight and elevate key scenes without being the least bit intrusive.  I enjoyed \\"Moon\\" and was happy to read that Jones is planning a follow-up of sorts called \\"Mute,\\" which will explore another story set in this timeline.<br /><br />The DVD is packed with extras including two commentaries with the director (one with the writer/producer and another with members of the technical crew) and several behind the scenes making of flicks.on of \\"Moon\\" than is \\"Space Oddity.\\"]  One of my favorite parts of sci-fi films is the robots, and I loved Gerty and his emoticon face.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|There are a few deviations from the book but the actors are great and even better looking.  This series combines fantasy, comedy and drama all into one.  This series is truly entertaining and for adults only.
0321544080|5.0|Fantastic information, fantastic read... Great information, I highly recommend this to any photographer or aspiring photographer, it will open your eyes.
071956994X|5.0|This is a book that you either value greatly or you dislike it.    Many people want to enjoy fiction that has a straightforward narrative, where all the characters are clearly described in detail and there is an ending that pulls together all the loose threads. When you have finished reading such a book, you feel you are ready to start the next book.    Mister Pip is not a book for such readers. But it is a must for readers who want their thinking and imaginative processes stimulated by the story.    Lloyd George has written a very unusual book. For instance the opening scenes include someone walking through a village wearing a red nose and pulling his wife along on a trolley. Bizarre?  But because it is unusual you want to carry on reading.    The author has the ability to write simply but very clearly. He also has the ability to switch quickly to a new set of events, totally unexpected. What comes across powerfully  is the complete helplessness of a group of villagers, whole sole aim in life is to have a life style that ensures their survival,  but are in fact completely at the mercy of internal and external cruel forces.    Much of the story revolves round Charles Dickens' book, Great Expectations. There is clearly a conviction on the part of the author of the powerful effect literature can have, regardless of when  and where a book was written, on people in totally different geographical and time contexts.. One reviewer could not see how illiterate villagers in an island in the Pacific Ocean could appreciate Dickens. Such criticism is devaluing the mental capacities of even the poorest human beings, in any country, and at any time. In fact, Mr Pip shows that complexities of thinking and relationships can be profound even in such societies.    There are many underlying themes in the book that literary students will greatly enjoy exploring. The result would be an enriching of their geographical and historical understanding.
B000NQPZCY|2.0|I've heard good things about the original version. I can only assume the director screwed up this version. I wish they would leave a good movie alone. Are their any \\"Director Cut\\" versions better than the original? In this case it was a screw-up.
015206396X|5.0|The summary does not do this book justice, but if it did than it would spoil the book.  I felt like I was actually experience the adventure alongside the main characters.  This is definitely worth your buy and holds the attention of any age reader.  I am 23, a new nurse, and this book help distracted me from the many stresses of life.  I gave it to my 76 year old grandma and she also loved it.  If you like adventure, excitement, and a little bit of romance than this book will suit you well.  I also recommend Fire by Kristin Cashorn.  Good reading!
B002WY65VU|1.0|There is a percentage of the population that is fascinated by moving images on rectangular surfaces. This population which spends an inordinate amount of it's lifespan in front of monitors and screens seems to have been frozen in a zombie like state since around the developmentally critical age of 13. This state coincides with the intellectually lower requirement for entertainment of seeing makeup laden people awkwardly moving about. Once called, appropriately,  slapstick now is called dark comedy. This movie is postured as good parody; well parody requires something of substance to parody - vacuous fluff can't be parodied.     Or, put another way, same old retreads - no new story (actually no story whatsoever), nothing creative, poor acting (didn't require much anyway and  Harrelson peaked in the Bball movie and has been fouling out since then. This one requires a technical.), cheap sets (except for borrowing someone's Hollywood home for a few shots). OK, I relent there was, admittedly, slightly better makeup on the Zs (but as \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" would say: ****-a-doodle-doo, that's momentous).
B002MRRRAA|5.0|I had heard about this coming out and was excited to see a concert on DVD that was well spoken of. I saw them only once in concert live and it was on the last tour they did before Kurt died. It was at a fairground in Ogden Utah, and I remember crappy sound and alot of mud, ect. This testament to the genius of the band is worth every penny to true fans. Nice to see them in true form. Fans, don't miss it!

The author demonizes modern portfolio theory, Gaussian distribution applied to market analysis and the Economics Nobel prize committee. This is what he offers in return::<br /><br />1 - The country names (not coined by Taleb) \\"Extremistan\\" the land tyrannized by the accidental and \\"Mediocristan\\", the land tyrannized by the ordinary;<br />2 - An imaginary Russian novel writer that loves a real book (a book within the book within the book) Il Deserto Dei Tartari;<br />3 - An stereotyped (in an offensive way) street-smart trader (also imaginary);<br />4 - An stereotyped (in an offensive way) nerdy intellectual (also imaginary);<br />5 - The concept that risk analysis is an art rather than a science that cannot be learned from a book (so why should you buy Black Swan?);<br />6 - A mere mention without the faintest useful explanation of fractal theory;<br /><br />The book should be an article. It could be replaced by the prologue, a few tables and the note on page 225. The book was published during the first semester of 2007 so I take it was finished at the end of 2006 and it says in the notes that Freddie Mac and Fanny Mae were sitting over a barrel of dynamite and that the growing concentration of financial institutions were creating the \\"too big to fail\\" disaster.

0547258305|5.0|I personally loved this book. It was extremely well wrtten, exciting, adventurous, and also it has enough romance that keeps you interested, but not so much that it feels like you're reading the Twilight series, AGAIN. I would recommend this book to girls who have an independant spirit and love adventure, or who just like to read about it. This book is about a girl named Katsa who is treated like a monter because she is graced (has a special power) to kill. She is thought to be just an animal that is controlled by her cruel uncle, until aanother graced fighter comes to look for his kidnapped grandfather and to train with Katsa. The other fighter, named Po, convinces Katsa to stand up for herself and disobey her uncle. She does with the result of feeling like a free person finally and the ability to do whatever she wants. She goes on a journey with Po to go and look for a reason that his grandfather was stolen. They find more than that on their journey full of adventures, and Katsa goes through some unexpected changes. With some surprising details and some half-expected changes in Katsa's life and the storyline the book ends in a wonderful way which leaves the reader wanting more. I loved this book and the only thing that helped me be not too sad about not having anymore pages to turn was the thought of the sequel just within my reach (at the library). I would read this book over and over again because of how much joy and excitment that came out of me reading it. I hope that the sequel will be as good as the first book, but it might be hard seeing as the first book was so good.

0307408833|1.0|The hype drew me in but when I invested in the expensive ingredients and made the red velvet cupcakes with vanilla frosting.... well..just ho hum. Dry cake & not enough cocoa, frosting passable but nothing close to the ravings by her fan club.      Did you notice that she does a bait and switch?  A page entitled Happy Hour is devoted to gushing about her \\"fabled frosting shots\\" sold at the bakery but then she executes a bait and switch - hey, the frosting recipe in this book is NOTHING LIKE the frosting in those \\"fabled frosting shots\\" at the bakery so while she encourages us to also serve up frosting shots too, our frostings shots will be terrible in comparison.  Hmmmm, she obviously did not give us the bakery recipes which is WHY I BOUGHT THE BOOK for heaven's sakes!  If she was not going to give us the babycake bakery recipes she should NOT have produced this book.  Honestly - where is the integrity?      All in all - great photos, fun font, but the silly writing, poorly tested recipes, and lack of integrity has cemented my decision to not bother visiting her bakery.  Some of the writing actually made me gag \\"towering ode to the magical pairing of mint and chocolate\\"  Was the editor out to lunch?  I felt the author was trying to pull a fast one but we are not taken in that easily - the food is just not that great no matter how many laudatory adjectives she uses.  I would have given it 2 stars but the annoying, self-congratulatory rhetoric was enough to demote this book to 1 star. IMO, the author should stop reading her celebrity fan mail and work a little harder at testing her recipes.  I know, I know, it is just not as much fun.
B00001OH80|4.0|I know everyone who is a hardcore fan doesn't like this album ,but please calm down. Lets look at it for a moment. All albums reflect the time they were released in.This is 1984 to a tee. Heavy dance and sythn tracks etc. Very few people could have covered the wide range of musical genres that Bowie does on this album. I can't believe so many people hate the reggae version of \\"dont look down\\". I mean the guy never gets pigeonholed by music. He simply does what he likes and pulls it off. Is this his best album? No. Is it bad? No! Give this CD a play. I bet once you put this in you won't pull it out until it's over! Feel me! Peace!

B000F5GO0A|1.0|This for me is the second worst path an influence from Balkan traditional music can take.  The very worst would be Turbofolk, the Serbian genre which blends the worst possible Balkan Ethnic music with horrible pop music.    So here's how it works, you have an American guy who goes to Paris, meets a Serbian guy who exposes him to Balkan Brass Bands and without ever even going to Balkans or the real Eastern Europe (farthest he ever went was Prague) makes an album of monotonous and emotionally stale music trying his very best to rip off some of the greatest music of the world.    Now a lot of people really like this record.  Okay, yes, I understand this could be great for you if you have never heard the real music that he is trying to rip off.  Go listen to the album Zlatna Truba by Boban Markovic Orchestra [[ASIN:B0028KOSDU Zlatna Truba]] and then you will hear how stale this Beirut stuff sounds.  Go to the Gucha festival in August and then you can see what Balkan Brass Music is supposed to be.    Furthermore, the name of the band Beirut, has nothing to do with the style.  He admits he just picked it randomly.  In addition to that, the song titles have nothing to do with the music.  Calling a song of your bad knock off of Balkan music \\"Bratislava\\" is like recording a song of badly played New Orleans Jazz and calling it \\"Montreal\\" something completely inauthentic.    This album is just for people in the west who want to have some exotic ideas of Balkan music without ever going to Balkans and trying to understand the culture.

1439102937|3.0|For her third book, I felt Lauren Weisberger slipped back in her literary talent a bit. I couldn't put the first two down but I kept getting distracted on this one. It's not that the story line wasn't intriguing but did we have to be reminded in every chapter that the three main characters were going through their 30 year old crisis? I never did get invested heavily in the girls and the one character who intrigued me (Jesse) was barely fleshed out. The city of New York naturally is a character all its own and I enjoyed the descriptions and placement of the storylines in and around the city.    Wait until you can buy it used.
B000FA5TTW|1.0|This book starts out interestingly enough, but fizzles into a tedious account of the boring goings-on of every minor character, with no resolution to speak of. The story left me feeling like I'd had cotton balls for dinner: still hungry, and confused about why I wasted so much time on something so purposeless.    I can't give you my reason for disliking this book without spoiling the ending, but let's just say that if I were going to write a parody of The Lovely Bones, I would leave the last 100 pages completely blank.
1416583408|5.0|I don't think this book was intended to be a scientific paper on dog intellect or dog training.  It was for the many dog lovers that want to know a little more about how their dogs think.  It was the first book I have read and immediately started to read again when finished. And, the cover was so appropriate!  My dogs already appreciate my training.
0307454541|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first in a trilogy of crime novels written by Stieg Larsson.  Originally published in Swedish, it was an international best seller long before I ever heard of it.  I am not typically a fan of modern crime novels, but some rave ratings on goodreads persuaded me to give this one a try.<br /><br />From the first chapters, I was hooked, even though the novel starts slowly and develops over time.  I suppose what pulled me in is how well written and translated it is and the dynamic and interesting characters.  The mystery itself intrigued me, a classic \\"locked-room format in an island setting\\" as the protagonist, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, describes.<br /><br />The titular character is a hacker turned private investigator who gives the novel a certain edge.  She's likely a woman with Asperger's Syndrome, but in spite of her difficulties connecting with people, she is extremely sympathetic to readers, and forms an instant bond with Blomkvist that is genuine and believable.<br /><br />The original title was Men Who Hated Women, and there is a fair amount of misogyny and some descriptions of violence, particularly against women.  I didn't find them gratuitous or excessive, but be forewarned.  Eagerly anticipating the next two installments, I am also sad that Larsson died so young without being able to give readers even more to look forward to.  (8/10)
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I was born in 1958.  So I grew up as MJ grew up.  I always loved him, and his music and dancing.  In my 20's I joined a spa and the Jazz-ercize class worked out to \\"Off the Wall\\" 4 times a week.  I never got tired of it.  I kind of lost touch with Michael as the years went on.  I got married, had kids and started two bands of my own, in my spare time.  LOL.  BUT  Michael's death really hit me hard.  I think because he was my age, and I realized what a massively talented person he was. I bought \\"This is It\\", because I missed it in the theaters.  Then I decided to see what Michael's last tour was like so I bought \\"Live in Bucharest\\".  HOLY CROW!! He never stops moving, and he is definitely NOT lip-synching to any of his music.  There are times he is so out of breath, he falls to his knees, or even flat on his face and just lies there.  The crowd goes wild.  Then he picks himself back up and starts again.  He goes from one gut-busting song to the next.  You can see his chest heaving from excursion.  I have never, in all my life, seen a performer give so much of themselves to an audience.  He is just out there, totally for them, heart and soul.  I would have to say Michael Jackson is the greatest showman I have ever seen. He can cause havoc in the crowd with a tilt of his hat.  What more can I say.  Get the DVD.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Allen Bauer is rescued from drowning as a young boy off Cape Cod by a young mermaid. Years later he returns to the same location, and once again manages to fall into the sea, and is rescued once more by the mermaid, Allen isn't sure what he's seen and what he's imagined. The mermaid decides to search for Allen in New York, sprouting legs when her tail dries. On finding Allen, they fall in love, but she has a secret, which will no longer be a secret if she gets her legs wet. If you grew up in the 80's, you can see why this movie still is a great classic. Great acting from Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah and a story line that can be taken funny as well as seriously. If you didn't see this movie in the 80's you probably won't appreciate it that much. Splash never gets tiresome no matter how many times you see it.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|First of all, with the correct setup, you can use HDMI sound. If your TV is equiped with a(n) \\"Audio Out\\" then you are in buisness. TV Audio out is almost always on, even if not being used. It transfers all sound on TV to the componant plugs so you can run your tv through a sterio or any other device yo want. If you run your PS3 on HDMI, than the sound is already being transferred to this componant plug. If you already forward this sound to a tuner, you can put the P21 RCA plugs in line and reconnect to your tuner. Now, sound will go to your P21 and you DO NOT need to turn your tuner on. If you dont have sound running yet, simply buy a small 3 foot length rca set, hook up to tv, put P21 plugs in line.. and Walla! you have game sound. Doing this, you do not need to re set up your ps3 sound, and you will run full HDMI all the time. ( just make sure the red and white plugs are not touching if they are dangling )  Now, the Headset themselves, they are awesome. the buzzing sound some people here is because the red and white  sound connectors are close or touching. There is still a little ambient sound but it is gone during game play.  I am currently trying to get the rest of my MW2 team to get these. I was hiding in afgan and I heard footsteps a mile a way. I got the drop over and over again... SWEEET Setup!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|This is the best series I've seen on DVD.  It's much better than \\"24\\".  It's a must have!
B001SO6KNS|5.0|are you kidding?! get this movie! only on blu ray though. im not gonna get into that but if your iffy about the dvd read some reviews about it, does this movie no justice, pretty much just cheap quality all around.  anyway back to blu ray, this movie is the shiznit-O-bang! yeah just like that. its a pricey blu ray but well worth it i say. the english subtitles on this is B+ at its best. lets face it when it comes to the chinese trying to translate to english they do a crap job only because its an import.  dont get me wrong, you still understand everything thats going on in the movie, its just some of the dialogue makes no sense.  fight scenes, come on, its all about the fights. this is one of the best action ive seen in a long time trust me.  this movie has a mix of everything in it. your gonna love my nuts.
B001TD1XWG|1.0|This album is medicore at best and horrible on any given day. The beats are very basic and I feel if he were going for a rock theme they could at least used better beat. My second problem with this ablum is that his lyrics are weak. I have heard Lil Wayne's mixtapes that were better, his metaphors are horrible also. It sounds as if he were making \\"high music\\". 1 of the 2 songs I actually like Drop the world, the only reason I like it was Em's verse inwhich he killed Lil Wayne. This album is not worth buying may while serving time The Carter 4 will be better since it cannot get worse.
B001W79MB8|5.0|good movie especially in blu ray.  i wouldnt compare this with any other animes but its not very original.  the fight scenes...dope!  bloody squirts, bloody limbs, bloody mess.  characters are cool, everyone gots their own fighting style. whats even cool is they speak chinese also.  yeah, when the foreigners speak to the japanese its in chinese they dont understand each other they need an interperter, but the confusing part is when the foreigners speak to each other its in japanese (gotta watch the movie to understand what im saying).  i believe they did this so the japanese audience dont have to read subtitles. oh by the way i watch english subs.  havent seen this movie in english so cant tell you how that goes. anyway great movie i only wish i watched this before ip man (another great movie, if not awesome!) because i cant get enough of ip man, but if you got money check out ip man for blu ray and check this anime out too because it rocks.
B0009X766Y|5.0|Loved this movie when it was new and still adore it.  Newman and Redford were perfect together and separately.  The con they pulled was so elaborate that it still makes me laugh to think about it.  This movie could be compared to the Oceans Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen.  Lots of fun.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I first bought this version of the series a week before Christmas 2009.  It was an incredible price of $43.00 which I thought was stellar.  It contained both seasons for the price on just one (at your local wal-mart or best buy).  With the holiday free shipping thrown in I had to grab it.  I instantly returned my individual copies (unopened) to the store and saved over $50.00!  Well.. I was even more surprised when this collection arrived and I unboxed it.  I've been an avid collector of DVD's and series, with over 500 DVD's, 100 Blu-Rays, and 30 complete series.  I've never seen such quality put into a DVD holder.  I was expecting to get a cheap box with two seasons of discs crammed into skinny holder like you usually get when you order a \\"the complete season of\\" at a ludicrously low price.  My surprise made Christmas all the better.    I've watched the complete season minus the last episode of season two (which i don't think was ever even aired?).  Anyways I immediately began watching the series all over again on the DVD's.  I did not encounter a single problem with sound or picture.  I found the experience to be just wonderful.  Two months later I have now watched the whole series twice over with my new DVD collection.  The box still stands in the same condition that I got it in with no signs of wear starting to show.  I anticipate with proper care this casing will never break down on you like standard series boxes tend to do.    For those people wanting a review on the series and not on the casing or the DVD quality.  I'll throw a brief summary up.    The series focuses around the period of 60 BC to 29 BC, with the first season following the accounts of Julius Caesar and his triumph of Rome.  Followed by his assassination at the end of the first season, the second picks up with his legally declared adopted son Octavian Caesar (later known as Augustus) taking up leadership.  It proceeds to depict the problems between Mark Antony and Octavian as they fight for political power.  Leading up until 30 BC when Mark Antony takes his own life along with Cleopatra after the split of the second triumvirate.  Octavian is now still a young man with all of Rome at his fingertips and no opposers left to challenge him.      I rate the series at a remarkable 5 stars overall.  However I would have to say I would have loved to see the series run longer than two seasons.  Where the first season does a magnificent job to follow along in a slow and progressive story.  The second season is very rushed often jumping years to a decade per episode.  Don't get me wrong, it is all very well done and some how they pulled a bold move like that off.  But I would've loved to had seen it stretched out over a possible third or fourth season.  In any event, perhaps it was for the best.  This way they never had the chance to ruin it like they tend to do when trying to make shows appealing to all audiences over the course of several seasons.  Be prepared for a very breathtaking and heart warming adventure with an incredibly climactic and sad conclusion.  But alas, that is Rome.
B0026RHR6K|2.0|BSG in the beginning looked like it could have been a worthy contender to match or even outdo JMS's epic 5 year story arc 'Babylon 5' B5 made us invest emotionally in the characters and their journey of development, an investment which was ultimately worthwhile. BSG in the beginning offered something similar but failed to deliver. It also failed to deliver a coherent story arc - the so called 'plan' was never realised - but was instead a massively wasted opportunity.    Ronald D Moore was given the task of turning a turkey of a TV series from the 70's into a relevant, highly watchable and engrossing contemporary show with an overarching story arc. In the first 2 or 3 seasons it looked like he was going to pull that 'miracle' off.  But no from the 3rd season onwards with a couple of notable exceptions story wise he turned it back into a turkey.    BSG has been an infuriating roller coaster ride. Often it has been a truly great TV series and at other times it has lost the plot completely.    What could have been a truly great show has fallen flat on its face with the fourth series and the final episode. The plot threads we all hoped would be at least partially explained have been written off as the work of God.    RDM has used \\"deus ex machina\\" to tie the series up. This plot device is the ultimate sin of any writer and has to be ultimate cop out in a show of this stature.    Basically this means that RDM can finish off the story using the absurdist teleology \\"God did it in his mysterious way.\\"    As H.G. Wells himself said regarding the deus ex machina, \\"If anything is possible, then nothing is interesting.\\"    Well, with God, anything can happen. Aristotle also said something similar way back when- and i think we can agree HE was a wise man.    The story was much richer and open to more interpretation when the gods were portrayed through faith as metaphor, but the Gods are cast as real and cannot be really interpreted in any other way.    Season 4's religious infatuation was a huge indicator of the direction this whole thing was falling into. The religious cliched chocolate box picture lid dreams of cancer victims sailing on the boat over the river to meet the loved ones on the other side etc. Surely a program of this stature could add more substance and pragmatism to such dark occurrances of dealing with terminal illness?    Many have said that the religious content was implicit from the start. This is true, but one can criticise the way the religious subtext has been handled throughout the series. Galactica's God is an interventionist God whose machinations and interference only devalues all the great work put into the characterisations and great acting. The motivations of the characters loses all meaning in this deterministic universe. The characters lose all responsibility for their own actions...remember this is God's plan. So 4 years of brilliant character driven plots and motivations gets flushed down the cosmic toilet.    Even earlier prophecies made by the Cylon Hybrids were ignored or just passed over without further mention.    Any reasonably explained scientific rationalism has been ditched completely, so those looking for any self consistent rules to be played out will be disappointed. Hard SF fans will be disappointed. Especially those wise enough to understand that the universe is not a deterministic clockwork one in the Newtonian sense but intrinsically indeterminate in the quantum paradigm/chaos theory..    If you try to analyse the show through the religious route it fails even more spectacularly and shoots itself in the head throughout the whole 4th series. There are far too many variables where God has to work in mysterious ways to get the characters to where they finally end up. This just confirms the lack of a truly coherent and consistent story arc.  The final hour of this tragedy dismantles anything built up over the 4 years of hard graft. The only way the religious theme worked at all was that the Cylons belief in the one true god gave them motivation to ethnically cleanse the immoral humans and their false gods (sound familiar?)    There are also many bad mistakes along the way. The major one being the position of stars in the constellations in the tomb of Athena way back in season 2. The constellations (position and names of the stars) indicate they are the same ones we see in our night sky. The constellations on scorched earth matched these. This meant that scorched earth should have been our Earth. When our Earth is eventually found the constellation idea has been quietly dropped. And this was supposed to be a major event.    The references which places BSG to our culture like greek gods mythology, telephones, radar, turns of language etc is ignored by placing the finale in the deep past. There is no way these references could have survived to have an effect. RDM uses the ridiculous unprovable idea of collective consciousness to cover that one. Anyhow God wrote \\"all along the watchtower\\" (not Bob Dylan sorry)and implanted it in various characters over the series.    The 7th Cylon was also an error and had to be hastily passed over. (whoops someone forgot how to count to 12!)    The evidently important opera house vision was passed off lamely in an ill thought out couple of minutes. It therefore became totally meaningless. This too had been built up to be a major event.    Even if the constellations matched our earth's or any other, the position of the stars would be very different (not even close)because Moore decided to use Earth 150,000 years ago. It just doesn't pan out at all. By using the star patterns depicted this should have meant that the end of galactica should have been in our future - not in our past as presented here. There are many, many other examples of these kind of mistakes littered over the 4 seasons.    The ending using Mitochondrial eve idea was cliched beyond belief. The Mitochondrial Eve of 200,000 years ago is NOT our common ancestor,or even common genetic ancestor. She is the most-recent common ancestor of all humans alive on Earth today with respect to matrilineal descent. That may seem like a mouthful, but without even a single one of those qualifying phrases, any description or discussion of the ME reduces to a lot of nonsense. ME is an ill named genetic based mathematical model and nothing to do with Adam and Eve pseudo scientific creationism as depicted by this show.    Basically it was stated that the 12 colony humans were highly compatible with the early humans found on \\"Earth.\\" This meant that Hera's DNA,Cylon DNA and 12 colony DNA was practically identical. This is absurd as the 12th colony was stated (inaccurately) to be a million light years away from earth. This would mean that for the 2 species of Earth and 12 colonies the DNA being so close was well nigh impossible. And there is no way that the evolution of both worlds be so convergent (or as in this case identical) This is at least openly admitted by the show but swept under the carpet with the \\"God's will\\" magic wand. Basically this just smacks of pseudo scientific creationism. If the DNA was different enough to Earth mitochondrial DNA it would mean that we would not now be related genetically to our primates or anything else in our evolutionary past. We would be genetically tied to Hera instead. This is absurd. The main point is that if Hera's DNA was so close to human DNA there would be no importance or reason whatsoever for her to be the basis of our own human-ness. It is totally pointless. So why bother at all?    The rest of Galactica's crew from the pragmatic view of human history must have been wiped out completely anyway. The galacticans ironically all agree in a consensus never seen in all 4 conflict filled series to destroy all their technology and settle all over the globe.... to die out with a whimper. maybe RDM thought he was still writing for Star Trek and invoked the ridiculous concept of the prime directive subconsciously? The Hominids didn't leave Africa until 60,000 years ago. and modern humans evolved there 150,000 years ago. So how do the galacticans help humans and give them the best part of them for the future? No records, no archeology, no technology etc. mass suicide...yes.    The survivors suddenly just become thoughtless consensual drones of a religious god as in Python's satirical warning in \\"the life of Brian.\\"  The weekly conflict between factions is swept under the carpet.    One of the main themes of this show was \\"are we worthy to survive?\\" and this brought in many valid questions as well as answers to this in a religious context. The religious content WAS implicit from the start, but there was a better balance between gritty stark reality and religion in the first 3 seasons. The series has really gone off the rails since mid way through series 3. The last season taken as a whole had few highpoints and it wasted a lot of precious time on nonsense which was never expounded consistently. ie: the final 5 cylons, who was the 5th cylon? (who cares? It didn't matter a jot anyway to the plot) How did Starbuck return from the dead? Why did they find her body/viper many light years from where it met its end? Why write her out and then bring her back? A lot of these elements felt like mere dramatic plot devices and didn't go anywhere. This just devalued Starbucks meaty role into that of a mere pawn.    When the show was good it was the best there's ever been. The mini series, the episodes about the Pegasus, the New Caprica plot lines, the rise of Tom Zarek, the collaborator witch hunts, the black market, the insurrection, scorched Earth et al.    The final episodes are entertaining in a superficial way but just fall apart under any kind of scrutiny.    The cast gave exceptional performances, some of the writing was excellent, some dire and the cgi was of feature film quality.    Many episodes in this final set felt like mere padding. It would have been a much better ending if they had finished the series half way through when they found scorched Earth. It would have been BRAVER. But no the ending RDM used renders the actions of previous seasons pointless. Re watching the series becomes a redundant act - knowing what you know at the end.    It became ever more apparent as season 4 imploded in on itself that they were just making it up as they went along.    I know this review may upset some fans, but after checking out the BSG blog sites a lot of fans feel let down. I have been a big fan of the show and found it to be at its best when it was most pragmatic/political/sociological/psychological. But this is my opinion which i have a right to exercise.    If this is the best RDM can do i feel inclined not to buy the final season and will probably give the forthcoming \\"Caprica\\" and \\"The Plan\\" a wide berth. If RDM can incurr a miraculous creationist interventionist God here there's no reason he won't use it again down the line.    BSG had great potential which it failed to recognise. Like many TV shows before and i suppose many more which will follow this will happen again and again and again.....    The real tragedy of BSG is that the series was built upon great characters grounded in a real world political social context. The first 3 seasons and part of season 4 built strongly upon these compelling themes. The final season dismantled these great themes and made them utterly pointless. The finale is probably the most disappointing end to a series i have ever seen. It is all the more disappointing because the show WAS so brilliant to start with.    BSG will sadly be remembered as the show that started off great but had the stupid ending.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|Just my personal opinion. In the story of Jane Eyre, one my favorite scenes is the \\"burning bed.\\" This movie just ruined it. I was so excited when it was time for this scene in the movie, then I just wanted to scream. Mr. Rochester's snippy but funny remarks during this scene were completely left out. (\\"Is there a flood?\\" \\"Is there a plot to drown me?\\" ) I can't even imagine that changing this scene was approved.  I gave it two stars because I did like the look of the actors.
0786868724|4.0|He's done it again!  Mitch Albom asks the questions so many of us want to ask about spirituality, religion, and God.

B001TD1XWG|2.0|Lil Wayne's Rebirth is finally in stores after months of speculation and anticipation of its release; an experimental Rock inspired album.  All I really have to say is...well...it's here!    In late December of 2009, this website accidentally shipped out copies of this album to fans that had pre-ordered it.  Apparently the release date was changed and Amazon didn't get that memo.  Anyhow with the album in the hands of fans well before the release date, Rebirth inevitably leaked out the same exact day.  Originally, Rebirth was supposed to be released as a double album alongside the Young Money debut album.  Rightfully so because they are both equally mediocre and disappointing.    Unlike other fans, I don't have a problem with rappers stepping out of their element and attempting other genres.  Rock inspired albums have been done before as well as R&B and Jazz inspired albums (Guru - Jazzmatazz, Andre 3000 - Love Below, Kanye -808s, Public Enemy etc. etc.).  I also don't think Rebirth is as bad as some people are making it out to be...it's not particularly good either but it's decent.      Rebirth features production from the Legendary J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, as well as DJ Infamous, Cool & Dre, Tha Bizness and other producers.  That is why I say the album is Rock Inspired instead of being a true Rock album.  Nonetheless a majority of the beats are surprisingly decent.  Lil Wayne also is a completely horrible \\"singer\\" and that term is used very loosely.  He has absolutely no singing talent whatsoever so inevitably (Did I watch the Matrix recently???  I might be) autotune is present and not to pleasing effects.  His droning goes on for the length of the album and quite honestly by track or 6 or 7 you've had enough of it.  I feel he would've fared better just rapping on Rock beats.      Despite it's inefficiencies, there are a few songs worth listening to.  The collaboration with Eminem, Drop The World, proves to be extremely good and it seems like Eminem is back on trackfrom his tragedy which was Relapse (that somehow won a Grammy???...I'm flabbergasted at that revelation...completely dumbfounded..oh yeah I forgot the Grammy's are a popularity contest).  Shanell contributes nicely to the album (which she didn't do on the Young Money album) as Running and American Star are pretty good songs.  One Way Trip is one of the better songs on the album and is produced by Travis Barker.  This is one of those songs where he just raps over the Rock beat and the effect is substantial.  My favorite song, however, is On Fire.  It's just a great song.  I'll pass on everything else though.      All in all, Rebirth is a serviceable album comparable to the Young Money album in terms of quality.  It's not really worth buying, in my opinion, although there are some songs of great quality.  I'd only recommend this one for die hard fans. 2.5 stars
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I read this book in one day! I give it four only because the story is a little predictable and follows the \\"typical\\" love story cliche's throughout.  However, if you're in the mood for a typical girly romance story that actually doesn't end with \\"happy ever after\\" then its definitely an easy read and it will hit the spot.  Without giving too much away which is hard to do because its really not that complex at all, the story centers around John Tyree who having grown up as somewhat of a bad apple ends up enlisting in the army.  On one of his leaves he falls for a kind, caring and gentle hearted girl named Savannah.  This story teaches you a great lesson in what true love means, sacrificing what you need in order to make sure your loved one is happy.

B000001EL3|5.0|If you had not heard of KISS after Alive! was released in 1975, then you absolutely knew who they were after Destroyer came out in 1976. There is no denying that this is THE album that made KISS a household name. I remember radio stations playing the songs Shout It Out Loud and King of The Night Time World. The latter song was also played on television on the Paul Lynde halloween special, and this appearance broadened KISS' exposure to new heights. Oddly, I do not remember hearing Beth on the radio at all...guess it was because I didn't listen to AM radio at the time.    This album is a must have in anyone's rock music collection.

We love the ending.  I think it's great that the princess decides to move on w/out the prince.  I know I did!
0783223668|5.0|For those of you who know Clint Eastwood primarily for his role as Dirty Harry, here is your chance to see him at his absolute finest as an actor and as a director.  Even if you're not necessarily a huge fan of westerns (can't say that I am either), this best of the best is a \\"must see\\".  I think the reason westerns were so popular in Hollywood is that the lawless anarchy of the wild west gives a truer glimpse into man's soul. Eastwood's character strolls into town in surreal fashion on horseback in a scene that kind of reminds me of Omar Sharif riding into view on a camel in Lawrence of Arabia. He saves a town spineless, self serving people that he disdains only to settle an old score. The layers of the plot are slowly pealed away throughout the film, keeping your attention until the very end.  The casting of characters is also outstanding, especially the bad guys and the newly anointed sheriff.  In typical Clint Eastwood style, the film also has plenty of memorable one line zingers.  Pop a big bag of popcorn and enjoy!
0743297334|2.0|On my third attempt, I finally made it all the way through The Sun Also Rises.  I forced myself to finish it, even though the plot never engaged my interest and the dialog is terribly dated and worn.  I read it to see what make it a classic.  To me, the book doesn't stand the test of time.  To quickly paraphrase the story:  We ate.  We walked over there.  We drank and ate.  We walked over here.  We argued.  We watched a bullfight.  We drank some more...  If there is something \\"important\\" about this book I missed it.  If you're a fan of clever dialog and would like something a bit more current, I'd recommend \\"The City of Your Final Destination\\" by Peter Cameron or \\"The City of Thieves\\" by David Benioff.
0385523904|3.0|As evident by the length of reviews on this book already posted, this book about the North Korean regime and the ordeals of the six chronicled defectors is a worthwhile read and I don't need to summarize or highlight events in the book as others have already done so.    I'd like to make a few comments about the book from a Korean American perspective.  Some of the details of their lives in North Korean struck a cord in me, particularly Demick's attention to the culinary culture of the Koreans.  The detailed explanations of how they made Kimchi and buried them in terracotta or the process of making tofu from beans to the making of soup, reminded me that the North Koreans struck by the famine could easily have been my own mother, sisters, or brothers.  In light of the culinary tie, it was especially difficult to read about their starvation and constant concern for where their next meal would come from.  Further, Demick's treatment of the Confucius traditions that are so deeply ingrained in Koreans (perhaps more deeply ingrained in the North than the South who have given up many cultural traditions in recent times), revealed profound depth in the narratives of the defectors - their sense of duty to their parents and family - and further explained the twisted hold the Communist regime hand on the people (crimes against the state were often paid for by three generations of the family).  Despite their constant fear of the Party and their meager existence, the North Koreans truly believed that things could be much worse and were likely much worse in the West.   Nonetheless, it was not so much the ideology they questioned, but economics that finally broke the camel's back and drove them to China and subsequent defection to the South.  And while they may have gained freedom from the regime, and a significant increase in their standard of living, I can't help but feel they have also paid the price of loosing some of their Confucius Koreaness as they are now displaced in SouthKorea, away from the world and family they knew and forced to acculturate to the West.  I imagine the haunting memories and the continuing thoughts of the family they left behind makes them wonder if they are even free at all?  What good is the most advanced cellular telephone if one cannot reach out to their loved ones?  Do the fruits of living in the South make the past (and present) any more bearable?   It becomes less about ideological defection, and more about having them face their own demons - the choices they made in their fight for survival.   Moreover, their deep love for their \\"father\\" Kim Ill Sung cannot be simply forgotten.  The Confucius tie of a parent and offspring, of king and subject, are not easily broken. The book reveals that mothers and daughters, sons and fathers, love one another despite any differences. They don't have a choice in that.      (BTW - one dying father's last words in the book - \\"mother\\" instantly brought tears to my eyes).    Why the three stars?  Demick's work scratches just the surface and I don't think anyone should come away from this book thinking they are even close to a comprehensive understanding.  She needs to press on and uncover the deeper wounds from both sides of the DMZ.   I'd like Demick to go back, armed with these accounts of these defectors and delve deeper into the lives of the thousands of defectors living in the South, the constant watchful eye of the South Korean government, the cases of North Korean abduction of South Koreans, and the countless Koreans living in Communist China.   There are more stories to tell from the hundreds of thousands, whose families are still torn apart.  Further, I'd like the public to know more about the failures of the West in bringing humanitarian aid to the North Koreans and not be simply satisfied with the story of theses six chronicled.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This album has absolutely rocked my world.  I just recently rediscovered Muse among my vast music collection, and realized that I had been missing out on a truly great band.  Perhaps I wasn't ready for it when I bought it?  Anyway, Muse in general is an amazing band, and I highly recommend them to anyone who is more... adventurous in their musical tastes.  If you are just starting out with Muse, Black Holes and Revelations might be a better place to begin.    This particular album is a work of art.  However, it is an ALBUM.  It's not really for downloading single songs, as you will most certainly miss out on an integral part/feeling of the album.     For those who are disappointed by The Resistance, I think this merely represents a personal taste difference, because I have found this album to far surpass some of Muse's other work, at least musically.  The songs here have some great lyrics, but I am more interested in the artful musical composition influenced by many different styles (see also Absolution).  Bellamy really shows the power and beauty of his vocals here, and I am supremely impressed.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I agree totally with the 5 stars given in other reviews of this wonderful Dicken's LITTLE DORRIT, including the Masterpiece Theatre's outstanding version of the story. It concerns the odd institution of Old London's debtor's prison.<br /><br />I'm not sure why I never read the book, the title may have thrown me off. It sounded just a little too sentimental--even for the melodramatic style of the great writer. In a sense it is a little different from CD's usual themes of class & oppression. Oh, that exists in LITTLE DORRIT, but there is a more gentle presentation here, balanced by every day life. Dickens' concern for the idea of Forgivness is here too, but not so many people to be forgiven. There is a surprising multi-racial theme as well, but only revealed in full near the conclusion. I am not aware of this idea existing in any other of Dickens'novels. The revealation in the plot very neatly ties up several subthemes. Like so many modern movies, the next to final action in LITTLE DORRITT is a stunning, Armagedon-like destruction. This too was a bit unusual for Dickens--and, of course, it works perfectly under his skilled vision.<br /><br />Also, like so much of CD's work, LITTLE DORRIT is highly autobiographical, perhaps more so than the other novels. The theme of debtor's prison struck home to Dickens because his financially irresponsible father ended up in one. The child Dickens was sent to live & work in a printer's shop in order to pay off his father's debts in order to get him released. It was not a pleasant experience. What hurt the boy most was how easily his mother acquiesced in his forced servitude. He never really got over his feeling of betrayal. Strangely perhaps, he was often less than fair in dealing with his own wife & children (there is a character in the book who is a rather cruel parody of his overweight wife.). All this aside, LITTLE DORRIT is neither an angry or bitter tale. It is more a love story told in the many facets of that emotion.<br /><br />If you're building a DVD library, you've got to include Dickens; and if you are building a Dickens section, this version of LITTLE DORRIT is an absolutely essential. Oh, yes...The book/movie is called \\"Little\\" Dorrit because the main character is short statured. I really didn't particularly notice this in Claire Foy who plays Dorrit. What I did notice is that she is a wonderful actress--and the actress playing her fickle yet loyal sister was excellent as well. I liked her make-up, sort of Edwardian-Gheisa. The British might not know how to cook, but they serve up great drama & theatre--and NOBODY can do Dickens better!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0009PVZMS The Charles Dickens Collection, Vol. 1 (Oliver Twist / Martin Chuzzlewit / Bleak House / Hard Times / Great Expectations / Our Mutual Friend)]]a DVD library, you've got to include Dickens; and if you are building a Dickens section, this version of LITTLE DORRIT is an absolutely essential.

B001EYGOEM|4.0|I gave this album 4 stars for numerous reasons. First of all, I realize that Taylor Swift wrote or co-wrote all the songs on this album. I feel like this album loses focus of what she is suppose to represent, which is COUNTRY music. I realize country music has changed like all other genres of music, but she should be classified as pop. Second, I felt like her first album was more complete and stuck to the roots of country music more so than this album. Those are really my only complaints. The tunes are very catchy; however I don't think this album is all what it was hyped up to be. I feel there are much better COUNTRY performers out there that don't get as much recognition at Taylor Swift.

0316042994|4.0|Evelyn Waugh made his name with acidly satirical novels focusing largely on the British upper classes' early twentieth century decline. Brideshead Revisited, ironically probably his most famous work, has similar themes but differs substantially in not being primarily satirical. There is some trademark Waugh wit to be sure, especially for those on the lookout, but this is more conventionally serious and ambitious. Not easy to classify, it is part comedy of manners, part historical fiction, and part romance; there are also quite a few comic and didactic elements and some symbolism. All this strongly suggests that Waugh was going for a masterpiece, and many fans and critics have called it such. It is certainly a commendable novel that deserves the high reputation it still has and is exemplary for characterization, a well-told story, and generally strong writing. The issue of whether it is Waugh's best book is essentially subjective, but it is certainly his broadest and probably his best written in conventional terms. However, it is brought down somewhat by a weak ending that makes the execution less stellar than Waugh's satirical masterworks and also harms his didactic purpose. This does not stop it from being an excellent novel but does keep it from true greatness.<br /><br />Unlike most Waugh works, Brideshead functions on several levels. Charles Ryder, its first-person narrator, is still young but past his formative experiences; now a World War II British Army Captain, he looks back on the events that brought him to where he is and made him the man he is. Chronologically, there is a definite progression - if not necessarily progress - from relatively carefree, naïve youth to hard-won, belated adult wisdom. The novel can thus be legitimately seen as a bildungsroman - one that, moreover, many British men surely related to, as Ryder had many of his generation's characteristic experiences. This aspect is not strong enough to make Brideshead one of the great bildungsromans, but it is an important part of the book's worth and lasting value.<br /><br />More important is the Flyte family that is the focus for most of Ryder's important experiences as well as the titular homestead that is metonymically linked to them. Like the Last family in A Handful of Dust, Waugh's most enduring other work, they are a traditional upper-class British family struggling to keep up with modern society and maintain ancestral dignity. It is a tough battle, and history has shown that there were almost no survivors. Ryder comes from a class that is distinctly beneath them but close enough for him to become active in their affairs, and he sees their tragic disintegration as both observer and participant. They stand in for the many families like them, and there is much pathos in their story, which also brings out other emotions. This is all the more so in that, in contrast to Waugh's usual way, he does not poke fun at them. Their fall is portrayed in an unadorned manner, letting us draw our own conclusions about its social and historical meaning.<br /><br />As this suggests, Brideshead is a very moving and engrossing novel; it might not quite bring tears but draws us in and runs us through an emotional gamut. This is all the more notable in that, as in much of Waugh, no major character is likable. Only Cordelia, the youngest Flyte, and the family's Nanny Hawkins are even remotely so. The rest are vain, selfish, self-pitying, melodramatic, and more - yet, though they are far from conventionally sympathetic, we feel with, if not quite for, them. This is a triumph of Waugh's art, a trick only the best writers can pull off. The Flytes have a tragic flaw - the inherited pride the refuse to abandon -, and it proves to be their destruction in various ways. Objectively speaking, it is easy to say this is deserved, but it would take a hard heart not to have some feeling. There is a sense that they are doomed - if not necessarily victims of venomous fate, at least to alarge extent casualties of time and place. Their story is fascinating and emotional enough to make the book worth reading.<br /><br />However, there is quite a bit more to the novel. A realist triumph, it is a vivid portrait of a distinct era; we get a good idea of how various British groups lived and thought. There is much social observation, especially in regard to class, religion, and art. Brideshead is particularly valuable as a realistic document of pre-WWII British college life; the most surprising thing may be how little has changed. We also get an interesting glimpse of an era when Catholicism was still a great social stigma in England even among the gentry - a topic close to Waugh. Class relations are also variously explored in Ryder's interactions with the Flytes. Ryder's role as painter meanwhile interestingly dramatizes the artist's role in the era and may be meant as far-reaching symbolism again arguably touching the author. Finally, though only briefly, the novel vividly shows WWII's profound effect on all aspects of British life. All of this is engrossing and entertaining; much is moving, some is comic, and quite a bit is thought-provoking.<br /><br />Brideshead also benefits from one of modern literature's most memorable and moving, if unconventional, depictions of love. Ryder and Julia Flyte are not the most likable characters to ever fall in love but are among the most believably and vividly drawn; much of what they experience will be widely and movingly familiar. As one would expect with Waugh, their relationship is no fairy tale; Brideshead does a superb job of conveying love's constant ups and downs with verisimilitude and emotion.<br /><br />Ryder's relationship with Julia's brother Sebastian is nearly as interesting in this regard and far more so otherwise. It is a startling example of just how recently intense male friendships could be carried on openly in Western society without homosexuality rumors. The move away from this is of course farmore pronounced in America than in Europe, and the novel will certainly be far more of an eye-opener for Americans in this way. To what extent Waugh meant the relationship as homosexual, if at all, is of course debatable, and the seemingly ever-growing Queer Theory movement has few texts more open to explication, but there is much of sociological interest here for all.<br /><br />The novel could have been truly great, an undeniable masterpiece, if it only had an effective conclusion, but it unfortunately does not. The dubious tradition of having hedonistic and otherwise conventionally immoral characters undergo perfunctory religious conversion at a literary work's end goes back at least to Apuleius' [check]The Golden Ass, and this is unfortunately another entry. Waugh stated that the main theme is God's grace, and those paying any attention can see that it is, though there is no hint until the last few pages. The Flytes' troubled relationship with Catholicism is a theme throughout, and their trauma is the sort of thing that typically drives even the most guarded into desperation and thus religion, but the relative ease with which various members embrace it is simply absurd. The patriarch's deathbed conversion is particularly overwrought; however guilty his conscience, it is highly implausible. Far more significantly, Waugh fails to portray is convincingly. Ryder's anti-religious comments and actions throughout the scene have center stage, and any moderately engaged reader would think sympathy and strength are with him, yet Waugh would have us believe he is on the losing end. One critic aptly remarked that this episode would be one of Waugh's most brilliantly and subtly satirical if it were not meant so seriously - but unfortunately it is. The mercurial Julia's sudden conversion is far more plausible, especially as Waugh takes care to carefully foreshadow, but he should not be offended if many readers cynically question her sincerity and wonder how long her resolution will last. Most ridiculous of all is the conversion of Ryder. A staunch religion opponent throughout the novel lacking even the slightest sign of giving in, his change and newfound optimism, however uneasy, are simply unbelievable. He has had some difficult experiences but nothing to bring such a change. The sudden switch is almost self-parodical, an embarrassing artistic flaw leaving a bad taste in our proverbial mouths.<br /><br />I would dismiss all this as a cheap narrative trick in a lesser writer, but we must give Waugh the doubt's benefit. It is most likely a simple case of didacticism overcoming art; Waugh has a point to make about how God's mercy operates in seemingly illogical but ultimately beneficial ways but pushes far too hard. This would seem obvious even if we knew nothing about him, but there may be much biographical insight. Waugh converted to Catholicism not long before writing Brideshead and had a somewhat uneasy relationship with it for the rest of his life; most who have looked into it believe he was sincere even if hardly a model Christian. His desire to portray this in his work is very understandable, perhaps even inevitable, but many critics think that, like nearly all authors in similar situations, he let beliefs reduce artistry. Balancing them is extremely difficult and certainly not limited to religion; that Waugh could not is unfortunate but hardly surprising. This was the first real instance, but it is generally thought to infect his later writings to varying degrees. However, the ending thankfully does not ruin what is otherwise an excellent work, even if it does frustratingly hold off greatness.<br /><br />A few minor, additional warnings may be needed. Waugh is in my view one of modern fiction's great stylists, his conciseness, straight-forwardness, relative lack of allusion, and general avoidance of Modernist techniques making him stand out in an era when literature became ever less accessible. He may lean toward overly simple forsome, but he has the great virtue of clearness that I value highly and that is so sorely lacking in much post-nineteenth century literature. That said, what was concise and clear sixty-plus years ago is not exactly so now. Waugh is formal and, in contrast to much subsequent fiction, especially the popular kind, somewhat stiff. He was not really pretentious but can easily come off as such to those not prepared to take him on his own terms. He was also uber-British, and Brideshead is particularly so; the country's culture and history infuse every aspect of the novel. This is of course not a bad thing, but those unfamiliar with British culture and literature - or who are averse to it - may be somewhat averse to the novel. My advice to them and all others not immediately taken with the novel is to stick with it. The ending is certainly a letdown, but Brideshead as a whole is one of the best post-nineteenth century English novels and should be read by anyone even remotely interested in literature of its various types.
B000002MUW|5.0|I am going to make this review short and sweet and to the point. \\"Bedtime Stories\\" was the album released after \\"Erotica.\\" It is a fact that Madonna lost quite a few fans and was highly criticized after her Erotica album release along with her book titled \\"Sex.\\" So you are probably wondering what this previous album has to do with this review? Well, Bedtime Stories softened Madonna's image since her previous album distorted her image and cost her quite a few fans. I feel like Bedtime Stories was a very complete album for Madonna; however as stated this album was to \\"clean Madonna's image up from her previous criticized album.\\" I feel like this album was not recognized for how good it was. Hit songs off this album include: (In order of how they were released)  1.Secret 2. Take A Bow 3. Bedtime Story 4. Human Nature. My personal all-time favorite song is off this album and that is \\"Take A Bow.\\" I Hope this helped!
0743455967|5.0|I found the advice given to be excellent, honest, and very useful.  It probably saved me from making a lot of mistakes in writing and publishing.  King's language is clear and explicit.  I like that.  If he thought something was hogwash, he said so.  No beating around the bush.    His organization seemed quite strange and internally inconsistent, but I got the nuggets of advice anyway.  That's why I gave this book a five-star rating.    I had the impression that writing a \\"how to\\" book was alien to him.  Also, he was in the process of writing the book when he had his horrible accident.  It must have been extremely challenging to overcome his physical problems at the same time he was writing a difficult book.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I purchased these to help support my video game addiction. Don't worry everyone, I've got it under control... everytyhing in moderation you know.    Well, since my hands are a little on the large size, and I only play with my index fingers on top (the shoulders of the controller), these haven't really made a night-and-day difference for me and my skills. If I had to guess, I would say they probably do increase the reaction time from L1/R1 to the lower L2/R2 buttons. But it can be difficult to measure nano-seconds sometimes.    All and all, I do like them because not only do they help my family differentiate between \\"Dad's controller\\" and the other ones, but they also keep the bottom of the controller from getting beat up when I sit it down, by providing just enough lift at the front. Oh, and yes they probably help with reaction time while gaming too. A well spent $5 in my opinion.

The action and fighting scenes in this movie are truly realistic and brutal all the way to the end.  There are no over the top, futuristic crap in this movie, it's all gritty and dark, which is a FANTASTIC THING!!!!  If you are a Van Damme fan, or even an action movie fan, then this is a movie you won't want to miss!!!    P.S. Whatever bad review you see are probably Van Damme haters because this movie did not disappoint fans of the action genre.

B001PPGAIA|2.0|Then watch this movie.    I saw trailers for it, and it looked pretty good, so I decided to rent it. And wow. Just... wow.    I generally like Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman movies, but this one was a screw up, and I don't say that a lot about movies. It begins in a confusing swirl, with a cliche, overly-done beginning and the strange story of the mixed boy narrating it. The movies looks like a romance slash thriller, but it feels like the director was so ambitious to mix everything together, it just came out as a garbled mess. There's too many characters, and too many storylines, weaving in and out of it.    The story feels confusing, and unrealistic from the start. The \\"bad guys\\" are weird, petty little men who just get caught up in this sad excuse for a movie; the lead roles are boring and their accents made me crazy. Everything feels as brittle and cheap as its CGI. Let me say, the stabs the director and writers made at drama (such as the cow-stampede scene, and the part where the fat man gets trampled... wow, that made me laugh my butt off), romance (Nicole and Hugh's characters are drunk when they first kiss... true romance? NOT), humor (What beautiful creatures... CRACK... dead kangaroo), and suspense (when all the mixed children survived the Jap shooting, I was like, REALLY?) ... well, let's just say it came off badly. Not to mention to bizarre story including the mixed boy's grandpa, who pops up and follows everyone like a little creepy stalker... he never really talks, and he kinda reminded me of Rafiki from the Lion King, you know?    And it goes on for way too long, with what feels like multiple endings. Each character flits in and out of the story without much presence, and I found myself willing at least one character to be killed off so the movie would end. It literally feels endless, like the director had so many ideas he got carried away.    I could go on and on, but you get the idea. It's so full of cliche, cheesy, sickeningly flimsy, stupid partsthat... honestly, if this was to be a good movie, you'd have to trim it down so that only fifteen minutes were left. I am dead serious, it was a waste of my time. My eyes still kinda hurt from watching it for so long.     So if you're bored and really are wondering what this movie is about? Watch it. But don't even dream of spending twenty bucks on this movie, it's quite a failure. A big disappointment, by my standards, because it had so much potential, and I wanted to like it... but my feelings are mixed, and really, I just can't say I enjoyed spitting away nearly three hours on this movie.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|An albums that will grow with you and last a long time. The melodies and vocals are just so beautiful it's almost too much to handle.

Just listen to \\"Take Care\\" and tell me I'm wrong.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show is the funniest show I have ever seen on TV. Everyone I have introduced it to agrees. From my teenage kids to my brothers in their 60s- this is a show for everyone. Not only is it great humor, it is steeped in good, solid family values: love, support, doing what's right and always being there for each other- with laugh after laugh along the way. Can't wait for the DVD. I too have never bought a TV series before.
B0030BYWKK|1.0|This is one of the most monotonous and boring records I've heard in some time and I was a huge fan of this band. It's all just MOR , plodding and depressing (not in a cathartic way).

Oh well....
B002Y5FKUE|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best version of Sonnambula I have ever heard. No tenor can hold a candle to Juan Diego and the added ornaments in the arias give it an extra flare vs. the traditional versions I have heard.    While some people will get confused as to what was going on with the story and set, I generally did not have a problem with it as a whole. After 178 years, why not try something new with a set in order to appeal to a new generation. Did it work overall? Definitely not 100%, there were some questions I had, but the singing and acting quickly made those disappear. If you are a perfectionist or a purist, and feel that opera must always have the setting it was originally designed for, then this is not a dvd for you.    Overall the singing is without competition. Florez and Dessay make a great pairing again and create beautiful music together. This is a great dvd for starters of opera to experts and I cannot recommend it enough.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This film is the biggest load of tosh that I've ever had the misfortune to waste an hour and a half of my life on! HOW anyone could think otherwise is completely beyond my comprehension.    This 'film' (and I use the term here very spuriously) was just awful. The 'Special Effects' were a joke - particularly the ouija board bit; my 16 yr old media students produce better pixelation/stop motion animation than that by far. Did you see the plant in the background 'moving' - laugh? I nearly did!    I am so glad that I didn't waste any money going to the cinema to endure this drivel.     What annoys me is how many rave reviews this hogwash of a movie has got. People PLEASE! This will only encourage the making of more terrible conconctions of cinematic torture.    The only positive thing that I can take with me from this experience is that I got my wish.....I wanted them both to die! They did. It's just a shame that it took an hour and a half for it to happen.

B002ZIAC4O|5.0|Kieran Hebden is UK Dance act Four Tet, and \\"There Is Love in You\\" is his 5th album. His style is Jazz/Folk-speckled theatrical electronica, and apart from a few repetitive vocal loops (on opening pair of the sublime \\"Angel Echoes\\" -with what seems to be album title warbled repeatedly- and the skittery nine minute opus \\"Love Cry\\"), it is an album of instrumentals.<br /><br />The aptly titled \\"Circling\\" has a cyclic feel that leaves one almost giddy, \\"Pablo's Heart\\" is a brief interlude, while the choppy \\"Sing\\" throws in some disembodied-sounding harmonies. \\"This Unfolds\\" sets sparkly effects to a funereal pace, while the haunting \\"Reversing\\" is reverb-laden.<br /><br />\\"Plastic People\\" is more upbeat with twinkling pianos, as is the truly beautiful \\"She Just Likes To Fight\\" (the latter my favourite).<br /><br />Rich in detail, this is a album that just grows and grows till it engulfs you.
B00275EGWY|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The Hurt Locker is a decent film with a persuasive performance by Jeremy Renner in the lead, but long after it has convinced us of its central premise (\\"war is a drug\\") it keeps pounding the point home, leading to a running length that feels padded and several moments in which the pace slows to a crawl; I *wanted* to like this movie as much as everyone else but aside from the opening and closing action sequences it lacks tension and is certainly not the best film of 2009.    3/4

Now, almost two and a half years later, the artist has released his sophomore album, \\"The Boy Who Knew Too Much.\\"<br /><br />My initial comment when I listened to the album the first time: \\"Color me impressed.\\" After listening to the tracks, I immediately viewed the DVD (it was interesting, but not something that I'd probably watch again as I'll just watch the music videos on YouTube).<br /><br />Now that I've had an opportunity to listen to the album many times and see Mika perform the set live in Chicago, I wanted to add some additional commentary about this disc.<br /><br />My favorites on the album include Rain (Track 3), Blame it on the Girls (Track 2) and of course, the first single We Are Golden (Track 1). Blame It and We Are Golden are both songs that I love to dance to. Whenever I listen to rain, I become mellow and just get lost in the song (\\"When it rain and rain and rain and rains...\\")<br /><br />Blue Eyes (Track 6) was also released on the Songs For Sorrow EP. It reminds me of being on a beach. Some bongo drums, strumming guitars - another mellow song. Speaking of the EP, Toy Boy (Track 11) is another great, fun song that was also on the EP. Mika tells a story in Toy Boy; instead of a typical song with a chorus, the \\"song\\" is more of a story that Mika speaks/sings. An enjoyable listen.<br /><br />I See You (Track 5) is very haunting. The piano on this track is dramatic. In a way, it reminds me of Any Other World from Mika's Life in Cartoon Motion.<br /><br />While I've listened to the entire album many times, these are the tracks that stand out to me. Overall, I give this sophomore release 5-stars. Is it another Life in Cartoon Motion? No. And I'm ok with this. Do I enjoy it as much as LiCM? Yeah, I do. The Boy Who Knew Too Much has its own qualities that I very much enjoy, and showcases Mika yet again as a great performer.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|The Bottom Line:    I had seen the quickie English-language remake Quarantine (which has the advantage of boasting a better title but otherwise is largely the same film) before I sat down to watch [*REC] but this effective piece of horror still held my interest; it's not great and has some leaps of logic that might irritate you after the film, but it also contains some good scares and I recommend it to horror fans.    3/4
B00006I53S|5.0|This len is a very good len for the price. It has the Image Stabilization Technology which works pretty good and the range 28-135mm is also pretty good. Overall, the quality of picture is  clear & sharp. I am happy with this len.
B0008ENICU|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Joan Crawford is very good as Crystal and Norma Shearer and the rest of the all-female cast distinguish themselves, but the film is far too long (the pace slows down to a crawl when the narrative leaves New York City) and has too little plot to keep a viewer's interest for all 130 minutes; I enjoyed aspects of The Women, but can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.    2.5/4

B002XUL6RG|5.0|This is hands down one of the best films of the past decade for me.  \\"Visual Artist\\" Steve McQueen captures a sense of humanity in a way that few directors seem to be in touch with, telling a powerful story in a fashion that most are afraid to.    There is very little dialogue - and the dialogue that exists comes in spouts like an 18-minute long scene where the camera stays still and doesn't cut away at all.  It could have easily been pretentious, but it is not in the least.  McQueen has proven himself just by this one instance to be an extraordinary visionary that knows how to tell a story vividly without having to \\"tell\\" it.  Did I mention the cinematography is gorgeous?  Practically everything in \\"Hunger\\" is honed to perfection, and Michael Fassbinder's gruelingly tangible performance shows human deterioration at its most believable.    A masterpiece.
055216125X|5.0|An early novel, before Leonardo Da Vinci and his mysteries, that aims first at creating a suspense packed story. Imagine the central national data storing unit in the United States, and the central intelligence computer dedicated to breaking codes and then to eavesdropping on the whole planet. Pretty fishy and pretty dangerous, particularly because over-shadowy and under-transparent. This central brain of US intelligence is under attack from a disgruntled fired Japanese agent and from a civil liberties militant who is also a computer freak and wizard who has managed to get into the sanctum. Add to that a megalomaniac paranoid boss, or sub-boss who wants to invent the absolute universal and invisible backdoor for all digitalized communication in the world, and you will have the subject matter for a catastrophic thriller, for a new Inferno under a dome, but 12 years before Stephen King. And catastrophic it is, though saved at the last minute or second though the skin of the ball-sack of everyone, including the women in the story is singed. The story is entirely built around this attack and the finding of the prime numerical key password that will stop the attack. Of course I am not going to reveal that key number, but I will admit it is a simple solution and it is amazing that all these people who have PhDs, are code-retrievers and decoding cryptographers do not know the various atomic masses of the various uranium isotopes. You do not need a PhD in nuclear physics to know that. Even Dan Brown knows it, who has no PhD in that field. But I guess we can let that go even if the last ten pages are slightly marred though we wonder what other solution they could find since that one is so obvious and neglected. Yet the novel is a lot more than just that suspense. It is haunted in fact by the fundamental syndrome that has run in American literature for decades, from post war science fiction to today's thrillers with Stephen King's Firestarter, The Stand, to only name two novels, and many other authors and titles before, in-between and after. The myth of the \\"shop at Langley\\", of the \\"CIA inner circle\\", of the \\"FBI profiling laboratory\\", or the \\"military scientific manipulating labs\\" where they study killing bacteria and other DNA frightening fantasies if not fascinating genetically modified cloning. Here Dan Brown adds to that strain of frightening inspiration the fear of ordinary people in front of computers, the fear for civil liberties, the freedom of expression, or other fundamental liberties. It is mostly paranoid, unjustified and yet so effective in the media. The sentimental, and even sentimentalese, wrapping of the story is just what it is, a fancy wrapping paper. Yet the deeply cultured nature of Dan Brown comes back sincerely when he alludes to some Spanish Renaissance phrase that has to do with marble carving. In this book, alas, that's practically the only instance of artistic reference. And that is definitely a drawback.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Vincennes Saint Denis, University of Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID Boulogne Billancourtls, and many other authors and titles before, in-between and after.

B002SJIO5E|3.0|the movie started out a little slow, but it had a decent little story line to it.
B000LC55F2|5.0|The Prestige is a work of film making genius. The plot has so many twists and turns it will successfully keep you guessing until the end. Every time the ending of the story seems clear another twist will muddle it up again. The Prestige is written by Jonathan Nolan and directed by Christopher Nolan. These brothers team up on this project along with Christopher's wife Emma Thomas, as a producer, to create a masterpiece of immense proportions.     The Prestige is an entrancing story of two friends turned enemies. In this thrilling story two magicians, played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, battle for one another's power and fame, often allowing their obsession to get the best of them. Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) begin the movie as friends working a mutual magic act as plants in the audience, but after Angier's wife dies in one of the tricks, he blames Borden and a bitter rivalry is born.     The acting by Jackman and Bale is superb, as is that of Scarlet Johansson as the charming Olivia Wenscombe. Olivia is a beautiful assistant haired by Angier to help him one up Borden. After Borden opens a new act called the transporter man, where he appears to disappear and immediately reappear across stage, Angier sends Olivia to spy on Borden and discover his secret. This secret becomes the object of an even greater obsession. An obsession that began with seeking revenge for his wife's death quickly turns to an obsession to simply destroy Borden, which will ultimately destroy him as well. Angier goes as far at one point to tell Olivia that he doesn't care about his wife, he only wants Borden's secrets.       These two men feed off each other throughout the entire movie constantly trying to outdo the other, going as far as broken legs, gunshot wounds, kidnappings, and ultimately murder. Nothing is too extreme for these men when revenge is within their reach. Jackman and Bale make this rivalry so intense and believable you're left trying to figure out evenwho is the \\"good guy\\" and who is the \\"bad guy.\\" While this is the least of the questions that must be answered through the course of this movie, it keeps you guessing just as well as the rest and the answer isn't revealed until the last few minutes of the movie.     While this is a wonderful story line for a movie, some of the morals taught through the events of the movie are not very good. The major themes of this movie are revenge, deception, and competition. None of which are themes that I would want running through my life or the lives of those I care about. The saddest part about this story is that these lives of revenge, and deceit were chosen by the men that they consumed. I did however like that the consequences of these choices are shown in the end, but unfortunately, one of these \\"bad guys\\" gets off clean and gets his life back, for the most part.     Much like the great magic tricks shown by these two men, The Prestige will have you watching it over and over, trying to spot how they were able to pull off the elaborate tricks that are the prestige of this wonderful movie.

0812973992|4.0|All of the grand reviews of this book are well-founded, this was a heartfelt and enormous story.  McCann has launched a magic carpet ride on a gritty rug that is sometimes threadbare and moth-eaten, but gets you there, nonetheless.  The characters were nicely expressed, although there were moments when I felt their plot connections a bit too contrived.  What were the chances...REALLY...that Claire would have an encounter with the young daughters of the dead hooker her husband had just seen in court?  In all of New York?  And the chapters dealing with the hackers and the tag-photographer riding the subway felt like red herrings...what was up with that?  Still, the author has a way with words, I could feel the weight of a humid night on the streets, almost like the sweat rolling down my own back. Beautifully done.  Worth the read, definitely.

0805091742|5.0|The checklist? Can even the eloquent Dr. Gawande (\\"Better,\\" \\"Complications\\") find a book's worth of things to say about such a humdrum tool of ordinary life?<br /><br />Turns out, he can. Gawande even generates excitement over the possibilities of improving almost every aspect of modern life, particularly the big, complicated, error-prone things like airplane flight, skyscraper construction and, yes, medicine.<br /><br />Surgeon, Harvard professor, New Yorker writer and one of our most open-minded and accessible medical writers, Gawande takes us behind the scenes of complex endeavors to show how checklists help avoid confusion, second-guessing, and stupid mistakes while fostering teamwork and communication.<br /><br />We see how a skyscraper goes up - and stays up. We see how Wal-Mart succeeded where FEMA failed after Hurricane Katrina. How a third-world village drastically reduced childhood diarrhea - without cleaning up the contaminated water supply. How an investor consistently beat out the competition. How Sully landed that plane on the Hudson.<br /><br />Though the checklist idea had been percolating away in his brain - a way to make sure the essentials don't get lost in the increasing demands of details - it was a request from the World Health Organization that focused Gawande's attention. Asked to help develop a strategy to make surgery safer worldwide - with virtually no money - Gawande homed in on the checklist.<br /><br />Failures due to avoidable error are rampant in complex situations. \\"Failures of ignorance we can forgive. If the knowledge of the best thing to do in a given situation does not exist, we are happy to have people simply make their best effort. But if the knowledge exists and is not applied correctly, it is difficult not to be infuriated. What do you mean half of heart attack patients don't get their treatment on time? What do you mean that two-thirds of death penalty cases are overturned because of errors?\\"<br /><br />There are some checklists in hospitals - they work and Gawande shows us how. But creating a checklist for something as varied and prone to sudden complications as surgery - that seemed daunting. And, indeed, the first try was unwieldy, time consuming and ineffective.<br /><br />So Gawande turned to the one sphere of modern life with a stellar safety record - aviation. Every aspect of flight is based on checklists. There are checklists for every conceivable emergency - even the one that led Capt. Sullenberger to land his plane safely on the Hudson River.  Gawande takes us step by step through that famous near-disaster and shows how checklists ensured smooth teamwork and standard procedure, freeing the mind to take advantage of skill and luck.<br /><br />He studied how the aviation checklist experts go about their tasks - how checklists are built from experience and refined through practice.<br /><br />He also studied the psychology that makes us resistant to the checklist. Even he, knowing better, felt his own operating room didn't really need a checklist, that he was fully in control. But almost immediately errors were caught. He tells one harrowing story of a man who would have lost his life on Gawande's operating table - but for the checklist.<br /><br />The checklist goes against the grain of our ideal of rugged individualism. Our hunger for heroes. The public wants to see Sully as The Hero, not as a member of a team that did everything right, though the full story will send chills of admiration down your spine.<br /><br />People - especially experts - think a checklist will slow them down. It's painstaking, mundane, boring. Gawande, taking us through his own experience testing his surgery checklist in eight hospitals worldwide (ranging from primitive and overwhelmed to state-of-the-art) illustrates otherwise. His sense of discovery and accomplishment is infectious and thoroughly convincing. Though even he isn't convinced it's going to spread like wildfire.<br /><br />\\"If someone discovered a new drug that could cut down surgical complications with anything remotely like the effectiveness of the checklist, we would have television ads with minor celebrities extolling its virtues....Government programs would research it. Competitors would jump in to make newer and better versions. If the checklist were a medical device we would have surgeons clamoring for it, lining up at display booths at surgical conferences to give it a try, hounding their hospital administrators to get one for them....\\"<br /><br />A smart, entertaining, involving book, recommended for everyone.effectiveness of the checklist, we would have television ads with minor celebrities extolling its virtues....Government programs would research it.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Hard to understand how a movie that manages to make you feel down in the dumps in many instances can have you laughing out loud the rest of the way. Perhaps because UP IN THE AIR is a movie so very full of surprises and complete knowledge of its main subject (I swear the next time I go through security in an airport I'll be looking for the oriental businessmen and avoid babies at all costs).  All throughout the movie I was expecting the obvious conclusion (the firer being fired) and was surprised to get something completely different in return, but even UP IN THE AIR's schocker scene, managed to make so much sense it's hard for me to understand how I didn't see it coming.  There's no question in my mind UP IN THE AIR will be the movie future generations will look back in trying to understand this particular era we live in. It is quiet simply a classic.

0345472322|1.0|The basic concept of this book is at least moderately interesting but the author murders it to death with page after page of insipid vignettes and painfully trite cliches amounting to little more original or inspiring than \\"you can do anything you put your mind to\\". Many of the vignettes that are based on public figures are so cherry-picked, as far as what they present, that they're at best insultingly simplistic and at worst completely misrepresenting reality; sometimes the real story doesn't support the point she's trying to make at all. The chapter on sports is particularly painful. Later chapters are better, but it's all relative--they just didn't make me bash myself over the head with the book as much. What's really disappointing is that had she actually had enough faith in her readers to discuss her research in any depth or detail whatsoever, rather than repeatedly insulting their intelligence by failing to devote more than about a hundred words to any particular topic, this could have been genuinely interesting and, dare I say it, even inspiring.

B0031S4K5E|5.0|A wonderful gift to your film library.  I cannot add anything that hasn't already been said about this amazing film.    I understand the frustration of not getting the toy but, I'm sure that Disney has done their homework.  This film - geared toward the young (as mentioned by Miyazake in one of the reviews) - will sell to families.    Especially now, those families - most likely - aren't upgrading to Blu-Ray and are sticking with their old DVD players until times get better.  Me?  Single and unemployed.  For as much as I want the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack to plan for the future, I will stick with the DVD until I have a good job under my belt and a few credit cards paid off.    I was at a Goodwill in Prescott, Arizona in September and spoke with a Mother that uses the VCR tapes donated as her library for her young daughter's viewing.  As a gauge, Walmart doesn't even stock VCR's anymore.    So - young son or daughter and a regular DVD player?  That's the market for the toy.

B000TXNDUW|5.0|Every director has their beginning but for Jean-Luc Godard, his 1960 film \\"&Agrave; bout de souffle\\" a.k.a. \\"Breathless\\" was the beginning of a cinema revolution and bringing the world closer to nouvelle vague, the French New Wave.<br /><br />Godard is a unique director who attracted attention for his innovative editing and his use of jump cuts, his style of not giving his talent a script until the morning of and using improvisation and utilizing film techniques that most directors would never do.  In fact, his filmmaking even infuriated his producer because instead of using a full day to shoot a film, sometime he was in the mood to do only 12 minutes.  But then again, Jean-Luc Godard is not your typical director and in 1960, no one knew what to expect from him.<br /><br />Many looked at him as a rebel as he wanted to challenge the conventions of traditional Hollywood cinema and for those who watched his films evolve year after year, the more we get to see Godard in his characters but also his political ideologies as well.<br /><br />But \\"Breathless\\" was a film that helped change cinema.  For decades, many followed the Hollywood tradition and sure, Jean Renoir did something unique and special decades earlier with \\"The Rules of the Game\\"  (unfortunately, no one at the time was ready for the film until three decades later and people acknowledge that his film was ahead of its time) but it was \\"Breathless\\" that inspired young directors and showed them that directors, auteurs can do something different.<br /><br />From the use of jump cuts to capturing Paris with a hidden camera, the film and its director was hailed for its innovation and it was the beginning of the French New Wave.  Interesting enough, although the film made Jean-Luc Godard a popular name, the director himself was not as thrilled by all the attention and popularity of \\"Breathless\\" that led him to create \\"Le Petit Soldat\\" (The Little Soldier) which was highly political and banned in France for three years.  Regardless of whether or not Godard enjoyed the success of the film, the film was unique and an inspiration to many filmmakers.<br /><br />For over 40 decades, \\"Breathless\\" has been regarded as a film that cinema fans must watch and eventually own and in 2007, The Criterion Collection released \\"Breathless\\" in a 2-disc DVD set (with a slipcase cover) and booklet.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Breathless\\" is presented in black and white in its original aspect ratio of 1:33:1.  The film looks absolutely great and the Criterion Collection once again does a wonderful job with the transfer.  According to Criterion, the transfer is approved by director of photography Raoul Coutard.  The new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a 35mm fine-grain master positive. Thousand of instances of dirt, debris and scratches were removed using the MTI Digital Restoration System.<br /><br />As for audio, the audio is in French Monaural and was mastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical track print, and audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.  The Dolby Digital 1.0 is clear and understandable but for a more immersive soundtrack, I chose to have my home theater receiver set with audio on all channels.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Breathless\\" comes with a good number of special features plus an 82-page book featuring writings from Godard, film historian Dudley Andrew, Francois Truffaut's original film treatment, and Godard's scenario.<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * INTERVIEWS - (27:00) Featuring interviews with director Jean-Luc Godard, actors Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg and filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville, recorded for French television between 1960 and 1964.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:02) The original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  * Coutard and Rissient - (22:28) Cinematographer Raoul Coutard (who worked with Godard for 14 films) and cinephile Pierre Rissient, assistant director on \\"Breathless\\" recall working with Godard and working on his first film.<br />  * Pennebaker on Breathless - (10:32) Documentary filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker talks about working with Jean-Luc Godard and his film \\"Breathless\\".<br />  * Jean Seberg - (18:54) A video essay written by Mark Rappaport (From the Journals of Jean Seberg) reveals the beginning of Jean Seberg and her life ending in tragedy.<br />  * Breathless as Criticism - (11:09) A video essay written by film historian and author Jonathan Rosenbaum.  Rosenbaum explores the cinematic and literary references in \\"Breathless\\".<br />  * Chamber 12, Hotel De Suede - (1:18:26) A 1993 documentary by director and popular French TV host Claude Ventura who tracks down, over nine days, the locations and the people who were involved in the making of \\"Breathless\\".  Interviews include actor Jean-Paul Belmondo, filmmaker Claude Chabrol, cinematographer Raoul Coutard, assistant director Pierre Rissient, editor Cecile Decugis and more.<br />  * Charlotte et Son Jules - (12:42) One of the short films from 1959 starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anne Collette.  The short film is about a boyfriend who continually admonishes his girlfriend.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />For anyone interested in French New Wave films, \\"Breathless\\" is a film that is recommended watching.  It's a film that changed cinema and launched the career of director Jean-Luc Godard.<br /><br />What I loved about the film is the acting.  The whole 25-minute improvisation scene in the bedroom is incredible.  I've learned through the special features that the scene involved Godard yelling and instructing the Belmondo and Seberg on what to do and also learned that the jump cut scenes were accidental but yet made the film quite creative, unique and artistic.<br /><br />But is it one of the best Godard films?  This is difficult to answer because personally, there are so many Godard films that I do enjoy but yet this is his first and is an important film in his career. But the problem is, to enjoy Godard films is to know Godard films.  You appreciate his films, the more you watch several of them and learn his unique style of filmmaking.<br /><br />Also, the film has been given so much credit for its innovation that so many people come to the film expecting something like Orson Welles \\"Citizen Kane\\" or a film that with this groundbreaking story and people who experience this Godard film are perplexed and don't understand what the big deal is. And I think that is what has perplexed Godard after the success of the film.  Godard was very critical of the film to the point that he distanced himself from it and thus created the film \\"Le Petit Soldat\\".<br /><br />But as mentioned, to enjoy Godard is to know Godard and that is watching his films and learning about them.  Fortunately, The Criterion Collection does a fantastic job with this release of \\"Breathless\\" in presentation and also its content.  Not only do you get the film but you get to see the various interviews with the talent, interviews with those who worked with him and easily enough, different interpretations of what people got from the film.  The 1993 documentary \\"Chamber 12, Hotel de Suede\\" is a magnificent addition to the film as we get to see and hear from those who are involved with \\"Breathless\\", giving us some insight to Godard and his unique filmmaking style.<br /><br />As far as my enjoyment of the film, I absolutely enjoyed it!  Godard and Belmondo had a magical partnership during their short time together and as for Jean Seberg, this is an actress that had a bad experience  in her earlier years as an actress, given a chance in \\"Breathless\\" (and worked once more with Godard) and had a rollercoaster of a career that ended in tragedy.  If there was one positive, she is immortalized through her role as Patricia in this film.<br /><br />\\"Breathless\\" is a film about two different people, their words and what they mean are different, they talk about themselves but yet never really talk to each other.

May it be the two talking about paintings, the two talking about Faulkner, this dialogue between the two is something that I found so enjoyable (as I have with Eric Rohmer's moral tale \\"My Night at Maud's\\" with also a magnificent, smart and enjoyable long bedroom dialogue scene).

Also, the film has been given so much credit for its innovation that so many people come to the film expecting something like Orson Welles \\"Citizen Kane\\" or a film that with this groundbreaking story and people who experience this Godard film are perplexed and don't understand what the big deal is. And I think that is what has perplexed Godard after the success of the film.  Godard was very critical of the film to the point that he distanced himself from it and thus created the film \\"Le Petit Soldat\\".    But as mentioned, to enjoy Godard is to know Godard and that is watching his films and learning about them.  Fortunately, The Criterion Collection does a fantastic job with this release of \\"Breathless\\" in presentation and also its content.  Not only do you get the film but you get to see the various interviews with the talent, interviews with those who worked with him and easily enough, different interpretations of what people got from the film.  The 1993 documentary \\"Chamber 12, Hotel de Suede\\" is a magnificent addition to the film as we get to see and hear from those who are involved with \\"Breathless\\", giving us some insight to Godard and his unique filmmaking style.    As far as my enjoyment of the film, I absolutely enjoyed it!  Godard and Belmondo had a magical partnership during their short time together and as for Jean Seberg, this is an actress that had a bad experience  in her earlier years as an actress, given a chance in \\"Breathless\\" (and worked once more with Godard) and had a rollercoaster of a career that ended in tragedy.  If there was one positive, she is immortalized through her role as Patricia in this film.    \\"Breathless\\" is a film about two different people, their words and what they mean are different, they talk about themselves but yet never really talk to each other.  Are they even listening to each other?  Do they even care for each other?    There's no doubt that one canrewatch \\"Breathless\\" and see something different each time.

B001W6S0C6|5.0|Not much to say that hasn't been said, this is a great movie.  The Blu-ray transfer is well done making it look as good as it did when I saw it in the theaters.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|n 1950, director Billy Wilder  who ha shad a string of cinema hits such as \\"Double Indemnity\\", \\"The Lost Weekend\\", \\"A Foreign Affair\\"  began work on his next film \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" with writers Charles Brackett (\\"A Foreign Affair, \\"The Lost Weekend\\", \\"Ninotchka\\") and D.M. Marshman Jr. (\\"Taxi\\", \\"Second Chance\\").<br /><br />For Wilder, it was his interest in how life has treated the talents of the silent film era.  After all, it was known that many silent film stars were unable to transition to film when the \\"talkies\\" began.  Many, who were so popular suddenly saw their careers ended abruptly.  So, Wilder wrote a screenplay and an idea from Brackett in looking at Hollywood through the eyes of a forgotten silent-film star who wants to return to the big screen.<br /><br />It was all about finding the key components to take part in the film and thus Gloria Swanson (known for work in shaping Hollywood, challenging the \\"Hay's Code\\" with her 1928 film \\"Sadie Thomson\\" and her affair with Joseph P. Kennedy), who appeared in many silent films, was chosen as the main actress.  William Holden (\\"Network\\", \\"Stalag 17', \\"Picnic\\"), former MGM director/actor/writer Erich von Stroheim (\\"Greed\\", \\"The Merry Widdow\\", \\"The Great Gabbo\\"), Nancy Olson (\\"Portrait of Jenny\\", \\"Union Station\\", \\"Pollyanna\\") and would also feature appearances by famous Golden Era director Cecil B. DeMille, former silent stars Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner.<br /><br />The film would earn eleven Academy Award nominations (winner of three), included in the American Film Institute's 100 best American films of the 20th Century (#12) and entered in the National Film Registry by the US Library of Congress in 1989 for being deemed \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\\".<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />If there is one thing to say about the Paramount \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" releases, many of these classic films have all been digitally remastered and look absolutely magnificent. These films containing the \\"CENTENNIAL COLLECTION\\" moniker are the definitive versions to own as they tend to have more features added and overall, like how CRITERION COLLECTIONS have spotlighted on films worldwide and have given top treatment, Paramount has done the same with several of their classic films. With that being said, I can only wish that a Blu-ray high definition transfer is in the works for these classic films because if they have been through a process of remastering, one can only expect how phenomenal these will look via HD.<br /><br />For now, \\"Sunset Boulevard - Paramount Centennial Collection\\" is only available via DVD but this new version is remastered, in fullcreen and features Dolby Digital English/French and Spanish mono.  The picture quality for a DVD is actually quite clean for a film over 50-years-old. The film looks absolutely great with blacks nice and deep, grays and whites are vibrant.  With the film already remastered in HD, I really hope that Paramount is considering a Blu-ray release of this title.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" has been given special treatment and fans of the film will not be disappointed.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Sunset Boulevard - Paramount Centennial Collection\\" comes with special features on two discs. Here is what to expect on both discs:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Commentary by Ed Sikov - The author of \\"On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder\\".  A well-done commentary that features a lot of interesting behind-the-scenes stories of certain scenes, certain dialogue and more.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  * Sunset Boulevard: The Beginning - (22:45) How \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" the film came to be. From writing the script and adapting it to film and also the talent of Billy Wilder.<br />  * The Noir Side of Sunset Boulevard by Joseph Wambaugh - (14:19) Mystery writer Joseph Wambaugh talks about \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and how the film that caught his attention and the film's dark/noir side.<br />  * Sunset Boulevard Becomes a Classic - (14:28) Interview with critic Andrew Sarris who talks about why he enjoyed \\"Sunset Boulevard\\".  Featuring interviews with the cast of the film, Glenn Close who played Norma Desmond on the Broadway adaptation of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and more.<br />  * Two Sides of Ms. Swanson - (10:35) A featurette about Gloria Swanson and interviews with Brook Anderson (granddaughter of Gloria Swanson) who talks about her grandmother and interviews with her fellow co-actors who worked with her on other films and more.<br />  * Stories of Sunset Boulevard - (11:20) The making of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", discussion about the original opening sequences, cast interviews and more.<br />  * Mad About the Boy: A Portrait of William Holden - (11:12) A featurette about the actor William Holden and how he was cast and discussion of his various films.<br />  * Recording Sunset Boulevard - (5:51) A featurette about the musical score of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\".<br />  * The City of Sunset Boulevard - (5:36) A featurette about \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and the significance of the area.<br />  * Morgue Prologue Script Pages - The original cut of the film featured a different opening.  Instead of the pool opening, it was a morgue prologue.  The following are the two existing versions of the script from the original monologue.  You can view the script and also the original, uncut shots (without audio).<br />  * Franx Waxman and the Music of Sunset Boulevard - (14:28) Franz Waxman's son John talks about his father and the music of \\"Sunset Boulevard\\".<br />  * Behind the Gates: The Lot - (5:05) Interviews with former producers who talk about their memories of Paramount Pictures in the earlier years.<br />  * Hollywood Location Map - A map of Hollywood in which people can learn about where the characters lived and where certain places such as Paramount Pictures, Schwab's Drug Store and Getty's mansion were located.  When you click on the location, you get video and audio about the significance of these areas and what happened to these locations now.<br />  * Edith Head: The Paramount Years - (13:43) A featurette on famous Paramount fashion designer - Edith Head.<br />  * Paramount in the '50s - (9:36) A featurette about Paramount in the 1950's.  Featuring popular films from the Paramount catalog.<br />  * Original Theatrical Trailer - (3:16) The unremastered original theatrical trailer.<br />  * Galleries - Using your remote, viewers can cycle through images from production, the movie or publicity.<br /><br />Included with the set is an 8-page guide about the directors and talent of the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Sunset Boulevard - Paramount Centennial Collection #1' was a magnificent start to the Paramount Centennial Collection.  Following the steps of the Criterion Collection, Paramount has released a total of nine films (to this date) in a pretty slick presentation, bundled with many special features and the remastering in HD is phenomenal.<br /><br />For a classic film such as \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" which has been released in 2002 and packaged in the first Billy Wilder DVD collection, suffice to say that this Paramount Centennial Collection is the version you must own, if you are a fan of the film.  With over a dozen special features, Paramount really went all out with this release and it shows.  Finding classic interviews with the cast, interviewing family members and loved ones of the talent, finding the original deleted footage...I'm truly in awe with how much was put into this DVD release.  With its remastering in HD, one may wonder if Paramount will be preparing a Blu-ray release.<br /><br />\\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is just a classic film that features magnificent performances by Gloria Swanson and William Holden.  The fact that Billy Wilder and his fellow writers took on a film like this and made it feel authentic by casting real life silent film star Gloria Swanson and Cecil B. DeMille (who directed Swanson's silent films back then) plus bringing in former silent stars Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner is amazing.  But to create a film based on the life of a former silent film star and just exploring that side of life of these forgotten stars is quite interesting.<br /><br />I like how the film was dark, noir-ish but at the same time, really eerie.  To see how Norma Desmond just grappling on to the character of Joe is quite obsessive and disturbing.  What I found interesting is that in modern films, the last time I felt this eeriness from a female character was Glenn Close as Alex Forrest in the film \\"Fatal Attraction\\" and coincidentally, Close played the character of Norma Desmond in the Broadway adaptation of the film with such rave reviews.  Needless to say, the performance by Gloria Swanson as the silent film star who just can't let go of the limelight and is totally enveloped by her past life is just so creepy to watch, your just captivated to the screen and wait and see if Joe can escape this prison that he subjected himself into.  And of course, the bombshell dropped by Erich von Stroheim's character Max, is indeed a shocker.<br /><br />As a silent film fan, you often read how many of these talents of the Silent Era (and some from the Golden Era) have shut themselves off in society and became recluse.  Granted, not everyone was as bad as the character as Norma Desmond but makes you wonder how many silent film talents have dealt with losing their careers when audio became part of films.  We know that there are stars such as Fatty Arbuckle, Louise Brooks, who were literally forgotten and some movie studios actually have done them wrong after these talents have put so much into the creation of this Hollywood system.  So, it was very interesting to see how certain silent film stars especially Louis Mayer reacted to the film.  Mayer was infuriated by the film and at Billy Wilder but of course, Billy Wilder had the better end of the deal creating many more magnificent films after \\"Sunset Boulevard\\".<br /><br />I can go on an on about how well the story was written, how magnificent the performances are and how superb this DVD release is.

B00003CX8V|5.0|The 1960 comedy/drama written and directed by Billy Wilder (\\"Sunset Blvd.\\", \\"Sabrina\\", \\"Some Like It Hot\\", \\"Kiss Me Stupid\\") and co-written with I.A.L. Diamond (\\"Some Like It Hot\\", \\"Kiss Me, Stupid\\", \\"The Fortune Cookie\\") was an incredible success in the box office grossing $25 million and nominated for ten Academy Awards and winning five including \\"Best Picture\\".  In fact, \\"The Apartment\\" was the last black and white to win an Academy Award for Best Picture.<br /><br />The film received many awards from BAFTA and the Golden Globes and is often featured in various cinema magazines in polls for \\"Greatest Films\\".  The film has been part of American Film Institute's top 100 polls and also was deemed \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.<br /><br />But the film had its fair share of criticism.  Because of the film's nature of infidelity and adultery, where films at the time were typically promoted as wholesome entertainment, the film although regarded as a classic and received positive reviews also received its fair share of detractors because of the film's content.<br /><br />\\"The Apartment\\" was released on DVD back in 2001.  followed by a Collector's Edition in 2008.  It was then released as part of \\"The Billy Wilder DVD Collection\\" which contains nine DVD's back in 2003 and then another Billy Wilder DVD Film Collection featuring four DVD's in 2008.  The version of \\"The Apartment\\" that I am reviewing is the version that came with the 2003 DVD box set and is the same release that came out in 2001.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"The Apartment\\" is featured in 16:9 Widescreen (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  For the most part, the film looks very good on DVD.  I am told that the 2008 \\"Collector's Edition\\" release is much better and I can only hope that Fox releases a Blu-ray version of the film in 1080p High Definition.  But for this release, there are dust particles that can be seen throughout the film.  It's not distracting unless you are focusing on it but for the most part, the film looks very good for a film 50-years-old.<br /><br />As for the audio, the film is presented in English, French and Spanish Mono.  I know that the 2008 DVD release features both a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and stereo version of the film.  But you do get the original monaural soundtrack and for those with newer home theater receivers, can definitely enjoy this film with setting the audio to stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack if needed.<br /><br />Subtitles are in French and Spanish.  English is only via closed caption.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This version of \\"The Apartment\\" on DVD only comes with the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"The Apartment\\" is a fantastic film!<br /><br />\\"The Apartment\\" is well-written, acting is fantastic and for the most part, editing and pacing is well-done.  There is nothing I can fault about the film.  At first, I felt that a romantic comedy film being over 2 hrs. long could be a bit too much but in the sake of this film, each and every minute was well-utilized.  Jack Lemmon gave a commanding performance and Shirley MacLaine was fantastic as well.  But shocking was Fred MacMurray's adulterous role as the actor who has appeared in many kindhearted, fatherly roles was playing such a character.<br /><br />Billy Wilder does an incredible job by working with the talent, especially with Jack Lemmon when it came to the script but also the small improvisation details, from him having a cold, gags such as shooting his nose drop across the office, making spaghetti and singing.  It's also important to note that the scene where Lemmon was hit in the film, he was hit in real life and Wilder chose to use the scene.<br /><br />Because of its content dealing with adultery, also suicide and the fact the film stars Fred MacMurray, I could imagine how controversial this film was back in 1960.  Especially reading how MacMurray even received an older woman hitting him with her purse when she saw him.<br /><br />Although a classic film, for me wanting to see \\"The Apartment\\" came from watching the UK film \\"Brief Encounter\\" directed by David Lean.  I've read that in that film which featured one of the main characters wanting to use his friend's apartment gave Billy Wilder the idea for the film but also a real life Hollywood scandal involving agent Jennings Lang and producer Walter Wanger (husband of actress Joan Bennett) in which the affair took place in an employee's apartment and a suicide attempt came from an actual incident involving a friend of writer I.A.L. Diamond.<br /><br />\\"The Apartment\\" has instantly become one of my top films that I have seen in my lifetime.  A good balance of comedy but also drama that takes on topics that probably made people uneasy during that time.<br /><br />I definitely would recommend the 2008 Collector's Edition of \\"The Apartment\\" mainly because its a new transfer and the DVD contains many special features.  But it's so easy to be a fan of Billy Wilder's work that you probably will want to purchase his box sets.  If you can find the nine DVD box set for cheap (I paid $29 which is remarkably cheap for the DVD set over the Christmas holiday week), then definitely get that version.  Otherwise, there is a four DVD box set available as well and since it was released in 2008, includes the collector's edition of \\"The Apartment\\".<br /><br />\\"The Apartment\\" is highly recommended!ng him with her purse when she saw him.

B00003CXB6|5.0|if anyone from amazon.com is going to review a film they should try to sound unbiased and try not to bash a film. Anyways I am a huge fan of Dinos so i enjoyed this one....probably more then the other two. graphics look good, storyline was fine, really people need to be less picky and try to actually enjoy the film
B0035OTPEK|4.0|Yes, the comparisons to Interpol are inevitable. They are from NYC, they play dark deep dance rock. Editors include more synths though, and that does serve to differentiate them. Some may find the keyboards overly schmaltzy or too 80s-ish, but I find them entertaining. When coupled with the melody, lyrics and mood, they create a nice soundscape.    If you like She Wants Revenge, New Order, Joy Division, Interpol, Parts and Labor or simliar dark new wave or post new wave bands, you are bound to like this one. The title track, \\"Bricks and Mortar\\", and \\"Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool\\"  are the real standouts in my opinion.    Do they push any new boundaries? Probably not. They sound right at home in the ones already there, though.
0307593525|4.0|I bought this for my husband as he does all the cooking - BUT I found myself intrigued by it and actually began trying out the recipes. A little tricky following the index but then I see it simply refers you back to Vol. I to locate it. Would recommend this to anyone who does or would like to learn to cook.
076790382X|5.0|This book is a collection of columns that Bryson wrote for a British newspaper upon his return to the US, after living in England for 20 years. In his very humorous way, he makes comparisons between the two countries and many funny observations about various aspects of American life. It provided many laugh-out-loud moments.

B0030BYWKK|3.0|I was eagerly anticipating the release of this album, as I was a huge fan of all of Midlake's previous records/EP's.  As I listened to the first song on the album \\"Acts of Man\\" I started to get excited because it was well written, produced, heavily textured...then the next song came on and the next and I started to notice a pattern.  This album almost comes off souding like one long song.  It may be a striking, dark, emotional song, but the album still lacks the variety of previous works.  The interesting changes within songs that made Van Occupather and Banman so interesting to listen to are not here either.  This is not a \\"Bad\\" record by any means, but it was definitely a bit of a let down.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This movie would not make it in athe present day given the husband is such a sleeze but the characters are entertaining and Rosalind Russell is her glorious self...
0375842209|5.0|A thought-provoking, beautiful story told from the viewpoint of Death, whose fascination with the main character creates a remarkable, though at times sad, story. A fantastic book.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|Action packed adventure! I enjoyed it from start to finish.  Russell Crowe does a bang up job along with a great supporting cast.
B00197POXG|5.0|I just finished watching the second movie in this set this morning.  I thought I had seen all the episodes when the series played on tv, but there were several that were new to me.  This show is amazing and I really enjoyed the historical accuracy in it.  I am a history buff and I savored every single minute of it.  Even the life messages that each episode contained are as true today as they were then.  I was surprised to learn that many of the predjudices of today were also around back in the late 1800's.  I guess some things never change.  My set came in a square box with Jane Seymour and Joe Lando on the front and back.  What I especially liked was the fact that I could read what each episode was about before I watched it.  The only disappointment for me was the fact that the Reverand Johnson remained blind to the end of the series.  I thought surely he would get his sight back.  I have purchased several tv series and this is the only one I watched completely from beginning to end.  I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone.  There is something for everyone from love scenes to frontier fights.

We have a lot of fun reading this book together. Its really cool, plus it helps little ones see that not ALL monsters are bad...sometimes they're cute & furry - just like Grover!! :)
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Not the greatest story ever told but its all about the music and it doesn't get much better than this.  Great blues played by really good musicians (not the actors).Robert Johnston is where it all starts with the blues and with this movie.

0060765488|3.0|During the German blitz of London in WWII, four siblings are sent to the English countryside for safekeeping by an eccentric professor and his stodgy servants. Left with nothing to do besides play and get into trouble, Lucy, the youngest, gets into a wardrobe and finds a passageway to the magical world of Narnia. It is there that she meets a certain Mr. Tumnus, a nice enough chap who just happens to be a \\"Faun\\", or what I would call a satyr. At first Tumnus seems to be very friendly and invites Lucy back to his home for tea. It is there that he reveals that he is supposed to capture any humans he finds and report them to the White Witch, the self-appointed ruler of Narnia who has entrapped the land in endless winter. When he goes against the Witch's orders he is taken prisoner and taken to her castle. Lucy, along with Susan, Peter, and Edmund, set out to rescue the Faun, and in the process becomes agents of prophecy who may have the power to overthrow the wicked White Witch. They're not alone. Aslan, the god-like lion that created Narnia, has also returned to lead the fight against the black magic that threatens to extinguish all goodness. But the kids never counted on one of their own blood turning against them.     Since they came out around the same time and the two authors were such good friends, one cannot help but compare the Narnia books to the Lord of the Rings sequence. And let me tell you, Lewis's work seems pale in comparison to Tolkien's. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe never quite makes it to epic status. There are too few characters, the world seems landlocked and hyperfocused, and you never get the sense that the book is part of a larger tapestry. Instead of world-building for all eternity, Lewis did just enough to frame his story. Nothing more. Nothing less. I just don't feel that the work has a solid mythology behind it.     I also didn't feel very connected to the characters. They all seemed distant, cold, and at times very snobbish, in a waythat only the English can be. Instead of warm-blooded real life characters, the four kids were more like anonymous cut-outs from fairy tales. Yes, Edmund was a little backstabber, and Lucy was the curious one, but beyond that, I never got a feel for who these people really were.     I will say this. I liked the book ok. It was a nice diversion, but I just never connected fully with it. I definitely do not rate it as a classic. It seemed more like a work produced in the 19th century than the 20th, and perhaps that was Lewis's intention. It just didn't work for me. I will definitely continue to read the series though.
B001PBRCVI|5.0|I downloaded this book on my Kindle back when it was available. It was one of the most heartbreaking and touching books I had ever read. She is a beautiful writer and makes you feel like you are part of each character. Although it is fiction, it is still an important look at that time in history and one that should not be forgotten. Months later after reading this book, I still think about it.
B0028K3192|5.0|This is one of his best cd's, I might be wearing it out. My bigest complaint is that is not long enough needs more tracks.
0061537969|5.0|What a great book, looking at life from the dog's point of view, hilarious in some parts, if you love dogs, you will love this book!
B0027HOBM2|5.0|Great to see the whole season at one time, without commercials! Just love the character development!
B002RI9SC4|1.0|Why should I pay more for the Kindle edition than for the hardback edition? OK, I know that I would have to pay postage and packing on top, but then I would have a physical book, with a colourful cover, which I could lend to my friends. And when we'd all read it, I could sell it second hand and recoup some of the original cost. This is pure greed on behalf of the publisher, which in my case is absolutely counter-productive, because I simply shall not buy the book!
B000JLSM00|4.0|Before directors had special effects to wow their audiences, they used scenery.    It's hard to beat Monument Valley for great eye candy, probably why John Ford used it in so many of his westerns.  Blu Ray brings back the detail of the big screen, amplifying the directors original intent.  Good script, good movie.
0307454541|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well as well as The Girl Who Played with Fire.<br />I heard somewhere that the author passed away. I am so sorry.
B000002JSP|5.0|This was the last Zeppelin album I didn't have. I think it is one of their best although it doesn't get the same fanfare that some of their other albums do. A must have for any Zeppelin fan!
B002BSHWUU|2.0|First, if this review were written when this item came out, I would, and still may be, crucified  #1 The packaging is horrible- Just visit a Bear Family Box Set- The Beatles Box, which was 22+ years in the making(first remastering job since 1987), deserved at least that- A full hard cover 12X12 70 page book that notes all of the critial information which would be of great interest to all fans- especially to those fans who not only like the music, but would also enjoy some of the fanscinating little known facts that the average fan would enjoy. A complete session- song by song would have been great. This is a rectangle box that barely fits the CD's.   When I purchased this box, I had so much difficulty getting the CD's out that I was afraid I would make a tear in it. I could go on and on but there are plenty of reviewers who have done this in much better detail and I just want to support and agree with those who shelled out a lot of bucks for this.  The initial review of this review led you to believe that the \\"mini-documentary\\" would be special to the box. This is not true as each mini-doc for each CD also came with the ones that were purchased individually.    #2-But, the real main reason for buying this Box Set is for the Music-It is  simply poor- I could go on forever about this but simply listen to the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" reissue (bonus tracks)--and listen to \\"Lucy\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\", etc.- Listen to those versions and you will hear the punch, the depth, the dynamics, and detail of the songs-  Based on this CD and the \\"LOVE\\" CD is why I went for the Box (and the heavy price that came with it) in the first place. I already have an incredible colletion of many the Beatles songs, version, alternates, demos, etc. But I was waiting with baited breath for this box just imagining how the full catalogue would sound. What a horrible surprise. If you listen to the LOVE CD- Just listen to \\"I Am the Walrus\\"- The sound not only is incredible but it is the first version ever issued that did not drop out to \\"rechannelled stereo\\" at about the 1:40 minute into the song- it is or it seems to me that the whole song stays in Stereo. Those are the kind of things that the average fan may not know about unless you heard the real thing, then you can make an objective opinion.  #3 With the advances in sound production today (pro tools, digital remastering, etc.) these songs should literally jump out at you as if the Beatles were right in your room with you  The remastering is horrible- it still has that tinny sound. But in other songs it is the opposite with a bottomed out low treble and heavy bass sound- sometimes you can hear this even from soone song to the other. Also, the volume level with the \\"tinny\\" songs are louder and more abrasive than the other ones. I am aware that some of this is due to the original masters, but, again, as heard in many other up to date Remastering CD's you can significantly still this sound with todays technology. Throughout most of this Box, it appears to me that they didn't even try.  #4 Also, related to remastering, it confuses me as to why they did not center channel the vocals as in the 2 CD 1962-66 RED SET-  \\"All My Loving\\" is in center channel, with exceptional sound separation as opposed to the Right and Left Channels in this box where the vocals are in one Channel and the Instruments in the other- I find it still very hard to even listen to them. And the Sound Quality of the 1962-66 RED 2 CD SET is still almost as good as this Box Set and the RED CD came out in 1993- yes, that was 17 years ago  If you listen to music recorded in the 50's and 60's - from the Blues Chess Label (Muddy Waters, etc.) Also, just as an another example in 1963 at Capitol Records-- Listen to Brian Wilson's production work of his work with the Beach Boys and this some of these songs came 3 years before his classic Pet Sounds LP When yu campare any if the 6-8 LP's he did from 1963-65--- it is embarrishing how poor this Box Set is in comparison  #5 A more current review is the total remastering of the Rolling Stones CD's that came out - the original ones were not listenable--But they went to where the Stones recoreded them (Chicago, LA, etc.) and the Hybrids that came out and are now out in DSM regular CD format is amazining. And the Beatles only recorded one place  Listen to the 3 \\"Anthology\\" Cd's- There is a much \\"compression\\" (dullness) in all of these songs-and these were 30 year old throw away demo's. alternate takes, etc.- And the real stuff in this Box Set is the best that they can do---  I have a friend of mine who has been in the music business for 30 years and one thing he keeps telling me is  \\"Record Companies will only put out what they want because they know that the public will buy it, then they will keep remastering or adding these to the next re-issue and know that people will buy it.  When we discussed this this new Box Set- he just smiled and said: \\"They are the Beatles\\" They don't have to do any more-they just will do it a little bit better the next time- because they know that we will buy it\\"  That's how business works- They already know that the general public is thrilled with this Box Set except the real Reviewer's that have written a factual accurate review of their product- But, they already know that because they see that 90% of those who bought this -think it is the best- and to them it is-Until the next one is released- That's where the money is- and for an example- how many Greatest Hits CD's has Neil Diamond Had?, or, Billy Joel (3-4?,) Look at Motown-that's all you see- more re-issues- because they know that there are people that will buy them- and the Beatles are the cream of the crop-One of the exceptions is how Decca re-did all of the Stones individual CD's ---see- below    If you are a fan of the Beatles- I would assume that to some extent most people would also have some Stones in their collection- Hearing is believing---Just by \\"The Rolling Stones Now\\", or \\"12X5\\", etc. Then you will get a good idea of how this box set should sound  #5 The original price is ridiculous as you can see from Amazon, the already USED prices and new prices are falling and by a lot.  #6 The bottom line is this is an Average Box Set for the average fan who wants to get all the Beatles work in one set. It is nothing more and nothing less. But for a true die hard like me- I still listen to the \\"yellow submarine\\" Compiliation and \\"Love\\" and my imports and wonder what really could have been    Or, at least, as my friend in the music business says \\"until they feel like putting out a little better one\\"  Billy Boy
B000001FKY|5.0|A must have for Leppard fans! This album gets a little less attention than Pyromania but it is equally great. Buy it! Share with a friend.
B0006BLJ26|5.0|What can I say? This is perfect.<br />This band got me believing in melodic metal once more.<br />They opened up a whole new world for me, I had no idea what was going on over in Europe until I saw bands like theirs along with HIM, Within Temptation etc.<br />Melodic metal has truly made a comeback, in no small part due to the likes of Nightwish.<br />I actually ordered the special edition which somehow came from Argentina so the print was partly in Spanish, which sucks, because I don't speak any Spanish. Other than that, it was perfect. This is one my favorite albums, especially since there are no bad/filler songs on it!
B000VNMMPM|5.0|angel-a is a beautifully shot black and white love story between a down-and-out indebt gambler and an angel sent to save him.  this is very much in par with wim wenders film Wings of Desire.  the acting is excellent, dialog is sharp and the movie has enough twists and turns to keep you captive.  there also is a \\"making of\\" featurette if you're interested in that sort of thing.  a must see movie for those that believe angels are around and can transform through the power of love.
B002SB2AAM|1.0|My wife and I work together and have a long commute, and books on CD have become a enjoyable way to use the time.  However, this one drove us nuts.  It's hard to separate the author from the reader sometimes, so I find myself annoyed with both.  I found his voice to be very vanilla, very all-American.  On top of that, he seemed to have a lot of trouble with accents.  Voicing a latino that only sometimes had an accent, for instance, pulls me out of the story.  The husky voice of the antagonist and the CIA director got very, very tiring.    As for the story, it feels like a first draft.  If I had to assign it one word, that word would be TEDIOUS.  The repetion was excruciating.  The dialogue feels like it was generated by an eighth-grader.  The plot is horribly predictable.  The narrative feels like a thin veil over heavy-handed pedantry.  (If you've read The Celestine Prophecy, you know what I mean.)  Rather than tell us a good story, it seems that Brown is trying to tell us that he did a lot of research.  My wife and I agree that the book comes off as one that somehow missed the editor's eyes.  Many contrived elements appear in the text, and the characters actually display wonder at the different unrealistic circumstances, as if Brown is saying to the reader, \\"I know, right?\\" when he is actually just being lazy.    This book gets one star not because I can't give it zero, but because I did actually want to know what happened.  I think there is a kernel of a good book inside this one.  Probably several pages (CDs) shorter, and one that a good editor could have helped tease out.
068817776X|5.0|This is a wonderful book - worth more stars than I can give it.  The author was a Jewish girl, born in Vienna, Austria, who was studying at the university there when the Nazis took over her country in 1938.  As a consequence of German controls, all Jews were eventually deprived of their major freedoms and most, of even their lives.  This is the sad story of how the author managed against all odds to survive in that anti-semitic environment of Austria and Germany until the war ended in 1945.    The author wrote this book in 1999, when she was living in Israel. The story of her life is incredible. Her book is one of those that you can't stop reading, that makes you sad when it ends. Still, it has moments when you smile, laugh even, and it has a message:  you may need a lot of luck to get through this life!
0385504225|1.0|I enjoyed Angels & Demons and The DaVinci Code.  I had planned to read Deception Point, but now I'm not sure I want to invest the time.  I at least need a break with a better writer.  I would argue that if this had been Brown's first novel, it would possibly not have led to a second and the critics' reviews would have been much less glowing.    It feels like a first draft.  If I had to assign it one word, that word would be TEDIOUS.  The repetion was excruciating.  The dialogue feels like it was generated by an eighth-grader.  The plot is horribly predictable.  The narrative feels like a thin veil over heavy-handed pedantry.  (If you've read The Celestine Prophecy, you know what I mean.)  Rather than tell us a good story, it seems that Brown is trying to tell us that he did a lot of research.  My wife and I agree that the book comes off as one that somehow missed the editor's eyes.  Many contrived elements appear in the text, and the characters actually display wonder at the different unrealistic circumstances, as if Brown is saying to the reader, \\"I know, right?\\" when he is actually just being lazy.    Probably the most annoying thing about this book is the fact that the characters can't just say what they discover; they have to teach it.  The protagonist(s) are trying to save the life of a friend/brother, and one would think that would boost their senses of urgency.  Instead, whenever some new development occurs, one of them becomes the teacher and the rest are idiots.  I don't know how many times I read, \\"I understand what you're saying,\\" said Langdon, \\"but I still don't see what that has to do with X.\\"  To which the reply is something like, \\"Let me put it another way.  Suppose I were to tell you that Y.\\"  She couldn't just say, \\"We need to go to the Capital building--trust me!\\"  That this occurs over and over and over again leads me to believe that Brown has lost sight of the fact he is writing a novel.  I imagine him grinning at his \\"cleverness\\" while he writes, eager to show the world how much time he has spent a) visiting DC and b) using search engines.  He seems aroused by the fact that people will Google the elements in his book.  I'm sorry, but that doesn't make one a good writer or suggest a book is worth reading.     This book deserves the one star it receives from me because I did actually want to know what happened.  I think there is a kernel of a good book inside this one.  Probably several pages shorter, and one that a good editor could have helped tease out.  I truly think that people who enjoy this book are probably not avid readers, or perhaps more exactly, not readers who digest a wide range of books and genres.  This potboiler does make the reader want to know what happens next, but the tension comes not from the plot; it comes from having to wade through scene after scene of substandard writing.  I believe that anyone who has been bowled over by good writing at some point in his or her life would be spoiled to this book.  There is certainly room for escapist fiction, but even among those books, there are good and bad.  All reviews are subjective, of course, but I found this book the worst I've read in several years.
0399247459|5.0|This classic book is perfect for both my 5 and 2 year olds. The board pages are sturdy and easy to manuever, and the colors almost pop off the oversized pages. The story is perfect for talking about nature, counting, colors, healthy eating and even how things can change! This version has a CD of Eric Carle reading the story, which has been great for longer car trips -although I can only listen to the story 3 or 4 times before I can't take any more! (The kids, however, could go on forever)
B0000DJYP8|5.0|I was really surprised that it came in clear vinyl. The sound is very clear and clean. I have been listening to this album since it was first released. Wow that is a long time ha.  It still sounds great and gets the blood pumping. Highly recommended.
B000002LMK|5.0|This is the most consistent, raw, and rocking release from Neil Youg & Crazy Horse since Rust Never Sleeps. No Neil Young collection is complete without it.
B002CMLIJ6|4.0|It's a good movie and it is nice to have a digital copy that is compatible with my ipod.
B000000993|5.0|If you're new to Tool, this (well all of them for that matter) is a must have.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I was a really good movie if you like the past few harry potter movies. It is a darker movie. But still very entertaining for all. It works on a kids level of entertainment and and appeals to the adult. This is a bad comparison but it works like Spongebob I like it and still laugh at it and I am 22 and my niece loves it and laughs at it for a totally different reason but still enjoyable to all.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|If you haven't seen this version of Pride and Prejudice in a while, the blue ray upgrade is well worth the extra money.  It's completely restored from the original print, and the colors and detail are great. I hadn't watched it in several years, and remember the older dvd I watched as looking a bit washed out, but everything is vibrant here--fantastic.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Received product on time and exactly as described.  Will not hesitate to do repeat business.
0679411585|5.0|Wow!  What a great book!  It was worth 10x the price I paid for the used hard cover copy.  I recently learned that there is a follow up book to this - I plan to buy it soon.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has an unbelievable, clean, crisp voice that leaves you wanting more. \\"Wild Horses\\" offers a sorrowful, haunting gentleness. \\"Cry Me a River\\" packs a strong punch without the nasal quality of Strisand or the breathy overtones of Julie London. Each song has a unique Boyle stamp unlike versions I've heard from others.     Susan's voice never sounds strained as she hits both high and low notes clearly with dead on pitch. She delivers regardless of genra...and she covers a wide range...spirituals, a Christmas carol, a broadway hit, pop, and more.     If I could give this CD more than five stars, I would.
0470449748|5.0|I've gone through about 200 questions so far.  The answer explanations are excellent for math and good for verbal.  Sentence correction explanations could use more detail and I found an error, but sentence correction may be the hardest part to thoroughly explain in a book.  I haven't attempted the GMAT exam yet, so I can't comment on how well it prepared me.
B001HPP2X2|1.0|The family had gathered round, we were all set for a sparkling night's entertaiment. I turned off the lights and pressed  the \\"Play\\" button. Nothing. Nothing!! Then a message to the effect that the disc would  not play in my region. Nothing on the Amazon site or  on the blueray disc or packaging to indicate there might be a problem. I have bought many DVDs and a few bluerays. AmaZon are well aware that I live in New Zealand. In New Zealand law it is the retailers  responsibility to ensure that the goods they sell  are fit for their intended purpose.  Amazon won't let me award the zero stars  I would like to give.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The best series HBO has ever put out and being on Blu-Ray only helped to enhance the incredible stories and scenery that are shown.
B000HWZ5WO|3.0|The cover art and title of the songs aptly sum up the atmosphere Plant was going for with the eclectic Shaken n' Stirred.  Seemingly like it only could have been conceived in '85, it sounds very much a product of its time. 25 years later, this is not a good thing. Obviously, Plant wanted to show the edgy, creative side of himself following his career with Zep, but efforts like this sound strained, and at times, a little embarrassing. There's not much that pleases the ears throughout the 9 tracker.  The strongest songs, or really only tunes closely resembling songs being minor hit \\"Little by Little\\" and closing ballad \\"Sixes and Sevens.\\"  Too many overbearing, dare I say Japanese sounding (only way I know to describe it), keyboards fill in gaps where guitars once resided.  The addition of occassional background female vocals only add to the nu-wave lite pop sound that I guess was intentional.  Call it a strange departure between the solid Principle of Moments and the multi-dementional, not always successful Now and Zen.  I'm sure only someone as famous as RP could get away with titles like \\"doo doo a do do\\" and \\"kallalou kallalou.\\"  Not sure what any of this means.  I give it more like 2.5 stars, come to think of it.
B0030M3SBI|5.0|If you like Hendrix or just like classic rock guitar this is a MUST HAVE for any serious collection. Excellent live performance, strong display of why he is still so famous to this day.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  The CD is packed full of high energy tunes that get people moving.  Darn near impossible to sit still when the tunes start cranking.
B0025KVLVA|1.0|I bought The Beatles Re-Master Stereo Box Set from Amazon recently and by the time I got to listen to the Past Masters CD it contained the Help CD instead. When I contacted Amazon you stated it was to late to return the set so I had to buy (again) the Past Masters CD. Shame on the packaging people who packaged this for you which makes you look bad! But you made more money from me so somebody was a winner out of this. Good thing I am a Beatle Freak. No more big money items purchased from Amazon.com anymore for me.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|This is simply the best revenge movie ever. And, with all due respect to Tarantino's other incredible films, this may have the best dialogue of all, except for Inglorious Besterds. On top of that, the soundtrack is one every filmmaker should envy. So imagine improving \\"Thelma and Louise\\", with a modern day Mad Max played by Kurt Russell going up against a modern day version of \\"Little Women\\" crossed with \\"Charlie's Angels\\" without the Charlie and focus on surface sex appeal. Then you might be able to comprehend just how blanking good this movie is. Thank you Tarantino.
031606792X|5.0|This is the last installment in the Twilight series and I wasn't disappointed at all with this book. It was so fantastic that I couldn't put it down. Such a great ending to such a great series!
B001GQSY64|4.0|There are stories for children that a person can enjoy them in both childhood and adulthood.  Examples: Harry Potter, the Twilight Saga, X-Men, and, of course, Star Wars.  However, there are also stories that a person can love as a child, but when they grow up, they look back on and wonder just why the heck they liked it.  Star Wars: Clone Wars (the movie) is unfortunately one of those.  In fact, it's the only Star Wars project I'm aware of that I, as an adult, thought was so silly I couldn't really enjoy it.     Star Wars: Clone Wars is pure action.  It lacks the interesting characters, interesting character interactions (father/son like Obi-Wan/Anakin; romances like Anakin/Padme or Han/Leia; master/servant dynamics like Sidious/Vader or Obi-wan/Luke), the more religious and philosophical undertones the Jedi often refer to; ideas about corruption and redemption; they're all absent, replaced by constant battle scenes.       The movie also introduces Ahsoka Tano, a 14-year old that's obviously supposed to act as a Mary-Sue for all the children watching to see themselves in.  She's inexperienced and desperate to prove herself yet somehow keeps managing to save the day, all while giving people cutsie nicknames and throwing out witty phrases that weren't actually very witty.  The movie humor was all Jar-Jar Binks humor, jokes purely for children that not only weren't funny, but mostly didn't make any sense.     However, just because this movie wasn't for me, doesn't mean it isn't any good.  The show has good acting, beautiful visuals, awesome action sequences, and as I said above, the kind of humor little kids really like.  Action fans will probably also like it because the battles are so exciting and well animated.     And though I doubt I'll watch the movie again, as a Star Wars fan, I'm glad I watched it because there were some things I liked.  As a big fan of Padme Amidala, I loved watching her get her very own action and strategy sequences.  Also, the movie introduces a lot of very interesting and cool characters (various clones and he villain Ventress, for example) that get better development in the Clone Wars series (the series, thankfully, returns to be accessible to both children and adults).  The girl in me has to admit the Huttling was pretty cute, and it was fun to see the softer side of Jabba.  And the action really was great.     If you're a young Star Wars fan, check it out.  If you're an adult, go ahead if you have to see everything Star Wars, but rent it first.  Two-and-a-half stars for me, four stars overall.
0140067477|3.0|This book was good and explained Taoism clearly to me. I just don't really think like that so I couldn't get into it, but my friend really enjoyed reading it and the Te of Piglet also. It's a great concept, I just have too many emotions to ever just BE, lol. Maybe someday I can relax and focus and get the point, but until then it would probably be best if you're actually interested in Taoism before buying this book.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Okay I'm assuming you watched the movie, if not you can look at the other reviews. (It's spectacular to watch, and the music is so muuuucccchhhh better in a lot of ways than the album versions. It has more funk, especially WBSS in my opinion. I like that version the best.    Extras:    Okay it's so worth buying b/c there's an hour special which is pretty much a LOT MORE footage that you didn't get to see. There's a section specifically about how awesome the 3d effects would have been. And they give insight to Michael's notorious concert exits (post Bad tour) and how for this one, it needed to be topped. Here's a clue, it's in 3d!!!!    For those that love the iconic look of MJ there's a section that shows sketch designs of some of the major costumes (WHAT THE HECK NO BEAT IT!!!!). The Thriller costume would have been one of my favorite. IT's a slightly glittered red jacket, fully crystalized black pants (like the gold version on the trailer or in the movie, but black), and these ultra cool red with black matching loafers (matches the Thriller jacket in brightness). The designer says of course he has black versions (I guess in case it was too much red, I thought they were cool.) He didn't show the black versions. I wonder if they would have looked like the Michael Jackson shoes for the 80s doll (red strip across. Sorta like the We are teh World shoes he ahs but red instead of gold). The Billie Jean costume would have been BAD. No joke. I can't say the idea was original, b/c Michael used these ideas, but they were never shown really to the public. He wore these on a date or two of the Victory tour concert. (I'm trying not to give it away, but if you went to Comic Con last year, you know what kind of MJ item was on display. Well this version is updated and takes it to the EXTREME. Totally cool) I don't wanna give it away. It is pretty much the same Biliie Jean costume but a cool kick added. The Blakc and White costuem was aweseome and the intro costuem IS AWESOME. Thedesigner explains like five or six costumes in total, (sorry he didn't mention Bad or Beat It costumes, I don't know why)    They say Thriller was extended and I know I saw the choreographer act in Michael's place and they did \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" which should still be online. It's FANTASTIC!!! But I didn't see that on here.    Earth Song- Huge explanation about the song and the look of it. You get to hear from the little girl.     They show what the intro woudl have been and Michael's entrance would have been like!! Wowwwww all I can say is wow, I wish artists would do this. If you've read \\"On the Road with MJ\\" then you'll know Mike did this to hype up the audience before the show started. Well this time, it's x 10 what he does to get the crowd hype.    They speak about the O2 Arena and how it got built and why (great enlightenment on this segment. They mentioned about how Michael had wanted to tour in 2001 but all major acts cancelled their shows b/c of Sept. 11th and they got Mike to come to O2 later. That was great!    Dancers auditions piece. (Personally, I didn't see the point of this. I guess since I'm a dancer I should care but, myeah I guess it helps the dancers get some fame.    Get the 2 disc b/c some of the stuff I heard about wasn't on here or I didn't notice it. (Extended songs)
B0009MDPYM|5.0|This movie was great and I wasn't disappointed in it at all. It's definitely a different kind of movie so it's refreshing. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I love this CD, I play it every day!!! I got it on time, just before Christmas. I would reccomend this CD to anyone who is a true Alicia Keys fan!
B0014E9188|5.0|The sound quality is awesome and the music lives up to expectation. Louder than normal PT music but great.
0962477060|5.0|I have already learned so much from this methods book!  By far it is the best guitar \\"guidance\\" book I have seen.  The wit of the author keeps the book interesting, and the accessibility of the book to all learning types helps any player improve their playing ability.  I have recommended this book to friends, and have also been able to teach new players using this book.  Brilliant.
0307269981|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat the whole time--I could not put it down! It was a great sequel to \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" The third and final book in the series will be released soon and I can't wait to read it.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|i love brad pitts character on here he is what made this movie great for me.this and pulp fiction i would have to say is tarantinos best
B0014JKJJI|3.0|These used to be made of soft rubber but now of much harder material.  So, these are much less comfortable.
B000F2O4MI|4.0|Rather stiff acting by Sandler, but Leoni is great. Story not as much about cultural differences as it is about character and morality, and ending is at once somehow disappointing and refreshing.
B003539QKO|5.0|This is the first review I have ever done on here. I have bought 100's of albums from Amazon over the past few years and this one I would put in the top 50. To all of the Rap fans who are crying and giving Lil Wayne a bad review, all I can say is you couldn't see talent if it hit you in the face. Rap artists for the most part are the most untalented people in music. Half of them don't even write their own rhymes much less play any music. All they do is stand behind a mike and recite. For Lil Wayne to not only do his own music but most likely freestyle most of it and than pick up an Instrument and play it is amazing! If more Rappers would do this I might just buy their music. Yes I am a fan of artists who play Instruments, not just rock but anyone of any genre who actually has the talent to play music! Not sit at a computer and make beats like the good majority of rap music. So if your a fan of typical Rap DO NOT BUY this album, you'll be sorely disappointed that Lil Wayne is talented and can do more than just stand in front of a Mic. Otherwise Buy this album, it's nice to here a Rap artist that has some real talent!!!!!!!!
B002NPY7FE|4.0|Cujo is a classic tale of what can go wrong in normal life.  By now you know the story revolves around a rabid St Bernard named Cujo.  The story does a great job in showing how man's best friends can easily become your worst nightmare.  This bluray version of the original movie does do it some justice by providing improved visuals - the upgrades are not significant, but noticeable.  This is an easy recommend for any fan of the original movie.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This is a DVD to enjoy with family! I would watch it many times and not be bored. There are reasons to enjoy this over and over as one does not see all the meaningful details on the first viewing. I can't understand why it wasn't \\"bigger at the box office.\\" It is simply charming!
143911000X|5.0|Book is fantastic. Bought it for a gift, but when it came in I read some of it and had to buy one for myself. Some of the articles are new, and some are taken from the show and the ones taken from the show will bring you right back to that episode.
B0017IKR7K|5.0|I loved that album. I would recommend it for people who want to discover new country music. I'm sure they will love it too.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|At first I expected this book to be another sappy romance story in which the main characters end up living happily ever after. The beginning certainly seemed like it, however as the book progresses it becomes clearer and clearer that it isn't just another sappy love story but a story about true love and the many different ways love can be shown. Through many parts of the book I found my self holding back tears as my heart was aching for the characters. I could somewhat personally relate to this book as I had gone through a relationship that was separated by distance and only now having read this book 3 months after the break-up I felt that I could truly move on. For me this was much more than just a book but it was a guide in life, a sign pointing to the right direction. I recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a story about true love. I also think that people who love books that make them think may enjoy this book too, as the book does leave the reader with a lot to think about and I'm sure a lot of people can reflect back to their pasts or perhaps even their current life and re-evaluate a lot of things.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Very well done.  It more than met our expectations.  It is a nice MJ collectible that will stay in our family for years.
B000PA9Q6E|4.0|This one is a really nice Muddy Waters Blues sound, which you can't find in the new styles musicians play these days. Very good!
B001PO53IO|3.0|That's the main problem with this show.  The design is great.  The animation is fantastic.  The voice acting is decent and no doubt will get better as the show progresses.  The picture on blu ray is outstanding.      From a visual standpoint, the series offers complete immersion into the SW universe.  If that's mainly what you want and are not too concerned with the writing, this series will suit you just fine.  For the majority of the 22 episodes the scripting is about equal to that of the prequel trilogy.  If you are fine with the writing in episodes I - III, you will absolutely love this.  If you did not like the writing in those films, I would recommend renting this before purchasing.  There are a handful of excellent episodes, but too many others are chock full of things I did not enjoy about the prequel trilogy and that is the reasoning for my three-star review.  Ironically, the first episode is probably the best of the 22.    A number of races, cultures, and planets within the canon are featured prominently.  Lots of characters who were mere background pieces during the prequel trilogy are brought to full life here, and it's a great thing to see.  There are some excellent space battles and if you love to see the large and small starships of the SW universe in action you will be very satisfied.  It's a great expansion on film for many things we fanboys (and girls) have only read or dreamed about.  The clones are featured quite prominently, so those of you familiar with Karen Traviss' writing will also find much to enjoy.  While many characters are featured, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Anakin's padawan Asoka are definitely the main focus in the majority of the episodes.  Personally I would rather that not be the case because the galaxy is so large and the story possibilites are unlimited, but that being said there is plenty of deviation throughout and hopefully even more in future seasons.          There are behind-the-scenes features for quite a few of the episodes,one of which revealed that a particulary memorable villain was voiced by George Takei!  A nice surprise for Star Trek fans.  The packaging of the blu ray is excellent.  It is a book-like case containing quite a few pages of conceptual designs and notes from the pre-production period of the show.  The three discs are encased on the inside of the front and back covers and the aforementioned pages are between.  As you can see the cover has one of the Clone commanders, and if you display the package near your tv while you watch it's a menacing enhancement to the show.    So that's that.  Pleny to enjoy for Star Wars fans old and new alike, and plenty of room for improvement in regards to better writing in future seasons.  For those of you with the mindset that \\"it's only a cartoon, what do you expect?\\", I can point to numerous action/adventure cartoons with far superior writing and character development.  See Justice League season 2 and Justice League: Unlimited season 1 and 2 for examples.  I hope this was helpful to those of you on the fence.
B001YV506S|5.0|I did not think i would like this movie.  My husband made me watch it.  Both me and my 9 and 10 year old daughters loved it.  We can't wait to watch it again.

B001U887N8|4.0|I was skeptical when buying Crocs. They seem like such a fad. They aren't in style, but they are comfortable. I used them around the house and when I go to the laundry mat. For the price I got them for, it was a good buy and I'm glad I got them. Maybe the next step is to not care what people think and wear them in public.

1408215330|5.0|The best dictionary I've ever seen. I own Oxford learner's dictionary, and Longman turned out to be much more reader-friendly. The DVD is awesome too! It has a lot of useful exercises (grammar, vocabulary, etc.). It also has a bunch of pre-recorded phrases for each entry, and you exercises that let you practice your pronunciation: you can record yourself, and then listen to the pre-recorded version. A very very useful DVD for those who study (or just want to improve) their english. I wish there was a dictionary like this in other languages, I'm mostly interested in Spanish ;-)
B00005YIPM|5.0|I bought this on vinyl when I was a teenager. One of my favorite albums ever. This SACD is as close to bringing Carol King into your living room as you'll ever get. Wow! the price sure went up since I bought it. There is a demand for this, and the recording industry is pushing crap like GAGA GOOGOO.
B00003CXBH|4.0|Great box set I gave my wife for Christmas.  Easy to order, quickly shipped, arrived well packaged.  Excellent movie, well acted and wonderful location scenery.    Patrick
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. My son (3 yrs old) and daughter (18 months) love this movie. I can't say enough good things. The only reason I bought it is, it includes the animated shorts Dug's Mission and Partyly Cloudy which are both delightful.  This movie is for adults and kids.  You get a disc in high def and a disk for the regular dvd player.  The blu ray will not play on regular players. Keep up the good work Pixar.

1401923119|1.0|I was initially intrigued by Lipton's comments, especially his long discourse on how genes and proteins work.  However, about 5 minutes from the end of the audio book, he mentions \\"Jesus\\" at least twice in the context of our ability to create miracles, or the \\"miracles of Jesus', with our mind.  I was not sure where he was going with the book since almost all of it is discussion of cell biology, or at least cell biology as described by Lipton.  The author goes through a lengthy explanation of cell biology only to end up asserting we can change our gene expression, or biology, through our thoughts.  As other reviewers have noted, he does not go into how we can change our biology, simply referencing some techniques.  The book is really just a \\"scientific\\" argument to lay the groundwork for something else, namely another new age theory of how mind energy can control matter.  I bought this book on iTunes and only after hitting the \\"Buy\\" button did I think to run Lipton through a quack detector.  There is little out there but I did find some discussion on a forum for readers of Richard Dawkins; I would give the link to the forum, but Amazon keeps deleting it in my review.  Some of the other reviewers have done an excellent job of pointing out the problems with Lipton's theory.    I agree that we really do not know all that much about the universe, why we are here, how our brains work and so on.  We have a lot to learn and we may very well discover someday that our thoughts can have a substantial impact on our gene expression, cure us of disease and perform an infinite number of miracles.  However, the evidence for this is sketchy and almost all experiments to prove the existence of psi, or other mysterious mind energy or control, have shown that nothing like this exists, or at least we cannot measure it yet.  I am skeptical and need evidence - Lipton's book provides none.  The book is just rambling weird science and I cannot recommend it because it does not do a good jobof addressing epigenetics (this is a real area of science) and seems to be the foundation for Lipton's new age philosophy and business.  Also, Lipton's mention of Jesus at the end of the book is incongruous; faith is not science because you cannot observe, measure, prove or disprove mythological beliefs and their consequences.   By resorting to religious fervor at the end of the book, Lipton completely undermines his credibility as a scientist, and all his material up to that point gets called into question.  Look elsewhere for learning about epigenetics - this book goes onto the shelf with the new age hucksters.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|A lot of people have seen this movie, but when watched on BlueRay the quality of the special effects seems much better.  I'm not saying they re-did the CGI, but the existing CGI was cleaned up perfectly, making watching this movie a whole new experience and very pleasant to the eyes. Tim Burton used very bright colors over dull backgrounds which works quite well.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|In my youth, I mostly had eyes for Leo. I put away this movie for a long time assuming it was just a teenage phase, but pulling it out again years later just cements its real value.<br /><br />Titanic was written and directed by James Cameron and was basically his baby for years. This movie won 11 Oscars. This movie tells the story of the tragic sinking of grandest ship ever made on her maiden voyage through the eyes of young lovers from different classes, Jack and Rose played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.<br /><br />Again, Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses because not only is she amazingly talented, she holds up a standard of a real woman's appearance, not a anorexic twig. Her portrayl of Rose DeWitt Bukater being forced into a loveless marriage to save her destitute family masquerading that they still have money. Her emotional highs and lows throughout are amazing.<br /><br />Her fiance, Cal Hockley was played by Billy Zane as one of my favorite uptight villains. His nose is in the stratosphere and he sneers down at everyone below his class, especially the threat to his love life, Jack. I particularly love the scene where he has an opportunity to help Jack and ruthlessly chooses not to, but the magnitude of that decision still brings tears to his eyes.<br /><br />And of course, Jack Dawson played by Leonardo DiCaprio captured the attention of all females age 13 and up for several years while he wisely went into his shell until his work could again be judged without hormones getting in the way. His character of Jack is instantly likable, charismatic, moving, and if you don't feel anything for his humanity by the end of the movie and want to save him, your high level of testosterone is probably impeding your judgment. It has been 13 years since this movie came out so it's much easier to look at it with a clear frame of mind unclouded by gooey-eyes or jealousy.<br /><br />I love the supporting actors: Bernard Hill as Captain Edward James Smith (years before Theoden in Lord of the Rings), Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews, Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Rose's Mother, Ruth, and Jonathan Hyde as Bruce Ismay. All have a measure of dignity and grace (except Ismay of course) as they deal with the emergency on board and I really feel like they bring those historic people to life in a way that garners empathy from the audience.<br /><br />The amazing images of the boat, the scale, the effects all take you completely into the movie, the grandeur and the danger. The music is beautiful although I could do without Celine Dion's song these days. If you haven't seen this movie, you live under a rock but it really is an amazing story based on historic events. Many of the events in this movie ACTUALLY happened, just not to fictional characters Jack and Rose. It is a blockbuster, one of the biggest movies of that decade, one of the biggest movies ever really and it propelled all careers of those involved to new heights.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />After holding out on us for many years, this super deluxe special edition showing all the behind-the-scenes goodies was finally released. This edition has commentary from cast and crew including James Cameron and Kate Winslet (Sorry, no Leonardo DiCaprio). There is also a track of historical commentary commenting on the time period, appearance of the boat, and events that occurred as the movie progresses. If you're a history buff at all and interested in hearing more about the boat, it is definitely worth a listen. My favorite is that someone was actually scolded for breaking property on the Titanic while it was sinking. In this edition, the sound has been upgraded, the colors are richer, and the picture was anamophically enhanced for widescreen televisions. The only downside is that the movie is split into two discs so you have to get up and change it if you don't have a multi-disc player.<br /><br />There are over 45 minutes of never-before-seen deleted sceneswith optional commentary. One includes the nearby ship California's reaction to the Titanic distress call. The alternate ending, \\"Brock's Epiphany\\" thankfully was not used. Jack does not live, it's just really lame. Celine Dion's music video for \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" is included. There are just hundreds and hundreds of on-set photos, personal photos from the cinematographer, storyboard sketches, and technical drawings. There are many featurettes on how certain effects were achieved and what portions of the set were built to scale and which were modeled. A great deal had to be constructed rather than rented since it was going to be destroyed. The construction timplapse is particularly spectacular. The deep dive presentation in full is humbling as you get to see Titanic at the bottom of the sea minus Brock's rambling. The \\"Breaking New Ground\\" TV special does a good overview of the making of the film in a shorter time span, but if you want to see every detail, you probably can with this edition because all the bells and whistles are there...minus Leo.ction to the Titanic distress call.

B0006B2A2E|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind DVD Review<br />2 Disc Collector's Edition (2004)<br /><br />This is an almost a perfect movie for me.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was directed by Michel Gondry who also wrote it along with Charlie Kaufman and Pierre Bismuth. I want to live in this man's head for a day, his brilliance and creativity and ingenuity with limited resources was inspiring and gripping to say the least. This is a different kind of love story, beginning at the end and ending at the beginning. Joel played by Jim Carrey and Clementine played by Kate Winslet are a couple who have had their ups and downs like anyone else. During this latest down, Joel goes to a specialist to have his memories of Clementine erased after he finds out she did the same for him. As he drifts though the memories, he finds he doesn't want to forget because he still loves her.<br /><br />Jim Carrey took a turn for the dramatic here. One of his first scenes is really balling his eyes out in the car in utter anguish. It hits you right in the gut when you realize you can empathize with that emotion of being at bottom and that this normally comedic actor strikes right to your core. This character is so different from his other roles. He's shy, awkward, inhibited for once, angry, and heart-broken.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is one of my favorite actresses. Her Clementine is real, quirky, charismatic, impulsive, and moody. She is the outgoing one instead of Jim Carrey and carries many of the comedic moments. Her unique rainbow of hair colors really displays her personality to the world.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tom Wilkinson plays Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, inventor of the process of erasing memories. His employees include his receptionist, Mary played by Kirsten Dunst who admires him and secretly loves him, field worker Stan played by Mark Ruffalo who is in love with Mary and has a relationship with her, and another field worker, Patrick played by Elijiah Wood. Elijiah Wood plays an uncharacteristically creepy role here (this was before Sin City, mind you) who falls in love with Clementine during the memory erasure and uses Joel's memories to woe her. It's a very complicated layering of love triangles and while the storyline of the memory clinic workers is linear, the story of Joel and Clementine is backward through Joel's eyes.<br /><br />It's amazing how memories of a person are just moments in time that you experience with them, good or bad and they can be very random or very special. Since it's all within the mind, there's a lot of jumping around and fuzziness, especially as Joel tries to find ways to outwit the process. It's also one of those movies where you actually notice how good the music is, I got the soundtrack afterward. The love themes and the \\"Elephant Parade\\" track are especially moving. This movie will stick with you emotionally, the last scenes always bring tears to my eyes. It also takes you on a thrill ride that will open up your mind and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering if he will succeed.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />There is director & writer commentary and there are conversations with the director alone, with Jim Carrey, and with Kate Winslet as they dissect characters and talk about how certain effects were done. It's amazing how simple some things were and how many ideas the director had, many that never even were used! One example is during one memory of an argument with Clementine, Joel is walking away and she becomes blurry while he does not. There were a pair of grips walking behind with a frosted glass pane to achieve the effect. In another scene, Clementine is leaving the apartment and she goes into one room and then appears in another and then appears by the front door. This was achieved with trapdoors and at the last second, a body double! Very smart, very simple. In one scene taken in one shot, Jim Carrey had to play Joel in the doorway and then Joel sitting in a chair in the room so hekept running behind the camera and putting his hat on and off till they got it. Some deleted scenes show more dreamy out-of-sequence events and odd situations with Clementine and Joel trying to evade the memory erasers. They give just a little more activity for the characters and illustrate the genius of the director. A Polyphonic Spree Music video is on Disc 1 and you'll either love it or hate it. It's a very sunny song that will make you jump around the room or groan in disgust depending on your frame of mind. I really enjoyed the Lacuna Commercial also on Disc 1 showing how the memory erasing could be advertised by the company, it's pretty amusing and disturbing at the same time. One of my favorite bits would be the Anatomy of a Scene bonus feature on Disc 2 where they take the major fight scene where cars and things are falling from the sky in the memory and breakdown how it was done in layers, how things were added, until the final product developed. One last thing, this DVD comes with a Souvenir booklet that mainly has quotes from critics about how special and unique they felt the movie was along with many production still photos.kept running behind the camera and putting his hat on and off till they got it.

0811870987|5.0|The front cover is eye catching, and it only gets better! Zuckerman has created a fantastic book which presents birds as you've never seen before. He must have put a lot of effort and creative thinking into how to catch the individuality and personality of a bird, as the photos focus on eyes and specific movements that show them as individuals. And the design/layout make the book really stand out from the masses. Anybody can nowadays with a prosumer camera take a decent photography of a bird broadwise, but to make it interesting requires more. The photos are taken under controlled conditions, but even then it is impressive - the book makes you want to go out and do something creative yourself!

Concert footage, interviews with Paul, George, and Ringo.  Only thing missing would be an interview with John....Wish you were here.  Anyway,  this is one that you will watch again and again.  Well done!
B0026P3G12|5.0|The CD by Susan Boyle is great.  I listen to it all the time.  I ordered several for Christmas presents.  It is Great Listening! and I especially like the personal notes Susan has written for each song.  It is a most personal album.
0743290119|5.0|I really enjoyed both \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" and \\"Chasing Harry Winston.\\"  Chasing Harry Winston is a great book and a fun read.  I tend to lean towards classics or mystery books, but this was a light-hearted, engaging story that at times was funny, heart-warming and human.  I honestly can't wait for the movie!  It's excellent story telling with relatable characters.  This is not supposed to be a serious, mind-altering book. Lighten up and enjoy the ride!  It's great fun.
B002BW7A58|4.0|Before I actually purchased the album, I read most of the reviews on the album. For the most part, they were negative, but I support my artists so I still bought it anyway. So after listening to the album Im wondering what is so bad about it? Now im not saying this is a classic album, honestly the best songs (7-12) are at the end of the album. Only tracks that shouldnt be on here is Paradice and Get A life(maybe Da Da Da too). Songs like Hot Revolver and Ready For The World shoulda made the album cut instead. Wayne said this isnt a rap album, its not exactly a pure rock album either but no other rapper could even attempt to pull this off so applaud him on that!     Prom Queen, Ground Zero, and American Star are pretty good songs that are worth a listen to.    Best Songs(7-12)    On Fire-best produced track on the album.    Drop The World-Eminem stole the show but Wayne did good as well.    Runnin- good song with a good verse and hook by Shanell.    One Way Trip- Probaly my favorite song on the album. Wayne is actually just rapping over a rock beat ; great lyrics by Weezy.    Knockout-Nicki Minaj stole the show on this song. Almost sounded like this coulda been her song if she had a rock album lol.    Price Is Wrong-idk why I like this song much but I just do. probably will remind you of your ex but a good song.    Overall good album. Honestly, I wouldn't mind a Rebirth 2 from Wayne.
1400052173|5.0|This book is mesmerizing from many different angles.  The story of Henrietta Lacks is captivating.  The science about the development of the first immortal human cell line (HeLa) is both important and incredibly well told.  The story about the author's obsession with the woman behind the HeLa cells is a fascinating addition to the story of the cells and the woman.  And the way that the author Rebecca Skloot weaves all three of these stories together into one tale is just great.  I could not put the book down.
8862930496|5.0|I have tried three different sizes of moleskine weekly notebook. First I tried the medium sized one which was good. Then I tried the bigger one which just couldn't fit in any decent sized handbag. This is the smallest one, about the size of my palm. It still gives plenty of room to write on the notebook page of each spread. I really love that feature about all three sizes and couldn't imagine having any other calendar. It fits easily in a pocket or handbag. And it looks really good, too. Wherever I am in the world I go out of my way to get it.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|Sorry to say that I didn't pay much attention to MJ the performer until after his death.  Went to see \\"This Is It\\" to see how he worked as well as the substance to his talent.  In short, there was a lot to be impressed about.  Even while rehearsing for the London Tour he obviously had a lot of the energy shown many years before on this performance.  MJ was a real talent.  I have come to appreciate him lately.  I wish I had sooner.  This video is fun to watch and to see an exceptional \\"song and dance\\" man at work!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This series is well worth the money if you are into learning about the planet and all of the many things that makes it such a beautiful place. They are all so interesting and the cinematography is exquisite. These film makers clearly risked their lives and sacrificed a lot to get shots that no one has ever recorded and shared with the world. AMAZING! LOVE THEM! (Defiantly worth buying the Blu-ray version)
B000VWGYHU|4.0|This is the album that convinced me that Marshall/Eminem was an artist and not just a quirky one-hit wonder.  I'm not a hip-hop fan for the most part, but I like it when it is good and its not just about what champagne they drink and how many girls they've been with.  I like N.W.A., Dr. Dre solo, early Snoop, and Mos Def.  When they are saying something meaningful, I think rap is great and this album proved that Eminem was a true artist to me.  It is a dark self-exploration and a reaction to the fanfare that accompanied his first release and it led to what I consider to be his best release so far, \\"Lose Yourself\\".  Great job, Marshall, you gained a fan with this one.
0061537969|5.0|The Art Of Racing In The Rain by Garth Stein is awesome.  It started out slow and I thought about giving up on it but I'm so glad I stuck with it and finished it.  It is narrated by a dog named Enzo who is devoted to his owner, Denny, a race car driver.  The dog and Denny sit and watch videos of car races together, while Denny points out racing tips to the dog that he applies to life.<br /><br />Denny had lots of personal problems including a sick wife who died of Brain Cancer and the constant battle with his in-laws over his daughter and a bogus criminal lawsuit against him.<br /><br />The dog shares it's thoughts with the reader but can only communicate to his owners with gestures which is frustrating for it and so he looks forward to being reincarnated as a man.  It's an inspirational book, encouraging the reader to \\"finish the race\\" and never, ever quit but hang in and overcome obstacles.<br /><br />I loved the ending!  Great book!
0807014265|3.0|I was anticipating this read so much that when I finally started reading it, it was a slow and drawn out first section of the book.  There are basically two parts to the book: one is Viktor's experience in the Nazi camps and the other is his examination of the effects on him and others he observed. The first part of the book is what \\"killed\\" it for me.  Too much detail and just too long for what he's trying to get to.  The second part of the book is much better, but not what I thought it would be.  Overall, this book is highly raved about by speakers, leaders, etc but I think it's just because the overall them of the book, not because the book is so great.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I purchased this for my boss, who is a HUGE McCartney fan.  He missed the televised show, so it worked out as a perfect gift.  He said that it was great and he really enjoyed it.
1401309666|4.0|I ran into this book by accident and boy am I glad I did! It's a fascinating look on how product marketing has changed in the Internet era. Written in 2006, when Social Media was not the rage it is today, it's even more relevant today. No matter what your industry is, if you want to succeed as a business today, you can't afford to avoid lessons from this book. I did wish that there was a \\"Cliff's Notes\\" version of this book as it is written by someone who obviously has a brilliant mind and often gets so nuanced that you have to read a paragraph multiple times to figure out the gist of it. Also, there seem to be some repetitive themes. If the book was tightened a bit, it could perhaps lose about 30% of its pages and would become a better read. Nevertheless, a great reference in anybody's library with a vested in interest in succeeding as a product producer, marketer and distributor.

B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side, directed by John Lee Hancock, inspired many people through the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron).  Oher lived his whole life in poverty and homelessness.  Then in an extraordinary turn of events the Tuohys, a rich white family from Nashville, Tennessee, take him into their massive home and Michael Oher joins the family.  Michael then achieves greatness in football through the position of left tackle.      The movie began with a play-by-play account narrated by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) of a professional football game in which a legendary quarterback was injured. The defensive lineman, Lawrence Taylor, tackled the quarterback in his blind side.  (Hence the name of the movie.)  The left tackle position then became much more valued because the quarterback needs someone to protect their blind side.  This tied into the story because huge, tall Michael Oher had extreme protective instincts.  The Tuohy family helped Michael achieve his potential both athletically and academically by showing him unconditional love and never failing support.    The Blind Side also proves an important point to the nation.  It received an extremely large profit; by January 1 it reached the 200 million mark.  The movie appealed to everyone.  Sports fans enjoyed watching the football, Moms loved to see the strong willed mother Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock), and kids could not stop laughing about little S.J. Tuohy's (Jae Head) hilarious proposals.  The Blind Side wonderfully depicts the story of Michael Oher.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I bought this set at Amazon as we approached the end of David Tennant's tenure as Doctor Who.  My kids and I have only recently (within the last two years) begun watching the show and it has become the one that we cannot miss.  And series four is my personal favorite, because of Donna Noble.  (Well, and Tennant and Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner...)  Donna brings a companion to the series who is clearly an adult, and one who has developed her own sense of integrity, her own judgement of right and wrong that does not bow to the Time Lord but can make the Time Lord bow to her, as in the conclusion of \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\".  Watching Donna come to an understanding of the dilemma the Doctor faces in making the difficult choices, reaching her own sense of rightness, and taking some of the responsibility onto herself gives her companion more importance than the flirtations with the two previous girls could achieve.  Transforming from a silly woman to a true friend, Donna brings great things to the show.    And, of course, the famous literary character (Agatha Christie), the child genius gone unthinkingly wrong (The Sontaran Stratagem), and the stunningly surprising question, \\"Is the Doctor married?\\" (Silence in the Library)...  Well, good times are had at my home every time we bring out these DVD's.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This is a great film, but there is foul language in it. Not advised for middle school age unless you preview and censor it prior.
1595141979|5.0|I have to say that I absolutely loved this book. The story was well written and it made me really feel for Rose in some parts. I liked the way Rachelle wrote about the stuggle that Rose goes through with her love for Dimitri and her vow to protect Lissa. I can't wait to read Blood Promise now.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I am an avid fan of Jane Austen, especially Pride & Prejudice.  A friend loaned me this copy to compare it to the other versions and what I found was a sorry excuse for movie making.  They should have named it, \\"The Reduced Austen Company's 'Pride & Prejudice' in 20 minutes.\\"  I have never seen movie actors given nothing to work with and then rushing through it in such a graceless, humorless, unmoving way.  Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden were a nice looking pair but neither was up to the stuff of Austen.  Did the director not see the wit and wisdom of the film?  They \\"Hollywoodized\\" and tortured the soul of the story.  It does not follow the book, they rewrote lines from the novel, making it harsher, more vulgar.  Do we wonder that the British laugh at us when it come to film making?    I feel for Dame Judi Dench who was given nothing to work with, no room to move, whose delivery was rushed for the sake of \\"movie time\\"  Her talents were wasted in this film.  I gave one star for pretty views (considering so many scenes were ridiculously out of doors.)  I'll grant that the last 2 minutes of the movie were sweet, though had almost nothing to do with novel, but it's not worth a rental or even another viewing in my opinion. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle got it right.  Matthew Macfayden will never be a \\"true\\" Mr. Darcy.  Please, please don't bother.

B002MW50KO|4.0|Merry happy to ya...our sharp-tongued Bobby D smooths off the edges and lets sentimental holiday favorites flow over the gravel of his worn vocal chords.  What a player.  Maybe this one is for the grandkids?  Maybe it's a wee candy cane poke in the eye of Jolly St. Nick?  Maybe it's just good clean fun?      Or maybe in his old age he really has gone soft in the head and succumbed to our deranged observance of the winter solstice.        Who knows what he's up to, but I wouldn't have missed this album for anything.  It helped me get through my own deranged observance of the sacred season.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae's debut is smooth and sexy in the way that Norah Jones' album \\"Come on Over\\" was. Corinne is talented in spades, and her voice is both sexy and youthfully innocent at once. This is a great CD if you and your honey plan on staying in for the evening.

0312370849|5.0|Historical fiction at its best! A touching story of how the Vel'd'HIV round up July, 16 1942 effected people and continues to effect people from the time of its occurrence through the years to the present day.  The story is told through the voice of a young girl (Sarah) as she experienced the horrors of the event and through the voice of the people she touched.  Sarah's Key is a remarkable story of strength, courage, hatred and cruelty few of us can imagine, incredible kindness and love.   A \\"must read\\" for everyone. I couldn't put the book down; reading through the night, well aware of the consequences a sleepless night would bring to the rapidly approaching work day.
0307460444|5.0|I really love this book, recipes are perfect and they taste better. I already made 4 or 5 recipes and also made some combinations by myself.  For sure I'm going to continue trying until I finish the book.    5 stars for Martha Stewart's Cupcake book.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Its not often that I find movies or television series that strive to play things as realistically as this series has. So naturally I was excited when I read about this series online and being someone interested in the military it was something I couldn't pass up, and it didn't disappoint.    What I liked most was the brutal honesty, no bias just telling it like it is, a rarity in today's media. Also the fact that one of the actual marines  that the series follows played himself, which only adds to the credibility of the material.    Two thumbs up, and if I had a third that would be up too.

B0010V4TZU|5.0|Coffee house `sophistication' meets college rock `nerdy sheik' wrapped up in an atmosphere strait out of independent film goddess Sophia Coppola's wildest dreams; Vampire Weekend as a band is pretty much a dream come true.<br /><br />My dream come true.<br /><br />It's funny because I've never really given this breed of indie-rock a chance before a friend (ex-friend) gave me a copy of Vampire Weekend's debut album, and even then I was kind of certain it was going to disappoint and so it sat in my car for nearly a year before I gave it a shot.  After I gave it one listen I was hooked and it stayed in my car stereo for quite a while.  In fact, this album is one of my favorite albums in any genre.  There is only one track is dislike (`One') and only three that don't grab me as some sort of perfection (`Mansard Roof', `Cape Cod' and `Bryn'), but those three are still great songs.<br /><br />Yes, this album is a complete pleasure.<br /><br />I'll get my feelings about `One' out of the way.  I hate the chorus.  I actually like the musical arrangement and the verse structure is fine (albeit a little bland) but that whiny delivery of `Blake's Got A New Face' is just like fingernails on a chalkboard to be.  The song just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />But that's just me.<br /><br />Now, I really like `Mansard Roof', so when I say that is doesn't strike me as perfection, that is all I mean.  I like it, but it isn't perfect.  Maybe it's the length, because it album feels like half a song.  I do think that it is a great way to open the album because it really lets you know who this band is and what you are in store for.  Maybe the fact that it is preceded by the glorious `Oxford Comma' is part of the reason why this song doesn't wow me as much as it does others.  I also really like `Cape Cod', although I find the verses to be less engaging than they could have been.  The chorus is wonderful though (I love the falsettos, and the slight breakdown during \\"it feels so unnatural\\" is a small delight).  I like the almost Irish folk sound to the opening of `Bryn'.  Outside of that musical interlude (they use it after the choruses are sung as well) is the most interesting part of the song though.  I don't really find the rest of the song to be that noteworthy; and like `Mansard Roof', it also feels like half a song.  If it had been elaborated on a tad I may enjoy it even more.<br /><br />Like I said, they are not perfect, but I still like them a lot.<br /><br />So, now we have the perfection, or, as I should say, the rest of the album.  `Oxford Comma' is utterly spellbinding.  The musical arrangement is so chill yet it has a soft bounce that engages the listener, and the lyrical content (while explicit in parts) is weaved so magically by Ezra Koenig that it becomes an instrument all it's own.  This is the definition of coffee house rock.  `A-Punk' has that punk rock vibe (and the vocals have Sublime and the like written all over them) but there is still that chilled atmosphere (the chorus is simply brilliant) that makes this signature Vampire Weekend.<br /><br />When I mentioned Sophia Coppola in the outset of this review, I was referring to her vision behind `Marie Antoinette', and I recall that film mostly because of the magnificent opening musical arrangement found on `M79'.  This song is probably my favorite on the album, for it is so unique, so impressively visionary and just effortlessly captivating.  Each and every part of the song is superb.<br /><br />I love `Campus'.  It captures college love beautifully, and it sounds impeccable.  I love the different side of the band found on `I Stand Corrected'.  There is a real subdued quality here that they play with flawlessly.  Sure, they interject energy into the song in stages, but it shows that they understand how to play around within their own comfort zone.  `Walcott' is just fun.  It opens with high-octane piano keys and then carries on with such a catchy flow.<br /><br />And I love Cape Cod by the way!<br /><br />For me, there was no better way to end the album than to insert their own spin on reggae with the infectious (and equally outstanding) `The Kids Don't Stand a Chance'.  I say reggae, and before anyone attacks me for that, you can't really deny the influence.  Listen to the way he sings this song, as if he were sharing the stage with Bob Marley.  Ezra carries this song to new heights, and the lyrical message is poignant and expertly delivered.  They are always true to their own sound (thus the expressive musical arrangements) but they broke out of their box with this one.<br /><br />Applause.<br /><br />I don't think I can rave this album enough.  I love their sophomore album as well, but it is not as good as this one.  I could listen to this on repeat for days and days and days (I have and I will).ir own spin on reggae with the infectious (and equally outstanding) `The Kids Don't Stand a Chance'.

B001DZDTX6|5.0|What can I say?  This album was the first album that I bought from Rush.  It is really, truely a brilliant album.  I've listened to it many times since I got it three years ago.  It grows on you a lot.  There is so many elements to it that make it such a classic.  It's got the staple pop hits Tom Sawyer and Limelight, but it's also got even better songs(I think) with Witch Hunt and The Camera Eye.  Hell, every song on this album is very listenable.  I don't like skipping around on this one, I like to listen to it in it's entirety because it's that good.<br /><br />I've since bought many more Rush albums, but this is my favorite.  I think, presumably along with lots of other folks, that Rush hit their peak with this album.  They built themselves up with 2112, A Farewell to Kings, Hemishperes, and Permanent Waves to reach a new level of greatness.  Those previous albums are all fantastic, but fall short compared to Moving Pictures.<br /><br />Every instrument is on.  Geddy Lee finally figures out his vocals, and there is more use of the keyboard.  I mean, Tom Sawyer is driven by the damn thing.  Also, Peart lays down many classic beats.  He even includes a little soloing here and there, but never too long to make it boring.  The bass parts are sexy, if you will.  I love Geddy Lee as a bassist.  And the guitar solo on Limewight by Lifeson couldn't be better.<br /><br />If you are a Rush fan and you don't have this, go get it now!  If you are a progressive rock fan, go get this now!<br /><br />Notable Tracks(I should list all of them):<br />The Camera Eye<br />Witch Hunt

B002C1BHIO|5.0|I bought this at the same time as I purchased the Mediabridge Ultra Series HDMI cable.  I had sync issues between my cable box and my Samsung LCD HDTV and figured it was worth a try.  I tried the lower cost Mediabridge Ultra first and, voila! no sync problems since!  So the Mediabridge Ultra did the trick at a lower cost than this Amazon Basics cable.    So why the high review of this cable?  Well, I also bought a second, larger HDTV for the bedroom and didn't have a cable for it, so the Amazon cable is working perfectly on that set while the Mediabridge does the work on the smaller set.  From a functionality standpoint, I cannot and would not claim that this more costly Amazon cable is any better than the Mediabridge Ultra.  But when it comes to the construction quality, the Amazon is a cut above and therefore worth a review.      While some will argue that all HDMI HiSpeed cables are the same, that is true only if the cable doesn't have any mechanical problems.  For example, if your equipment is in a tight spot and the cable has to be bent 90 degrees close to the connector, there is the possibly that a lesser quality cable could suffer damage to either the connector or to some of the copper strands inside the cable itself.  That may well be what caused my sync problems in the first place because the cable supplied with my Samsung TV frankly had weaker connector protection than either the Mediabridge and certainly this Amazon Basics cable.  Whether any of the other EMI protection, etc. makes any difference I truly cannot say, but i can say that the Amazon cable is the best of the three that I have tried, has construction quality that appears on par with the 'best' branded cables, and the fact that I can buy 3 or 4 of these Amazon cables for the Monstrous price of one of those branded cables, and this is a no brainer!  If you want a very good, high performance cable that does the job, the Mediabridge Ultra is recommended without reservation.  If you want the same performance in an even higher quality of construction (and it looks nicer, too!), this Amazon Basics is worth the step up.  And you are still saving lots of $$$$ over the big brand cables.

B001CTDH76|2.0|Los amantes de las series de suspenso, sean de investigación privada o policial, esperan sorpresas, caminos nuevos y que la tensión en cada capítulo vaya subiendo se acuerdo a la conocida secuencia de \\"hilo, nudo y desenlace\\". En mi opinión, The Mentalist (1ra. Temporada) carece de ello. Incluso si uno la considerara dentro del género intermedio de la \\"comedia policial\\" (en el que se encuentra, por ejemplo, Bones), se la siente insípida y carente de imaginación.     Cuando pienso en un mentalista lo asocio de inmediato a un ilusionista, al estilo del personaje de Harlequin, aquella maravillosa película inglesa con Robert Powell, Carmen Duncan, David Hemmings y Broderick Crawford, y siento que The Mentalist se encuentra a \\"años luz\\" de ella. Para mí, no vale la pena.
0385340540|1.0|I finally gave up on this book on page 151.  If you are into learning how to read restaurant menus in Italian or if you need something to read so you can quickly fall asleep then this is the book for you.  Grisham builds absolutely zero empathy for the protagonist and the cast of characters surrounding him are sooooo dull.  The amount of print devoted to learning the Italian language is just God-awful incredible.  I do not know why or how Grisham could write such drivel, English or Italian.  Take the money you would spend on this book and go to Olive Garden for dinner--you will be spending your time and money far more wisely and the menu will be in English.
0385504225|3.0|This book was typical Dan Brown fashion...lots of research, which can make it difficult to read and comprehend at times, page-turning thriller occasionally, but overall, it didn't quite live up to the hype as the sequel to The DaVinci Code.
0861714911|5.0|It's a good anthology.  Not that I would know.  I have not studied the Pali Canon extensively enough to know what should go into an anthology and what shouldn't.  That's why I count on the author to have done that for me.  Because I am lazy, and I got other things going on.  I mean seriously, If I studied Buddhism to the extent that I know I should, I would be in a monastery (preferably the Bodhinyana Monastery in Australia).  But I don't, and thus I leave the deliverance of the Buddha's message in the hands of people who, I hope, know what they're doing.    The anthology is set up in a way that seems to have an appropriate progression of ideas.  Which, as I understand it, is not how the texts were originally written, or spoken.  It is nice to have that sort of analytical cohesion.    I did not expect so much dialogue, though, I must admit.   I expected it to be more like the Dhammapada in matter of fact style, almost poetry.  but it is not.  It is a lot of some dude asking Siddhartha questions, and Siddhartha answering them in the long drawn out, repetitive way that only the Buddha can.    I like it.  It is a good book.  The translation is believable.  And it looks fantastically pretentious on my bookshelf at work.  Take that coworkers.  I'm wicked spiritual!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|This was a fasciniating look in to the trials & tribulations of a rock band....very real.  Admire the hell out of them for putting themselves out there and allowing us in to see in to their world.  More bands should work out there issues and stay together...pays off!  LOVED IT!
B0030BYWKK|2.0|I am going to listen to this album a few more times before I give up on it.  It is pretty boring though.  The album is well produced and has plenty of the layered sound that I expected. I still love Midlake, but this record comes off as a collection of lullabies.  It is a total yawn-fest.  I was really looking forward to this record...for a long time...which makes it suck more I guess.

0440238153|1.0|Really, only thing that could be said of this book that would pose some kind of justice to it is - Oh! My! God! And don't be mistaken. Those are not shouts of joy or praise. Now, I'm not a religious person, at least not in any conventional way, and I like more than anything intelligent bashing of any kind of organized religion, but this doesn't even come close to it. And what is even worse, it sucks at storytelling. Now, for those of you who have read first two installments of this series this may come as a surprise. It sure did come that way to me. First two books are excellent fiction, excellent storytelling and one of the better examples of writing in contemporary prose, but third book is something entirely opposite. It almost seems like Pullman casted aside story and started on a voyage of polemic arguments against religion. Which wouldn't be so bad if there were any argument present. It seems like this book is consisted of nothing more than angry, illogical phrases and events that serve only one purpose - to piss catholic Church off. And, as far as I can tell, it does very good job at it. But this attack actually does something else. It deals a heavy blow to every independent thinker out there who battles with fundamentalism of any kind. In a way that if Pullman novel is best what atheist thinker and novelist can offer, why trouble yourself with it. It isn't even worth disputing with. And, following the mysterious trail of analogy, and strange logic of one that stands for all, we can easily discard any argument against religion.<br /><br /> What Pullman does is huge misunderstanding of faith, theology, religion and concept of existence of God. And hey, it would be okay (so to say we could easily discard this as a fictional representation) if it isn't for the fact that Lyra and Will somehow got lost inside this debate. Not to mention huge change of Miss Coulter character (which, beside being illogical kinda makes you puke), trashy ending, liberation of the dead and \\"heart-breaking\\" conversations in underworld and all kinds of endeavors like those which make entire novel very high on throw-it-in-the-volcano-never-to-see-it-again list.<br /><br />I guess one must make a slip at some point when writing the epic, and Pullman did it in third chapter. What started as a great adventure with lot of potential became a squishy mass of soap-opera dialogues and events that will be hard to swallow even for those with stomachs much tougher than mine. I suppose that if you're already reading this series and you've come this far, you have to finish it. But be warned, it doesn't pay off. You'll do better with imagining an ending of your own.rt-breaking\\" conversations in underworld and all kinds of endeavors like those which make entire novel very high on throw-it-in-the-volcano-never-to-see-it-again list.

B000RJO578|5.0|Sometimes a satire goes beyond just satire. \\"Hot Fuzz\\" makes fun of the common over the top police buddy films by giving us the usual unlikely couple taken to extremes. Nicholas Angel is more than \\"by the book\\"-- he lives the book, and his partner Danny is a caricature of the slightly inept, slightly lazy policeman. The relationship between the two is played for the usual laughs against a British community that is just a little too perfect and a little too peaceful.    And then the movie sneaks up on us as the two partners get to genuinely like one another and we get to genuinely like them, even as the nefarious plot behind the town's quiet unfolds in a series of gristly murders. So Nicholas, who is so good at police work he rarely has ever needed to use guns, and Danny, who has always wanted to use guns but never had the chance, get to take on a cast of most unlikely villains in a classic shootout that is both exciting and comical.    \\"Hot Fuzz\\" makes homage to its sources, the ultra-violent cop films of the last twenty years, even as it lampoons them. This is a top-notch film.

0307387178|5.0|From start to finish, I read this book knowing the terrible fate of Chris McCandless. The story begins with the discovery of his dead body in an abandoned bus. From the time this young man made set off to the wilderness of Alaska, he became Alexander Supertramp. He had given away everything, the only thing that he held on to from his former life was his name, and by changing that he was now free.   \\"So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more dangerous to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.\\" -- Chris McCandless. This bit of writing from the young man who escaped society really embodies his view on life.     Chris had changed his name, burnt all the cash in his wallet, and left all of his possessions behind. Just like a snake, he had shed his skin. All that Chris had on him when ventured up to into the wilderness of Alaska was a .22 caliber rifle, a ten pound bag of rice, a field guide of edible plants and berries, cheap hiking boots, and the clothes on his back. The life he saw ahead of him was going to be untouched by the society that had poisoned his previous one.    To many, Chris could be described as naïve, and his story, depressing. But the way that Krakauer tells the story gives McCandless a near mythical status. He is the man who took his live by the handlebars and did something so bold, that his story could almost come off as fiction. Krakauer does a fantastic job presenting his research and his own opinions and commentary in this book. The feelingsthat you develop for Chris are extraordinary, and I think that is what makes this book one of my favorites of all time.

0140277447|5.0|This is a very well written book about a horrifying chapter in humanity's history. Iris Chang has written a very readable book that never gets bogged down like many dry history books do. The narrative comes alive with the many first person accounts she includes, mostly from the diaries of the Westerners who were there trying to help, but also from many Chinese citizens who survived. I particularly liked the chapter where Chang tries her best to dissect the psychology of the Japanese soldiers to figure out WHY and HOW they were able to shed their humanity and commit such unspeakable acts upon helpless civilians. The pictures included in the text are some of the most afwul images of violence and barbarism I have ever seen - not for the faint of heart. Chang is quite frank and open in her disbelief that the Rape of Nanking has been largely forgotten, and that Japan has (for the most part) never had to truly answer for its unspeakable acts its military committed at Nanking and abroad (especially the top leaership). After reading this graphic book, and looking at all the evidence the author presents, it is appalling that so many Japanese citizens to this day refuse to admit this happened, much like the idiots who believe the Holocaust in Europe never happened. Highly recommended.
0307346617|5.0|Not sure this would transfer over to a movie at all, but accomplishes what it wants to for sure.  The ideas that Max Brooks comes up with are phenomenal.  I have been considering writing a Zombie book, and every few pages of World War Z I think to myself, man, what didn't I think of that.  If you can enjoy a zombie movie, you will enjoy this book.  It is almost the perfect book for fanatics.
0792846443|5.0|This is a great Thriller. Most of which takes place just in a tiny cabin in the woods after a snow storm. Possibly Stephen Kings best novel turn film. Great Casting and Perfect Acting.    The DVD is double sided and has Widescreen on one side and Fullscreen on the other. No skips or bugs. No Special Features either. They give you the trailer though.    Definitely worth the price I paid and then some.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|I saw the PBS special of this beautiful Christmas concert and knew immediately that I wanted to own it for enjoying every year! The musical combination of Andrea and David is as good as it gets!  The guests vocalists are the best in the industry! This is a timeless classic and my new Christmas favorite.  If you enjoy the beautiful piano music of David Foster and the amazing vocal talent of Andrea Bocelli, you won't be disappointed.  Thank you Amazon for your speedy delivery!
B0019UGYK0|5.0|This is BY FAR my Favourite Paul Newman film. I love a good prison flick, and this one Really Delivers.    The film is a classic these days, with a great ensemble cast, and Newman as the anti-hero. The prisoners work on a Chain Gang in the south. And Newman is a New Arrival who earns everyones respect quickly. The films follows the everyday life of these men in a small prison, and has everything you need in a prison movie. The story is very basic, but like a lot of the classics, they do a lot with very little. So much of this is Newman dealing with being an under-acheiver and never quite feeling like he belongs anywhere. But this is nicely understated, so it does not give the film too heavy of a feeling or make it overly sappy.    The film also has a nice featurette in the special features which I quite like. It's about a half hour, and has lots of cast and crew interviews. I really like features like this, and it is done very well.    If you like classics, Paul Newman movies, Prison movies or just Good films, you check this out.    And if your new to Paul Newman and liked this try HUD (badass Newman) BUTCH CASSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID (classic western with Robert Redford) THE STING (with Redford again, my 2nd fave Newman flick) and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF (classic, no action, but superb acting)

B000002GQG|5.0|This is the album that started it all for the Moody Blues. They were a band that was rising to the top, but had reached a plateau, when Justin Hayward and John Lodge joined as lead singer/guitarist and bass/ vocalist. As they were discovering their sound, they decided to write a show that was conceptual. The songs described a day. At the same time that this show was developing, the record company asked them to record a \\"rock\\" version of Dvorzak to showcase the new stereo sound record players. Finding it too difficult, the band decided to play their show instead. It was an epiphany. The songs are marvelous! Each member of the band contributes to the writing and singing of the songs. And, of course, this is where we were introduced to Justin Hayward's \\"Nights in White Satin\\".

0345479092|5.0|I read this book when I was pregnant and since our baby boy was born I have read it again twice. So many little details of how to help your baby with respect, so much advice I took for granted the first time I read it. I really recommend this book to first time parents and to parents who encountered difficulties the first time around. Our boy is 5 months old now and I still recur to it again and again. No one said having a baby would be easy and Tracy helps with all the situations you could possibly encounter in a healthy baby.

I wish someone would have told me that this is not a happy movie.  Through most of the movie we see the couple falling in love and falling apart.  I have meet lots of girls like Summer, and I hate them.  They use guys and tell them they are going to do it, and than keep pulling guys in for the kill.  I hated waiting that again on the TV screen.    I loved the acting and the writing.  If I had gone into this movie know that it was going to be a downer but interesting, than I would have been ok with it. But Light warming and fun it was not.

B00068ULLY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is arguably the best film-maker of his generation. His ability and passion to tell stories through film is second to none. \\"Kill Bill\\" bears witness to Tarantino's love of film by referencing a variety of genres such as blacksploitation, marital arts, anime, spaghetti westerns, and superhero movies. Some might find it easy to dismiss him as merely a movie fan who makes movies about other movies. I argue that he's far more creative than that. He draws upon these genres for inspiration and creates stories that are fresh, intelligently written, and compelling to watch. For example, in the third act of volume 2, Bill, played by the late David Carradine, shoots [Uma Thurman's character] with a dart filled with truth serum forcing her to answer his many questions. While waiting for the serum to take effect, Bill monologues about his fascination with comic books and, in particular, superhero mythology. \\"The point emerges\\" as Bill compares [Uma Thurman's character's] alter-ego, Arlene Plympton, with Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent. No one but Tarantino could reference comic books in a film and make the dialogue sound so interesting.    In the realm of cinematography, he \\"pulls out all the stops\\" using a variety of camera techniques like split-screens, long-shots, and fast close-ups on the eyes. Some of these techniques can be traced backed to Martin Scorsese, one of his biggest influences. Of course, do I even need to mention the music? I believe I can best describe the selection as cooler than Dante's ninth level of hell. \\"Kill Bill\\", while packed with dozens of exciting ideas, can be enjoyed simply as fun movie viewing which, in my opinion, is a trademark of an excellent director.    The Box Set isn't anything extraordinary. Based on my own copy, all that I can determine is that the Box Set contains the regular DVDs............................. in a display box. Unless you are obsessive over display boxes, you could do just as well to buy the two moviesseparately either online or at your local movie retail store. I personally enjoy the DVD extras but don't be deceived. The Box Set doesn't contain any additional DVD extras.

B002VWONB2|5.0|Perhaps not in all of cinema's history has there been a movie with such brilliant writing, scoring, acting, and numbers of emotional close ups.<br /><br />Casablanca is a legend of nearly 70 years, but thanks to Blu Ray technology it doesn't have to feel that way.  Watching this classic in 1080p is truly an experience, and I have to praise Warner for providing us with the absolutely best possible transfer this film has ever seen.  There's not a trace of grain or flicker or anything you'd expect from a film this old, and the result is stunning.  If you've seen the movie before, it's time to relive with this remarkable new technology.  If you've somehow missed it on TCM, get cultured and experience one of the greatest films in our history in a way no generation has ever been able to do.  Blu Ray.  It not only improves the viewing experience, but it invites the viewer right into the moment.  With clarity as perfect as this, you forget you're even watching a film and instead feel as though you've tapped into the memories of the characters portrayed.<br /><br />I don't feel the need to mention the movie's plot, as most I'm guessing have either already seen it before or can find that out elsewhere, so I want to end this review with what you are probably most wondering about anyway.  Is the Blu Ray transfer worth buying this for?  If I haven't made it clear enough already, YES.  I've seen some poor Blu Rays transfers, but this is not one of them.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best I've seen.  The extras, though I haven't experienced them yet, look interesting, including an audio commentary by movie critic Roger Ebert.  All in all I'd say that this release is definitely worth getting even if Casablanca isn't your favorite movie of all time.  It is a classic, and it is an experience, and with Blu Ray it's better than ever before.
B001YB29HG|5.0|First off, I am a fan of Josh Whedon's work, but you don't need to be to love this. Second, I am delighted with this delicious little frappe of humor and talent. It is full of lovely and unique songs, a thrilling theme and casting that is simply divine. Neal Patrick Harris is compelling and superb, Nathan Fillion is terrific as the blunt hero type-and a better singer than expected and Felicia Day lights up the screen.<br />  If you think you do not like musicals, try this on for size. You will be surprised, thrilled and darkly pleased. Visually, fantastic, drawing on a wealth of lore and drawing you into the story before you know it. This is, in a way, a tragedy, but not for the viewers. I am in awe that Josh put this together, apparently just for fun, and the web release was an unexpected and pleasant surprise. The only wat to improve this would be to have more of it.<br /> If after seeing this you do not run out to get everything else he has done, you are missing many, many treats.<br />  Unusual, dark and delightful, Josh has done it yet again.

B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD is clearly very popular.  I heard Susan Boyle interviewed about it.  She was asked how she chose the songs, she frankly responded that she \\"had help\\".  Each song is beautiful and they all fit together in a wonderful way.  Of course, Susan's voice is beautiful beyond description.  There is a particularly good use of full orchestration in one of the cuts, and a fine and very spare use of the guitar which is impressive in at least two of the cuts that I recall.  If you love beautiful music and a clear, lovely voice, you will be glad to have this CD in your car stereo to listen to, or in the room where you listen to music in your home.
B00008LOS1|4.0|It's a great album. Where's the SACD version? And guys, increasing the compression to make it \\"louder\\" only means you think the listener is too stupid to turn the volume up! Increased compression equals a reduction in dynamics. This music is simply too good to be subjected to this tragedy of modern sound engineering. This album needs SACD and proper engineering to do it justice.    UPDATE 9/17/2010: This title is now available in a 2 channel only SACD Japanese release.  What a huge improvement!  The whole album is just cleaner and begs for higher volume but without fatigue.  You'll likely notice it first in the vocals and Pete's guitar.  If you think that Moon's drum kit is a little lower than before, just turn it up!  Less compression here so you must crank it if you want volume.  I paid a bit over $50 for this disc and while I'm not happy with the price, this album is too good not to own in high resolution.  If you have the coin, get it.  FYI, I have not seen this SACD on Amazon yet.  Hopefully it will come and at a reduced price.  Thank you Japan!

0385341008|5.0|This book is the most enjoyable I have read in a long time.  It is written in a format of letters, but letters written in such a way that you are reading on to find the reply.  It is set in the time period after WWII, and teaches one a lot about the Guernsey Islands and how much they suffered during the war, a subject heretofore unknown to me.  Yet the author manages to tell this story in a lightedhearted way, with characters that are both loveable and ungorgettable.

On with the story Magneto wants to start a Human Mutant war he wants to infect humans with a plague that can mutate & kill them they also used it on Senator Robert Kelly & he died.

0545123267|5.0|First of all, let me say that I am not normally one for sappy romance. I prefer a little more adventure thrown in the mix. But this book is amazing! The characters are deep and leave you breathless. I loved every word and moment Sam and Grace shared and can't wait to read the next book. Maggie Stiefvater is incredibly descriptive in a non-overbearing way. I am definitely going to read her other books.

B001UJSW64|4.0|Renata Scotto was a Bellini specialist and sang all the mature Bellini operas (with the exception of Beatrice di Tenda). Quite a few of these operas probably owe their popularity today to her fervent endorsement of such (then) rarities as Capuletti and Straniera. She was the first soprano since Bellini's time to sing Zaira in an important revival in Catania, Bellini's birthplace, in 1976. One can argue on and on as to whether Norma requires the vocal heft of the big Verdi roles that came much later in the 19th century with a fuller orchestra. However, in Bellini's time, he chose Guiditta Pasta to create the title role at its premiere. This is the same soprano that created the role of Amina in Sonnambula, which today is cast almost exclusively by leggiero (light) sopranos like Dessay, Sumi Jo, etc. There is this mistaken impression that Scotto did not have a success in Norma, which is absolutely untrue. It is true that she did not have a success on opening night at the Metropolitan Opera in 1981 and subsequent performances at the MET that season were irregular at best. [The annual Spring tour was another matter entirely. She garnered rave reviews and standing ovations.] Moreover, it is inconceivable that the Metropolitan Opera would give a coveted opening night to someone essentially vocally miscast in one of the most challenging roles of the entire soprano repertory. What could they have been thinking? What could Riccardo Muti have been thinking in Florence just a year or so before this recording (1979) when he cast her in a new production in Florence that was widely acclaimed? In fact Scotto had scored success after success in several Italian cities as well in in Vienna, Spain, Germany and in the United States in Cincinnati (where a wonderful broadcast exists), Houston (another broadcast) and Philadelphia. All of these performances are available to private collectors. The English magazine OPERA raved about her Norma in Spain, saying that she was the heir apparent to Callas at a time when Sutherland and Caballe were both singing Norma. As any collector of vocal music know, the great aria \\"Casta Diva\\" has been a showpiece for many of the great sopranos (including the lighter, coloratura sopranos like Galli-Curci). It has little to do with the challenges of the rest of the role. If one would argue that the \\"Casta Diva\\" on this recording, which is the weakest part of Scotto's portrayal, is the reason that she was not suited to Norma then one has only to listen to a dozen or so versions by coloraturas that could never dream of singing Norma or to Beverly Sills lovely performance on her complete set. Edita Gruberova, a soprano that started as an Oscar and Zerbinetta, has a much lighter voice than Scotto and has had success as Norma. More importantly she doesn't begin to have the sumptuous middle voice of Scotto. The fact is that most of the role lies directly in the middle voice. Most did not complain about Scotto's vocal weight when singing Butterfly, Suor Angelica, Otello, Luisa Miller, and so forth. Moreover, most of these roles had much larger orchestrations to cover the voice than Bellini's. The fact of the matter is that by 1979 Scotto was having vocal troubles that the close scrutiny of the microphone amplified as if under a microscope. For an artist clearly in some distress, Levine adopted a very strange performing version of Casta Diva that only exacerbated vocal unsteadiness in the upper middle and upper voice. Instead of rising individually to the A flats that are usually \\"pecked\\", in the second verse, he has her sustain a single A over the entire stanza. This might have worked for a Caballe, but it did not work for Scotto at the time of these sessions. In fact, the results are jarring when re-listing to so many other of her Normas where the \\"Casta Diva\\" was positively ravishing. More problematic, however, is the cabaletta following \\"Casta Diva\\" which is given complete including the repeat. This finds her lunging for thenotes. Considering that Scotto was a great Lucia, Amina, Alaide, etc. (and again in comparison to the tapes of earlier, live performances), her coloratura should have been fleet and accurate. I wonder why Mme. Scotto and Maestro Levine didn't wait and have another go at it later, in in a few weeks or months, when she was in better voice. For me, Norma was an excellent role for her, especially on records, because the vocal color was dark and dramatic sounding. [This is in contrast to Sills whose voice was thinnest and least attractive in the middle voice.] Once past the \\"Casta Diva,\\" however, she gives a vocally accurate and extraordinarily moving portrayal (esp.in \\"Dormano entrambi...teneri figli\\" and the whole final scene). Although the rest of the cast have healthy robust voices, they don't begin to have the unmatched word pointing and Bellini style of Scotto. Troyanos is in wonderful voice, but she does nothing with the text. Giocamini should have been an ideal Pollione but he rather blusters his way through in a Del Monaco like fashion -- loud, unsubtle but handsome. Plishka, too, sings well but nothing more. Levine, while improving on the brash, unsubtle conducting that characterized his earlier Norma recording with Sills, doesn't do anything special here either. [One is grateful at least that he keeps the ball rolling unlike Cillario on the Caballe RCA set.] What a shame that Gavazenni, who worked with Scotto so often in bel canto roles, was not selected instead of Levine. Levine was, I am sure, a bigger name, guaranteed to sell more records. [BTW, his conducting of the live Normas with Scotto, Troyanos and Domingo at the MET improved remarkably: he gave the singers much more breathing room and, strangely, he also included a fuller edition including the beautiful pastoral section after the \\"Guerra\\" chorus. This is available on both Bonynge performances. One usually hears more complete versions on record than in the theater.] So except for the \\"Casta Diva\\" andits cabaletta, this recording is a memorable momento of Scotto's Norma for so many of us that heard and saw her great successes in this role all over the world. For that reason I am giving four stars to this recording.
B0033B5XCS|1.0|The previous review covered all of the logistical problems with this new collection: higher cost with less content. Now let's go over another disturbing problem: the cover. It features the wrong/new Freddy; Robert Englund stars in these eight films, yet the cover features Jackie Earle Haley's lame new rendition. This is just another cheesy gimmick intended to raise interest in the Nightmare reboot. New Line cinema should be ashamed for whoring themselves out to Platinum Dunes this way. As revealed in the \\"Nightmare Encyclopedia\\" from the original box set, New Line was a struggling, no-name company before the Nightmare franchise; Nightmare made them what they are today. Yet the makers of the reboot have repeatedly disrespected both Wes Craven and Robert Englund, and this cover shows that New Line's alliances lay with Platinum Dunes, and not with the creative forces that made them rich.    If you are a fan of the Nightmare series, do what was recommended above and buy the original box set, and Freddy vs. Jason by itself. You may pay a little more, but I believe the special features are more than worth the price. If you want all the films as cheaply as possible, then buy both Film Favorite four packs; you will save $12 compared to this set.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|This movie is wonderful for all ages! Growing up, my family watched it around Christmas time every year and I plan to show it to my kids as well. The movie teaches and reminds us of the most important aspects of Christmas, which are sometimes too easily forgotten in our commercial society. The song, \\"It Feels Like Christmas\\" is a joyous reminder that Christmas is about love and sharing.     Aside from the important messages that this movie sends, it is wonderfully put together and the music and characters are just delightful. It is truly the best family Christmas movie ever made and is a must for those who want to enjoy a movie that expresses the true spirit of Christmas in a fun and excting way. I highly recommend this movie!
B002OFWG7O|3.0|i bought this for someone that live in my house.  it is a little hard for me but i must admit that the band is hot.  my friend loves it and has worn me out with the cd.  he says it is one of the best bands ever.  now, for the videos.  did they read the scripts before agreeing to do these videos?  i will say up front, i HATE jack black so including him in the video did not help. the music is good; not my usual taste but i do appreciate.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|Well it is with a great deal of advanced research that I went into Sunshine and even still didn't feel fully prepared for the material within.  I suppose a part of this had to do with director Danny Boyle's (past credits include 28 Days Later & The Beach) unique approach of blending hard science fiction with horror.  But before I get ahead of myself here, let's take a moment to discuss the hard facts.<br /><br />Sunshine is a 2007 British science fiction film directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland centering on the exploits of a crew on a spacecraft on an extremely precarious mission to the Sun.<br /><br />Set in the year 2057, the film presents the notion that Earth is in eminent danger of entering an ice age as a result of the quickly dying sun.  Like a sort of gritty variation of the campy 1998 film Armageddon, a crew of humans sent to attempt to save all of mankind via an experimental and desperate space mission.  In this case the goal is to re-ignite the Sun with a massive nuclear bomb, with the equivalent mass of Manhattan Island.<br /><br />The visuals are the direct result of cinematographer Alwin H. Kuchle's tireless efforts and it is said that Boyle and Garland worked on the script for a solid year (coming up with some 35 drafts in the process), spent another year preparing for production, filmed for merely three months, and then spent a third full year simply editing and completing the visual effects.<br /><br />The end result is a roughly 40 million-dollar production featuring quite a star-studded cast including the acting talent of Cillian Murphy (the Scare Crow/ Dr. Crane in 2005's Batman Begins) and Chris Evans (Johnny Storm in the Fantastic 4 films).<br /><br />The film does a pretty nice job dodging the potential for scientific ridicule by avoiding prolonged dialog on why the sun is dying or for that matter, focusing on the corresponding catastrophic events taking place on earth.  Instead the film literally opens on board the spacecraft (the Icarus II) some 16-months into its voyage toward the sun.<br /><br />Icarus II because it turns out that the first attempt at this mission failed on route some 7 years earlier and hence required a second attempt if human kind were to have any hope of survival.<br /><br />Right from the onset the film harkens to tones of Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction masterpiece ALIEN with gritty realism to the claustrophobic environments of the spacecraft's interior and the up and close and personal nature of the hodgepodge of individuals making up the crew.<br /><br />The pacing is deliberately methodic and the music scoring is structured so that the viewer is never really unaware (for better or worse) of the horror-infusion present here.  I would go as far as to say that Boyle does a nice job in creating a sort of underlying tension present very early on that never really abides throughout the course of the film.<br /><br />Throughout the mission viewers can expect all of the usual snags, bugaboos, and unexpected detours the genre is know for; among these human error resulting in physical damage to the craft, a creepy distress beacon, an impromptu rendezvous with a derelict ship, sabotage, physical conflict and so on.<br /><br />The visual effects are surprisingly stunning for a film with such a limited budget.  The exterior scenes, which are nearly entirely computer generated, are alarmingly accurate.  Particularly noteworthy is a sequence in which the crew encounters Mercury as it orbits the face of the sun, which at that point in the mission is, still some 30-million miles away.  Fantastic!<br /><br />About the biggest complaint I've encountered to the film is the fact that Boyle succumbs to his desire to turn the project into but another zombie-esque horror picture about ¾ of the way through.  Indeed there is some legitimacy to these concerns but if I may offer any sort of consolation here, let me just say that at least the \\"monster\\" at the end of the picture is fairly scientifically sound despite requiring some suspension of disbelief.  In Boyle's defense, a few of the deleted scenes (which are included on the DVD) and his own commentary track (also included) do a better job justifying the whole ending malady far better than it does on its own merit.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting feature on the entire DVD (which could, perhaps, justify the cost of admission on its own) is the included commentary track dedicated to Dr. Brian Cox of the University of Manchester.  Dr. Cox served as the scientific consultant during the film's creation and adds some incredible insight into the scientific accuracy of many of the concepts presented in the picture itself (some of which I thought were fantastical but turns out could happen).  About the only issue un-addressed is that a nuclear reaction large enough to re-ignite a star the size of our own sun would require physical mass some multiple billions the size of the bomb shown in the film.  Oh well, it's a fun thought anyway.<br /><br />About my greatest praise of the film comes in the form of Boyle's ability to paint a picture of the harsh and unforgiving nature of space and space travel.  This is no space opera (so Star Wars and Star Trek fans will likely find Sunshine to be too slow and dramatic) but rather an almost pseudo-documentary like that of Apollo 13.  Even though Boyle credits inspiration and on-screen homages to Scott's ALIEN and Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, Sunshine most closely resembles the look, feel and pacing of Paul W.S. Anderson's Event Horizon.<br /><br />In all the film shoes great potential and I suspect that if not for the horror-esque twist for the final quarter of the picture, Sunshine would eventually find favor with the science fiction community at large as perhaps one of the most underrated pieces to come out of London, or for that matter, anywhere.efense, a few of the deleted scenes (which are included on the DVD) and his own commentary track (also included) do a better job justifying the whole ending malady far better than it does on its own merit.

6301978587|5.0|I love the movie Yentl, and had requested it for years, unfortunately, my hubby, being new at online shopping, first bought me a region 2 DVD.  Apparently they have never released it on DVD for the US.  I don't understand that.  Barbra Streisand has many diehard fans who would love this movie.  Yes, she sings a lot in it... that's why we love her.  Mandy Patinkin and Amy Irving are just wonderful and of course Barbra is at her best.  It has serious moments, romantic moments, and funny moments.  One of my favorite old school films.  In the meantime, I have purchased this VHS copy to tide me over.
B000ERU9S2|4.0|This is really a great movie. The action sequences draw you into the story line, and of course, DeNiro is superb. Watch it and try to stay in your seat.
B002Q9MZHE|5.0|The cinema photography is excellent for this classic opera. I recommend this blueray production very highly.    HIDEO MD FACS
0956010903|5.0|For all those already familiar with the other two books outside the Harry Potter saga (\\"Imaginary Beasts & Where To Find Them\\" & \\"Quiditch: A History\\") the content of this book should be familiar. Again there are scriblings of Hermione and the others, an introduction by Dumbledore, etc. It's a good, relaxing and entertaining read for all those that are fans of this amazing story. But the real gem is this collector's edition. As soon as you lay hands on it you sense that it's something special, like those really old books you only see in major libraries or museums which makes it so much more interesting. Obviously this is only a container for the actual book in its velvety pouch, but it does give a sense of occasion every time you open it. The pouch is really good quality and the book itself looks really interesting with all the faux-metallic engravings and skulls. On a closer inspection you can perceive some imperfections, but all in all, it's all very satisfying to own. Of course to pay the asked price you need to be a fan, but all the same, I feel it is something that anyone would feel happy to own.

B001FB55L2|5.0|This ensemble cast delivered the goods and nailed each of their performances.    Tobey and Jake are very believable as brothers and Natalie was the true heart of this story as her beloved husband played by Tobey goes to a very dark place as a result of his experience in the war. All of the cast members were strong and made you really care about what happened to them.    I felt their happiness,pain and sadness.    Jim Sheridan the director is true to his style and storytelling theme about war and its effects on a marriage,family and forgiveness.    There was one scene with he and Natalie that reduced me to tears and that is not an easy thing to do, thus the five star rating which is well earned and deserved!
B000002HHB|5.0|Received this CD in just 4-5 days after order. In new condition, no damage, great sound.
B000EUDAWG|2.0|I bought this spider to scare some people in my office. visually it's great but as soon as you hit the button on the remote the motor makes too much noise. It's pretty unrealistic as soon as it moves. I did manage to creep out a few of them......as long as it just sits there.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|James Horner's music alone is powerful enough to make one feel you are again watching the movie. If you enjoyed the film, you should love the soundtrack.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I watched this move for the first time two years ago and have loved it since. The quality of this dvd is flawless and the special features are impressive. Definitely add it to your collection if you are a Tim Burton fan.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I'll be honest, my roommate forced me to watch this, and I expected it to be pretty lame. Instead, I ADORED it. The look of the movie is awesome--lots of color and texture. The feel of it is a bit surrealistic, like a Roald Dahl book, which I don't always like, but I think they did it just right this time. The hero and heroine are utterly charming and their love story is just beautiful. It feels very real, not just a series of romantic cliches. Also, Penelope's pig-nose is very well done; it's startling, and you can understand why so many people react badly to it, but it's done in such a way that you get used to it, and it even becomes sort of cute. It would have been easy for the movie's creators to either make it hideous or negligible, and either one would have damaged the story.    This movie is sweet and charming in every way. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B002UZXJA6|4.0|This CD does not contain all of the songs on the DVD of the same title but that said, it is refreshing to hear real music again done well from true entertainers.
B000XCZGPE|5.0|This is one of those CDs that is a must have.  Not just for a Hip-Hop fan but a music fan in general.  This album defines an era.  Great production, great raps, strong attitude.  Could you ask for more?!  This CD is as relevent today as it was 20 years ago.  The second you hear it you feel the energy you want to take a stand.<br /><br />The guy saying that they are not from Compton needs to check his facts. Why would you use 2000 census numbers for a group that started in the late 80's anyway.  The only person in N.W.A. not from compton is Cube and he is from South Central.
B002WY65W4|3.0|Maybe my expectations were too high because of all the raving reviews I read before watching Zombieland. I did enjoy watching the movie, but I don't think it's as good as a lot of the reviews suggest. Prior to watching the movie, I was planning on buying it. It was worth the price of a rental, but IMO, it's not worth buying.
0061730327|5.0|This is a great true story that is very uplifting. I was introduced to this story in a class in college and then wanted a copy of this mans story. This should be put on a reading list for high school being that it has a great moral to the story.

B001QITO52|5.0|The secret to Pink Floyd's success always was and always will be the incredible SOUND they put out and it's mainstay, David's guitars. Everyone said that without Waters they'd be Kaput! NOT SO! With Roger Waters departure, after years of court fighting, you'll see the remaining members of Pink Floyd came out the winners and I thank GOD that Roger Waters and his over inflated ego are GONE! This album marked the new begining for the band. During his tenure, Waters did crank out some memorable lyrics and a few good tunes, but, without the remainder of the band, and without Alan Parsons at the controls, Roger Waters is really pretty much the \\"has been\\" here. Not since Dark Side Of The Moon, has the remaining members of the band been allowed to shine as brightly as they have here on \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\". I heard \\"Learning To Fly\\" on the radio and \\"KNEW\\" instantly that it was Pink Floyd and it was new and I had to have it immediately! It was money well spent and I've since purchased 2 copies of the CD. One for the house, one for the car. My children grew up listening to Pink Floyd. But, their first introduction to them was \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\". They were instant fans. My favorite story about my children knowing Pink Floyd is when we were having a conversation about them and my one child that bought this album shortly after I did and wound up loving them as much as I do said: \\"Who's Roger Waters?\\". Aha! I said, my point, exactly!
044654146X|5.0|I immensely enjoyed the \\"Start Up Nation\\" over the years I have worked closely with many of the key names in the book....I found the book to be factual and very enjoyable....and the research was quite good....I recommend this book everyone who has a passion and is driven towards success.    I do wonder why the original cast members and contributors to Israel as \\"Start Up nation\\" were not mentioned.    The following remarkable indidviduals Eli Hurvitz, Uzia Galil, Efi Arazi, Fred Adler, Dan Tolkowski, Stef Wethheim, Harvey Krueger were the original pioneers of \\"Start Up Nation\\" and made it possible for all the other people in the book to move foward.....these people were the Steve Jobs and Bill Gates of Israel.    I would like to see a Prequel or Sequel written to \\"Start Up Nation\\"; talking about the true pioneers that led up to the \\"Start up Nation\\".....with all that said the book was excellent and I commend the writers on their efforts and committments to entrpreneurship in Israel.

B001NXDIMK|5.0|This second season of Damages is more of a sequel than a true second season of a television series. I say this because Damages is a very cinematic show. From its cast of big name star, elaborate and inventive plot, dark content, beautiful cinematography and first rate direction; nothing about this show feels like something that came from TV. Season 1 was groundbreaking and thrilling television. Season 2 is a continuation of that, upping the ante for good and for worse. The story is so large and so complex it was, for me really fun to try and put all the pieces together. Most people will complain that it was not as straight forward as Season 1 but I didn't care, the writing was seamless and just made you pay more attention. The acting is stepped up as well, especially from Rose Byrne, the true star of this season. If you are a fan of Season 1 I urge you to check out this sequel season. It really is a continuation of the excellence we found in Season 1.<br /><br />And how could anyone pass up with a show with this cast: Glenn Close, Rose Byrne, Tate Donovan, Anastasia Griffith, Ted Danson, Michael Nouri, Marcia Gay Harden, Timothy Olyphant, William Hurt and John Doman.
B002WY65VU|2.0|I bought this brand-spanking new, based on the strength of the (generally) glowing reviews, and man, was I ever disappointed. This movie is a snooze-fest, plain and simple. Want a *traditional* zombie movie where pockets of humananity are fighting for their very survival? Look elsewhere. Want a zombie movie where zombies are actually involved...you know...throughout most of the movie? Look elsewhere. This is like an after-school horror/love story special in October. A young guy (virgin) who crushes on any female who either glances at him, smiles in his direction, or comes banging on his door begging for help. This character is who the movie revolves around, and I'm not making this up. Oh, and a never-ending (and not funny) search for Twinkies by Woody Harrelson. You read that right, Twinkies. The zombies just happen to be in the movie because...well...it's called Zombieland.    The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because of a VERY brief cameo appearance from that guy who starred in Ghostbusters. (no spoilers, if you haven't read the other reviews, or seen the other movie) He's gold, as always, but even he couldn't save this directionless train-wreck. First five minutes of the movie=action....last five minutes of the movie=boring, over-the-top action.....everything in-between=Filler.    Want a really good horror movie released in the past couple of years? Buy 'Quarantine' instead.

B002HFWAWW|3.0|Be aware that this is a Canadian import blu-ray and that Alliance has decided to yet again create 1.78:1 out of a movie that was 2.35:1. This means no black bars, but it also means edges of the image are missing and that it's been zoomed in. While I don't own this movie, I think that fans of this film (of which I am one) should consider holding off until a US release. Alliance regularly screws with the aspect ratio of their releases for some reason.
B002RSDW8A|5.0|A non-traditional romantic comedy, where you are taken into the life of Julie and Julia. Both women had a passion for food and both had their struggles in life.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|I own Seasons 1-3 on DVD and have watched every episode of Dexter to-date.    I must say that this show is THE most entertaining hour on television, period.  Extremely well-written, with top notch performances by Michael C. Hall - and, this season, John Lithgow.  Their cat and mouse game was riveting.  The season finale was a shocker - but, it was perfect.  The writers didn't cop out.    I think in terms of favorite seasons of Dexter, here's where this one sits relative to all:    #1 - Trinity (Season 4)  #2 - Ice Truck Killer (Season 1)  #3 - Miguel Prado (Season 3)  #4 - Doakes (Season 2)    I cannot WAIT for Season 5 to start.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I injured my knee after the third time of doing this workout.  I'm at a healthy weight, and have exercised with cardio/weights (firm dvds) 4-5 times a week for years.  I know how to do the exercises (jumping jacks, lunges, etc) properly on Jillians dvd.  Soon after doing this workout my knee swelled up and I had shooting pains in my right knee for six weeks.  I had to sleep with my right knee bent at night because it was painful to keep it straight.  Finally, I went to the doctor and had to take 800 mg 3 times a day for six days, as well as ice/heat. I'm grateful I didn't tear my muscle.  I think I'll stick with my firm dvds (never had an injury with this series).  I wish Jillian wouldn't state, \\"I have 400 lb people that can do jumping jacks and so can you!\\"  Well, even at a healthy weight high impact exercises can hurt people.  She needs to let people know they should modify the exercises and do the best they can (maybe she can update this dvd and add more lower impact exercises).  Bob Harper is excellent at letting you know to modify if you can't do the exercises.  I cannot do this workout again for fear of hurting my knee again.  By the way, it is all healed now and I'm doing my Firm strength/cardio workouts again.    :)

I was interested in learning about the occupation of the Channel Islands, the characters were pleasant enough, but I was still tired of the book halfway through---before I even reached the predictable ending.
0385504225|5.0|This book blew me away.        I've done a lot of reading, from Milton and Shakespeare to the Vedas and the Bible.  I'm familiar with symbology and quite a few esoteric religions.  Being a screenwriter, I also know good writing from bad, and strong storytelling from weak.    Dan Brown's latest book is stellar.  The critics love to pick at his style, but frankly I don't think their comments are relevant.  This book sucked me in and held me until the last word.  The writing is compelling; the story is motivating; the mysticism is fascinating; and the puzzles are downright genius.    Way to go Dan Brown.  Keep 'em coming!

Something like, \\"Aw, who cares about all that other stuff anyway?\\"  or \\"Screw 'em, they're lucky to be getting this!\\" or \\"Heh, I simply don't care.\\"    Whichever, this is the beautiful music to a very entetaining film that we should have had many years ago, but are only now getting after two and a half plus decades?    Oh well.  Just be glad you have it.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|This is a great gift set.  We love having a DVD copy and a Blu-Ray.  The Cars that come with the movie are very high quality.
B001SN78JO|1.0|I received the DVD case and instructions to downlowd the movie and after amny tries on different occasions was never able to download the movie.  Great price for nothing.
0307454541|4.0|Don't be put away by the fact that it was written and published in Sweden. For some reason, there are people out there who find non-American/English fictions to be inferior to the popular and well known domestic fictions. Not quite the case here.<br /><br />When I was reading this extremely well written book, I was reminded of watching 'Old Boy' (a Korean Movie) and how refreshingly different and entertaining it was because this book and the movie do not follow the same plot that we are so used to. They both touch on taboo subject we are reluctant to tread and they do it in a way that leaves indelible mark on your frontal lobe.<br /><br />Pick up this book. You will enjoy it and look to read that sequel just as soon as you are done.
0449002632|5.0|Wonderful and historic novel with many unknown facts. I just finished reading his New York and am now reading The Forest(which happens to be a little slower).All great reads! A fabulous buy on Amazon

B000053VAZ|5.0|This movie very effectively protrays two people who are each schizophrenic.  It is halarious and entertaining, yet at the same time shows a very real and serious condition.  There are some amuzing scenes and a few sad.  The ending is for you to see.  Terrific actor and actress too.
B002XUBDVK|5.0|The newly remastered release of Gangs of New York represents such a substantial improvement over the previously released Blu-ray misfire that filmfans and videophiles will be left with little to nothing to complain about. Everything about the transfer looks amazing, and all of the problems that plagued Disney's first release are nowhere to be found. Colors, contrast, black levels, and fine detail are all excellent, the presentation is free of digital anomalies, edge enhancement has been kept to a bare minimum, and the film looks fantastic.<br /><br />Thanks Kenneth Brown [...]

0684853523|4.0|On Writing---Stephen King                                                Review by Richard H. Williams    Stephen King's \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft\\" is useful to both neophyte writers and seasoned authors. He usually writes short stories and novels in the genres of Horror, Fantasy, and Science Fiction. King is also a columnist, screenwriter, film director, actor, and television producer.    King's book on writing, which was serialized in the New Yorker, taken together with his \\"Danse Macabre,\\" makes it clear that he has easily made the transition from fiction to non-fiction.    In the forward he speaks disparagingly of books on writing. King's use of the word \\"craft\\"  in his book title, coupled with Norman Mailer's referring to writing about writing as \\"The Spooky Art,\\" make it apparent that some well-known writers feel that the teaching of writing is more a crafty art than a science.    Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" is low key and honest and is written in a simple and clear style. It is replete with interesting anecdotes, some of them humorous. He indicates the need for research in writing by saying, \\"When you step away from the `write what you know' rule, research becomes inevitable, and it can add a lot to your story.\\" Yet he cautions, \\"Remember that you are writing a novel, not a research paper.\\" It is unfortunate that King, Mailer, and some others writing on writing seldom give much detail as to the nature of their research techniques.    To see how the editorial process works, peruse the example on pages 271-281 of \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.\\"    The only shortcoming of Stephen King's book, in my opinion, is the lack of both a table of contents and an index. This makes it difficult for the reader to locate specific writing topics of interest.
B00275EGX8|3.0|Now that Hurt Locker has received nine academy award nominations, I have one question:  Why?  Perhaps the kooks in La-La Land perceive it as anti-war even though the film was gratefully free of political rhetoric.  I note that another review here by an alleged former leader of a bomb disposal team showers praise on this film.  I cannot argue with his expertise on the subject - if he genuinely is experienced in this aspect of warfare - but I do know that the film did little to affect me except to trouble me that this might depict the real behavior of soldiers in the field.  My son, a PFC in the Army Reserves, agrees with me.  Some of the scenes were gripping, and the frustration that the proliferation of IUDs in the Middle East brings - to the extent this movie depicts it accurately - was brought to light well.  Jeremy Renner did a fine acting job, but I hated his character when he should have engendered sympathy.  I wanted to relieve him of duty, send him to the brig, and put a sane person in his place.  His interaction with the Iraqi boy never played out fully, and I could see no reason why the soldier became so involved when he was otherwise so loony.  The scene where the Iraqi couple drove him away made no sense, and the birth of his own son seemed tossed in at the last moment.  Something tells me that much of this film fell to the cutting room floor to adhere to the two-hour rule and left serious gaps.    Sorry.  Not overly impressed.
031606792X|5.0|4th and final book in the Twilight series.  I really enjoyed this book b/c it brought everything to a close.  Even though I wanted it to continue it gave a good ending.  I also read The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner which is a branch off of this series, also good.  Stephanie Meyer has done wonderful with this series and I hope she keeps it going b/c there are so many directions it could go in.  A good, entertaining read.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I'e seen this movie many times and never get tired of it.  Problem was, it was my son's copy.  So, when I saw it on Amazon for a terrific price, I returned his copy to him and got my own.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle if phenomenal.  She has such a powerful clear voice, doesn't need to perform the vocal acrobatics that many singers use to reach notes.  She is wonderful. Highly recommend this CD.
B002HRTMHQ|4.0|The opening chords of each track catch my attention every time. He really nailed the tender, careful, heartsick style of the soul greats, but mainly through excellent instrumental accompaniment. I do wish Hawthorne's voice was stronger -- it honestly seems better suited to singing back-up than lead. But the full package is a winner -- a great album overall. Hope to hear some collaborations in the future.
0316044938|5.0|Had it not been for the movie I would not have known about this book.  My daughter went to see the movie and, curious, I picked up a copy of the book to read.  This was one of those books I found myself resenting having to put down to deal with real life.  Comparing notes with my daughter, I get the impression I wouldn't want to see the movie now.  Despite whatever excellent acting and fantastic special effects it likely has, the book itself was so artfully yet simply written that I can't imagine the movie even beginning to compare.<br /><br />The view of the afterlife looks like a popular postmodern re-interpretation of the common Protestant Christian view of \\"heaven\\" (though with God and any attending angels noticeably absent), and it seemed to resemble what was presented in the 1990's movie \\"What Dreams May Come.\\"  However hokey the elements of the life-after-death seemed at times, the author did an excellent job of not fully explaining everything, particularly with regards to the extent to which Susie (the slain girl) could interact with her living family, friends and murderer.<br /><br />When I describe this book as \\"hopeful\\" I'm not referring to an afterlife for the dead.  Instead, I'm talking about the hope it provides that families and communities can mend after horrific tragedy.  There can be life after the death of a loved one.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|I've always liked this movie and ordered it from Amazon.  The price was great and the service, as always, was incredible.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it.  One improvement he suggested is the patch cords need to be longer so that he can sit on the entertainment center neatly with the other electronic equipment.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is one of the best horror/vampire movies I have ever seen. Unlike the Twilight franchise that is aimed at young adolescent females and twenty-somethings with vampires and werewolves that are made to look more like the stereo-typical, dangerous bad boy who girls of this age find so attractive, Let The Right One In's Eli is a vampire in every sense of the word. It is an intelligent, very good movie that makes the Twilight saga pale in comparison.
6304806418|5.0|Madonna is THE queen of music video and this film is essentially a two-hour music video that is done in such a way you can't stop watching.  It's as good as the Broadway production and definitely is a piece of art.

B000WQWPKA|5.0|Saw this movie thousands of times and this was the first time I seen it in Blue-Ray and I t ell you WOW!!! So much better than the other once.. Hard to believe that this movie was filmed in 1996 Blue ray makes it look like it was filmed few years ago........ Quality is improved by 100000% Get it if you seen it still buy it!
B000WLOM6U|5.0|I recently downloaded several songs from this album.  A truly fabulous collection -- possibly her best.  Her voice is in great form, the songs move right along, her band is excellent.  Krall herself is not only a fine singer, but a fine jazz pianist as well.  Even the production work is very good -- no random crowd sounds which are often heard on live recordings.  I play this music while I work, work out at the gym, walk outdoors, cook dinner.  The perfect antidote to a gray winter's day in Chicago.
B001PKHS68|5.0|This is a fine Hitchcock film, with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly at their best.  Story is exciting and has humor as well as adventure.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This show is my favorite show on television right now.  It has everything, the action, the characters, the drama, the comedy, and a brilliant story.  It's a great show and if it does continue into a 6th season I will still be watching.  This season 4 collection is great, and if you're a fan how could you not buy it now it's only $16.99 (I bought it when it was $27.99)?!  My store is selling this for $49.99!  Anyway, the set is great has all the season 4 episodes, packaging is the usual, extras are fun too. Five Stars.
0446619078|5.0|I really loved this book.  Michael Connelly has ruined so many other mystery writers for me -- after eating Godiva, how can I go back to Hersheys?  Maybe using high class chocolate isn't a good analogy;  his stories are gritty and real and surprising, rather than elitist or staged or tidy.  Well anyway, Connelly's characters feel completely authentic, the plot is tightly woven and fast-paced, the dialog is snappy and ironic.  The melding of character development with detective work is just perfect, and is my favorite part of this book.  I really enjoy backstories on characters, to have an idea of what makes them who they are.  Connelly totally delivers.<br /><br />The snow we've been having has given me the opportunity to read several of his books, and the Last Coyote is my favorite so far.  Other reviewers have provided an excellent synopsis of the plot, so I won't duplicate that, other than to say Connelly is unpredictable and totally satisfying from a wrap-up point of view.<br /><br />I will just add that if you are a Connelly fan trying to share your love of Connelly with someone who'd rather read Jane Austen or Chekov, this would be the book to give her.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|J.J. Abrams has created an amazing television series.  It's enthralling, thought provoking, and very entertaining to watch.  The characters are interesting and each episodes plot is never anything less then imaginative.  This Blu-Ray release of season 1 is great with a quality not many blu-ray discs have matched.  Great extras and the price itself is a steal for this season. It was $29.99 when I bought it, now it seems to be at $24.99.  Five Stars.
B002BW7A58|5.0|This will come as a shock to those traditional Lil Wayne listeners, but it's because you're unappreciative of true talent when you hear it. I am a consumer of all genre's of music and I think Wayne will find a new fan base with this release. This album truley shows that it is possible to rapper and still explore other realms of sound. I personally enjoy hearing rappers team up with rockers. It's where I think music is heading and it's good to see the wave starts here. Buy this album if you're open to new ideas.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I always loved this movie growing up and it really is just as good now! I think most people will buy this for nostalgia's sake, so they already know what they are getting.
0307269752|5.0|As a lot of the other reviewers have said, I too couldn't put this book down.  The second book is just as good, if not better, as we get to know Lisbeth better and what really makes her tick.  I am half-way through the third and last book and dreading its coming to a conclusion just because I don't want it to end!  Enjoy!
0765360969|5.0|Great Book. Bought it for my brand new kindle a month ago and now it's not even available for the kindle anymore. I hope the rest of the series becomes available because I am spoiled now and don't wish to kill a tree just to finish the series...

Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...<br /><br />What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.<br /><br />Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is an interesting documentary for music lovers, especially Baby Boomers like my husband and I.  He is a guitarist, so when I saw this film on a recent flight (yes, I thought it was an eclectic choice for an in-flight movie, too!), I knew I had to get it for his birthday.  We watched the movie, and listened to it, through our killer audio system, and really enjoyed it! By the way, my favorite guitarist of the three featured is still Jimmy Page, but it was fun to see how the three guitarists interacted.    Music Lover
1400049628|5.0|This book is highly recommended and should be regarded as important as any other disaster plan. It gives advice that range from weapon and combat techniques to ways to defend yourself whether your at home, on the run or stuck in a swamp. There is also information on symptoms, different types of zombies and the classes in which the outbreaks will occur in. This book is detailed and well set out, with drawn images and ever recorded attacks. If your up for a laugh, cant think of something to buy as a present for someone, or seriously paranoid, this book is for you.

B002T9H2L0|1.0|ill put it like this.    the trailer was more interesting than the actual film.    Brad Pitt did a good job as usual.    every scene in this movie is drawn out way to long and it moves so damn slow.    the dialogue is useless because while it \\"builds suspense\\" there is just not enough happening here to keep me interested.    its kind of like sitting in on boring conversations shared by prissy uptight elites, i didnt feel drawn in or interested.      im so glad i rented it ONDEMAND for $5. QT has been slacking lately.  Those Grindhouse movies were crap too.
0061849901|5.0|This is one of my favorite books for a reason--it manages to capture what some may call insanity in such a raw, tangible, relatable way. Some people compare it to Catcher in the Rye but this is by far my favorite among the two. I'm pretty sure everyone feels disenchanted with the world at one point or another, especially when growing up.... This book has meant a lot to me.

My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!    While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!

B0009VPFSW|5.0|I purchased this to use in an Olympus E20N ( a rather old camera ) to replace a dead IBM Microdrive.  According to Olympus the largest CF card that can be used is 320MB ( did anyone ever even make a 320MB other than IBM Microdrive ??? ).  I was aghast when I saw the ridiculous prices of the smaller CF cards that most places were asking.  I have used this card with no problems in the E20N even though it is larger than Olympus recommends.  I highly recommend this card for someone who needs a \\"small\\" CF card at a reasonable price.

B0025KVLS8|5.0|\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is the title of the Beatles' third album and their first feature film. The first seven tracks were included in the film's soundtrack, and these were the first to be recorded. One interesting thing is that the album is the first and only one on which all titles are credited to Lennon-McCartney. The fact that the two songwriters usually wrote their songs separately is a different matter.<br /><br />There something special and recognizable about the group's 1964 sound; what this exactly is can be difficult to describe, but Harrison's 12-string guitar is definitely one of the reasons. Numbers like \\"Can not Buy Me Love,\\" \\"You Can not Do That\\" and \\"Anytime at All\\" are good examples of this sound.<br /><br />The group shows of the album an impressive continuation of the rapid musical development that had started with the first recordings with George Martin late in 1962. The songwriting is with very few exceptions outstanding first class. Vocally both Lennon and McCartney are on top, and Harrison  beautifully falls into the delicate harmonies. he playing is very tight, which could also be a reason for the aforementioned 1964-sound.<br /><br />Lennon is on most Beatles albums the dominant singer and songwriter, and this is particularly evident on this album. He is the man behind many of the most memorable numbers from the album, including the titletrack, \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" (a sure hit had it been released as a single), \\"Anytime at All,\\" \\"You Can not Do That\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"If I Fell\\". The remainder of Lennon's contributions are more average, but far from weak.<br /><br />McCartney is in focus on the hit single \\"Can not Buy Me Love\\", and he also contributes the two evergreen ballads \\"Things We Said Today\\" and \\"And I Love Her\\".<br /><br />It was normally European standard that a Beatles album contained 14 songs, but in this case for unknown reasons, only 13 were selected - especially strange because the very strong Lennon's song \\"I Call Your Name\\" was recorded during the same sessions. \\"I Call Your Name\\" was along with three coverversins released on the 1964 EP \\"Long Tall Sally\\".  The song should have earned a place on this album, as it subsequently often has been forgotten / ignored - at least in Europe. In the U.S., the songs was included on the album \\"The Beatles' Second Album\\". Well, at any rate this is great album.e same sessions. \\"I Call Your Name\\" was along with three coverversins released on the 1964 EP \\"Long Tall Sally\\".

0143038419|5.0|I am enjoying this book more than any other book in a very long time, and I read a lot. However most of the books I read are of a practical nature, rarely do I read fiction, or books for fun. I picked this up because the author was in Italy, which is a fantasy of mine, Venice in particular... I thought I'd page through it. One night, as I was headed to bed, I picked it up to see how it started... I ended up standing in my living room for 3 chapters reading, enthralled. I find myself re-reading paragraphs, rolling the words around my mouth. Mostly I envy her, both her travels, adventures, and journey of self-discovery, and also her writing style. It is beautiful, descriptive, and engrossing. I do see others' point, in that she does seem a little self- consumed, but it IS a memoir ... I read many books focusing on the needs and tragedies on earth( I have 9 children, 5 of whom were adopted from 3rd world countries), and its a nice change sometimes to live vicariously through someone who can live onto herself, once in awhile. Although It is not my own path.  I do not have to agree with her, and do not on many points, especially her religious perspective... to enjoy it- but it is amazingly written, and a joy to read.  Read it, enjoy it!
B001FB55MG|5.0|This film is a wonderful family film. It has a perfect mix of adult humor, child humor, fantasy, reality, action and comedy all in one film. It will keep you watching from beginning to end.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I LOVED IT!!---Everything about it...from the acting, the actors,   the blood and guts, the dark humor, the fast paced rock-n-roll vibe...  this is a horror film that delivers big time!

Of course, you will always have those with \\"delicate sensibilities\\"  who will nay-say, but then they shouldn't be watching stuff like this anyway!  This film rocks!   POINT BLANK, PERIOD!! (-:

0385504225|5.0|Forget what all the \\"wanna be\\" literary critics say to put down this book. It's just a fiction thriller that keeps you turning the pages wondering what's going to happen next. It's great for escaping reality. It's just plain good fiction. I don't care about the historical accuracy that some question. I just enjoyed the book for keeping my attention. Hope the movie is just as fun.
B001F12J48|3.0|3D is not as good with the multi-color glasses, but you can't get high quality without going to the theater. Movie is definetly a kid movie only.
0452295548|4.0|A well-written account of an amazing experience, in which the author observed what was happening to her as she had a stroke, and later as she struggled with her one-sided brain power.  It would be good to know whether other stroke victims ever appreciate that one-sided power as she did.  Of course, not all victims recover as she did, so they can't tell their stories.  Her professional knowledge of the brain added greatly to her ability to analyze the experience, and to our understanding, too.
1423119509|4.0|Fun, exciting series for the kids although childern who have not been exposed to Greek/Roman mythology might benefit from a quick overview of those concepts. My kids loved both the sories and the packaging. It is now prominately diplayed on their bookshelf. Even my son thought the characters were \\"cool\\" and the action kept him engaged in the story.<br /><br />Great gift option for someone who wishes to give books to a hard to please boy or any avid reader.
1563899426|5.0|So I picked this book up on a recommendation from a friend, and I am so glad that I did.  I thought it was going to be kind of hokey at first but I decided to give it a chance and see what it was all about.  Reading it was a great experience and I found the characters very interesting and familiar.  I grew up with them and it was great to see them in this time and place but seperate none the less.  There are many different characters from so many different tales most I remember and there are still some that I don't, but it gives me a reason to look them up and maybe relive a bit of my childhood in the process and then come back and live in the present as an adult with them in this new and always surpising world that they are in.  I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I have.
B000005JAK|5.0|_Candy_Apple_Grey_ is one of the best post-punk records ever made. Genius songwriting and and well-developed style.

0553577123|5.0|June 12, 1942<br /><br />I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support to me.<br /><br />Comment added by Anne on September 28, 1942:<br /><br />So far you truly have been a great source of comfort to me, and so has Kitty, whom I now write to regularly. This way of keeping a diary is much nicer, and now I can hardly wait for those moments when I'm able to write in you.<br />  Oh, I'm so glad I brought you along!<br /><br />The red-and-green checkered autograph book Anne Frank received for her 13th birthday wasn't meant for family or friends, let alone the world, to see. The first few entries dealt with the everyday musings of an adolescent school girl along with some of the restrictions placed on Jews in the Netherlands. Then came July 5, 1942, when Anne's older sister Margot was issued a call-up notice to report to a work camp. The next day both girls along with their parents Otto and Edith went into hiding in the attic of her father's office building.<br /><br />For the next 2 years, Anne documented the quarrels among those in hiding (the Franks shared their cramped quarters with the Van Pels family as well as local dentist Fritz Pfeffer), the never ending fear of discovery, and her own coming of age under these unimaginable circumstances. After hearing a London radio broadcast by a member of the Dutch government announcing that the diaries and letters of the Dutch people who'd suffered under the Nazis would be collected and released to the public, Anne decided to publish a book based on her diary. She kept up her regular entries while also rewriting and editing previous ones.<br /><br />Sadly the occupants were captured in August of 1944 and sent to the death camps. Anne died a miserable, lonely death of typhus in Bergen-Belsen, just a few days after Margot and 3 months before her 16th birthday. Otto, the only survivor,  read his daughter's writings (kept safe by his employee and family friend Miep Gies) and granted her wish with the 1947 release of The Diary of a Young Girl. Published in more than 60 different languages and garnering a hit stage play and countless film and television adaptations, the words of this young Jewish girl have inspired millions.<br /><br />Little did most know that the published work was an edited version of Anne's original writings. While any edition of the diary is worth reading, I personally prefer the Definitive Edition. Published in 1995, it includes previously removed material about her strained, complicated relationship with her mom, her more saucy comments that convey her frustration with many of the adults (moreso Mrs. Van Pels and Mr. Pfeffer) in the Secret Annex, and her developing sexuality. There are also 4 previously omitted paragraphs featuring Anne pondering on her parent's marriage. It's understandable why Otto cut them out since she believed her parents were more co-parents than a loving couple and that had to be painful to read.<br /><br />All of these things make her more well rounded than in the original version. Her progression from a silly school girl to a more mature, introspective young woman is even more striking and heartbreaking. Heartbreaking because her life was cut short not too long after her last entry, the deepest one she'd written. Of course it includes the constantly misconstrued \\"In spite of everything, I still believe people are really good at heart\\" line, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />Sometimes sassy, bratty, and sharp tongued, but mostly caring, kind, and reflective, it's a crime that her talents were never given a chance to shine in adulthood. Anne dreamed of being a writer and a journalist, but never knew her wish to \\"go on living even after [her] death\\" would come true in a literal sense. We must never forget this girl and the many other innocent victims who perished in the Holocaust.

B001U887N8|5.0|I bought these shoes for my sister who has serious lower back problems.  These are now the only shoes she can wear that don't cause her more pain.  A very excellent value on Amazon.  She just purchased a second pair for herself.  Good quality!  Easy to slip on and off.  Liners are a big plus.  Easy to clean.

0385532458|4.0|Quite enjoyable.  This is a book I would highly recommend for a lazy mid summer day of reading.  A little unusual for Grisham to be writing this way, not to mention the short story format, but as in all of his past work, he keeps the readers attention and makes the reader not want to put the book down.  The small, interlacing tidbits in each story makes one feel that one is experiencing the 'goings-on' of every day small town America.  Highly enjoyable read which I would recommend to anyone.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This will be short and sweet- this game is really wonderful.  Up to four people can play at a time and it can be played with all levels of thought.  I love this for the fact that it has created a \\"strategic thinker\\" out of my 8 1/2 year old!  She can sometimes (though not often) beat me!  The game usually takes about 10-20 minutes to play (depending on the level of strategy involved). Great, easy to learn game that the whole family can play together.

B002SEW5WW|5.0|This album is a wonderful completed thought unlike most popular music. The sound is unique enough to be distinguishable. The lyrics are meaningful and even the track order is arranged to tell a meaningful story. Great album, I never get tired of it.
0439023483|5.0|I was really impressed with how thoroughly I was pulled into this book.  I loved it.  I thought Suzanne Collins did such a nice job with the writing.  The story is so compelling.  And although the author's unusual, (I can't think of another way to phrase it,) 'wholly present' voice is a little hard to get used to at first - she is a really impressive author. Given the content, it's not overly graphic, b/c it's Young Adult, I'd guess. But it's got great pacing, well-developed characters, a fantastic story-line, excitement, heart, etc.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|First of all, I won't sit here and write a review of \\"The Dark Knight\\" (like most people did). This review is strictly for the blu-ray disc. I just purchased a blu-ray player recently and this was one of the first discs I bought(I was one of the lucky few who caught it for a huge discount during lightning deal week). To say that \\"The Dark Knight\\" has a nice picture and sound would be the understatement of the year. The picture/sound quality on this blu-ray has to be seen to be believed,words do not give this movie justice, but I'll try. The lifelike picture quality is truly amazing. I swear there were a couple of times while watching \\"The Dark Knight\\" I felt like walking up to my television to make sure the characters were actually on the screen and not in my living room. I saw this movie three times in the theater and watching it on blu-ray was like watching it for the first time. \\"The Dark Knight\\" blu-ray disc picks up EVERYTHING-from the beads of sweat dripping from Harvey Dents face as he lies on the hospital bed to seeing Heath Ledger's Joker make-up literally dry up and crack right in front of you. \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a definite must have for anyone adding to or beginning their blu-ray library.
0439023491|5.0|Such a great follow up to Hunger Games.  Can't wait for the next one!
0465011047|5.0|I read this book years ago. It's very easy to read, and it can easily be read in one day.    Kang Chul-Hwan has become a famous advocate for North Korean rights and a diligent critic of the North Korean goverment's brutal treatment of its citizens. That he hailed from a family of pro-Workers' Party Koreans makes his story all the more ironic.    His detailed description of the hardships of life in the camps - extremely dirty inmates, eating rats - will provide insight into a level of brutality that the western world believed gone after the fall of the Soviet Union and the abolishment of the gulags; a type of cruelty that most westerners thought would never be repeated after the liberation of Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Dachau.    North Korea-related news have been frequent in American prime time news over recent years - the North Korean nuclear tests, the six-party talks, etc. But an oft-forgotten aspect is the hellish suffering imposed upon an estimated 200,000 civilians who have been consigned to miserable existences in these camps. \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" will horrify you, but it will remind you of the limitless capacity of man to bestow unspeakable cruelty on his own kind.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was extreemly happy. From the timelyness of the delivery, to the quality as promised.
B002ZHKZEC|4.0|IF you're a fan, then yes, the stories deserve 5 stars.  In fact seeing the complete specials in short sequence (as buyers of the set obviously will) and without commercial interruption deepens the dramatic effect of the final story arch of the 10th Doctor, seeing them as if for the first time.  The set offers drool-worthy extras for the serious fan, with each single-episode disk paired with an episode specific \\"Doctor Who Confidential\\".  And yes, seeing them in Hi-Def is certainly wonderful.  Incidentally, it's well packaged.    No, the review loses a star for failing to distinguish itself in any meaningful way from the standard def DVD version (which EARNED it's five star review, thank you!).  No BD Live, no pop-up menus, zippo.  Just the added Def.    Look, you don't need the fawning overly detailed reviews.  If you're buying this you've seen them already, I mean --  how could you NOT, right?  You just want to know if its worth it.  If you think seeing it for years in HD is worth the extra bucks, then yes it's worth it.  If you can live in standard def and save some bucks, then no.  Either way, the stories kick, thanks to Russell T. Davies, and David Tennant (who will be missed, and dearly too I fear).    And between us, \\"The Waters of Mars\\" is my personal favorite ;-)
