B0050DIWFC|4.0|I was recommended this book and it is a great read. The book is a well-written crime novel. The author clearly tried to appeal to a wide audience, especially women who are mothers. The reason I give it four stars is because there is a little too much touchy feely stuff for my taste but I imagine the majority of the readers probably would probably like it.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks and look forward to each new book.  The Best of Me was another wonderful read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Does not disappoint. I could not put it down.  The only negative is that impost sleep reading well into the night during the time it took me to finish it.<br /><br />Very recommend.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|The second part of a trilogy covering a range of world events through the 1st half of the 20th century. With the author's usual attention to detail. Looking forward to part 3.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|It was good wish they had told more about the money that they didn't get. It seemed that they were living good for a while
B008602KQI|3.0|I wish it were a bit more true to the book. To me, there is more to this book than just the hunger games.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Great scenery, interesting storyline, Hitchcock classic, Cary Grant and Grace Kelly were superb. Humor, suspense, and mystery. Great entertainment. Worth watching.
B009AMANH4|5.0|When you consider all that Happened in Lincoln's day and what he went thru I feel the picture captured the real Lincoln and probably how he really felt. I would have like to have seen more of his earlier years and what led him to office. Lincoln and Washington are the best of any Presidents we had...there is one who I feel is probably the worst we have ever had but I will not use his name with the likes of Lincoln or Washington in the same paragraph.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|I'm usually a fan of Jane Austen books -- and enjoy the style of conversation that goes around in my head for a few days. But I had a hard time interpreting this one. Though I enjoyed the story and wanted to know how she would resolve the impediments to the important romance at hand, I had to read some passages two or three times to determine what they meant, finally giving up and deciding they probably weren't germane to the plot anyway.
B004LWZW8S|2.0|Immortals is too graphic and full of gore, The storie line of the so called GODS is really dumb...killing your own? Did they ever think this story line thru? Special effects is great but other than the gore is tooooo much like Kill Bill and the added killing scenes are really pused to the limit...I would pass on this one.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|I was not real impressed with the first Iron man but I was completely entertained by Iron man 2. It was not stop action!
B008JFUO36|4.0|I like the movie but only as far as the sci-fi end of it. Story is way out in left field. Special effects are good and Tom Cruise is likeable. Still trying to figure different angles of the story..why who did what and such. Type of movie you have to watch more than one to figure out what really went or is going on.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really loved it and i think it was well done!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love bella and alice it is halarios! !!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Quick easy read. I love how all of the stories intersected to provide us with so many secrets. Thank you for the epilogue!
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|CLEVER - LOVED THE MUSIC, THE CLOTHING, THE PHOTOGRAPY.  GREAT FILM. IT HAS ENDURED THE TEST OF TIME.  GOOD BUY.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|Everything about this album is great.  audio, extras, everything is worth the money. I've always liked Evanescence, and they definitely don't let me down.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|There are 2 rivets in the rotating part, making it impossible to rotate it without tearing one out.  Otherwise, it's ok.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Refreshing family values, a little romance and a lot of fun!  Definitely a &#34;chick show&#34;.  An all time favorite I adore.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|The game was fun at first but got boring quick. Same over and over again and the fact that I can change timing doesnt help much
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Interesting insight into what black is and is not.  So many different shades that people with &#34;black&#34; skin can't be grouped into one culture or race.
B007L6VR12|5.0|If you remember anything of the 60's, you'll relate to all of this film.  The casting is superb, from the top named stars, to the unknowns.  Just a joy to watch.  The musical score is also a major part of the film and helps make it more memorable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show. It reminds me of manners, dramatic endings, and new beginnings.<br />Don't want them to end.<br />Keep going
B00821OX98|4.0|Good basic sci fi.  Not too cheesy on the special effects and acting is good to fair.  Ok story line as well.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|What I love about this game is that it is fun without being violent. You breed and raise dragons. It sounds like a horrible business model &#34;let's make a game where you breed and take care of dragons. We won`t have the dragons battle or anything like that. Nothing bad happens.&#34; But it works, and the game is blast. My kids tried Dragoncity, but that game stinks. You really need to do two things to get anywhere in that game: 1) need to pester your Facebook friends to get anywhere, and 2) you really need to spend real money to buy fake gems so that you can open new islands. And the Dragoncity dragons are just ridiculous-- a Soccer Dragon that nukes other dragons with a Soccer ball? Really?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are great especially Granny.  The subject matter is still reliant in odays world.  Life goes on and on.
B001ASVXSE|5.0|I can find no faults with this collection of works interpreted by the masterful violin maestro David Oistrakh. Many thanks to EMI for the large collection - 17 discs - available at a good price. The sound of the recordings is excellent. Highly recommended.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved it! Can't wait for the movie to come out!! It had me captivated from the start to the finish
B00A4B9A1U|5.0|I came to this book having watched the 10 hour excellent documentary series of the same title. I wasn't sure what to expect from such a relatively long book, however I found it a rivetting read, difficult to put down with many interesting moments such as at the views expressed, the retelling of many familar events from a new perspective or in greater detail, and some new information that filled in gaps in my knowledge. The book is told in 14 fairly long chapters and a long introduction that is essential to read to understand the view taken and how the narrative is constructed. The narrative is laced with many interesting facts and quotes, noting the sources and the position or job title of those whose views are being given. The narrative is basically chronological in order though it does contextualise some subjects in the light of recent events, in particular the recent financial crisis and so called war on terror. However much of the narrative stays based in each time period and gradually unfolds through each presidency noting in detail much to do with defence and foreign policy of the US government, though not exclusively, and their development down through the years. A structure which runs in parrallel with the documentary series. However the book is far more detailed and goes into greater depth on many of its subjects and is rather more academic than the somewhat breathless emotive and moralising documentary. I recommend the book as essential reading to anyone with a interest in world history from 1900 onwards. Some grounding in history of the period would help and possibly knowledge of more orthodox views as a balance not just to the views but a contextualisation of events. Certainly it would not just add balance but an interesting perspective on just where that orthodoxy comes from. Otherwise this book is definitely worth a read with its agenda setting views and knowledge rewarding informative narrative that can't be ignored.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I'd love to play it I've already bought it but it says there was a payment issue. Every other game I've bought downloaded but for some reason this won't. Just cuz it looks cool I'm gonna rate it 5.
B00CIAYYU2|5.0|It was quite violent, but very very good! It kept you glued to television so much so that we didn't want to pause it.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I love reading about the SEALS, their bravery and how they keep us safe.  They obviously put their lives on the line for us day after<br />day.  However, I had a great deal of difficulty in this book putting aside the author's narcissism and the fact that he spells out his<br />delight in killing the enemy.  A far better read is Marcus Luttrell's &#34;Lone Survivor&#34; - which explains the training and camaraderie amongst SEALS in working together for the safety of all, including great insight into his captivity and the honor in men, even 'the<br />enemy' in gaining his release.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|For those interested in cinema history, For its day it set a standard for characterization and special effects. It legitimized sci fi movies as legitimate entertainment.
B0081336FO|5.0|Fantastic series.  Entertaining, clever, and funny as heck! The acting is fab and the modern retelling of the SH stories is just awesome.
B00CWVFZ8W|4.0|An interesting turn on witchcraft. On one hand given a Vampire like makeover and on the other hand &#34; A family Curse&#34; treatment. I most enjoyed the mood of a period piece from the early 20th century. Over sized romance where young love conquers all!
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Exceeded my expectations!!! Came in a beautiful carrying case box but wasnt too happy about the way the dvds were held inside....but overall, Best disney trilogy for any movie collector..young and old :)
B007REV4YI|4.0|Daniel Craig for me is the best Bond of all time! Being 67 yrs. I saw the early Bonds on the big screen but the combination of skills and traits a spy needs are  ALL present in Craigs performance from my blu ray player. Enough said.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very addictive!<br />Bit annoying about needing tokens that you have to pay for but can easily do enough without spending money
B005DJREGQ|3.0|This show totally takes me back to my high school days.  It is cute, the characters are fun to watch.  It is likely a show targeted at younger viewers, like high school age.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book is beautifully written and alive but also incredibly disturbing and depressing.  It kept me up biting my nails and hoping for some sort of redemption. Very much like The Kite Runner in that the things that happen are horrific, but the characters somehow remain human and beautiful .
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Not too wild about if, in order to advancee very far you need to spend real dollars, that bothers me.  I know someone spent time developing this but the constant reminders to spend real money is bothersome and makes me not want to spend at all.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Gosh, if you have ever wondered what went on in the early 1800's, between England and France on the waters of the Earth, then this is the movie you REALLY want!!!  Napoleon's super ship against an old English battleship of-the-line, commanded by none other than Russell Crowe, who does and excellent job as a humanitarian as well as someone you would not like to disobey!<br /><br />Great battle scenes and sound effects; wonderful portrayal of work on board ship; and most importantly, a bit of humor stuck here and there with some great music.<br /><br />I recommend for EVERYONE!  Great movie; even better BOOK!<br /><br />Gary
B0043JDUNS|3.0|I had already seen this movie, can't remember what I thought the first time. It was OK but not the hilarity that the movie description said would occure.  We enjoyed it, my husband fell asleep, the action was good, the whole look of it was good, special effects were good.  The way he puts on his suit, or the way the suit gets on him is very good.  I don't recommend for a 2nd viewing but if you haven't seen it already you'll enjoy it.  Downey does a very good job with this character, Tony Stark, a very annoying but likeable guy. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't even look like Gwyneth Paltrow in this.
B002M5E2DW|2.0|There is definitely something to positive thinking and how your view of the world shapes your experience in it.  But controlling the universe with your brain has too many logical gaps for me to stomach.  Cheap science based prosperity gospel is certainly making the writer rich.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My daughter loves this movie!  She is at the age where she reciting the words from her favorites movies and shows.  This is one of them!
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, Mark O'Brien was a very likable, incredible man who was able to maintain a great sense  of humor even in a life that offered the average person every reason to just shut down and give up, not only was he doomed to a life in an iron lung, he also had to deal with a great amount of guilt that started with Polio and included the death of a sibling.  Every character in this story was extraordinary from the Priest to every caretaker.  I laughed and cried I did appreciate that the producers were able to maintain a sense  of dignity in showing the public what was required for Mark to fulfill his dreams of being a complete man.  Jody Foster, John Hawks and William H. Macey were perfectly cast.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|A great movie about dealing with overwhelming odds and conquering them. Alec Guinness is great and William Holden is a reluctant soldier, who turns out to be a hero.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|originally posted on my blog I Heart Romance.<br />----------------<br />I started reading this book because I knew I wanted to read it before seeing the movie (and I did the right thing!  More about the movie in different post).<br /><br />This book was a slow start for me.  In fact, I had to force myself to finish reading it in time for the movie.  It wasn't that I did not enjoy it, I did but the first few chapters did not catch my interest at all.  I remember starting to read this a few years back but I couldn't push through.<br /><br />That being said, once I got into the story, I liked it.  It was very well written and the pace was perfect for the length of the novel.  I immediately identified with the characters despite them being a mishmash of different personalities.  I also loved reading about an alternate universe/world of Shadowhunters, Angels and Demons.  This is the first shadowhunter book that I read but not my first angel/fallen angel book that I read (see my review of Fallen & Torment by Lauren Kate).<br /><br />My favorite character by far has to be Simon.  And yes, I want Clary to open her eyes and see what she has in front of her.  I even cheered when I found out that Jace was her brother  (although, spoiler alert, it will be revealed that Jace is really not Clary's brother).  I also liked that it was Simon who saved them from the high demon when they went to get the cup from Clary's neighbor.<br /><br />When it is revealed that Hodge, Jace's tutor and guardian of the Institute, was still working for Valentine, the action starts.  We also get to meet the werewolves headed  by Lucian Graymark/Luke Garroway who was a pack leader in New York and Clary's uncle who she grew up with.  It is also revealed that Lucian was Valentine's second in command and Jocelyn Fairchild's (Clary's mother) best friend.  When a fight breaks out in an abandoned hospital, we get to know who Valentine really is and who Jace is as well.  Valentine is also Clary's father.<br /><br />The plot is pretty much predictable with a few surprising twists in the end.  I really enjoyed the book and will finish reading the whole series./><br />The plot is pretty much predictable with a few surprising twists in the end.

B007QJ8VBI|5.0|Gary Grant is one of my favorites and I am in love with Doris Day. Great movie. I loved it.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Cant wait for season four.  I miss some of the characters that would still be main characters.  But the show is great
B008JAGZDE|2.0|Look, I'm a fan of the American pie films, but I just think that the same old crude jokes get a bit old.  It was nice that they bought all the original cast back, but come on, let it go already.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a great case!  It's worn wonderfully -- shows no wear & tear after months of use.  It's also been enough protection to keep my iphone safe.  I love it -- it's simple with a small amount of design.  I get compliments on it all the time -- from both men and women!  GREAT product!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have just finished the last book in the series, and all I am is disappointed.  not in the novel itself, but that at least as far as vince flynn being the author, this is the end.  Did not find a single one of these books to be disappointing ever, and can now only hope that someone picks up the mitch rapp torch and carries it on at least to close to as well as vince flynn did
0062255657|1.0|I fail to see the merit in this totally weird, plodding fantasy. I couldn't even finish reading it because of the redundancy and boring details.

B002UM5BXW|5.0|A look into professional kitchens I NEVER imagined. Anthony B. sure &#34;takes you there&#34;! There are so many funny tales, but he is also truthful about his short-comings as they reveal themselves through time. I think its a great book, but not for those who can't tolerate the &#34;F&#34; word !
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game would not download and so I never got to play this game. I would like the chance to try it one day though.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, it is really fun to play, I would recommend it for all horse lovers out there!
B00DNDR29I|5.0|This is not a thorough review. This is simply telling you that you must enjoy this album! I've been following Ms. Monae for about a year, and even managed to find her album before she started releasing the Suites.<br /><br />These are my top tracks that I heard for the first time on the album--<br /><br />Electric Lady<br />Primetime<br />We Were Rock & Roll<br />Look Into My Eyes<br />It's Code<br />Dorothy Danadrige Eyes<br /><br />The interludes are entertaining the first few times you go through them, but you'll want to consider leaving them off for any playlist you construct. The Overtures really tied the album together for me. (At first I couldn't stand them, but they started to have more value to the work as a whole.)<br /><br />If you love Janelle Monae, buy this. If you like her, buy this. If you're not sure, buy this anyway! You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />If Cindi's reading this, she needs to know that we can't wait another 3 years for an album!<br /><br />Be sure to buy tickets to Miss Monae's concerts, I dunno how much she's getting from this album but it's not enough! For those in Atlanta, she'll be here in November I think. I saw it on jmonae.com! Do it!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|You are really smart to make such a great game!!!!!! I enjoy playing this a lot!!!!!! I love how there is different characters to choose from¡!!!!!!!!

B00CCCF4NW|5.0|Just wanted to give this five stars.  Positive, nostalgic, glitchy, noisy, quiet, melodic, entrancing, anaesthetic and clarifying, motivating and relaxing.<br /><br />Amazon, please add some audio preview samples!
B00340ESIS|5.0|Blake Snyder has a way of putting it in the simplest of terms that makes you think about storytelling in a light they don't show you in film school. This book is recommended by beaucoups of writers and writing websites. I highly recommend checking this book out!
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|This was actually a very good movie that for the most part kept you thinking.  Even my kids enjoyed the movie.
B00CNIDGVW|4.0|really its a beautiful remastered, the color, the sound and the image its really faqntastic and seems like the film was made a year ago! really recommended
B0052REUW0|5.0|The most concise and poetic definition of the meaning of life is Albert Camus's novel The Plague. The most comprehensive scientific and philosophical explanation of this meaning is Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of our Nature. Best books I've ever read.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Great CD and great priced. Love Celtic Woman and this CD is a very good one. Be sure and buy !
B0080MJYR0|2.0|This movie was a B feature when it was released and is easily a prime candidate for mockery on Mystery Science Theater 3,000 (if that show were still around). Spoiler alert - if you're curious about where Duran Duran got their name, this is it - the villain is Dr Duran Duran.<br /><br />Jane Fonda plays a stereotypical sixties-era bimbo (and admittedly looks pretty good doing it), but there's not much else to see here except a boring window into the warped idea of what the baby boomer 'love generation' thought was racy, radical and risque back in 1968. It all comes across as buffoonish, gratuitous and pointless, but in the pre-Maxim Magazine era I bet this soft core styled film sold a lot of tickets to pre-pubescent boys wanting to see a little skin action.  Two stars only in a museum-piece cultural history lesson kind of way, not for any cinematic prowess.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Well done, awesome cast. This movie is a must see the adventure continues I'm true Star Trek style. Great job.
B0035JNRXU|3.0|Never watched this one before but finally got around to it. This is more like an episode of Next Generation than a feature film, but it's ok.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely amazing story & wonderfully written. Looking forward to reading Losing Hope. Thank you for a heart wrenching story one where my heart goes out to those beautiful little ones that are subject to the assault and I pray for them!
B00271B752|4.0|A classic early Pacino film with excellent sets and props - well done and probably could not be made again with such attention to detail. True story made it even more compelling, and Pacino was well cast for the lead role.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked the movie very much and would view it again.  Makes you ask the question of where we are going in the future.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan, Zealot:  The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, New York, Random House. 2013<br /><br />Reza Aslan's Zealot is the latest \\"in\\" book on Jesus.  The last being those of Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan. I must admit that I have a visceral reaction to fads and that I came to Zealot with a bit of skepticism.  Zealot is, however, in many ways a very good book with some important things to say about Jesus of Nazareth or, more properly, the historical Jesus.<br /><br />For those of a more traditional bent, you may find Aslan's work troubling.  He jettisons many cherished Christian beliefs such as the birth stories of Matthew and Luke including the idea of the virgin birth.  This is all part and parcel of secular biblical historical study.  But if one can get beyond this the book has some interesting things to say about Jesus.<br /><br />Aslan, in using the word zealot is trying to get at the reason that Jesus ended up on a Roman cross.  The Jesus, meek and mild, of popular religion would have provided no reasons for either the Jewish authorities or the Romans to notice him, much less for the Romans to crucify him.  The teachings of Jesus have an incendiary bite to them, but we often miss this having interpreted them in terms of heaven for generations. Then his entry into Jerusalem being proclaimed messiah and his \\"cleansing\\" of the temple were the final straw, particularly in that he did so in Passover season when thoughts of redemption of Israel from foreign powers ran high.  Aslan really makes his point well and repeatedly.  I quibble with the word zealot however.  The Zealots, as a party in Israel, did not arise for another forty some years after Jesus when the Jews and Jerusalem rebelled against the Romans in 64 C.E.  I would have used the word messiah as complex as that word is in the New Testament and as complex as was its meaning at the time of Jesus.  Zealot is just sexier as a title.<br /><br />The first few chapters of Aslan's book are his best, in my opinion. They lay out the history and cultural movements of the New Testament period, particularly the string of messianic claimants that arose, better than any other history of the New Testament that I have read.  Jesus' times were more and more turbulent as Israel steadily crept toward open rebellion late in the 1rst century C.E.  Aslan covers this history excellently and he does so in a very readable way.  The only other author that does so as well is John Dominic Crossan but Aslan does so in about half the pages and in a much more readable style.<br />In the later parts of Zealot Aslan tracks the life of the church centered in Jerusalem and how Jesus was \\"transformed\\" into god and the internecine battles between James the brother of Jesus and the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem and Saul of Tarsus/Paul.  Here he is, though sometimes correct, on thinner ice.  I am not convinced that there was the absolute breach between James and Paul as Aslan proposes.  Though I do believe that he is correct that, after the destruction of Jerusalem and the church in Jerusalem Paul's gentile Christianity soon became normative Christianity.<br /><br />As an effort to help those of you that are of a more traditionalist bent I want to begin my closure with a quote from Aslan and try to suggest one of the fatal flaws of biblical studies.  On page 120 Aslan makes the comment, \\"There may be no more important question than this (Jesus's relation to the other messianic claimants) for those trying to pry the historical Jesus away from the Christian Christ.\\" This is the grand task of biblical studies.  The assumption behind this comment is that there is a disconnect between the historical Jesus (historical reconstructions of Jesus the man) and the Christ of the Church.  But what if the two cannot be ultimately pried apart?  What if there is a real, historical connection between the core historical Jesus and the Christ of the Church as James Dunn proposes.  It is not that the Gospels do not need historical study.  But what if the historical Jesus, as best as we can ascertain it, has a direct connection to the Christ of faith?  I believe that the two do share a basic core reality.<br /><br />Finally, one could come away from Zealot with the idea that all of biblical scholarship agrees with Aslan's reconstruction of Jesus as a zealot.  Alas, New Testament studies is far more fracture than this.  I believe that Aslan's basic point has merit to it.  But other scholars reconstruct the historical Jesus in vastly different ways.  For example Marcus Borg and Geza Vermes have argued that Jesus was a \\"man of the spirit\\" while Dale Allison and others argue that Jesus was an End Time prophet.  And the list goes on.  New Testament scholarship in its study of the historical Jesus is in complete disarray and there are as many reconstructions of Jesus as there are writers and scholars.  That said, Aslan's book is worth reading if one wants to understand the historical figure of Jesus and the permutations of who the Church believed he was in the first few generations of the Church.<br />Jay Millso not need historical study.

B000A2RRF4|2.0|I wish I hadn't spent the money on this or any of the other things I got.  Wanted to show my young son some of his work, thinking his live stuff would be memorable.  I guess you have to be there to get the thrill.  I have been more impressed with just YouTube videos.  This is just a personal thing.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|What socially redeeming qualities are there supposed to be in blood, guts, gore and mayhem? They are whellming! And so on...
B0000DJE9R|3.0|I wish I hadn't spent the money on this or any of the other things I got, especially his live performance DVDs.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's one of those books that keeps having something happen every page so you don't get bored with it.  Once Clary starts to figure out about the Downworlders & the Clave, the book really takes off.  Definitely work the read.
B0084I9QIW|2.0|I guess I just wasn't impressed.  I think I am going to be content with his YouTube videos from now on.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|I watch each movie after reading each book, if it wasn't for the books I wouldn't understand the movies at all, they movies are all action and leave out a LOT of the internal struggles, personalities, and flaws of the characters, the book gives depth to everything, read the books, for a full HP experience.
B007YJ8ZRK|5.0|This is possobly my favorite movie of all time, with the twists in the plot and the really unexpected ending.
B009R659L8|3.0|What I like most about Mary Higgins Clark, is that her books are easy and fun reads.  The chapters are short so you always feel like your accomplishing something and the end is usually not obvious.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'd recommend this book to someone who loves action, love and adventure! I absolutely love the concept of this book!
B004GYY714|3.0|this app is pretty good it wouldnt play the station my daughter likes, even though its on the list when you do a local search, but it routed to a similar station in the area. havent had any problems with it like some of the ones ive read. only been using it a week though.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|when  you open the case the kindle instantly comes on and when closing it goes off, you can secure the kindle by flipping the band to keep it closed. fits in your purse really easy
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|It was just not enjoyable reading for me...boring, stupid, and I wasted money on it...I guess Oprah books aren't for everyone
B000HF0J36|5.0|This is a classic movie. Fantastic story, wonderful actors. I would definitely recommend this movie<br />!! L.L Cool J. Makes this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best novels I've ever read. I loved everything about this book. The amazing tale itself - I think it's genius to have come up with it. The characters - I felt I truly knew each and every one. The suspense. And I always love a tale that takes place in another country. After the first few chapters, I almost wrote down the name of each character with little reminders as to who each were - I could not imagine keeping them all straight, could not fathom how their lives could possibly be intertwined. Suddenly, though, they all clicked into place. You will find yourself grappling with how the secret was ultimately handled - i.e. accountability for a terrible action. I found the author's Epilogue absolutely astounding - just when I didn't think the book could end any better. Talk about a book that will stay with you long after you've finished it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Such an amazing account that anyone who has ever suffered a loss or had trouble finding themselves can relate to
B00886XQO0|5.0|I've had these headphones since day 1. To be honest, I don't really use them much because I have really good hearing. I use these more for night time when my family is sleeping or if my partner is sleeping next to me while I game through the night. The sounds are amazing and you have the ability to customize the way it sounds with the free downloadable program from Turtle Beach. This headphone is not just for Xbox 360. A lot of people aren't aware that you can hook it up to the back of your TV, if you have a Digital Optical and get sounds from everything playing on your TV! The cool thing is that it is dual pair bluetooth (One is for the wireless chat. So if you do want to chat to your buddies on 360, you have to use 1 of the 2 bluetooth signal by default.) and you can connect it to your smartphone. This allows you to answer calls and re-dial while playing! You can also play music from your smartphone to your headset if you want but this is unneccessary. If anyone have any questions, feel free to ask and I will respond ASAP.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|Jane Austin is one of the best. However its a difficult read because of the terms and phrases they used but once you get the hang of the word usage, its a fast read as well. Romantic and one for the ladies. I think she could have been an advocate for womens rights in modern times. Her characters are loveable and remind me of stories my grandmother used to tell about her life as a young lady. She was born in 1893, so it was sometime later, but in some ways very connected to the social graces and lifestyles of the characters in this novel. I enjoyed it!
B000ZP6MIY|5.0|Super happy with these Crocs. I need to wear slip resistant shoes at work, and these are my second pair of Crocs.  I'm replacing my first pair because the soles were beginning to wear out. So far these are comfy. The best part is the price.  My first pair were $40, and these same crocs were $45 in the SRMaxx catalog. I paid only $27 on amazon, and with my yearly stipend of $25 I pay only $2.
1616550414|2.0|I thought it would pay more attention to the back story. Since it's called Hyrule Historia. But it's just a lot of art work for the most part. Book arrived with the corners bent. Nice object to collect dust on my shelf.
0061906220|5.0|Awesome! Pete the Cat is now an absolute favorite in my kindergarten classroom! We have ordered every book that's out there about Pete the Cat!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app has many levels for different ages. Pretty to look at n cool sounds makes it appealing. And hey its free!
B00ALGW286|5.0|Captivated by author, Julia Gousseva's ability to paint pictures that materialized in my mind, images of Moscow Dreams will forever be part of my internal landscape. Nowhere before had, I read, \\"Sunshine squeezed in between the buildings.\\" As an author it had ever occurred to me that a summer rain could come on so suddenly that one could see the drops, \\"...racing each other to the ground.\\" Were this wordsmiths only ability to write about the ordinary as a transcended experience it would have been enough to make this a thoroughly unique read!<br /><br />However, Dr. Gousseva continued to demonstrate her mastery of historical fiction with layers of both generational personal and national history woven through the longing of 14 year old, Marina who lives through the fall of the Soviet Union and all that ensues. Juxtaposing what is known with what came before, and the unknown the author shows us the height of possibilities, the breath of fear, a crucible of becoming that each character and every person faces.<br /><br />It is said that for any fiction to succeed the tension must build. Moscow Dreams does this and much, much more! Those looking for an amazing read will be enthralled!<br /><br />On a personal note, as I read this thought provoking novel, I found myself thinking about the changes occurring here that many are not in favor of. I remembered the Passover we celebrated in the spring of 1991 with a family of Russian Jews who, due to the fall the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) had finally been allowed to come to America. Speaking with them, I realized that what we took for granted, they had never done for fear of being discovered.<br /><br />Therefore, it is with a happy heart that I say, \\"Thank you Dr. Julia Gousseva for showing us what can happen when we do nothing as a people. Thank you for showing us how dreams can survive. And lastly, bless you for illuminating the human condition.<br /><br />Always writing about choices and how God can help us change, Paula Rose Michelson wrote the Amazon Best Selling Christian self-help book \\"How Did We Become Angry?\\" That book and her three sweet Christian fictions with a Messianic twist and a hint of history: \\"Beginning Anew: The Naomi Chronicles\\" and \\"Casa de Naomi: The House of Blessing, Books One and Two\\", are available on Amazon.hange, Paula Rose Michelson wrote the Amazon Best Selling Christian self-help book \\"How Did We Become Angry?\\" That book and her three sweet Christian fictions with a Messianic twist and a hint of history: \\"Beginning Anew: The Naomi Chronicles\\" and \\"Casa de Naomi: The House of Blessing, Books One and Two\\", are available on Amazon.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game it really makes your hand eye coordination better... I recommend this game to everyone....
B006ISJQ26|3.0|I enjoyed the book and frankly I thought the film was not up to par.<br />There are better action movies.
B00E5INZ82|5.0|Better than other games,really realistic, fun,love  the up grades and the way the graphics are showed , great game for my kid.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Great dancing, great personnages, great acting,,,what's not to like. Two hours of pure delight! The songs are exceptinals: Tuppence, Superca...etc...
B007EECSFA|5.0|The plot is multi- layered and the pacing is great. The setting of England during WwII and switching to present- day keeps one turning the pages past  bedtime. It's a mystery and a love story. Really enjoyed the sense of place and time.
B003ELKNH2|5.0|It made film history. We still can visualise a lot of scenes. Well done. A must for anybody who loves the movies.
B003HARV4S|5.0|I've seen all of these movies before but I love them. I wanted them in my DVD library. I like how easy it is to order things from Amazon! KATH
B00C3V5TTQ|5.0|Love the classic sounds that bring back memories of tunes like \\"If you leave\\" as well as the experimental electronic sounds of \\"Dazzle Ships.\\" This album is now my favorite of all their albums!
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show i cant wait til Sep 17 for season 3. I love everyone one of this character.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I spent two weeks testing the free version of this app and I love it.  The free version works great, it just lacks some of the customizable features that this paid version offers.  The paid version allows the user to set more than one alarm at a time (handy for those that need to be reminded to take their medications.)  You can also choose to use your own music files as the alarm or use the music that comes with the app.  The same applies to the sleep timer, use your own music or pick your relaxation from the white noise generator that is also included.  You can also change the appearance of the clock.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite part of this app is that you can dim the display with just a brush of your fingertips!<br /><br />Well worth a dollar!
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie is great.  I watched the first part of this while I was in college.  I had to find and buy this after that day and have already purchased this once before.  I bought this one used because I leave it at friends houses and forget where I left it.  I wont lose this one.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Awesome movie. constantly had me guessing and re-guessing  all start cast did an excellent job as well. Definitely recommend it
6305014140|5.0|I bought this copy used because it is the 3rd copy I've owned and it was cheap.  I keep taking it places and leaving it for people to watch then forgetting where I left it.  This one will not be lost.  Ninja Scroll rules.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is so nice and convenient to have right on my phone apps. It has come in handy many times. I like the alternate color features too!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed this. Didn't love it but it held my interest. I did love the historical aspect of the story.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Beautifully written, wonderful storyline, the more I read the more I wanted it to never end.  You will fall in love with the characters and feel that they are real. Long listed for the Man Booker prize, Ozeki deserves a win!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love to read the post-apocalyptic SF stories. Most are interesting in that they present new ideas about how the future could take a turn for the worse and what humanity does to survive. They are usually weak on character development and are often (particularly the eBooks) poorly edited. Wool, goes further and makes you think about today and peoples' motivations, how seemingly good intentions can go way off course. Howey's stories are well-edited and enjoyable to read.<br /><br />Wool (and the entire Silo series) is very well-written with deep characters and plenty of life insights along the way. I just started the final book in the series, Dust. It's a good idea to read them in sequence. Once you start, you won't be able to put them down.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|To talk about animal slaughter and humanity as a mixed subject is a bit of a confusing dichotomy.  Once you are able to get beyond that you can't help but develop great admiration and respect for the work of Temple Grandin.  The film (TV show) is very well done and Claire Danes gives a not to be missed performance in the title role.  Watch this with some of Ms. Danes other performances and you will see what good acting really is.  She is an outstanding talent with an amazing range.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Appreciate that it is topical<br />Excellent cast ,even if some are annoying at times.<br />Do enjoy watching this quick<br />Moving series.
B0081ISUOG|1.0|Paid for the pro version, ad-free, and they charged me but I never received the app download. Total waste of money - very upset.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This guy is my new favorite Jew, can't wait to start my daily routine. I love the Truth Tourette's and brutal honesty. I am actually excited to lose my job now.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|A most excellent album.  One of the bettter cd's i've bought in some time. Each song is awesome.  Ive never listened to the deftones before and am glad i picked this one up.  Definately recommend it!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Very addicting game, have it on my I phone and like it more here on the big screen. The only bummer is I can't seem to get the daily challenges I play on my phone to load on the kindle.  If they get that, you will not be able to put the game down!
B0027Z5DM6|3.0|This is not the greatest Adam Sandler movie but not bad either.  My kids loved it. Would watch it again.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I haven't seen as imaginative a film in some time. I think this film most closely captures the metaphysical reality of our existence, than any film before. Not only that, but it's exciting with well developed characters as well, and with a generous sprinkling of humor. Don't miss it.
B000NHPCS0|5.0|Took me a minute to understand what was going on but this is a great movie! Jack Nicholson is outstanding as usual! Leonardo DiCaprio and the other guy (good will hunting) are awesome too!
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I got this game because I wanted to improve my reflexes and my response time. I have a choronic illness that has slowed down both of these. This game is a great challenge for Me, and I do believe it will help.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Movie was good but keeps stopping saying loading.<br />Then it seemed like it got better but loading issues kind of sucked.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I got this game for Myself,  not knowing what age group it was geared for. Needless to say, once I downloaded it I realized my mistake.
B001RNO7D0|5.0|These are my favorite hiking shoes. They are very durable. I have had these for years and I have put many many miles of trail on them and they are still quite intact and looking good. No loose stitching, no holes, the tread is only slightly worn. I still use the original laces too. I walk on rock faces, dirt paths, gravel roads, mountain trails, snow, mud and everything imaginable. They have never let me down. They seem a wee bit heavy to me, but perhaps if they were not heavy they would have worn out long ago. When I do need new shoes, I will buy these again. Note: I typically wear size 11.5 or 12, but fit perfectly into a size 13 of this shoe.
0062255657|5.0|This book was absolutely brilliant! I am a somewhat new Gaiman fan, but I read 4 of his books before this one, and it fairs well with the lot. Great book with fantasy and that Gaiman tone. A quick read, but was very worth buying.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|It kept my stock clocked 8320 cool under load.  The only downside is the installation was more involved than expected.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|Interesting insight into the character of Magaret (aka &#34;Peg&#34;) and her background and history. It seems odd that the writers waited until this point to delve into this though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever it is a lot of fun it can be hard but not bad I would choose this as my favorite game
B008469DGY|5.0|this game is a great game. anybody can practically beat it. I got this free but playing it I would buy it for the original 99&cent;
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Good game. Teaches one to give thought to any move that is made. Gives one need to use thought process before just jumping to next stop.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|I never heard of Maysa. Amazon recommended her based on my previous purchases. She is in a league all her own. I loved every cut on this album.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|fun realistic fun eats battery fun fun fun fun I really don't like surveys that dictate a word count fun
B00821OX98|3.0|First of all, i don't think that a summary is necessary.  Either a person likes or dislikes it, that is one of the reasons I don't give many ratings.
0345803493|5.0|I found out more about the main character Christian Grey and his life.  His relationship with Annastia continues to grow. I can't wait to read the last book 50 Shades of Freed.
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|This free Kindle game is a great teaching/learning tool. It allowed my grandchild to compare pictures to come up with a common theme.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|This is an excellent game. I highly recommend it!!!! It's a great way to pass the time. If u like magic the gathering , you'll like this. Hope u enjoy...'
B008X9Z37A|5.0|the kindle fits just right. i now have not problems letting the 3 year old walk around with it. keeps my fire safe.
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|there was no plot, they didn't explain anything, there was a terrible ending, the ending didn't make sense, it was not scary
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Without this app getting to your Picasa albums is a challenge.  This app simplifies the process and makes showing off your pictures a breeze.
1476729719|4.0|I loved almost everything about this book.  I was invested in the story from the start and didn't want to put it down.  I read a lot of popular fiction and often find myself skipping over complete paragraphs, sometimes pages, of what I refer to as \\"fluff\\" - describing ad nauseum the surroundings or other details to add length to the book - and I didn't do that a single time with this book.  I was constantly stopping to re-read entire paragraphs because they were so poignant and beautifully written, comparisons were imaginative and complex.  That's what made the ending so completely disappointing.  It's almost like another author wrote the ending.  I don't need a happy ending all tied up in a bow, but this ending just didn't do justice to the rest of the book.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Easy to use and lots of features makes this a very nice program for my Kindle Fire HD. Very pleased.
030746363X|1.0|I got this book for the dieting content.  Initially I was very excited and shared the recommendations with my wife, an academic physician and medical researcher.  She warned me there were numerous basic science flaws.  I didn't listen and tried the diet anyway.  It is awful.  I've done Atkins, South beach, and various other low carb diets before and this is MUCH MUCH worse.  You feel sick the whole time, especially on your \\"binge\\" day.  Basically, I was on the toilet or doubled over with GI pain almost every day.  I don't normally have any problem with lentils or beans, so that wasn't the issue.  Anyway, Yes, if you are too sick to eat anything, you lose weight.  However, who cares.  There are other diets that work just as well and aren't as painful. Personally, I got better results from Atkins, and from just doing a lot of exercise.  Based on my wife's analysis and my personal, horrible experience, I would encourage people to look elsewhere if weight loss is what you are after.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|It's easy software to install and it works flawlessly and behind the scenes. Also, it does not suck up system resources to much. I only wish they would bug me less than every single month about upgrading to the paid version.
B00271B752|5.0|one of the greats.  Pacino is at the top of his form in portraying this, just trying to do right, kind of guy.  the story is 100% true which makes it even more fascinating.  I had not seen it since the 70's and it was like seeing a great film for the first time (again) the other night.  if you like Pacino, like NYC type cop stories, and like the tragic hero stuff, you cannot go wrong with this film.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Great classic movie! One of Disney's best! A great movie for the family with a great moral lesson to be learned.
0061801313|5.0|Wonderful Books just gave them to my son he loves them. Especially the Covers how they have the dolls and real person.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Great movie, and one of the sharpest blue ray pictures I have seen so far. Must have for sci-fi fans
B004SBQGHS|4.0|For 99 cents you can't beat it.  I don't play much but it's good to have if I do want to play.  Tried the free one with ads and immediately uninstalled that one.
0307276902|5.0|I got this for my grandson and he really loved this book.  He has passes it around to some of his friends.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|We really enjoy this series and love to sit as a family to view. Of course, our child likes to watch some again on her kindle. Fun twist to fairytales.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|Another awesome album from this fantastic band - one of my favorite albums of 2013 for sure! Would definitely recommend
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Was listening to the GOG Podcast and he was a special guest. I did not know who he was prior, but I had heard of his books. I immediately purchased this and started following the diet and exercise tips. I will also be purchasing his 4-Hour WorkWeek.<br />-NWE
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and read it in whatever time I could snatch during the day. Love the twists and an easy read.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Very good plot, action movie. I don't see any future fo the movie it could have more drama but no room.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Engaging for my 5 year old and the graphics are good.  I find that there are far too many advertisements. It is confusing and frustrating for my child.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The game is really cool and fun the missions are hard and touch mode is kind of annoying because I can't move and shoot at the same time but if you switch to gyro it's pretty easy and REALLY fun. Plus there's awesome graphics and<br />armors that I haven't even heard of
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Even at my age not sure how to take what I have just read.  The book however was written well and really did bring you into the story line.
B000069KGM|5.0|University trained musicians using all the tools they while playing rock and roll.  Better than I had remembered.  RIP Terry - even Jimmy Hendrix knew how talented you were.<br /><br />Listen to this again - though somewhat dated - nothing like it today.  An orchestral masters thesis.<br /><br />Remastered quality is lacking as is Chicago II.  Perhaps it is the best that can be done.  This aspect is disappointing.  Thought that it would be much, much better with technology.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Awesome book and awesome series.  You won't be disappointed - I couldn't put this book down.  Card is a great author.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is one of my top 5 &#34;comfort&#34; movies. It encompasses all of the qualities I look for in a movie: intelligent, timeless, touching, funny, a little sad, and the best - hopeful. The actors couldn't be better in this wonderful film, and I just cannot get enough of it. Enjoy, and enjoy yet again!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|More levels please. Took me only 20min to get through all 10!  Levels 7+10 were the most challenging so maybe some with greater difficulty!
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|If I could give this movie zero stars, I would. This is one of the worst, most poorly written and overwrought films of the last decade. I laughed throughout the entire movie, and I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Absolutely love the option to fade in the alarm volume!  This allows me to wake up gently, regardless of background noise in the room.  This app is very easy to use, including the music vs sound options.  Great for travel.  Just wish it had am and pm so I could set a repeated alarm.  I haven't had the app long enough to experiment with setting a repeated alarm, and then seeing if it only activates once a day or twice.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|This is a fun family movie that keeps the kids entertained and is enjoyable by parents also. This movie is not one that you have to worry to about language or sex. We enjoy watching it a few times each year.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|Just rewatched. It's startling how much better the writing is in series 1 when compared to the most recent season. Really enjoyng the performances of Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper.
B00004CZN9|2.0|This DVD will not play on your DVD player, I finally played it on my computer, and the quality is bad. The movie is not original, it is a copy. Plus mine had subtitles you could not disable.
B005GIS1SY|5.0|My wife and I first saw portions of this movie during a Yellow Ribbon Event.  It wasn't until much later that we decided to watch the whole thing and I am glad we did.  It was a very nice movie, plenty of comedic scenes.
B00CJGP116|5.0|i got it last saturday and i have played it over and over and over and OVER again! -- my fav': vivir mi vida [both versions] & dime si no es verdad -- really great music, i actually can't stop dancing! :) --
0553106635|5.0|As of this writing, I have read the first four books in the the Song of Ice and Fire series and a Storm of Swords in my opinion is by far the best yet. While it is pretty hefty (over 900 pages), I got through it in no time at all! So many unexpected events took place in this book.... I literally could not put it down.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Enjoyable story for teens and adults.  Each characters courage in the face of the unexpected was encouraging.  I hope e movie lives up to the promise of the book
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This is not complete and therefore I really have no comment.  I will try to contact you for a reload or refund.
B00CQ8U5ZE|5.0|this is one great movie iam so glade it came out on bluray this is charles bronson at his best  and so is lee marvin with an all star cast get death hunt you will be glade you did.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love the story and characters! Never have opportunity to watch it on TV but can watch at my convenience on my Kindle, starting at season 1!
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|It was much better than we were expecting it to be, had low expectations going in but glad we rented it
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|The Blu-ray version of George Steven's SHANE is exactly the same as the former DVD in that it has the feature film, a commentary track and the trailer. The art work on the cover is pretty much the same. The only reason to upgrade this title is for the Blu-ray and fortunately that is reason enough if you love the particular title. The picture is quite stunning. If you haven'g seen the film then you will be in form a treat as the retail price of this classic is quite low and the film itself ranks as one of the truly great Westerns of all-time!
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Everyone in this household agreed that it was too boring to watch.  We turned it off after 10 minutes or so.  I was especially disappointed since I'm a big Matthew and Reese fan, but just couldn't get into it.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|this is the perfect case for Plantronics voyager legend a must have keeps headset safe when not using it and keeps battery at 100%
B004GJXQ20|5.0|it took me a chapter or two to really get into the storyline but from then on i was hooked. I have not seen the TV series yet but i have heard that the books are better !
B009KS4XRO|3.0|There are better bingo games available but I have to take into consideration that it is free. My biggest issue is that the game freezes and by the time it catches up, it either throws 6-10 numbers at you or the round is over. Rarely if customer support is contacted is anything done.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Drops of Jupiter was ok- But Ca 37 is wonderful- didn't know the boys were from the bay area.They were at Bottle Rock Napa now I really wished I'd seen them.
1611761808|5.0|Very different characters, separated by generations and geography, have a tie to each other.  This is a beautiful story that comes together in an amazing way at the end.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I am always up for a good Sci-fi movie.  Would have liked to have seen more of Morgan Freeman, but Tom Cruise was good and it was overall a pretty good show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Period pieces are my favorite and Downton Abbey did not disappoint. The clothes, the jewelry, and the decor. Dame Maggy Smith is the greatest!! I am such a fan of the show now, waiting for January 2014 gives me something pleasant to look forward to.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the only tv show that I am totally addicted to!  What an interested time of life that everyone has forgotten, even thought it's really not that long ago.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I started late viewing this series so purchased both Season 1 and Season 2.  Once I got started I couldn't stop watching and was disappointed when there were no more episodes to watch.  The office political battles between the two senior partners and the legal wranglings of Harvey and Mike are intriguing.  And it certainly doesn't hurt that Donna and Rachael are part of the story.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|It's nice to be able to ramp up the volume and to see where you are at with it. Nice!!! What a great program. Thanks for making this free and available
B004LSJCJM|5.0|First CD i have purchased by this artist.  I plan to buy more, i like his blusey style of music.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|The girls had seen this in the theater so when it came available it was a &#34;must have&#34;.  There is a new twist to the Pony stories and that made the girls more interested. They have the dolls not too and can play for hours, either while the movie is playing or on their own.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|All my friends talked about how great the show is, so last week I had a Downton Abbey marathon and watched all three seasons. Loved the scenery, characters, costumes, and stories. I was saddened by the ending, however. Matthew was one of my favorite characters. I look forward to seeing season four and being in real time to discuss the episodes with my friends.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I have not played games much and this has been a good one to start with.  It is easy to understand, fun and challenging.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I enjoy some of the music from back in the day.  This CD is full of good songs that liven up the place when I play them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham never disappoints - I read this book in one day. Loved every part of it, especially (of course!) the ending. Can't wait till his next one comes out! Enjoy! :)
B009GED3HS|5.0|What can I say. LOVE the show. Great quality for a download on my laptop. Waiting for the new season.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I really like that direct approach... It's about 6 basic movements, with 10 steps each... sounds easy.<br />However, the book contains very pertinent description of these movements, describe each step of it, and offers additional info about them...<br />I just loved this book (and started the conditioning :) )....
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|The dr. Panda apps are so much fun and educational.  We own all of them and they keep our daughter very well occupied when need be.  I highly recommend.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|just in a few words... I loved this book, it's fun and it contains a lot of useful info, for any kind of runner...
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I find it very smart of you guys too write such a lovely novel. This is very important and we use this everyday in life people have grew up with this.
B004U2RCZA|4.0|This is a great cd.  Show how versatile the group is.  I highly recommend this cd and can't wait for another one.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Love the show and the books add much more depth. This purchase has really increased my love for the series.
B007DKNEI0|5.0|I have owned the records since they were released , and I still have them.....they are all in good condition....<br /><br />This CD collection means that I can play everything in my car....such tracks as the \\" Encore \\" suite , Kiev Mission ( Exit ) and<br />Tangram , suites 1 and 2 , will sound quite different in a smaller confined space.......<br /><br />I'm a Tangerine Dream addict , and this collection will be a valuable addition to my library.<br /><br />As with all their work , this collection represents significant period in the groups evolution ......I can recommend this collection without reservation...<br /><br />Another successful purchase from Amazon online.............<br /><br />Graeme Brown<br /><br />Melbourne<br />Australia
B002GMSMHS|5.0|Came fine, in great shape.  I plan to order more and use your business again. I appreciate it.  Thank you, John
0425266060|5.0|Great book can't wait for books 4 and 5 to be out!!!! Once I started to read couldn't stop!!! Love it!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it's not the best I've read but it's one of them I just wish it was longer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game. I was entertained for hours but finished the very next day since there is only 10 levels. Can't wait for an update!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This app rocks!! The best weather app I've seen in a long time it's a must have. I can't wait for the upgrade
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If I'd had even the slightest inkling of how easy and natural it was going to be...feeling myself slide into this &#34;mind movie&#34; she so effortlessly conjures; I would have purchased these magical pages the first day they were released into the world.  THANK YOU, MS. JAMES!  Yes, in &#34;shouty capitals&#34; - well deserved for the second beautiful gift you have given us... ;)
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like this alot just wish I could figure out how to set the time. But still it's a good app
B00068TJM6|3.0|This very nice watch failed to function after 14 months. Specifically the stopwatch return button froze.  Stopwatch now inoperable. Not very reliable. Still, it is a nice looking watch.
140006922X|5.0|I have to say that after reading two of Mr Aslam's books, I am quite a fan. His writing style is very readable. His facts are well researched and well presented.<br /><br />The subject matter is fascinating. Zealot compares and contrasts Jesus the Christ with Jesus the man. Very little actual direct evidence exists about who Jesus really was. But, through inference when reading and comparing the gospels and other early Christian and Jewish writing, as well as historians like Josephus, Aslam pulls information from disparate sources to put together as close to a biography of Jesus as we'll ever get. Is it perfect, probably not. Is it close enough to believe that Jesus really existed and preached his gospel and that he claimed to be the Messiah? Probably yes. And, he goes further to discuss the way Christianity developed from Jesus's original teachings to those of modern Christianity.<br /><br />This is the second book I read written by Aslam. The first book I read was \\"No G-d but God\\" which I also found wonderful. If I were to recommend both books, I would suggest you read Zealot first, if only for the correct chronology.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading more of Mr Aslam's writings.
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|Great idea, but Christian Bale's ridiculous fighting skills ruined the whole movie. The sets were pretty well done. Emma Watson went way too soon
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I, Rashalle,  have to say that I absolutely love this show!!!  I watch it all the time and can't get enough!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Most fun I have had in long time with this game!  Got to have on list of apps.  so get it.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|This is my favorite of the 5 Hanson cds that I have. it is amazing!!! love it. I highly recommend!
B005544V6A|5.0|I love USA channel, their series are super.  Haven't had cable in a few years, so I've lost track of Royal Pains, White Collar, and Burn Notice ... but just found Suits on my Amazon Prime and am loving it.  Great writing!  The characters are rich, the plots inventive, it's got everything I want in a good series.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love this series of Sherlock Holmes but my only wish is that they had made more shows in the series.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Even with Vertigo ascending to the Sight+Sound poll's #1 slot, I still think North By Northwest is a better movie.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Listening to their first album, the band is hardly recognizable save Turner's Sheffield accent, but this evolution has led to 5 albums, all with a very unique atmospheres. AM's dark, sexy tones add another chapter to the saga. It's not perfect, but from the behemoth Dr. Dre Meets Black Sabbath masterpiece \\"Arabella\\" to the late night groove of \\"Fireside,\\" to the crooning \\"No 1. Party Anthem,\\" its a triumph. Buy it.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Easy to use. Good program to watch good quality Music videos. I  Use on Kindle about 2 years. Try it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the big buttons, and nice display!  Love it!  Easy to see, easy to use!  Great pick!  You won't regret it!
B002GJT4Y6|5.0|I am delighted with my four disc ultimate edition set of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.<br />I love the extras and the extended version of the movies.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|This is a great CD.  It reminds me quite a bit of Radiohead in the quick switches of music within a song and lilting lyrics.  The more I listen, the more I like it!
B0091REZMW|5.0|So much fun! I LOVE PLAYING THIS EVERY CHANCE I GET. There are so many things to do and so many quests to complete. It should keep me busy for hours!
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I wanted to catch up all of my Beatles CD's remastered. This was an excellent way because I always convert my cd's into MP3's and this saved me a step. After all this time, there is still no one who can compare with the Beatles, unless of course it was a Beatles' solo album. Yes it is a little expensive but overall, with the limited edition of the &#34;Apple&#34; well worth it.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|Only downloaded it because it's Star Wars related. Just don't care for it. Too flashy, Too fast paced, Pinball is far better on the PC than it is on the tablet.
030789701X|4.0|This product is amazing in it's overall quantity of information and quality of condition. I love this product overall, but I was disappointed at the handling of it as it was being shipped. When I received it, it was bent on the front of the cover. It is a very sturdy cover so I was surprised to see that anything dented it. Needless to say, it should be packaged much more carefully to improve customer satisfaction. For that reason alone, I rate it 4/5.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Your basic Bingo app. Multiple areas to play in, Each has their own collectibles which are worthless but at least it gives some replay value to each area. Of course you don't win in every game but at least it's playable, I have had it for a few days now and have yet to run out of tokens to play Bingo with.<br /><br />Overall, It's not that bad. It's your basic Bingo app. I have no problems with it and would recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have the following and it works flawlessly on all the platforms;<br />Droid 2<br />MacBook<br />Windows 7<br />Kindle Fire<br /><br />I think because it's free helps too.  ;)
B00COMLLX2|2.0|Similar to what I said about Star Wars Pinball, I will say for this app as well. Pinball just doesn't work well on tablet, I much prefer playing it on my PC instead.
030758836X|5.0|This book set the bar and set it HIGH. So far I've been searching for a book that knocked me out of my chair and had me hanging on for dear life. None have met this book or even come close. This book is a phenomenal study in the workings of marriage and the emotional toll it can take on people. Chock full of twists and turns and great character development that leaves you wondering who exactly you're rooting for. I cannot stress enough that everyone should give this book a try. It is by far my favorite reed since Duma Key and 11/22/63 by Stephen King. WOnderfully compelling and extremely exciting. The hardest part was the end because it was over. I don't know how she's going to top this book and part of me wonders if she will. I read both her other books and they are just as good, but not on the same level of Gone Girl. Flynn is raw and unedited and the book shows she has no limits. Looking forward to her next novel. I will say, I wonder how the movie will turn this out, but I know I'll be one of those people saying \\"It will never be as good as the book\\" when the credits roll. Must read for anyone. PERFECT beach read.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Very good challenging mind game . Would recommend it to anybody who likes a good challenge.  Overall I would buy it and any other game like it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great love story. Could not put it down. Kept you interested on every page. Another great one by Sparks. Definitely my favorite author.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Which is why I'm writing this review right now. I want to earn 15 credits for a hint. The first several puzzles are deceptively easy, so the game lulls you into a false sense of security.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I'm a fan of this genre...the legal drama/soap opera, where characters are complex and family dynamics are woven into drama of legal maneuvering.
B00000I5Y6|5.0|There are some great oldie songs on here from Kansas.  I have been looking for something like this for a long time.  thanks Amazon.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|How could anyone cast Tom Cruse as Jack Reacher!  I enjoyed the story. The bad guys are oh so incredibly evil. I am reading the second book featuring Jack Reacher now.
B00008G9JN|5.0|I like all of it.  I have heard the album before but it was vinyl, no longer have it so I ordered the CD.  Excellent
B004MPEVWC|5.0|This movie was awesome, no one should do anything like what they did and get away with it fiction or non fiction
B007AL48UK|1.0|I own this app. The amazon store is aware that I own it. I am now getting a message saying I dont own it. Then it gives me another error about my network connection. I know my connection is excellent. I hope this issue is resolved.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Characters nicely developed in a fun, uncomplicated story. Great summer reading on a summer day by the ocean at the New Jersey shore.
B0055SWM08|4.0|not to difficult at the beginning allowing time to get the hang of it before getting frustrated. well worth a buck
B006C45MRE|3.0|I was told by my 17 year old son this was a good movie, he was half right. Lets just say it was not as bad as I thought it would be. If you have a bad weather nothing to do day and your TV has endless re-runs, this is a good time killer.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Love the graphics!  I like that the items are not stationary on repeated tries.  Would love bigger items,tho, as my eyes tire of the searching.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Love real life stories, This could be anyone, in any life in any relationship. More than once I wanted to go through the book and help her
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best show I have seen.  Great writing, awesome performances, intriguing story arch and lots of laughs.  It is intense, touching and funny.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Great plot and concept; however, it was too wordy and far too much detail.  It kept me reading and wanting more but I found myself skipping over a lot of pages that just kept repeating and reiterating.  I wanted to read the second in the trilogy but found myself hesitating to buy it as it had poor reviews.  I might just get it from the library.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|The Adobe Reader is much better than the ebook reader in my Kindle Fire HD.<br />It fits the size and format easily and navigates well.<br />I could not bookmark the page I was reading for reasons not known.<br />Also, perhaps for copyright reasons, I could not insert comments or sticky notes
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An excellent cast of characters and beautiful emotion.  Enthralling and truly magical.  I would read and re-read this book a hundred times again.  The emotion and connection you have with the characters while reading is touching and real.  A must read.
B009R659L8|5.0|And I've read them all.<br />It's been a long time since I closed a book with a sigh, sad that I was finished.<br />Mary Higgins Clark is my favorite mystery/suspense author, she just has &#34;it&#34;.  Her characters come to life and I find myself immersed in the story while trying to figure out the identity of the killer.<br />The story began with a bang (well, literally) and flowed with perfect pacing.<br />There were a couple small errors which i believe is very unusual for Mary, but no way am I taking a star away for that.  Mary is not slowing down in her writing one iota, and I, for one, am extremely grateful!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie is hilarious!! I can watch it over and over again and it gets better every time! Fat Amy steals the show!
B00006CXSS|2.0|Band of Brothers is a classic, but the product I received  was damaged. The case has numerous dents that I am not too happy with. The Miniseries is great, the DVD discs appear fine, but very disappointed with the damages to the outer casing.
B005I7G3EM|5.0|Hatari! is a John Wayne classic.  It is fun, warm hearted, and a pleasure to watch.  Yes, I would hope animal wrangling is a bit different now a days but other than that it is a wonderful movie for the whole family!
0240815807|5.0|Just in flipping through the pages when I first got the book, I found some simple yet amazing ways to fix my mixes!  This is a fantastic book!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbet id a terrific show. We go through all the episodes so quickly and can't wait for the next season!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Susan Tedeschi & Derek Trucks have put together a band that is going to be one of the power houses of the blues world.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I grew up with this show and have seem all the episodes many times.  HD makes them seem as though I was watching for the first time.  The reconstructed Pilot was a thrill!
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Good for the whole family.  I brilliant twist on historic events!  Great performances by all.  Love the scenery and locations!
B00EVLU2F2|2.0|After listening to this album, it made me seriously question if I really am a Goldfrapp fan.  Supernature is my all time favorite album from the group. To this day, I still love every single song on it! I wasn't blown away when I previewed the songs for this one, but I still downloaded it with the hope that maybe the 30 second clips where just poorly chosen... No, they were perfectly chosen, and that's a bit unfortunate.<br /><br />Every song, with the exception of Thea, sounds exactly the same. Her voice is beautiful, and the music is &#34;pretty,&#34; but unless you spend hours looking for the hidden meanings within each song, there isn't really any drama or intrigue to the album.  The songs slowly build to a hinting of electro-glam, and then end. You then start back at the bottom and start over with the next song.<br /><br />It's as if something is missing from each song.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Fun enough game for kids but almost every time you play you need to buy.<br />I have already deleted it as there are plenty of entertaining & free apps that don't require purchasing points, etc just to keep using the game
B001JI8IJW|5.0|The true nastiness of the scenes at Headquarters makes the whole movie outstanding.  Yes the Christian Lebs would never have a suicide bomber but so what--chalk it up to poetic license.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Still good, but I liked the first one better. I would still recommend watching the movie because it is good.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|What will happen to these two. This ended too suddenly. Please let them continue in another story. I loved this book so. The story consumed me to the point that I read late into the night,knowing I had to get up early this morning. Enjoyed every single moment of this story.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Thoroughly entertained...the characters are interesting, realistic and the whole concept is fresh. Kind of helped me relive my youth while also feeling glad that part of my life is behind me. Awesome show.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recommend the book to whoever likes suspense. Also, it may leave you a little confused at the end, wanting more. I have read all of the books before, and all of them are great.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|I have never read a book that I enjoyed so much! Brilliant writing which captures all emotions in one read
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really enjoyed the game like the mixture of ho and puzzles great graphics and good story. Will purchase more games.especially from the makers
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Couldn't wait to begin this book, again the story just flowed. Not hard at all to imagine the characters. Wow!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This movie is faaaaaaaaaaaaaar deeper than anyone think it is. After watching this movie, I thought I had it all figured out but BOY was I wrong. I looked up a 42min google talk explaination of the movie and now my eyes have been opened. This is by FAR the deepest movie I have ever watch. Just as deep as a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream!
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|I don't hear much of a difference while its on. I know it's on because the volume is controlling the phones sound...
B000QGAU4E|5.0|I took this vision of the future as a sorta sequel to this book I read called 'Dante's Inferno' by Dan Brown. I KNOW it wouldn't fit together but still, its pretty awesome
B004G606K8|4.0|i love books like these. the adventures are well developed and the descriptions are vivid. the characters are finally not &#34;perfect&#34; with some kind of special power that sets them apart. they are normal with normal problems, they arent full of righteous emotions and they all have a small dark side too. the characters are well rounded. and i was swept up in the book fast. cant wait to finish the series.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy this game. But I wish the energy did not get used up so fast. Also I wish there was another way to get diamonds. Overall I really like it.
147674355X|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Written so well that you can't foresee what's going to happen next. I cried happy and sad tears!!!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|You should get this game best game EVER soccer goalie shirts and then you want to make a necklace and helpfully the way ariana to make a game on the amazon to draw something that I think u why not who said he had to draw cartoon free soccer store for the amazon and I like it happened on kindle is the Himalayan and I think the Himalayan noisy and then you want the way the Himalayan noisy the amazon and I have been a game on the amazon to draw this game on draw this is very fun if the amazon river in lake Tahoe the amazon to draw this game is very fun crafts for your new school year old girl in the amazon river in lake city of a necklace the amazon and then the amazon river and the Himalayan mountain view the Himalayan noisy and the way to get off the amazon and then you want a platinum to get this
0670026557|4.0|Very interesting approach to business and being successful.<br /><br />My two sons interested in the book so it makes a good gift to those in business
0385528787|5.0|It takes a great writer to weave together a story that engages readers while at the same delivering a disturbing message about our possible future. Margaret Atwood is such a great writer, and her new novel, MaddAddam, completes a trilogy that presents a vision of the world we may be creating. This satire projects what may happen if some trends continue. In Atwood's future, genetic engineering has gone amuck, a pandemic devastated humanity, while species have gone extinct. Amid this bleak landscape, there is the development of community and bonds of enduring love. Readers who have read the earlier novels will certainly want to read this one to be able to enjoy a satisfying conclusion. New readers to the series or Atwood can start here, and will likely want to read more.<br /><br />Rating: Five-star (I love it)
B003Z49LYO|4.0|High production values with solid performances. Respectable adaptation of the Thomas Hardy novel. Not much more to say about it..
B002EDH0FE|4.0|An interesting turn on a dark and brooding alternate universe.  Comparable to Blade Runner.  Doctor Manhattan rocks, although we don't see enough of that character.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I enjoyed this book much more than I expected I would. Really pulls at the heart strings. An emotional journey.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I just didn't really care for<br />This book. I thought the writing style was very young, and I was ready for<br />It to be over way before it actually was.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Loved it. Such a great comedy with a good message. The entire cast was amazing. Ryan Gosling is shirtless! Bonus!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game and I go back a couple times a day, once I get more free coins, I try to do tricks but it has a mind of it's own
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Superb acting enhanced by the tension created by how none of the actors knew ahead of time who did it. Will be very interesting to see how the various members of the village under suspicion react when the killer is finally revealed.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I absolutely loved it. It was what I expected and yet so much more. Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Definitely hoping to find more books like it soon. &#60;3
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I chose this book for my book club and everyone loved it.  I could not put it down and it was a great book.  I have read a lot of different books and types of books for book club, and this is by far the favorite.  It was very enthralling and you made a connection with a lot of the characters.  Men and women enjoyed this book!  It was a little hard to keep up with because it went from past to present to future and back and then forward again, but after a few chapters, it was familiar and easy to follow.  Highly recommended.
B008M87GJK|4.0|What  don't like is that with the Kindle Fire, it is not sensitive to the orientation of the device. News is great, everything else is perfect. Love it, but fix the orientation.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I love Mahjong....this one is good and was recommended with another game.  I guess the only thing I would change is maybe a little bigger tiles.
1451648537|5.0|I am till reading this book, but could not wait to review it.  Wow, I am blown away and mesmerized at the story not only of Steve Jobs, but of Apple and how they interacted with Bill Gates, IBM, etc.  It is a must read for anyone that has ever pondered the wonderful little machines that are now so important to our lives.  I can't help to lament that my father wasn't around to witness all these wonders, and to read this book.<br /><br />Kudos to the author for telling it like it is in regards to Steve (and all the others for that matter) and for him, or his family for not censoring the sometimes brutal portrayal of such a brilliant man.  It is seeing these characteristics, and of those around him that gave me a better understanding of the genius and why we now have the computing capability and products that we do.  Great minds are different, just like the ad campaign suggested.  Different and courageous!<br /><br />I started out with an iPod, then and iPad, next an iPhone4S and finally a MacPro with retina display......I finally got &#34;it&#34;  and began to make the change after the iPad (going on 2 years).  The products are brilliant in their simplicity.<br /><br />Now back to the book.......
B008K6HN8I|3.0|This was recommended to help install the Dolphin browser and Flash player so I could watch movies on my Kindle.  I downloaded it and used it so I guess it works fine.  Not sure what else I'll use it for but it's great to be able to watch YouTube and network TV shows on my Kindle now.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I really like this case.  It's very sturdy and the ability to rotate the Kindle to reach the charging port is a HUGE plus!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|game is fun but after a while it freezes and wont let me play anymore other wise game is fun to play
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Could never have been him at the end,  lame at best. Too bad they could not have made the story work without cheating.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|its really nice, no complicated downloads, its for free and you can search for and watch your favorite types of music videos over and over again.
B00BG0RSJ4|4.0|I got this for my Grandson for his Birthday. He really likes it, as do I!  My favorite sceen is when the seagulls are all saying &#34;MINE-MINE-MINE !!!&#34;
0007520506|5.0|A work of deep beauty. I actually called my friends and read sections to them so that they could experience the wisdom.
0743243153|5.0|I have lost track of how many people I have suggested this book to. A must read for anyone who can read and has any level of reading comprehension skills. A personal reference book for life!
B00DBISUWS|5.0|So glad to see them revisit some of their early cinematic textures... This is a beautiful album to soundtrack a rising sun with your loved one.. Magical, ethereal and tinged with an unmistakable melancholy.. Ahh...lovely...
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Worth every penny to rent!  Leo was masterful in this rendition of a timeless classic - worth buying even! Rent it!

B009XIXVU6|4.0|A story that many of us know-of children given up by their parents in hope of a better life; of war, of generosity, of callousness among the well-off.  Interesting characters; a good read.

B000IZ7YK6|5.0|I have to watch this movie every couple of years. It is a great way to spend an evening.  Who would have guessed you could make a compelling movie about the role water played in the development of the L. A. basin--- of course the movie is about so much more than that. One of the things I like best is that Jack Nicholson is no superman. Moe often than not when there is a fight he ends up the loser but that never deters him. He engages in the conflict because he is convinced he is in the right. A favorite character in the movie for me is the county coroner. Who ever the actor is he steals the scene.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Being drawn into this book, there are never ending changes that keep your mind whirling, like you are being let into a secret, a level at a time.  Depicting a fairly happy childhood, it slowly traps the main character in a seemingly inescapable web of fear and danger that is hard to determine if it is real or fantasy.  My heart rate went up a couple of times in the book and had to remind myself to breathe.  Aside from the '5star' rating system, I REALLY loved this book.  So much in it - emotion and adventure.
B0017XFBMG|3.0|If you were ever lucky enough to hear The Pogues in concert when Shane MacGowan wasn't thrown off the trans-Atlantic plane before a U.S. tour; and later, you were lucky enough to hear them when he WAS thrown off the plane, you would know this: The Pogues were a remarkably tight band of musicians led by a drunken singer who threw everyone off by his lack of rhythm. Don't get me wrong. I love Shane MacGowan and the spirit of anarchy he brought to the band. The problem with this set is it's virtually all messed-up live and demo performances.<br /><br />If you saw the MacGowan/Pogues trainwreck in concert, you would remember it fondly the rest of your life. I'm just not sure an entire 5 CD box of \\"never released\\" recordings was the best way to go while the original recordings languish in a pre-1990 state of limply-mastered digital versions.<br /><br />As it stands, my best Pogues recordings are on vinyl. That is a fine enough way to listen to them, but I would also like to have selections on my iPod--many selections--whose fidelity to the vinyl recordings is up-to-snuff. As it stands, whenever one of the original CD transfers comes up, I have to adjust the volume level and listen to the worst sort of digital compression.<br /><br />With these complaints noted, there are almost enough tracks to make a worthwhile single CD (I could shred Disc 3 and never feel a pang of remorse). The Radio 4 material is every bit as good as the studio recordings which, after all, were never lacking in rawness: I suspect that MacGowan knew better than to show up at the BBC drunk. Disc 4 starts with live material recorded in Glasgow, and there's something very touching about an entire arena of Scots singing along to the tracks. The three extracts of \\"Fairytale of New York\\" (with Cait O'Riordan taking the original female part of the duet) not only show the development of the song-suite, but also point the way to what might have been--all due respect to Kirsty MacColl. But, really. This is literally a perennial hit for The Pogues to this day: would it have killed Rhino to include at least a complete alternative version of the track?<br /><br />The remaining question is: why not re-release all the albums, singles and EPs in newly-mastered versions? FALL FROM GRACE is not horrible; that's the best I can say about it. But I want to hear the original tracks of \\"Transmetropolitan\\", \\"Down in the Ground Where the Dead Men Go\\", \\"The Body of an American\\" and so many others that have not made it onto remastered \\"Greatest\\" collections. In the original studio versions.<br /><br />After those recordings have been brought up to post-1990 standards of digital mastering, then I will gladly return to this collection. When I'm drunk enough.erally a perennial hit for The Pogues to this day: would it have killed Rhino to include at least a complete alternative version of the track?<br /><br />The remaining question is: why not re-release all the albums, singles and EPs in newly-mastered versions?

1451626096|5.0|I am an ardent student of the Wars of the Roses (a term which is inaccurate for the time, when these interfamilial conflicts were actually called the Cousins' Wars). Phillipa Gregory's series of novels, told in the first person by different characters is historically accurate, and logically thought out in the areas that are still unclear. Gregory writes well, and her characters are three dimensional and believable. I recommend this entire series to anyone interested in the period, for not only a good read, but also for interesting insights into the possible (and often probable) explanations of the psychology of aristocrats of the mid to late fifteenth century.

B00DCRE83S|5.0|The first two songs and 'Above All' make this a must purchase, everything else is just bonus gifts. The entire album is just about perfect in every way. I compare this to a heavy metal Motorhead, Metallica and even ZZ Top mixture with some Prong thrown in. The vocals remind me of Lemmy\Prong for some reason but that's a good thing. Great job by Jason Newsted and the band.

Since the kids are now young adults, I went back and bought all 10 seasons! I've spent last few months watching all the episodes, and just today finished up with season 10. Oh my, what an awesome cast and great story lines! I am now ready for the season 11 premiere in a few weeks and even though I'm sad that Cote dePablo (Ziva David) is leaving the show; I'm excited to see where the series takes us next!
B008Q0D32S|5.0|A remarkable movie that isn't your typical &#34;spaghetti western&#34;. Great actors and a well defined script. The music is definitely of the period when the movie was made but still plausible for todays audience. Sets are on location and no use of GIF.<br />Just a great classic!!!!

I was given this as a gift & I have to say I'll never take a movie from that person ever again.

0399165274|4.0|Some of the comments I have read elsewhere regarding THE KILL LIST have been harsh. Fair enough. If you're expecting that Frederick Forsyth has pulled another THE DAY OF THE JACKAL out of his hat, then you are going to be somewhat disappointed. And yes, the book does have a bit of a problem with pacing. A great deal of it is background information, so much so that at times the story almost gets lost. Still, though, this is a book that you will not regret reading, and the last hundred pages fulfill the promise of the first.<br /><br />The pitch premise of THE KILL LIST could easily be \\"Tom vs. Jerry in the War on Terror.\\" In actuality, it is The Preacher vs. The Tracker. The Preacher is a Muslim terrorist whose Internet broadcasts are aimed squarely at Islamic converts in Western countries. A charismatic speaker with superior persuasive abilities, the Preacher urges his followers to strike randomly against the western \\"Satan\\" by choosing high-profile government targets at all levels --- state, local and federal --- and sacrificing themselves as martyrs. Achieving a great deal of success with this, the Preacher seems virtually unstoppable. His followers choose their own targets and the time and place of their attacks, making proactive response against them nearly impossible. The Preacher makes his broadcasts from an unknown location.<br /><br />What he looks like is a mystery, and he is ultimately placed on the Kill List, a short list of those who are so dangerous to the United States that they have targeted them for elimination by fiat of the President and a very small and select group. The agency that is tasked with hunting down these individuals is the Technical Operations Support Activity, which is known by the boring acronym of TOSA. TOSA's chief hunter is Christopher \\"Kit\\" Carson, an operative known as the Tracker. Carson is a third-generation Marine with multiple skill sets and a superior ability to think on his feet. Already eager to find and terminate the Preacher, Carson finds that his mission has become personal when one of the Preacher's disciples makes Carson's father a collateral target. The problem facing the Tracker, however, is how to find someone whose identity and location is so closely held that almost no one knows who or where he is. The answer, of course, is one step at a time.<br /><br />Utilizing the seemingly unlimited might and majesty of the United States government, the Tracker follows the slimmest of leads from the mountains of Afghanistan to an attic near Washington, D.C., making use of a diverse range of unexpected allies to locate the Preacher and to bring him to a rough but appropriate justice. Even as the Tracker moves toward carrying out his mission, the Preacher continues his attacks by proxy against the West. Racing against time to save an innocent who has fallen into the Preacher's hands, the Tracker pulls out all the stops in order to bring a hostage --- and himself --- back alive.<br /><br />Forsyth places THE KILL LIST very much in the real world, which is a dangerous place indeed. Again, the proceedings may drag a bit, particularly in the middle third of the book, where things almost get bogged down in lengthy (though necessary) explanations. Nevertheless, Forsyth picks up the pace in due course, and by the final hundred pages, readers will find their hearts firmly lodged in their mouths. More than mere entertainment, THE KILL LIST is worth reading as a tribute to those rough men who stand ready in the night while we sleep peacefully.<br /><br />Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub

B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I read one review warning about the Bluray of the show being of very poor picture quality. Mine is terrible. It looks like a bad cellphone recording. I heard the DVD isn't like this so I am gonna try that route.<br /><br />I love the show. The editing is fine. I'd rather see the show as it was performed without the restructuring of editing, but that isn't the way it is done.<br /><br />The sound on my Bluray is also not in complete stereo.<br /><br />I am returning the Bluray and trying the DVD. I think the many positive reviews of the Bluray were written before those folks saw it. It was only released today. They are giving positive reviews to the awesomeness of the show and Madonna. I agree the show is awesome and so is my girl; but this product is a disaster. At least my copy and apparently others.<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/12/13 I have the DVD now. It is of much better picture quality than the Bluray; but it is still not good video. I don't know if it is the way it was filmed or the way they produced the DVDs and Blurays, but video quality is not doing the show any favors. As for the sound, it is not complete stereo. I have awesome equipment and you cannot get loud concert sound out of either the Bluray or DVD. No Bass to be had on my DVD or Bluray.<br /><br />I have sent the Bluray back and received the refund. I'll keep the DVD as it is better than nothing. I'll hope for a better release. With all of the negative feedback who knows what might happen.<br /><br />Now I'll buy the audio CDs and see if they sound right. LMAO Long live the Queen!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I started reading this book after seeing an up and coming movie trailer for it and I love it! It keeps your interest throughout the book by never revealing too much and that is what keeps you reading. I am almost finished with this book and already bought the next book in the series.

B004NOH9LW|4.0|This is an important film that, though initially rather dark, ends in light.  It's not shot like a lot of today's films though it was released in 2010.  It's of a classic cinematic code, which is interesting.  I recommend it.

I have not had any problems out of it and see it close down several programs when I use the boost...although I watch some re-open almost immediately so have to smile on that one. At this point I can't say anything bad about this as it seems to work well but would be reluctant to recommend as I see little change in my Kindle when I use it...probably because I have had it less than 3 weeks.
0385335482|5.0|Becky Bloomwood loves shopping. So much so that she finds herself in financial trouble and her job at Successful Savings magazine can't cover her bills. The VISA statements are piling up and she's in overdraft at the bank. It's time for Becky to get creative. Her hilarious schemes and excuses to the banker will leave you laughing out loud as she tries to maintain her shopping habits while coming up with money saving and money making ideas.<br /><br />Becky is a warm hearted character, who manages to retain her charm even when she's being devious. The novel touches on a lot of aspects of being young, single, and trying to make your own way while quickly discovering that everything is a lot more expensive than anticipated. This is mostly done in a humourous fashion, although Becky finds herself near her breaking point on several occasions. A great read for a rainy weekend, the weekday commute, or anywhere you find yourself needing an escape. Go Becky Go!
0062255657|5.0|My first impression of Neil Gaiman's \\"Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" was that it was disappointingly small. This slim volume looks no bigger than a novella. As an avid Gaiman reader, I am used to his large novels full of intricate and converging plots. \\"Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is not your usual Neil Gaiman novel.<br /><br />This story is fairly simple. It is told only from the limited perspective of the unreliable memories of the narrator. But like most Gaiman novels, there is magic, there is discovery, and there is truth. In fact, this novel feels like Gaiman's most autobiographical, most truth-telling story yet. It is highly melancholy, sometimes strange, and even a little scary.<br /><br />I wanted to give Gaiman a long hug after only the first ten pages of the book. There's a lot to think about in these pages. It's a beautiful novel that I immediately turned back to the first page when I finished reading the last page.
B001IAME78|2.0|The rest of the superhero movies were so interesting... What happened? This movie bordered on boring with a thin storyline. It caters to those looking for a ton of fighting scenes but looses wind on pulling you into the plot. Maybe this is three stars because it wasn't terrible. And those who haven't seen the other Marvel movies may enjoy.
1594204217|4.0|I've read all of Michael Pollan's previous books and have very much enjoyed them. I am a big foodie; I like to cook and experiment in the kitchen with fermentation, brewing, baking, etc. This book, \\"Cooked,\\" is right up my alley.<br /><br />\\"Cooked\\" is divided into sections based on the four elements: fire, water, air and earth. In the Fire section, Pollan delves into the mysteries of real pit barbeque. He studies what makes barbeque delicious and how to do the perfect whole pig roast.<br /><br />In the Water section he studies braises and \\"one pot\\" cooking. Pollan discusses the similarities between the world's great cuisines and the universal basics of the \\"onion and garlic\\" recipe base. This section also gets into the science of what happens in a pot between the meat and cooking liquids.<br /><br />The Air section was on baking. This section was the most interesting to me, because I am not an experienced baker. One of the shocking things revealed in this book is the genetic modification and selection of grains and the perils of flour processing. I had no idea that when I was buying \\"whole wheat\\" flour, it was nothing of the kind! This section actually changed my life. I have researched and discovered a great, organic, non-GMO, stone ground whole wheat flour mill. I now order this four by the 25 lb. bag and make loves of delicious whole wheat sour dough bread ever week.<br /><br />The last section was on earth and discussed fermentation and brewing because these arts are 100% dependent on the microbes that inhabit the earth. I am what Pollan refers to as a \\"fermento\\". I have taken classes on fermentation, studied Sandor Katz's books, and always have something percolating on my kitchen counter. So, much of this section was old news to me, but definitely would be interesting and useful to someone interested in making their own lacto-fermented pickles or sauerkraut. He also experiments with making his own beer, but since I brew my own beer, cider and mead, this was really just an overview of things I already knew.<br /><br />To conclude, \\"Cooked\\" was a very enjoyable romp through homemade food. Pollan writes personably and you feel as if you are on the odyssey with him. Even if you are pretty accomplished in the kitchen, this book is sure to open you up to a few new ideas and challenges. So get \\"Cooked\\" and get in the kitchen!ally just an overview of things I already knew.<br /><br />To conclude, \\"Cooked\\" was a very enjoyable romp through homemade food.

1400069807|4.0|\\"Salt Sugar Fat\\" has ruined grocery shopping for me. I've never been a fan of highly processed foods. I am not one to throw Kraft Cheesy Skillets, or Lunchables into my grocery cart. I know that processed foods are bad for you and full of empty calories. But this book took that point of view and radically expanded it.<br /><br />So much of what we think of as \\"food\\" contains little to no actual food! And it is a worse problem than just obesity. These \\"foods\\" contribute to high blood pressure, organ failure, heart failure, altered taste buds, and even cancer! Manufacturers of these products know their dangers and don't eat them. I wouldn't eat a meal at a fancy restaurant that the chef wouldn't touch, so why would I eat a meal in a box that the CEO of Kraft wouldn't touch?<br /><br />\\"Salt Sugar Fat\\" is broken up into three sections that address each ingredient's role in processed foods. First is Sugar, and this section is a real eye opener. We all know about the sugars involved in sodas, but what was really frightening to me was the secret sugars that are added into all manner of foods in order to mask other chemical \\"off\\" flavors. This is the section that first introduces the concept of the \\"Bliss Point\\". According to Moss' research, people's bliss points for sugar are higher and higher due to early exposure to high sugar foods in infancy. If you grew up drinking soda and other sweet drinks, you are doomed to crave higher and higher sugar contents in your foods for the rest of your life.<br /><br />The Salt section has similar information to the sugar section. People are developing higher and higher tolerances to salts in their foods. Even children, who normally don't like a lot of salt, are being trained by processed foods to crave it. Again, salt is added to EVERYTHING. It provides better mouth feel for a lot of products, preserves products, and masks metallic and other off flavors.<br /><br />I was ready to be hit hard by the fat section, and I was not let down. Fats are not going away from processed foods. Fat is essential to their success. Moss' research shows that when salt and sugar are combined with fats, our brains/bodies do not identify how much fat we are ingesting. Basically, the key components of processed foods work together to turn off our natural satiety. That's terrible news for the consumer, but great news for processed food manufacturers.<br /><br />Don't read this book if you aren't prepared to go to the grocery store armed with your new found information on processed food. You will be checking the labels on everything and evaluating and translating the information therein. Nothing is as it first appears. \\"Low Fat\\" or \\"Diet\\" varieties often harbor secret stashes of extra salt or sugar that keep the calories ridiculously high. But if you are ready for some hard truths that might just save your life, get this book today.Fats are not going away from processed foods. Fat is essential to their success.

B000SEFNMS|5.0|Having been in Denali National Park a few months ago, this book was extremely vivid to me. We were on an organized group bus tour about 100 miles into the heart of<br />Denali where we saw  hikers trudging along with their large backpacks. One particular hiker I will always remember was a young woman, alone, hiking on a path less than a mile from where we had seen a female grizzly with two cubs. I have often wondered what became of that solitary woman hiker...did she survive, did she encounter the grizzly female or did she vanish into the wilderness!  I love animals and nature, but I also realize that entering a wilderness as a hiker would be a risk I would not be willing to take.

I look forward to Star Wars 2 featuring the angry birds and bad piggies. My son and I play the same boards together to see who can make the biggest mess! Keep up the great work!!!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Too many adds to go through to hear the weather. I understand the concept of ads to provide a free service but this goes over board and its hard to close them all out to get what I want to know about the weather.

B007XKEY6Q|3.0|The 3 star words are not always in the English dictionary. They must be foreign words in another language. I thought I was downloading the English version.

B00EY8BRGU|1.0|The movie is a complete bore with a simple plot that leaves the viewer wishing there were really a plot.  Don't waste a nickel on this one.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|One of the best Star Trek movies made. The writing was fun, the suspense was fun, and the action was fun.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are great, the story is awesome, and the multiplayer is super advanced and THE BEST MULTIPLAYER game I have ever played. I cant wait for #5 th come out!
B00A2H9PLG|2.0|Despite what I had heard about it being a flop, I decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />I watched this in the theater and while everyone was rolling in the aisles laughing at every little thing, most of the time I was extremely bored. The action was passable but nothing more. The political overtones were ridiculous. A bunch of it was just blown over the top. I'm not a fan of racist Jamie Foxx, although, granted, he did a passable Obama-esque president.<br /><br />The only redeeming qualities of the movie was James Woods and that the movie was not made to be taken seriously.
B009K0P10K|5.0|One of the best shows I've watched!! Absolutely love it I can't wait for the next season to start. My family and I are all hooked :-)
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|What a great story of such a integral part of our musical culture. I never knew Sound City existed let alone so many top start of today and past years recorded their music there. You will be glued to the screen every second of this movie! I cannot recommend this movie enough!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Couldn't get it to START setup. Coordinated with Chromecast tech support and after several tries to get setup to initiate, the technician said the Chromecast was designed to be used with TV's newer than 3 years old. Mine's 5. So I'm sending it back. This should be included in the description. I gave it three stars because I don't think it's right to give it less than that because my tv is technically not capatable. I'm sure it's a good product.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|Nice read carries some current events with it also. Paced well, his relationship building was not as believable, not his strong suit although the story line was good.
B00ADMYN9E|1.0|Corso has tried to link his story with 20th Century developments suggesting they all came from the 1947 crash.<br /><br />For a start fibre optics were around long before 1947<br /><br />Most of his chapters seem to be taken from previous reports, many of them fiction<br /><br />The most obvious &#34;proof&#34; of an alien vehicle would be the &#34;memory&#34; metal to which many people have testified, and which certainly would have been in an filing cabinet full of spacecraft samples.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I tried using my preloaded office app on kindle hd but I found out it was only meant to view documents not work on them. This app can do it all create new presentations word docs or excel. Perfect!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Others love his style or writing, but while I do find it occassionaly interesting, the author seems to be more interested in showing off his style than telling a story.  There is even a tendency to repeat the same description of the mother figure with virtually identical words again and again and again.  But you can't get away from the fact that it is a good story and told in an interesting fashion.  But like the Sportscaster (Was that the title?, I couldn't get myself to finish that one.) it really drags.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|It's an entertaining game. Nice graphics. The story is ok...a little hokey but doesn't detract from the game. The hints are ok and aren't intrusive. I like it.

1589946006|5.0|These things are just rad.  I don't even play Arkham Horror, I just keep these little guys in my dice bag and pull them out before I start each of my RPG game sessions, setting them around the table in various spots, both the big ones and the smaller ones being perfect to squeeze into odd corners and weird spots around the table.<br /><br />It adds a nice little bit of flavor to my games.  Whether it's my Call of Cthulhu game, where I just set them around the table in odd places for flavor, reminding the players of the kinds of things that are always watching them from the shadows and in odd corners, or during my heavily Lovecraftian, Mythos-based Pathfinder campaign, where I set them around the edges of my Chessex grid-mat, letting the players know just exactly what forces are lurking, watching, and waiting just beyond the edge of their vision (and the edge of their lives.)  Letting them know what is in store for them in the future if they probe too deeply into Things Man Was Not Meant To Know (which, of course, being good, curious, risk-taking adventurers, they will do anyway.  And once they get high enough level, the real fun will start... :)<br /><br />I just wish I could find some Mi-Go, Shoggoths, or Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath to use the same way!
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|This is a great Blue transfer, most legacy shows little improvement. In addition the interviews are updated with the original cast
B000URDEB0|4.0|The beginning of this record rocks.  All the songs are really good.  Each track gets progressively better.  Amaranth is really good, catchy.  The kind of song that you can't get out of your head after the record finishes.  For the Heart I Once Had has a pop/rock sound and feel to it that break away from the hard driving songs that precede it.  That's not to say that it is bad, just that it doesn't exactly fit here.  That also goes for The Islander.  It has a traditional Scottish sound to it.  And just a touch 60s.  The story is cool. Musically, it sounds good.  It just doesn't fit here.  It seems to end the way it began, however.  Rockin hard with good story songs.<br />8/10
1476734941|4.0|I tried this diet, have been on it for about 6 weeks and have lost 10 pounds.  I have never been successful with diets in the past because they involve restricting your calorie intake every day.  With this diet, you only restrict your food intake 2 days out of the week and can eat whatever you want the other 5 days.  I can do 2 days a week and I find myself eating less on the other 5 days anyway because I feel full faster now.  It is relatively easy for me to follow the diet, although I will say the very first fast day was extremely difficult for me, I was hungry the whole time.  Now, I am usually not too hungry and even have energy to exercise on my fast days.  I found out about the diet from a coworker and started it without the book and then decided to buy the book.  It is not necessary to buy the book but I was interested in reading about the other aspects of the diet besides weight loss.  I liked the book, it is a quick read, had interesting info and was inexpensive.  I plan on following this diet the rest of my life.  I have not weighed what I weigh now in many, many years.
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|If you are looking for great acting, this is probably not the show for you.  If you want non-stop action, give it a look.  They may be some of the older action stars, but they are still the best in the biz.  Very entertaining from beginning to end.
B00899DR40|5.0|Loving post-voice-change Bieber! Its nice to hear something that doesn't sound completely retarded. Reminds me of the R&B from the 90s.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Starz hit a homerun with the Spartacus series.  Very sad when Andy Whitfield passed, but Liam McIntyre did an exceptional job while taking over.  This series is beyond graphic, but seems to be a very realistic portrayal of those times.  If you liked the movie 300, you should love this series!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like it I wound recommend it to anyone that like hidden object games. this game keeps you on your toes.

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I have been with Trent from the beginning.  I first saw him in a small industrial nightclub in Pittsburgh with the release of Pretty Hate Machine. Then onto arenas and festivals.  In 1995 I saw him share the stage and the evening with the incomparable David Bowie.  The Fragile is the only album that could lull my daughter to sleep.  I was at the show where he announced that he was leaving NIN behind him, and although I was sad, I respected his integrity.  Knowing when to quit is a quality that few possess and in a lifestyle of fame and excess, it must be next to impossible to execute.<br /><br />Marriage, children, a fascinating side project, an Oscar...Reznor's post NIN life seemed brimming with promise and I couldn't wait to see what else he could do.<br /><br />And then the announcement came...NIN was returning with new music and a world tour!?!  I felt such disappointment.  What happened to moving on?  Was it all an act so that Trent could message his ego with a big farewell tour and a \\"triumphant\\" return?  Where was the grace and dignity of \\"moving on?\\"<br />I was clinging to the hope that this artist that I grew with and admired had not manipulated millions.  That he just couldn't stay away.  That NIN had more to say.  I refused to listen to any tracks upon their release.  A NIN album is ALWAYS more than one song.  It is a body of work.  A mood.  A piece of time fossilized in the darkest amber.  It feels new and old all at once.  The understanding of a hidden thought.  An unnamed emotion.  It's like the moment between being awake and asleep when you aren't quite sure whether you're dreaming.<br /><br />And as I slipped the disk into the dashboard of my car for the first time, I held my breath.  I waited, eyes closed, for the sound.  Was i reunited with my dark ally or a sheep in wolves clothing?<br /><br />And of the album, I almost have no words.  It's all at once sterile and warm.  detached yet deliciously inviting.  There is so much space and yet so much ishappening...moving.  Like a thousand metallic centipedes crawling through the circuitry.  A voice that was once raw and assaultive, now almost humbled, inviting.  He still carries the darkness, But Reznor is a father now, and it has illuminated a new part of him.  A new language to express feelings that he never though he deserved to have.<br /><br />Two men whose journeys took them far away from one another.  Upon reuniting they realize they have returned changed.  Textured by life.  Gentler in some ways.  More powerful in others.<br /><br />This is a special work of art from a true artist.<br /><br />Thank you for returning.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|This is nothing more then a fixed up remake of Star Trek 2. The WRATH OF KHAN. Great action. But still a remake.With a few things changed. But still in the end.  Just one more fixed up remake.<br />Again they can't do anything new!  Sad!
B00EA5HEM8|5.0|Loved this story!  Parents, students, and teachers all need this kind of encouraging story to help stay inspired.  Simple, loving, and adventurous.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I decided to try this app for my sons, but ended up getting hooked on it myself. The graphics are great, and the game play is very challenging, even as an adult. This game is great!!! For a free app, I would definitely recommend trying it.

B001ET0826|5.0|Excellent album, interesting concept and Prince at his finest make a classic, any prince fan should pick this one up!
B00F35BV64|3.0|Well it has all the action and the dialog we would expect from a Star Trek movie. However they revised Star Trek History in this one. All fans know what happened to Chris Pike and Kane,so why revise history into something it was not. They should have come up with a new story line. There's plenty of history that we know nothing about to create. It's a good movie on it's own, but as a fan of Star Trek I'm disappointed they tampered with the old story line.
B007RTAR64|5.0|She is a very pretty doll and I really like her. Wish I could find the other dolls from the games. My grand-children will enjoy her as a collectable. High recommend her.

B009UNGYHG|5.0|Looks nice and works even better.  I've used a similar charging system by the same company and they are a must to have.  I hate carrying around backup charging systems because they are a bit heavy and eventually I need to charge them so why not use something slimmer and better to look at.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I am only giving this game four stars because of the fact that they do not give more time to solve puzzles.
B00CUKTGJO|5.0|The tracks, remastered by Mick Jones and a guy whose name escapes me for the moment, are brilliantly done.  There are things in the song that haven't been heard on CD (and possibly not ever) before - literally.  According to Jones, the old playback heads were actually too small to pick up the entire tape when they were transferred.  This is particularly noticeable on songs from Sandinista and Combat Rock where you can here guitar parts that you never heard before.  This collection takes the newly remastered tracks from all 5 proper Clash albums and presents them in a way that highlights the breadth and depth of their stylistic range.  The ordering of the tracks is extremely well thought-out instead of the standard chronological presentation.  There is an ebb and flow to the presentation that most \\"best of\\" collections lack.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This charger has a cord that makes sense! Unless you are charging from your computer, you need something that will stretch to your chair from the nearest wall socket. This does exactly that. It also fits tight into the phone and kindle. That's what I have but I'm sure there are other products that use this same charger. I hate a sloppy fit that you have to wiggle around to get a connection. It charges my kindle fast even while I'm using it. This is why I am buying another one so I can have one in my car too. Yes, it actually stretches from the charger (which is down low in my van) to my ear!
0316069906|5.0|I was lent this book after I became vegetarian and it was truly an eye opening read. As a constant skeptic when learning new things the citations to scholarly journals and sources for every fact he used made me trust him as an author. This book is not in your face, but informative and allows you to make your own conclusions. For me it provided me the clarity in my decisions and reinforced what I already vaguely knew about the food industry. Definitely a great first read for someone wanting to know more about where their meat comes from.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|This move has jumped the shark. The books and the first 2 movies are pretty good. Without Matt Damon, they had to stretch the plot and it didn't work. I could not follow anything in the movie. The action was weak and the story was boring and unbelievable. I hope they stop with this one, it was bad.
B008FTAAG2|1.0|The album did not download properly after multiple tries, only contained a few of the songs on the track list<br />I want my money back
B00EU9BSNU|5.0|I am major F1 fan, particularly in the 80s.  When I heard Ron Howard was on board to direct a film using and racing authentic F1 cars from 1976 (Year I was born)and consult , I mean really consult and research with guys from the era I was hooked and have been following production on the film for about two years.<br /><br />I was one of many who knew of the talent of Niki Lauda and was introduced to James Hunt as a commentator for the BBC on F1 so this movie is special to me on so many levels.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months and I find out one of music heroes Hans Zimmer is doing the score, and you can be sure you wont be disappointed.  Like the making of the film Ron didn't skip on the score.  He surrounds himself with the best people.<br /><br />Hans captures the era perfectly and also the aspect of driving with these tracks.  So far my favorite is 'Oysters in the Pits'  I only wish it was a little longer.  The ambient guitars, heavy bass and rock guitars and drums really are something to savor on this album, and I cannot wait to drive my Porsche 944 with this soundtrack playing. :)<br /><br />You will also notice there are nods to the signatures of 'Mombasa' from Han's brilliant 'Inception' score.<br /><br />Overall a brilliant work of music that I truly recommend.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|I didn't care for the newer style music that was played in the movie.  It should have been music from the period.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This is a series missed by many fans!! Wish there were more out-takes and cast contributions.  An outstanding series, enjoy having the video to play the episodes.  Excellent cast and series.  Ras

1476715904|4.0|Mini Review<br /><br />Slammed was a great introductory book to the series. There's this exciting, yet forbidden, relationship that develops between Will and Layken that has you flipping through the pages with anticipation - wondering what they'll do next. (And hoping that it's every bit of forbidden that you could imagine ;-)). You're also introduced to the concept of slam poetry, which is what the characters connect over; the art of words. I've kind of heard of slam poetry before, but I've never experienced it any way. Colleen has a beautiful writing technique that is full of emotion and hits on various aspects of life that we can all relate too. Overall, it's a beautiful contemporary romance full of \\"head versus heart\\".<br /><br />Writing quality: ***** (Book 1, 2) and **** (Book 3)<br />Character development: *****<br />Plot progression: ****<br />Romance: Great character tension, no explicit scenes

B00CUKTGJO|5.0|I definitely liked this CD with the remastered songs.  The music sounds sharp and clear.  Strummer's voice comes alive (no pun intended) in the songs and really provides a lot of deep emotion.  You will definitely want to listen to this on a great sound system in order to enjoy the clarity of the remastered songs.  Crank up the volume and lose yourself in the only band that matters.<br /><br />Most serious Clash fans will have all these songs on many different discs already.  My Clash collection was incomplete because I never spent much money on collecting music and some of the ones I did have I have lost through the years or they became damaged.  This is a great CD to start building up my Clash collection again.  If you aren't sure about The Clash get this CD to try them out, well worth the money.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is good. It is not as robust as the desktop version. For example we cannot video chat with this app. There is also no ability to edit our comments after posting.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|It seemed like Hosseini needed some better transitions, as the story moves back and forth in time and lost me a couple of times.  In the end, I decided I understood his message and was glad I'd read it.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|For this and other reviews please visit Zemfirka Blogs... [[...]<br /><br />Okay... finally done! It was a bit of a struggle, but I've done it. I practically had to force myself through the first half, and then read the second half in one sitting. Go figure. All in all though, I feel disappointed, underwhelmed and annoyed. I had such high hopes and expectations, since everyone talked about The Mortal Instruments so highly, that I expected to enjoy it immensely and what I've found did not impress. Don't take it to heart dear friends, if you don't agree with my opinion - I still love and value you and your recommendations, but this book was not for me. And, let me tell you why... [For those, unfamiliar with the novel, beware: mild spoilers ahead!]<br /><br />Clary is the 15-year old, girl next door, daughter of a single mother, and is about to have her life turned upside-down, when her mom goes missing under mysterious circumstances. What's a girl to do, but suddenly discover a Shadow World full of magical beings, secret societies, and angels. Oh, and by the way - she is \\"like\\" the best thing that happened to this magical Shadow World. She is the new it girl and all the boys want to be \\"friends\\" with her, and girls most obviously cannot handle it - they are jealous. [ I'm huffing and puffing just writing this!]<br /><br />Enter, Jace. The most popular shadowhunter on the block, who has an eye for Clary. Jace is seventeen; he is a total heartthrob, obnoxious, know-it-all, and a professional demon hunter. Things like eBay or Dungeons & Dragons are not in his vocabulary, and his childhood was not all bright and sunny. No matter, he is good at killing demons, and making snarky remarks about his ability to score with girls. So obviously, the two, set out to \\"save the day\\", by helping free Clary's mom, catch the bad guy, aptly named Valentine, and find mysterious object that helps turn humans into shadowhunters.<br /><br />I don't know where Ms. Clare has observed teenagersacting as such, but for my personal sake I'd say teenagers are not like that, especially not at fifteen. I'll try not to judge too harshly, but I just can't imagine leather-clad, 15-year olds running around clubs, talking about their \\"adult-like\\" experiences as if it wasn't a big deal. I'll even forgive the almost adult-free world they seem to live in, as many YA novels take similar approach; still, neither Clary nor Jace had any redeeming or likable qualities. I simply didn't care for them and that's what made this a hard read for me.<br /><br />Other than that, Clary had a total Mary Sue syndrome going on, she kept going from totally shocked, to totally cool-with-it in a matter of sentences. Besides, she was no help whatsoever in most scenes, and simply froze, contemplating random things, while waiting to be miraculously rescued by Jace or Simon. Luke Garroway and Magnus Bane perhaps left more of a positive impression, unlike the Lightwood siblings. As for the main villain, Valentine, he was not villainous enough. And the whole Star Wars-like revelation scene made me almost throw this book away [which, luckily I didn't, since it was borrowed from the library].<br /><br />In Conclusion:<br />I've read quite a few reviews since I've finished City of Bones myself, and it seems this novel fits into love it or hate it category. From extremely adoring reviews, to highly disappointing ones, this book is clearly not for everyone. If you read the many reviews posted throughout the web, quite a few of them note the plagiarism rumors surrounding Ms. Clare's writing, which seem to be unsubstantiated judging on the publication of these books. As many other readers I can certainly make connections and find similarities to few other novels and series here, whether it should be considered plagiarism or not is not up to me, and I have not considered it in my review or reading of the novel. As for you, my friends, try it if you will, you can't judge something until you do, and perhaps this will be more your cup of tea than mine.<br /><br />Happy reading!
B008JFUO4U|2.0|Many recent blue-ray movies no longer have a time icon letting you know that the movie is loaded. This is one.  I waited 3-4 minutes and the movie didn't start.  I assumed that something was wrong with the media.  The next movie did the same thing.  You will really need patience with this movie. I had the same result on two different Blu-ray players.

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I was expecting a disk similar in quality to the first one. What I got was Dolby Digital 5.1 not DD True HD. The audio track drops out in several places. The quality of this disk has detracted from a very good story in the Star Trek series.<br /><br />This will probably be the very last disk that I will purchase.<br /><br />Nothing takes me out of a move like a bad soundtrack.
B001QMCJ1Y|1.0|two times I RECIEVED THIS BLURAY DISK AND THEY WOULD NOT PLAY  I AM DONE !!!!!!!!! WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY I ALSO BOUGHT PRACTICAL MAGIC AND I LOVE IT
0321934946|5.0|This is a wonderful little photography book for beginners and intermediates. I now take it with me on every expedition (this edition is small enough to keep in a standard Canon bag). I can't help but compare it to the textbook Harry Potter finds in the sixth book with all sorts of tips and tricks that go beyond the conventional knowledge. I really highly recommend it.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Let's face it, those of us who love Dylan defend Self Portrait but who actually listens too it? . What these out takes make clear is that Dylan never intended to make a lousy record, but rather tried to alienate his fan base and at the same time reach a new one. There are plenty of gems here, and Dylan is really trying, but he is lost, out of touch with his muse. The Isle of Wight concert is a blast, and as the set list goes on Dylan loses more and more of his country croon. Lucky for us, he can't even keep up the charade for one show. Al Kooper was reportedly quite frustrated that Dylan rejected his mixes for New Morning. Sorry Al, Bob was right.
0545128285|5.0|Gotta say, I wouldn't mind raising my kids on some of these stories in lieu of the classic stories or in addition to.  Some are just pure magical, some teach valuable lessons and most don't give an individual a false idea of how life is and how it will turn out.  It is just very realistic (besides the magical parts of course).  JK really is a great author.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I love the price (only $35!), but early reports/articles said this would be AirPlay compatible, which it most definitely is not.  I see now the description is much clearer about what is supported and what is not.  The $99 AppleTV is far more useful with IOS devices (obviously what I have).<br /><br />I really hope this product takes off and Android users get something that is more equivalent to the AppleTV.  It is definitely a really good start.  I would *LOVE* if this actually had AirPlay support so I could give presentations off my iPad wirelessly.  There's always the hope for a firmware update. ;-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is absolutely addicting! You will find yourself trying to top you high score every time. I recommend this game to anyone from child to adult. If you've seen the movies or not you'll not only enjoy it but will have to peel yourself away from it.
B00D6M86RS|4.0|Wish it would have been more comic book and less movie but still a fun game .<br /><br />A little more variety would have been nice.
B0033H7VI6|1.0|I purchased this knife after hearing about from the youtube channel \\"ultimatesurvivaltips\\" it was bigger than i expected but that just makes it all the better! so far it has tackled anything I've thrown at it, like cutting tree limbs an such. The only thing wrong with this knife was that it did not come super sharp... but it was easy to fix that so i didn't take a star off for that, if you want a big knife that you don't to fail... get this knife. Also if you don't like having to fuss over constantly watching for rust, check out the schrade schf10 which is stainless steel.<br /><br />Edit: even with constant everyday oiling i could not keep it from rusting, i have returned it and purchased the schf10.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Cute way to kill time. Some of the controls bug me and the general amount of time you end up having to wait, but overall it's pretty good.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|We live near the Henryville, IN tornado site and attended the Lady A benefit concert they gave for the high school. It was amazing. This album is also amazing, but everything Lady A does is fantastic, so I wasn't surprised!
0312370849|5.0|Although Sarah's Key has its grim moments and not so pretty tale to tell, it does correctly inform us of a time to not be forgotten, and does so in a memorable way. Through flawed characters with all the angsts thereof, both then and now, it unweaves a very human struggle on a very personal level. Our heroine may be a victim of her own doing in some ways regarding her marriage, but she is a heroine of the best sort when sorting out what matters from the past, and its untold secrets. I could not put the book down, and it will stay with me always. These last two facts are what, for me, constitute a great read.  ~author of Benjamin@ [[ASIN:0988904993 Benjamin]]
B006BFK5DK|2.0|I would not buy this CD.  I love EWF and this is definitely not their best.  I owned all the old Cd's and still continued to play them today.  Maybe it is because the lead singer is no longer with the group at no fault of his own --Verdine's White brother. Continued good luck and success to the most wonderful band group in the world.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Love being able to download it to my ipad.  I can read in bed at night without disturbing my husband.  It's typical Harry Bosch.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying this CD.  Another purchase made after seeing the play &#34;One Night with Janis Joplin&#34; at Arena Stage in Washington, DC.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it! It's very easy to use and convenient. Best of all, it's free! I recommend  Calculator Plus for people of all ages.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I really enjoyed the last Star Trek with Chris Pine as Captain Krik and felt the flashback to an earlier point in time worked. With this latest production of Star Trek I have mixed reviews. The special effects are well done and the returning characters are all great as expected, but there was a lack of plot development. I am really tired of action movies trying to feel like a first person shooter video game. And that's what I felt like, that I was inside a video game and I did't have a controller. I like special effects as much as the next person, but that is not enough to hold my attention. I want to hear a story. You can only watch so many space ships explode and men flying through space until it become predictable - nothing special anymore. Star Trek Into Darkness touched on a backstory, but it never took the time to really develop the the plot. I want to use my brain and not just watch action sequences.  If I had it to do over again, I would wait and rent the DVD from Netflix and save my money because I don't think I will watch the movie more than once.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|There are so many of these clock apps that it is difficult to use for us that are 60 years and up. This one is just right. Thank you for making this possible.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Just the best overall features offered by any video monitor. 3G connectivity is awesome for a working Dad who just wants to check in on a sleeping baby back home.<br /><br />Customer service is excellent via twitter.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like games that make you look and  a lot of fun wish that you could change the back ground, or style of the tiles
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The story moved briskly, but I felt the conclusion was a little limp, for all the intrigue that built to it.  Overall-enjoyable, just not great.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great Show! Very entertaining. Keeps you wanting to see the next episodes & not miss any. Each season gets better
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Season 6 DVD Set came today by the big brown truck. Watched several episodes of disk one. This is my favorite show. Ready for Season 7 to began.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|OMG!!! I saaw the movie & Knew i Had to have it! Kevin & Whitney have that Chemistry that just Jumps Off the Screen!!!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I really like this type of game!! They are fun and challenging. The screenshots are exactly the way they look.
B000002VMD|5.0|Whitney  is Riveting. Outstanding Incredible and Real!!! Her Voice & the way she hits Those Notes Is Just Plain Awesome!!!
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Despite the great cast, this story was a little hard to get into.  I ended up pausing it and never returned to watch it.
140006922X|5.0|An exhaustive look into the life and times of Jesus. Interesting historical perspectives shed light on the gospels and the disciples.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a seeker of truth.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|The movie itself is awesome. That being said, trying to use the ultra violet digital copy is a pain. It's not like most other movies where you just type in the code and it downloads. First you need the flixter app, then flixter on your computer, then an ultra violet account, then redeem/download the movie, then download it to your iphone, ipad, or whatever. It's like they deliberately chose the most confusing, arduous process ever to be able to watch this movie on your phone. And it's NOT COMPATIBLE WITH iTUNES!
B000J103OI|5.0|my granddaughter loves this movie and i was very, very lucky to get it at the price that i did
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Dredd is such a welcome surprise. This is a return to form for the sci-fi action film. It's simple, straightforward, and it relies on strong characters and writing rather than big set pieces and special effects. This is an 80s action film through and through--equal parts Die Hard and Aliens.<br /><br />If you're even remotely interested in sci-fi as a genre, Dredd is a must see.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I went from reading the first book through the whole three because I couldn't wait to see the movie and stop. Just 20-30 minutes a day turned into a week and a half of reading on all my free time to know what would happen next! All 3 books are great even after I saw the movie,  \\"The Hunger Games,\\" first and I did not know when movie number 2 would take is place so I could watch it in the theater. So, I did what any addicted story fanatic would do...I saw the trilogy in book form & bought it & read it from page 1 of the first book till the last page of the 3rd book! FANTASTIC!!!! 5 Stars!!!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have now read all three books. Stieglitz Larsson was a great storyteller. What a loss to realize that there will be no more Larsson books.
B00E6887H0|4.0|It seemed like Ry Cooder took a break for a while, eschewing LPs featuring his vocals for session work, short-term band membership (Little Village anyone?), production jobs (Buena Vista Social Club must have bought him several new houses by now), and soundtrack work. Nothing wrong with that -- he's always been a multifaceted dude, and I could see how making song-driven albums in the '90s wouldn't really be rewarding for him in the same way that it was in the prior decades.<br /><br />When he re-emerged with \\"Chavez Ravine\\" in 2005, I was thrilled...and since then, he's produced a very winning streak of albums diminished only slightly by a descent into rather pedantic political punditry. (I should make mention that I tended to agree with his politics, but found his unrelenting carping rather exhausting.) The past near-decade has been a purple patch for Ry, and a live album seems a great way to summarize the way his music has grown and changed over the years since he came back to us as a frontman, vocalist, and bandleader.<br /><br />And boy, does it ever. This is a fine slab o'something, with a nearly perfect mix of ragged and right.<br /><br />It's hard not to make note of the fact that this was recorded at the same venue (San Francisco's Great American Music Hall) as his 1977 live record \\"Showtime,\\" and with two of the same musicians in the group (accordionist Flaco Jimenez and vocalist Terry Evans). I gotta say that Flaco is dazzling here, offsetting more straightforward conjunto/polka stylings with some dizzying chromatic and syncopated lines that I just didn't expect from him. In addition to Evans, Cooder's other longtime backing vocalist Bobby King is replaced here by L.A. session star Arnold McCuller (Lyle Lovett, James Taylor, etc.), and the rhythm section contains Robert Francis on bass and Cooder's son Joachim on drums. The younger Cooder has turned into an impressive musician, with a good bit of Jim Keltner in his feel, but with a lighter touch. Also on hand is a large brass and percussion ensemble, whose members augment the tunes throughout the night -- sometimes just a man or two, sometimes the whole dang crew.<br /><br />And at the center is Cooder. I know his guitar is really the main event, but it has to be said that his voice has finally arrived: It's got a crack and rasp to it that I can tell he's wanted for a long time, and it makes for a commanding, engaging presence. The years have put a nice dab of soul onto it, and he pushes his range and his phrasing to great effect here...and the guitar...Cooder still is capable of those soaring, silvery slide leads, but his touch and conception of the instrument has grown so much. His awareness of overtones -- accented by a healthy heaping of distortion where necessary -- is incredibly impressive. His sliding pinch harmonics on \\"Vigilante Man\\" are stunning, and throughout he's playing with just so much feel and groove. Single note and harmonized licks are countered by nice slabs of distorted chords. Heck, his second solo on \\"Crazy 'bout an Automobile\\" is basically a big-band style shout chorus and all the more exciting for it.<br /><br />The material is varied...nothing from \\"Chavez Ravine,\\" but some old catalog favorites (including two revisited from \\"Showtime\\") and one of his protest numbers delivered to great effect (I like his political tunes, but whole albums of them wore on me a bit).<br /><br />I've blathered on enough. This is well worth your time -- a handy summary of an inventive, charismatic musician who is still finding new things to say. The live sound is great -- not too clean. The only detraction is a rather sycophantic audience, who seem to be brown-nosing Ry most of the night in a very vocal manner...like they are trying to convince themselves, their girlfriends, their comic book shop owners, etc. how cool they are. Just sit down, shut up, and let the great man do his thing.
B009NNMBCA|5.0|I'm QUITE a bit older than the average fan, but thanks to having 2 younger daughters, i have become a HUGE fan of these boys! This movie is an awesome insight into the lives of these young men. It shows you the fun times, and the times when they are just openly and honestly still kids who miss their mums and dads and would love nothing more, some days, than to just be able to walk down the street without getting mobbed. But, accepting their place in the world and loving every minute, they pull it off with grace. They prove to be very humble, down to earth young men from solid working class families, who have worked SO very hard to get where they are. In the realm of boybands, the life expectancy of a group isn't very long. But i'd like to see these fellas stay together for a long time and keep up the amazing work. We love you One Direction!!!!
B005LUJWBM|5.0|Highly reccomended as are all Baldacci books, well constructed plot just enough predictable things to tease but keep the pages turning looking for the final twist.
B00CTT9646|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!<br />I know you want to. I want to too. BUT DON'T BUY IT!<br />Paramount completely missed the mark when they thought it would be a good idea to split up all the special features, created by the filmmakers, FOR US FANS by giving different bonus features to different retailers. So no commentary (even though it exists) on some disks, and limited on the others.  And only a small portion of the other special features.  There are five featurettes on the Target release. The five on the Best Buy version are completely different. So there are actually 10 featurettes altogether, approximately an hour's worth of material, missing from the general release, plus the iTunes-exclusive commentary mentioned. You don't get any of that on this disk!!<br /><br />What does this mean? If you want all the special features created for this release, you have to buy 3 different versions of the blu-ray plus the itunes version (for the director's commentary).<br /><br />Don't let these idiots take advantage of you. While it really sucks to not be able to own this sci-fi gem, or the 3D one I've been waiting to buy, The best way to show these morons what we the fans think of this low-ball cheap idea,  is to not buy this movie.<br /><br />So I've decided to forgo purchasing any version of this release.<br />The Movie:  I really liked this re-boot ST movie more than the first one.  For me, and most Star Trek fans, the real selling point for wanting to purchase the blu-ray were the bonus features (of which there were plenty on the first J.J. Abrams Star Trek film). But given how Paramount has split up the features, no matter which version one buys, we are getting taken advantage of!<br /><br />The fact is, there are several other current and upcoming blu-ray releases that I could purchase instead where I would get more bang for my buck.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun to play for hours can't stop playing. I have played many of the g5 games, and this one  is one of my favorites.
B00CUKTGJO|2.0|The Clash's whole back catalogue is getting remastered and is available in various editions from the ultimate must-have 12 disc \\"Sound System\\" to each album studio album being available on their own as well as that they are also releasing \\"Hits Back\\" which (for the most part) replicates a gig they played in Brixton in the summer of 82.<br /><br />While all these songs are all great it's a pity that it is all studio versions which really means that is just another in an already long list of Clash compilations that most long time Clash fans can easily put together as a playlist themselves as there is nothing here that has not been unavailable before. Of course if they could have found the live recordings that would be a totally different situation as it stands official live albums by The Clash stands at a measly two \\"From Here To Eternity\\" and \\"Live At Shea Stadium\\" so another live album would have been a welcome addition. Yes you do get a copy of the hand written Joe Strummer set list played that night and there is a whole bunch of extra tracks tacked onto the end of disc 2 to round out the set to give you 32 tracks in total.<br /><br />So while the songs themselves are all great and as a long-time fan of The Clash I can appreciate it covers their early days of being a full on punk band to their latter days of experimenting with dance and Rap such as \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" and \\"This Is Radio Clash\\" showing how talented and diverse they had become over a short space of time, this collection is for collectors only.
B00B7I8HZ4|4.0|I just received my unit this afternoon.  I also got a Crucial m4 SSD ([[ASIN:B0082PVK8Q B0082PVK8Q]] to install an XBMC system onto.  I was torn between installing OpenElec, XBMCbuntu, or doing a minimal Ubuntu Server install and installing XBMC from there.  I tried the Ubuntu server first.  It booted from my flash drive and installed just fine.  Then I went to reboot into the new OS on my SSD.<br /><br />No boot media found.<br /><br />I tried a whole gamut of things to try to get it to boot.  I first did a BIOS update.  My unit shipped with a March 2013 version (0040), and (at the time of writing) the most recent version is April 2013 (0042).  I thought, maybe since they released 0042 so soon after 0040, they were patching a serious problem--perhaps the very problem I'm having!  Well, it didn't fix the issue, but at least I ruled it out.<br />I next tried to install OpenElec.  First, I ran the live version to make sure the rest of the system was working.  It booted just fine and streamed some of my LAN NFS content (another note on that... I saw two HDMI sound devices in the XBMC system preferences, and it was the second one that worked, in case you can't get sound over HDMI).  I then rebooted and installed the distro to the SSD, and attempted to boot from the m4.  No boot media found.<br />Note, the system boots just fine to my USB drive every time.  So I go looking online for answers, and I come across a number of people having similar issues.  The most helpful responses come from an Intel rep saying that the issue is caused by unexpectedly high mSATA SSD temperatures.  Basically, their support page says to turn up the \\"minimum duty cycle\\" to 50 or 60 from the default of 40.  Apparently, this is just confusing lingo for \\"fan speed\\" because that's what increases when you raise that number.  I thought maybe my problem was solved, so I once again attempted to load my OpenElec install from the SSD with the new BIOS fan settings.  Success!  But it was short lived.<br/><br />I got my hopes up too quickly, and reinstalled Ubuntu server (13.04 x64, if you care) over the OpenElec install, and rebooted.  No boot media found.  Desperately, I cranked up the fan speed to 90 and then even 100, but to no avail.  At this point, I should mention that the Intel post also mentions that there is a thermal pad kit available to help keep an mSATA SSD cool in one of these NUCs.  You can find the support topic by Googling \\"Intel Thermal Pad Kit\\" (Amazon doesn't like external links).  I just now contacted Intel support requesting one of these kits, and I'll report back on whether or not it stabilizes my system and update my review accordingly.  Right now, it's essentially DOA unless I feel like running a live distro.  While it would be usable, it would be a waste of the SSD I bought.  Also, for those in doubt, I tested my SSD in another computer, and it works just fine.  Also, despite refusing to actually boot to the device, the BIOS does show the SSD as a boot device.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-When/if it boots, it runs OpenElec splendidly.<br />-Gigabit Ethernet and GPU decoding mean even this Celeron system is plenty powerful to handle my heaviest 1080p content.<br />-Solid form factor, easy to open and install parts.<br />-2 DIMM slots for DDR3, apparently up to 16 GB.  I'm using 2x2GB at 1333 MHz.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Apparently, the luck of the draw dictates whether your unit will have trouble booting from the SSD, as other reviews made no mention--though, as stated above, there are other people having this problem and complaining on Intel's forums.<br />-USB 2.0, not 3.0 (though I couldn't care less--my content is streaming over my LAN so I don't care about faster peripherals).<br />-Lacks wall-outlet half of the power cable.  The mickey mouse power cables are common, and it makes sense from the point of view that they want to ship these internationally and not worry about packaging region-specific plugs, so I'm not too miffed.  I had a sparelying around from an old HTPC.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|It was a very long and boring movie. I would not recommend it to anyone! It was nothing like the book and it was filled with inaccuracies.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This was an excellent movie. The plot left you on the edge of your seat and in the end the movie wrapped it up perfectly.  Great showing by all the actors including Woody.  Hope there is a sequal.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Just like playing tabletop Magic.  A LOT of fun!  If you like playing Magic, you will definitely not be disappointed with this game!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Disturbing.  Not as good as the David Baldacci's or Vince Flynn novels I normally read, but a decent diversion.  Kind of sick and twisted...  Not as much depth of character as would have really made me emotionally invested in the heroine as I would have hoped for...
B00E6Z0THE|1.0|Never found a puzzle, hint guide useless, picked up items on the way, never found any place to use items. Total POS.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Love it. one of my favorite movies of 2013.  Bought one for me and one for my nephew to watch.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Great entertainment for any era. These stories are perfectly approachable for the mystery lover as well as history buffs or as just plain enjoyable  short stories. I'm amazed to think of how many people over the last century have enjoyed this collection as much as I have. Masterfully written and worth much more than I paid.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Great video,vivid colors & striking sharpness- good for relaxing - just sit down and let the picture and sound do the rest.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I was not a huge fan of \\"Suck It and See,\\" but AM is consistently good throughout. Of course Alex Turner's lyrics are as clever, detailed, sharp, and cunning as ever. The songs are sexy and intrancing, but are also sensitive with a lot of heart. There's a great mix of wild, \\"get-down\\" songs (Do I Wanna Know?, Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?,and Arabella), as well as tender and sensual numbers (No. 1 Party Anthem, Fireside, and Knee Socks). In short, it's just what you'd expect from the Arctic Monkeys....a good time with a whole lotta soul.

B002PMPTIO|5.0|I like the new cast for this iteration of Star Trek.  I'm not a die hard trek fan but even my girlfriend was able to enjoy this one and the newest one having never watched Star Trek previously.  She is not the scifi fantasy lover most of the time but she enjoyed it.  Also picked it up on the cheap :P
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|If your looking for a nice fun game that you can play non stop then this is the game for you. I literally play this game more then other games, and is probably the only game I pay to get extra. It's not hard at all to get into rounds, I can get into them really fast.
B0019IIPXQ|3.0|I'm not a fan of the cost on amazon prime for this purchase.  The movie is 13 years old and can be found in the dollar bin at many stores, but I do like the convenience of not leaving the house to make a purchase/rent.  However, the movie is overall mediocre and it shows in some of Vin Diesel's one liners where he didn't quite pull off the emotion behind the line.<br /><br />Bottom line, we only rented it for the purpose of catching up on the franchise before watching the third installment that came out this year.  I'd search for a bargain bin copy first if you are worried about the cost.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|It is not fun on the 2 round trough it is the same thing as it was th  first time
B0084QWB0O|5.0|This is a story told by a man who witnessed his friends giving the ultimate sacrifice for this country and being prepared to do the same. Not only does this book portray the heroes of the Marines and Army Rangers, but it gives background information on the work it takes to become an elite military squad. It also shows compassion in the Afghan culture and the lives of the people living in rural Afghanistan. Themes of faith, hope, love, and perseverance exist throughout this captivating novel. The protagonist has an identical twin brother and the power of their bond and relationship adds a unique dimension to this story. I would recommend it for anyone who likes heroic stories of soldiers and the importance of families and friendship.
B007JMW46U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, especially the format, with each chapter being is own story. This made for a great bedtime read. The writing is so descriptive you really get lost in the stories, and they are so suspenseful and interesting.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|This is what the Beatles sounded like after their 10,000 hours in Hamburg and before George Martin's studio wizardry became apparent. Great covers and original tunes. Sounds great in the headphones.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is a lot of fun to play.  It works your brain and at the same time you are having fun.  Great game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator that was easy, had large numbers, and was accurate.<br />Some of the calculators on the Internet were so small or so complicated, I got rid of them. I love Calculator Plus Free! I do my check book with it each week.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The first book in the series was so excellent, that this one may disappoint somewhat. I still recommend it: Katniss becomes a more rounded character; one finds oneself drawn even farther into the Capital's perfidy. I find this read so compelling. So many books and stories have explored these themes, and yet Suzanne Collins makes them new and newly thought-provoking.
B00406O7YK|4.0|We love to watch the old time movies that are not made anymore.  This is a very entertaining movie that is enjoyable to watch, and the video and audio was great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I finished this book, I was exhausted and deeply moved. Suzanne Collins pulled me into the story so deeply that I almost couldn't put it down. Even then, I pondered  the characters' choices and dreamed I was part of the story. Fabulous. A must-read.
B00000ILDF|5.0|I love this series Sigourney Weaver at her best and Sci-Fi at it's best! Don't cheat your self this movie is a classic pick it up today.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Violence for the sake of it ain't entertaining - just another piece of meaningless crap.<br />Recommend seppuku to the producer & entire cast, in ascending alphabetical order.
B00006674X|5.0|Thank you. My sister in law is going to love it.<br />She is a big Elvis fan and this is the one movie she could never find in stores.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is a great game! Nice clean graphics, enjoyable... I hope they add more levels! Keep them coming please! Great job!
0547338023|5.0|This book is absolutely my favorite book, graphic novel or otherwise, that I currently own!!  I have long enjoyed [in both French and English] the original book by Saint-Exupéry--it is rightly the most-translated book in the French language!  I had thought, before reading this, that the graphic novel treatment by Joann Sfar [that is a guy, by the way...] might mess with the charm, and charming self-drawn [by Saint-Exupéry] illustrations that are so much a part of the original book.  However, I was drawn inside by the cover art, which immediately struck me, and trust me--there is nothing lost here, and much gained--I was affected strongly on the original book, and love its messages~~and this one did the same to me, only much more strongly!  I absolutely recommend this version, or its original French version [Mr. Sfar did his adaptation in French, originally] to anyone who has or has not read the original!
B007N8RULO|5.0|Very fun and relaxing. It is Nice to have on my phone for when I am stuck waiting. It is really enjoyable.
B007P6VM04|5.0|Great music BUT all of the music from the show is neither on this disc nor on BOMBSHELL.  The music from HIT LIST is missing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game better than temple run, not only do you have to jump over trains and other objects, you can roll and puck up prizes on the way. Only complaint I have is change the view at the beginning of game for head start. It gets in the way with the guard chasing you.
B006BFK5DK|3.0|the elements are my all time  favorite band, however my bias is to the 74-79 era when i feel that was the prime time fire and peak.  now to me they have been putting out average albums over the past 30 years and it  has alot to do with the lack of stronger songwriting. what hurt them back in the 80's though was the embrace of technilogy and the watered down vibe of their sound. the album here is well produced and polished, however nothing is really standing out and that is the problem because you expect at least something that is close to a classic track. its  great to have Larry Dunn on here, however the last EWF album that truly loved me was the I Am album and while there are some  cool grooves and arrangements and voc als here and there, nothing on a  whole is seeing that classic period, still its cool to have another elements album in the collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not one show out there is better than this one!!! Took me a while to watch it and then I just couldn't stop...buy it!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|It's not hard or easys it's fun and gets your he** double hockey sticks up.<br />But it costs a lot of fake money to get stuff.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This is a book perhaps better read on paper because the characters appear in different generations and the story lines are hard to integrate.
0553385461|5.0|I bought this for my wife. Although I do not agree with some of his ideas my wife finds it interesting.
1401206905|4.0|Got a son who is batman crazy and he LOVES this book.  Recommended for any one who wants to know more
0385523394|4.0|I bought the book after watching the Netflix series. The book is not at all as crazy as the show. I can see where the Netflix producers have gotten their inspiration to all the crazy scenes, but they never happened in real life. I recommend to read the book, it provides a lot of interesting stories about the real prison life.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game. One can play for free still earn enough credits to buy power ups to win more.  I play daily.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app and play it all the time I recommend it for everyone<br />My one question is when will there be horses in it?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|**UPDATE**<br />I orginally had the chromecast plugged into an extension cord via the charging block, which created a bit of an eye sore with the cableing. But, I somehow remembered there was a USB port in the back of my cable box (yes, I still subscribe to cable, Time Warner nonetheless...) In any case, I gave it a shot, and voila! It actually powers the device. I thought it would power down once I turned off the cable box, but nope, apparently the box continues to supply power even when the box is off. So now I dont have to route the power cable and extension cord just to power it. I should also add that i have the chromecast plugged into a HDMI switch, since my tv only has 2 HDMI ports. And it works just fine this way as well. &lt;/update><br /><br />**start original review**<br />First, what is with all the 1 or 2 star reviews saying it doesnt do much? Did you people not do your research on what this can/cannot currently do? Yes, app support is minimal right now, but they told you that it only supports Netflix, YouTube and google play vids right now, and that tab casting is still in Beta! Anyway...onward to my reivew-<br /><br />Finally received this after waiting a month and a half here on Amazon. Set up couldnt have been more straightforward. Plug Chromecast into HDMI port. Plug in the power (either to an available USB port or outlet). Go to the chromecast set up webpage to download the setup. Follow the on screen instructions. Start casting!<br /><br />I dont subscribe to Netflix, so I'm really banking on other app support soon. But I did try out youtube and a bunch of sites that offer streaming video, such as ESPN, Hulu, Aereo and sites of various tv stations (MTV, CW, etc) on my laptop using the Chrome browser. Also tested out youtube from my iphone. All cast without a problem. I dont know why I was surprised that even the audio was casting through the device, but it was! which is great so i dont have to connect the laptop thru my sound system.<br /><br />Must admit the picture quality is not where I would like it, but hoping that'll change once apps start supporting it. Also, as some have mentioned, Amazon streaming is not supported right now, at least in full screen. You can cast the tab and watch it in the browser, but once you try to full screen it, it doesnt work.<br /><br />All in all, you can't lose for $35. Here's to hoping other popular apps jump on board soon, and google allows casting local videos!admit the picture quality is not where I would like it, but hoping that'll change once apps start supporting it.

B000GWE44U|3.0|The movie was great!  The immediate playback was awesome!  It NEEDS closed captioning.  My friend who is deaf had to lip read the entire time.  Sad day for her.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love the series, and really appreciate the extra content you get on this DVD. The interviews, background information and additional historical context really add to my enjoyment of the series. Highly recommend!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I bought this album for 1 song!  I was surprised with how many songs I actually knew on this album. All the songs I knew were so different sounding that I never expected them to be from the same band!
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun. There were jokes all throughout, with a touch of romance, and a lot of singing...acapella style. Overall, I really liked this movie, but I am one of those people that likes almost all singing and/or dancing type movies (almost all). This was one of the singing movies that I would watch the whole thing over and over, not just fast forward to the singing parts. If you are a fan of singing movies, and a fan of comedy, I highly suggest this movie.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|Great album!  Great band! Love most of the songs on this album!  Very cool to listen to!  Really grew to like most of the songs on it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for a time filler - not enough time to get into a book but a little time to kill.  I enjoy the challenges.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game,can't get enough. They need to add Stuart as one of the characters. Please create more levels.
0385349947|5.0|Love this book!!! Everyone else has written great reviews. Now just buy it and read it! You won't be disappointed!
B002GMSMHS|5.0|I was able to find the camera's model number to match the XD card with the camera. It is perfect and we could finally use our camera again.
B00CPWTRAA|5.0|The world's best tenor now proof to be a sensational Verdi baritone! Absolutely beautiful voice and music. Bravo maestro Domingo!
B003XF1OK4|5.0|Excellent read. This captures women's everyday struggles and emotions beautifully. Truly a delight to read and a comfort to feel I'm not alone in many of the sentiments. Also, I must note better than the movie.
B002YOJBYG|5.0|Wonderful singing and acting by the great Domingo. And in 2013 we hear him as a tenor in this same opera! How great an artist,
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Great movie. Exactly what I had expected of a Clint Eastwood flick. If you are a Eastwood fan, you need this DVD as part of your collection.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|So creative and engaging! The colors, the shapes, the stories...all of it as a whole makes this a first class children's show. And my young grandchildren LOVE it as well. :-)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Whispersync is super cool; you can read on your cell phone on the bus or train or wherever, and pick right up where you left off on your tablet or Kindle e-reader when you get home.
B0067R0APK|2.0|Much better on the iPhone or IPad. I don't know how it looks on the new Kindle fire but the one I have it's just okay.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Enjoying the game. Wish the time was a rad longer or that you could earn longer time by doing well. You can use the easily earned coins to buy a little more time, which is cool, but I'd like to earn extended time, too. Other than that, definitely enjoying. And it lets you progress without having to start at level 1 each time. Always a plus. :)
B00DGN51O8|5.0|There was no bad language, no gory scenes. Would be careful with young children. Definitely 9 and over. If you have younger children that you think can handle it, I always watched the movie first to be sure. I feel it can cause nightmares for younger children. I would watched this movie again with the grand kids. Has some very funny parts.
B00A83075M|5.0|I love this move. I've probably watched it over 50 times in the last couple months since I bought it. No complaints!
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I watched it with my daughter. I thought it was unique in the ending, usually the bad villain stays bad. In this movie it has an encouraging twist to true friendship and how to turn from a bad friend to a better friend.<br />Approved by a Mom,,
B005R32L66|1.0|Bought a TV Cam to use with Skype and HDMI on my TV. Can't receive or send requests to another state. Skype is apparently always having problems. Ready to return the camera.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have always hated how long exercising takes!  It is very frustrating because on top of work and everything else going on I feel like there is no time for exercise, so to have an exercise routine for so cheap that is only twenty minutes is a life saver.  Do not think it will be easy either you are working out for the entire time and sweating your butt off, but you see results almost immediately, so it is completely worth every penny.
1582432678|4.0|I know you are wondering how I can give a book 4 stars that I haven't read yet. Well, I watched the movie last night and buying the book today. I have told everyone about this movie and how this child was. This movie has affected me in a way that I haven't fully comprehended. The book will give me more insight and more information. I'm sure once I'm done with the book, I will be changing this to 5 stars. This was a wonderful cast and they did their job, for I felt for them. I have to know if Eve was afraid of her child (sometimes it seemed that way). He should have been in therapy a long time ago.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I liked the oringinal with Stallone, This one is equally as dark.  But atleast the sun shines in this one.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Cast aside all feelings about the film Star Trek Into Darkness when considering this gift set.  It is all about the QmX phaser replica.  And like all of their products and replicas it is spot on.  Good weight, not too heavy if you want to wear it as costume piece.  It looks fantastic on the display stand. Buy it for yourself, buy it for loved ones, buy it for friends.  Plus as a bonus you get a blu-ray, dvd, and digital copy of the movie with a 3D cover.
B00A7UD6ZY|4.0|He reports that they are compact and he likes that they fit in his pocket. That they could be a little louder - in the BART (train) he sometimes has a hard time hearing, but all the other times they are good. He would recommend them for the price.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|I rented this one day from Netflix and loved it (not to mention Jensen Ackles is a voice; pleasant surprise!) I looked it up and finally found a copy on here. It came in the mail quick and was in fairly good condition. Very good movie, I recommend it!
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|I don't know what all these great reviews are about.  They seem to be about the special FX or the 3D or what ever.  My impression of the STORY LINE is that this is NOT, REPEAT NOT AN ACTUAL STAR TREK representation.  For someone who was fortunate to watch the REAL Star Trek with Caption James T. Kirk, Mr. Spock and the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, these cartoon characters do not come close to representing that classic TV series.  This Star Trek should be called Alternate Universe Star Trek.  Simply put, the movie is ILLOGICAL.  The time sequencing is screwed up. WHY: In this version, Khan encounters the Enterprise, when the Crew had just been assembled.  And rather then Khan and his genitically altered crew being put on a distant planet, they were put into a frozen state?  So a past event occurred before a future event, but that out of sequence event coincided with the initial launching of the Enterprise, which was the ship that was used to maroon Khan and his people.  Then there is Old Spock speaking to young Spock about a past event, that is reoccuring, HUH?  Sorry but this is just another rip off of the extreem creative ability that America had at one time.  Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek and it was successful, so now rather then write a NEW level based on that success, the creaters of this \\"version\\" decided to recreate the characters and attempt to steal the greatness that the series once had.  To give credit where credit is due, this BOGUS cartoon Star Trek is an entertaining movie, but you must forget all that you know about the REAL Star Trek series.  I wonder why JJ Abrams did not make a \\"future\\" version of the highly successful series by creating new characters with NEW names.  I guess that it is much easier to steal thunder then create it on your own.  To restate: The movie is worth watching, if you, much like the \\"writers\\" of this dribble, forget every thing that you knew about Star Trek, Star Trek The Next Generation, Star Trek Deep Space Nine, andStar Trek Voyeger.
B0090RSYVG|5.0|I LOVE HIM! I'm so glad I could find this! (I just wish I could find a Lego Thor!) It arrived SO quickly in the mail it actually surprised me. I love him, every Loki fan needs one!
1451626096|5.0|This is an addition to my Phillappa Gregory collection. I've yet to finish reading it but am well into it and certainly enjoying it so far.
B00DSTBMMU|1.0|As a fan that has bought everything (unfortunately including this) - don't waste your money.  This is a phoned in album to get some dollars from sales.  Too bad....
1416972242|5.0|A continuation of the story started in the City of Bones.  I couldn't put it down.  I really got involved with the characters.  I have to read the next part, City of Glass.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Pretty good read if you are under or over the age of 12. Excited to finish this series by Jeff Kinney
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It's pretty addicting. Quite a lot of fun, it gets pretty intense further in the game and its fairly challenging
B005XUC398|5.0|I loved it, a look at what might have happened at the last crash of the stock market. Very entertaining and it didn't get slow. I would highly recommend this movie.
B001AFF25W|4.0|Excellent book with great information if you do what is asked of you. Practice and repetitive steps are some of the key lessons taught in this book.<br />Inspirational and a must read.
159463176X|4.0|Well written epic of loss, love and redemption as well as pitiable loss and yes, hope. Captivating and provokes reflection on what really is most important in one's life.
B0090C0BNA|1.0|I was under the impression that this headset would work. I was wrong, It worked for about 0.00 seconds out of the box. Probably just a bad pair but Im not going to buy this product again.

B007L96SI6|2.0|But this album is all over the map, except it misses being good.  Goodness, what a waste of a good voice.
B00BCV3HGU|2.0|CD will not play 5 songs out of the total songs on the CD.  Not pleased at all with this purchase.
0142402753|5.0|I purchased this book for my 3 yr old son and we both enjoy reading this book.  The pictures are colorful and fun and the underlying theme of sharing with others and being happy with who you are, not how you look, are great lessons for any child.  I highly recommend!!!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|If you want to know why they had a hard time getting along with each other. then you might want to check it out, but even if you don't care about that, you will want for the 45 minute concert from 1975 that comes with it. It has Randy Meisner singing his big hit \\"Take It To The Limit\\"!!! Now they only sing 8 songs in the concert (I know I was tick off there were only 8 songs to) but its a Great Concert anyway. If your a Big Fan of the Eagles trust me you will want the live concert, even if you don't care about there history, but if you watch there history of why they broke up, you may find yourself coming away not caring to much for some or all of the members of America's Classic Rock Band of the 70's.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|I adore this movie. It is one of my 90´s favorites. Stallone is funny as and Wesley Snipes is gorgeous. It has lots of funny and delightful moments with Sandra Bullock, Denis Leary, Benjamim Bratt. I never could understand the 3 seashells, but hope that one day they'll make a remake and explain it to us all. It's an action movie but packed with funny moments so it's perfect for anytime, actually, with friends, boyfriend, girlfriend or whatever.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|As a longtime Castle fan I like this season's writing and acting a lot; the cleverness and nuances of plotlines and chemistry among the actors is at an all time high.  In Season 5 the relationship between Castle and Beckett develops further as they initially try to keep their romance private from co-workers.  Storylines are very well-told and well-thought out.<br /><br />Castle's intelligent screenplays and wonderful ensemble cast continues to shine.  Castle's my favorite show and has been for the last couple years.  Why?  Because the writing and characters are believable, engaging, fun to watch and captivating.  I initially started watching this because Nathan Fillion was so outstanding in Joss Whedon's legendary \\"Firefly\\" series (which I still re-watch often) and I wanted to see him in other roles.  Speaking of which it's great to see guest stars and rare Firefly homages in Castle (eg Final Frontier ep, thanks; it's appreciated :).  Nice saucer easter egg in the menu in one in the Castle season 5 dvds.<br /><br />Castle is easily one of the top shows to be produced in recent years, well worth watching, and it's great to see that the evolving relationship of Castle and Beckett is still edgy and fun, not having lost anything 'the morning after' -- masterfully written scripts and brilliant acting helps Castle continue to shine. Thanks everyone for doing it right.<br /><br />-Ken
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a ton of fun to play! With all the different places and all the new updates it doesn't get old I would recommend this to any of my friends.

B0002KQNJU|5.0|I first saw this film as a child late night on tv after reading book 'The Little Vampire' which featured it in one chapter under its European title 'Dance of the Vampires'. I never forgot it since and because of it became a huge Polanski fan to this day. Although often compared to Hammer films of its day this surpasses all of them in my opinion. The cinematography and set design are wonderful, really drawing you into the snowy Transylvanian settings. The music score is haunting and the direction and cast are first rate. It's not by any means a rip-roaring adventure in comparison to other films in its genre but what it is, to me, is a beautiful, ambient and often hillarious homage to the classic vampire tale. That said, I can clearly see why some people just don't get it. It's definatley not a conventional film and one to divide critics and viewers alike but definatley worth a watch. Enjoy!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Classic Marvel character paired with great actors and supporting cast. Will not dissapoint if you are into Marvel comics or good movies

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Another one of Marvels great movies! A must own if you are a Marvel buff, will not disappoint. Must see
B003ULUASS|1.0|I was disappointed with the actual quality of the vinyl, first the records are white, but in this case were more like grey, both records had like a black swirl all over making it look dirty and messy and even affected the sound quality adding many noises to the playback, so I don't know if all are like that or I just got unlucky, I was closed to return it, but I just deal with it.
B001DHXT20|5.0|Movie was better than the first Hulk remake, but Edward Norton is not the right character for the part even though he did a great job in the movie! Great Movie
B004XDYJRU|5.0|We've enjoyed this app on our I-Pad and were delighted to see if was available for the Kindle Fire.  We can listen to our favorite kind of music from a variety of different stations.  And when we travel, we can listen to our small-town local radio station while on the road to keep up with what's happening.  The app is easy to use and if you hear a song you like, you immediately know it's title and artist information.
B007RX32TY|5.0|That's all I need to say. Imagine Joy Division meeting Portishead. There was a lot of talk of its ties to the movie &#34;Drive&#34; and you can definitely hear that influence.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a good keyboard with some good features.  I would like to see more settings such as the ability to turn off auto space after punctuations.  The predictions are pretty good.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|well done as a documentary. ana;yzing a serious problem for some people.<br />It is amazing how someone can pull off the part without clothes and not be considered porn,
B005LJITS0|4.0|it was a good movie and my 9 year old son really liked it and he would recommend it to other kids
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This was my entry into Sigur Ros. I heard it at a music store and had to buy it. The quality and depth carry from release to release. Hoping to see them live this year.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|this movie has such a great powerful, inspiring message. I could watch it over and over. Its def one of my favorites!!!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is a place to Review the Blu-Ray movie not the Special Features....so what if there are exclusive content for one vendor or the next? If you want all the content buy all the discs. It happens with Movies, Rentals, Games, Hell even food and clothing is Exclusive so why should a movie be any different???<br /><br />The movie is unbelievable and deserves the 5 stars I am giving it. The new cast is still as good as they were in the first and I hope they just keep dropping these new movies.<br /><br />JJ is the best out there! Keep it up!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I love this movie. I really wanted to watch it and couldn't find it for rent anywhere until I looked on amazon!!! Its so sweet and original!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Not only did I get all eight movies, but it was at an excellent price. Watch all 8 of them in 2 days. Awesome.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Must have classic.  Amazon streaming/prime is the cheapest way I could find this movie.  Had to track it down on amazon on PC to find it though,  XBOX and Sony products didn't have it listed when I searched for it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love having the DVD.  I missed the season this year and my daughter sent me two of the DVD's so I got caught up in the show.  I had to find the 3rd and of course it was on Amazon.  I can't wait for the next season.
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|I hate to give a one star rating to a book, but I can't honestly rate this book any higher. Not only because I don't agree with Professor Dawkins's main premise, but because of his poor arguments, his unfair and inaccurate representations of religions and of the Bible, and his unnecessary offensiveness to religious believers.<br />I won't repeat all the counter-arguments that have already been well presented in other reviews, but here are a few objections out of many.<br />Dawkins portrays scientists that believe in intelligent design as lazy and anti-progressive (loc. 2062). According to him, creation scientists don't want to solve the mysteries of science, because that would somehow lessen the need for a creator. Perhaps such scientists do exist, but I don't think I've ever read or listened to one. There are many very intelligent and highly educated scientists who believe in God, including many who believe in a young earth, and they work as hard as the scientists who believe in evolution to make meaningful contributions to humanity.<br />In loc. 2086, Dawkins argues that \\"flaws\\" in the design of nature is evidence against intelligent design. He cites the laryngeal nerve as an example. I am not a biologist and am not familiar with the laryngeal nerve, but I find it interesting that other supposed flaws (from the human tailbone to the appendix to \\"junk\\" DNA) that have in the past been used for the same argument, are now known not to be flaws at all. Science simply had not discovered their purpose in the past, but now we know that these items actually do serve a valuable purpose. It is rather strange that atheists, when one after another of these \\"flaws\\" are demonstrated to be anything but, keep insisting that the details that are not yet understood are flaws that disprove the existence of a creator.<br />There are huge problems, I believe, with Dawkins's argument on the anthropic principle as an explanation of a habitable earth. For one, he cosmically understates the odds of the appearance of a world with the correct conditions for life. Even if we accept that there are only six \\"knobs\\" that have to be inexactly the correct position, the possibilities of variant positions, even with only one \\"knob\\" are nearly endless. Actually, an \\"infinitely long slider\\" might be a more correct picture than a \\"knob.\\" If you multiply the possible positions of even only six \\"sliders,\\" I would say calling the odds \\"one in billions\\" is a gross understatement.<br />There is much that could be said about Dawkins's arguments on morality. I will keep it a bit personal. Dawkins challenges: \\"Do you really mean to tell me the only reason you try to be good is to gain God's approval and reward, or to avoid his disapproval and punishment?\\" Personally, I would answer: Certainly not! God is my Father, I love Him, and I love to do what pleases Him. (I hope you can relate to that at least a little in the context of an earthly father.) Do expectation of reward, and fear of punishment, motivate me to obey God? Certainly. Are they the main motivations? No. Just as while fear of punishment would (I presume) be one negative motivator that would prevent Professor Dawkins from eliminating a problem with his neighbor by eliminating his neighbor, I do not choose to believe that it would be his main motivation for not shooting the guy.<br />All in all, I must say I think it most interesting that Dawkins attacks religion so fiercely as a basis for morality, when as far as I can see, he has no basis whatsoever for morality besides subjective personal feelings and Darwinian pragmatism. Dawkins says that the \\"increased understanding that each of us shares a common humanity with members of other races and with the other sex\\" are \\"both deeply unbiblical ideas.\\" (loc. 4138) Totally to the contrary! Paul told the Athenians that \\"He has made from one blood every nation of men.\\" (Acts 17:26) Repeatedly in the New Testament we are told that all races are equal before God, as wellas men and women. (Colossians 3:11, Galatians 3:28, Romans 10:12, to cite a few) Dawkins continues: \\"One reason black people and women and, in Nazi Germany, Jews and gypsies have been treated badly is that they were not perceived as fully human.\\" Exactly. Which perception is most unbiblical, but one that is at the very least much more compatible with the thesis of evolution by Darwinian natural selection.<br />I am also baffled by the attacks on the Bible's integrity by Dawkins and many other authors. Textually, the Bible is so much better attested than any other ancient text - it's laughable, really. I know people aren't basing a religion on Plato (at least not generally), but still - I don't hear people attacking the textual integrity of Plato, Homer, Aristotle, or Virgil. We have only a handful at best of many ancient works, but nobody is doubting that they are at least generally true to the original. There are literally thousands of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament catalogued today, besides thousands of copies more of the Latin Vulgate and other translations. For a brief, casual, but well-documented discussion of the integrity of the Bible, check out Is the Bible True - Really? by Josh McDowell and Dave Sterrett - downloadable for free on Amazon.<br />I would certainly be alarmed at the thought of fundamentalist \\"Christians\\" taking over the government and forcing their views on the populace, as, according to Dawkins, some would like to do. I am glad we both live in a country where Dawkins is free to publish his book and I am free to post my review. (And I am truly sorry and outraged at the hate mail you have received, Professor Dawkins.)<br />Yet it is just as frightening a prospect to me that parents should be stripped of their right to bring up their children in a manner consistent with their religious beliefs, as Dawkins seems to propose. Certainly if your religious belief requires you to abuse your child, you must not be allowed that liberty. But manywould like to widen the definition of \\"abuse\\" far too wide.<br />Dawkins seems to be of the opinion that it should be illegal for the Amish to raise their children in the Amish way, hinting that this is abusing their children. My parents were both raised in Amish homes, so I speak from some experience, or at least personal observation. I am sure that many others who personally know Amish families could testify that their children, in general, are some of the happiest and contented children in America. There are exceptions, of course. But children are not victims of abuse just because they are not driven around in cars, and are not given access to TV and internet (which, according to scientific research, probably hinder much more than help the mental development of small children). And no Amish people of my acquaintance would refuse to administer antibiotics to their sick child (as Dawkins also implies). Again, there may be extremist cults that would, but not most Amish.<br />There is much more to be said, but my review is already rather too long.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|To tell the truth I'm not sure how to review this book, but I'll give it a go anyway. Emma, by Jane Austen, is one of those novels that has you really wanting to find out what happens, at the same time that you truly dislike the protagonist. At least I did. In fact, Austen was quoted as saying about the book, that she was going to write about a character who \\"no one but myself will much like\\". Boy, was she right.<br /><br />Austen seemed to be well aware of just how different Emma Woodhouse was from the heroines of her other works. She was spoiled and snobbish, and really did not possess as many good qualities, but I really think that this was a purposeful choice on Austen's party. This is just my theory, obviously, but I think it obvious that Austen was deliberately writing a story using a woman who embodied the most disquieting cultural ideas of the period (ideas that Austen herself didn't much like, it seems), and still seeing if she could make her sympathetic. In other words, Emma was a woman of her times, and then some.<br /><br />As the story begins, Emma is attending the wedding of her former governess, Miss Taylor, who Emma believes wholeheartedly that she is responsible for pairing up with her now husband, Mr. Weston. How much influence Miss Woodhouse really had on the match is, of course, debatable. Given subsequent events, one would be forgiven for not believing she could have had much to do with it at all, given that the couple is actually happy and together.<br /><br />But all of that is neither here nor there. The point is that, as the narrative begins, Emma is feeling flushed with excitement over this new marriage of a couple that she sincerely believes she was responsible for bringing together. She decides she is quite good at this, and will help others. In particular she meets and becomes friends with a young woman named Harriet Smith. Smith (from a lower social class) is a gentle, kind, loving, and pretty, but naïve, young woman who looks up to, and all but worships, Emma.<br /><br />Emma, quite frankly enjoying the attention, decides that she will take Miss Smith under her wing, She will find someone worthy of Miss Smith. She will put her match-making talents to good use and help her young friend find a good husband. Poor Miss Smith.<br /><br />Emma could best be described, I think, as a romantic comedy of errors. It is quite difficult to actually discuss much of the plot of the book without giving away some major spoilers, but I will try my best. There will be some spoilers ahead, though, so be forewarned.<br /><br />The writing quality was as one would expect of Jane Austen: superb. Of course, calling Jane Austen's writing \\"superb\\" would be considered almost unnecessary by some. There was an issue with the pacing, which felt a little bit off in that everything seemed to fall into place like dominoes at the very end. The denouement moved far too quickly, I believe.<br /><br />Of course this is a minor quibble. I don't have any real critiques of the book, except for two areas that I had a problem with. One was a cultural distinction of the time that I can't really mark the book down for, but discomfited me, and the other issue had to do with an illogical inconsistency involving said distinction.<br /><br />The cultural distinction I refer to is the concept of social status at that time in British history. Basically, this meant that personal morality, kindness, and other good traits mattered not as much as one's family connections, education, economic status, or some combination thereof. Indeed, social status seems to have determined nearly all.<br /><br />The end-of-story narrative drove me nuts when Austen narrated how Emma and Harriet's friendship began, of course, to lessen gradually, and that this was what was appropriate (from Emma's point of view). What could possibly be appropriate about remaining friends with a cold, cruel, untruthful, stuck-up woman like Mrs. Elton, while a kind, sweet, considerateyoung woman like Miss Smith slowly stopped being your friend (all due to differences in \\"class\\")? Such ideas of olden days such as social status drive me to no end of insanity when I read of them in some of these classics. But this brings us to a criticism I do have, or at least a question.<br /><br />You see, if Emma holds too superior a social standing to be friends with Harriet Smith, then how could Mr. Knightley not be too socially superior for such a friendship? He is wealthier than Emma, better educated (a given for the time, due to sexism), involved with the governance of the local church and the town, among other things. He is very much of \\"superior standing\\" to Emma. Yet he never once is said to back off of his friendships and mentoring of Robert Martin, Harriet Smith, or other poorer folks. So how can Emma \\"have\\" to do so? My belief is that this is either an inconsistency, or a deliberate plot point to send the message to the reader that Emma had some more growing up to do, and still was flawed.<br /><br />This is definitely food for thought, as is so much of this engaging, thought-provoking, entertaining (though sometimes quite frustrating) novel, which I suggest people give a try.young woman like Miss Smith slowly stopped being your friend (all due to differences in \\"class\\")?

B00B22ASUM|5.0|What a lovely book.  I was so happy to see a book about a cat for there are many many books on dogs.  I am a cat person with three kitties of my own.  I know how very special they can be. How wonderful James was able to share this love and that he was so generous in letting all of us share in he and Bob's remarkable story
B0049U4NQO|5.0|I loved this book so much!!!! Best Series ever to read and i recommend this to any readers.BEST SERIES!!!!!! :D
B001A4LYN2|5.0|The discovery of huge oil in TX and CA is the turning point in modern history. Almost everything you touch or see is related to oil. This movie gives a great picture of the unreal greed involved in oil. The opening 10 minutes are priceless. No words. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a world masterpiece of film. You will not be able to forget the ending scenes of this movie.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a great little game. It was a free app but I would have paid for this I am enjoying it that much.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|This lens is better than my Canon lens that came with my T3i.  The Macro feature is excellent.  Very happy that I chose this one and I recommend it to everyone.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Poor Colm Wilkinson...or ANY cast member for that matter, of the stage show 'Les Miserables' (1985-present). If this was torture for me? I cringed and had to stop the film over and over due to this agonizing adaptation. I read 'Les Miserables' when I was twelve; and I never imagined close ups of anyone's tonsils, or pictured anyone looking constipated as was the mode d'etre of this film.  However, I did picture the madness that Geoffrey Rush so brilliantly brought to Javert in the 1998 film.  As well as envisioning Valjean like Wilkinson--a bear with a voice even more powerful than his brute strength!  Bottom line?  The casting was 95% wrong; and the directing was 100% to blame!  I'm a huge fan of each and every one of these actors--in other roles.  But now, I have a really foul taste in my mouth--like they all had REALLY bad breath and sang this entire show 2\\" from my face.  Plus, I don't understand why everyone is falling all over themselves about Anne Hathaway.  Don't get me wrong--I LOVE her in her other movies--but in this case--she was just bug-eyes and dirt and whisper/screaming.  Hadn't she seen the play?  (And just to be extra catty--why did she have all of her perfect teeth at the end, and no Eponine to sing with her?  Wrong move, Mr. Director)  Eponine was the one shining star in this debacle!  Beautiful voice, beautiful girl.  Thank goodness!  Well, I have to admit, Marius had an incredible voice.  I have seen the play 4 times--London, NY, CA; never really paid attention to Marius--he was just there as filler & a prop in Valjean's arms, or to hold Eponine's head up--but in this?  He has some pipes!  Hence, the one star.  Eponine and Marius.  Even my favorite actress, Helena Bonham Carter, couldn't save this ear-splitting, laughable, abomination.  When I finally got through it (and it took a number of tries) I turned to my husband and said, \\"no, really, where is the REAL 'Les Mis?'\\"  Disappointed doesn't even begin to cover it.  So! I am in my happy 'LesMis' place listening to Colm ; and plan on revisiting the Anniversary editions--where, surprise!  Javert is a brilliant tenor!  Valjean is redemption; and Fantine doesn't run her nails on a chalkboard while singing some of the most gorgeous pieces of music EVER written. If ANY stage cast members read this (yeah, right)--believe me, you are missed and longed for!  Hollywood has a horrible track record for ruining the best of the best--look what they did to Julie Andrews with 'My Fair Lady'; and Carol Channing with 'Hello Dolly'?  Travesties.  So sad, so sad...Hollywood--'do you hear the people sing, singing the song of angry men?'  ;)
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I love this movie and I love Bradley Cooper!  Such a warm and totally different side of Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro!
B005544TRQ|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this show and how much he liked it. I didn't want to start watching it mid-season, so I decided to watch it from the beginning on Amazon Instant Video (Seasons 1 and 2 are free for Prime members!) What an awesome show! I watch 2 to 3 episodes each time because it just absolutely draws you in! I'm almost through Season 2 and can't wait to see Season 3. I just wish the episodes were a little cheaper. Regardless, do yourself a favor and watch this show - you'll become a fan, guaranteed!
B00C7E3EFU|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time!! The remastered Blu Ray picture and sound is phenomenal...highly recommended if you're a fan!
B005ZUR724|1.0|This company does not care about its customers. They do not listen to their players nor have they fixed any in game issues. Also you can buy your way to the top. Gameloft pumps out games and gets money up front before abandoning the game once players start to ask for changes. And no customer support.  Trust me I tried to like this game,  I really did. If you want to wast time and money then play. If not just wait for WoW.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|What a let down this movie was. Looked forward to it and it was one step above terrible. Awkward, strange, a story line that didn't work. Beautiful cinematography couldn't save it.
B009MJUCM6|5.0|I love his cute face!  Schleich products are great and have collected for years as they represent real qualities of animals and are sturdy enough for kids to play with.  I love that they look real and not cartoon like.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Thought this would be an interesting adult version of the children's story but turned out to be too dark, too violent with a story line that just didn't work. Its okay if you're bored and can't find anything else to watch or want something to put you to sleep.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Product is as advertised. Very satisfied customer. I like the slim fit. Easy to slide in pocket or purse. Would highly recommend.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I fluctuated between giving it one or two stars. This movie was so boring, I turned it off less than half the way through. Looking at the gray, sterile scenes was depressing. Don't waste your time unless you want something to put you to sleep. Although, it couldn't even do that for me. I sometimes wonder what the studio, producers, stars, etc. were thinking when they pour so much money into a movie like this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was the faotd a few months ago. I got it to see what it was & haven't stopped since. Since they change the scenery every month, it doesn't get old. My only issue is that there are times the new challenges don't show up until they are almost done sometimes. Otherwise, a very fun game.
1594746036|4.0|This was a strange, dark, but interesting book with oddly captivating photographs. I took a reader's advice and bought the book rather than the Kindle version and was glad I did. I enjoyed this definitely unusual and quirky book with its unusual characters.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Such a sad story, can't imagine how it must have been. Huge respect for Jaycee's courage, and her deep awareness of how others may view it or think about what they might have done to escape...
B0019HQIGS|5.0|Excellent DVD! A real close-up look at the amazing talent that John Mayer is live on stage with some awesome band members!
B006C45CFG|2.0|Story content was too slow.  Had great actors but they couldn't save the bad and predictable storyline. It could have been made better had the movie not grown boring and repetitious.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this book, everyone told me to have tissues around by the end. But once I started, I couldn't stop. I read in the hallways on my way to class, almost running into three poles from not looking up, irritated my best friend, and shed a few tears in class once I did reach the end. If recommend this book to anyone, it's amazing.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|REALLY??? ITS KEITH URBAN....ENOUGH SAID..... GREAT MUSIC FROM A PHENOMINAL SINGER! THESE WERE ALL MADE DURING HIS TOUGH TIME WITH SUBSTANCES, RIGHT AFTER HIS MARRIAGE.....ITS A TRIBUTE TO HIS LIFE AND HIS LOVE FOR STICKING BY HIM....WONDERFUL
B00DKY4LBW|4.0|A much, much better improvement from \\"Suck It and See\\". I was already impressed when \\"R U Mine?\\" was released early last year and have been anticipating the album for it since. Frontman Alex Turner takes a new direction with this record, exploring the themes of lost nights mixed with desperation. I felt the record was more concrete than the past two, AM reminiscent of old Arctic Monkeys and Turner's use of lyrical imagery of the nightlife in Sheffield he describes as pictured their first release. If you've lost interest in AM, fine but at least give \\"Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High\\" a good listen-- it may change your opinion of AM for the better.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I liked the movie. I think Cruise was well cast and made the movie much better than it would have been otherwise. The plot is mildly novel but it could have been better. All in all, good flick though.
B001TIQT98|5.0|I love Leonard Bernstein.  He always had passion, and went for the music.  These Mahler recordings are among the very best.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Perfect humor for me to unwind with. I've loved every season so far and it just seems to keep getting better.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I believe that there is a good story in here.  I've kept reading because I believe there is a good story in here. Unfortunately, I'm struggling against the lack of editing (it's \\"meddle\\" not \\"mettle\\") and the sheer lack of time structure.  I give this author credit for making a valiant attempt at what could be a huge and epic story.  Unfortunately, my suspension of disbelief only goes so far.  I cannot fathom 9 14-year-old boys defeating an army of 100.  I cannot see 1 epic hero being able to ride for 2 days straight without killing his horse, and then being able to rescue his girl from a castle of mercenaries.  I also cannot see a leopard cub being able to bite through a man's hand or a horse's leg.  How do only 7 generations hold a kingdom for 800 years?  There are too many things that haven't been thought out.  I would love to see this book series get some professional editing.  It would be fantastic once all of the wrinkles are knocked out.<br /><br />**Edit**<br />Ok, I've made it to book 7.  I'm beginning to think that these books are being written by a 6th grade writing class.  The only \\"bio\\" stuff I can find on Morgan Rice is that he/she is the author of many #1 series.  I don't know how this can be when the grammar and spelling and frequent misuse of words is so prominent.  Characters are 2 dimensional.  Battles are predictable.  Rice actually breaks many laws of physics in the battle scenes. Too many times as one man is about to be killed by (pick a weapon), his friend strikes down the enemy, and apparently the weapon immediately reaches inertia to fall to the ground mid-swing. What happened to momentum?  As well, these books are being pumped out too fast.  Please quit trying to sell us your rough draft, Rice.<br /><br />I guess my breaking point would have to be the oh so cheap Star Wars knockoff. \\"Thor... I am your Father.\\"  \\"Thor... Use your anger.\\"  Really, Rice?  Was Return of the Jedi playing in the background?<br /><br />Please, please, please get some professional editing.
B00EI6E17A|3.0|After waiting what seemed like forever for something new from Lady Gaga this song failed to wow me. While it does have a catchy tune, it really doesn't bring anything new to the table from any other song that she has done, or any other pop star. I still have hopes for the album and perhaps it will prove my thoughts wrong about her newer material.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is a perfect ensemble comedy, and this is a great introduction to it. Everyone in the cast works well in it. Kaley Cuoco is great as Penny, but Jim Parsons steals the show as Sheldon, perhaps everyone's favorite character. The show is basically about a bunch of scientists (some physicists and one engineer) who know very little about life outside the laboratory, and Penny moves in across the hallway and shows them the \\"real world.\\" The cast really clicks. Every episode in this first season is great, and so are the extras. Get this if you don't know too much about the show and need to get acclimated. This is one of the best sitcoms ever! Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, and Jim Parsons are all first-rate in the leads.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This was an okay book to pass the time. I didn't relate to the characters at all, maybe I am too old? The plot was interesting but the ending seemed contrived and not really believable.
0143122061|1.0|Book has a British bias and is totally mislabeled.  However, the author told us upfront that this book is his opinion.  I would suggest The Rise and Fall of Western Civilization as a more appropriate title.  This book is more opinion than history.  In many instances I will describe it as lucid, thought provoking ramblings.  Author drops ideas unrelated to the subject here and there and never fully develop them.<br /><br />Chapter 2 - Competition - Author states that while Confucianism in the East taught that humans must adjust to the world as it is, Christian religion believed in the mastery of the world (humans have the capacity and duty to change the world).  I am not sure where the author gets this idea.  You can argue that the Christian religion that originates with the Roman Catholic Church is not exactly the center of revolutionary thought.  Author seems to equate Christianity to Protestantism and of course, the automatic jump to Capitalism follows.  America was discovered by a Catholic European kingdom (Spain) that was not exactly a proponent of competition and opportunity.<br /><br />Chapter 3 - Science - This is a wonderful chapter of the history of Western Civilization knowledge base.  It marks the beginning of the bifurcation between East and West.  The East simply did not participate in the Scientific Revolution, and much less in the Enlightenment movement that transformed the West.  This chapter explains why East and West development went separate ways.  The discovery of the classics, philosophy and algebra via the Arabs is not labeled as a download, but a donation for the good of humanity.<br /><br />Chapter 4 - Property - This chapter really went on a tangent and got lost.  This chapter focuses on explaining the difference of the European concept of property implemented in South and North America.  In this chapter the author forgets the East and engages in a discussion that compares the European concept of property implemented in South and North America.  I have not seen this concept explained so clearly.  However, he does not describe the Eastern property concept.  Furthermore, he does not address the property concept in old Europe.<br /><br />Chapter 5 - Medicine - Chapter should have been titled (and the author even hints it) The Age of Imperialism. Author uses \\"medicine\\" to tone down the violence of empire displayed by all European powers, but critical only to the non-Anglo empires.  Narrative is excessively critical of the French idea for disguising the quest for empire with the excuse of \\"exporting the Western civilization benefits.\\"  I guess the French got an A for conniving, while the others just \\"came clean\\" and innocently declared their greed and lust for power openly.  They were less conniving.  Why try to pass judgment over the validity of excuses for conquest and empire?  Not a word on the Americas.  I guess medicine was not happening on this side of the world.  A very measured and reverent reference to the British Empire, the largest of all the European empires during that period.  In more than one way, he states that the British colonies were better-off than the other European empires' colonies.  I believe this is a stretch. I guess everything is relative and some abuses were more civilized than others.<br /><br />Chapter goes from the medical experimentation and discovery conducted by the Western Empires in Africa, to Napoleon, to the First and Second WW in a blink.  In fact, the chapter only touches medicine at the beginning and then is drowned in other topics.<br /><br />Chapter 6 - Consumption -This chapter should have been titled The Triumph of Western Capitalism.  The chapter explores the Industrial Revolution, but its narrative is disorganized.  At times it seems like unorganized ramblings with no clear point.  At times the author seems to be thrown into a \\"what came first the chicken or the egg\\" loops.  The author likes to hint a lot without outright telling you.  In some cases it is reduced to a bunch of disorganized facts that are definitely important to the overall narrative, but that are not fully articulated.  At different spots in the narrative the author drop \\"bombs\\" of ideas and never fully develop them.  Examples:<br />1. By 1910 the world has been economically integrated<br />2. How is it, that an invention of 1873 (American blue jeans) is translated into a sexual revolution in the 1960s?<br /><br />Chapter 7 - Work - This chapter should have been titled The Decline of the West.  It is a series of vague macro statements mixed with specific economic hard data that is confusing.  Again, the author hints that the descent of the West is related to the descent of Protestantism (work ethic, thrift, religion, entrepreneurial drive).  Cannot explain why, when did it start or what are the reasons behind the abandonment of Protestantism.  He goes into a series of speculations without really coming to any conclusion.<br /><br />Chapter 8 - Conclusion - The Rivals -This chapter is a tragedy.  So heavy on opinion and emotion, that it is hard to separate fact from fiction.  It starts with concrete theories, but it gets lost in opinion quickly.  Chapter should have been titled The End of Western Civilization Domination: The Final Victory of Western Values.ed to a bunch of disorganized facts that are definitely important to the overall narrative, but that are not fully articulated.

B008ZDC7M8|5.0|This encyclopedic documentary divides the history of film into periods, each of which is examined from an artistic perspective. The narration provides an education in itself. Having attended a prestigious film school myself, I can knowledgably assert that this odyssey into film history is similar to a semester of film school. If you love films, if you make films, if you are just curious about why anybody cares about old or foreign films, or if you just need to recharge your inspiration, then as far as I'm concerned this is the documentary for you. I found it to be a real treat and I'm glad I ordered it.

I just barely checked the mail and when I opened the very thin package, I saw immediately that there were two chunks out of the disk case and had a HUGE Crack all throughout the case I checked the disk and it also had scratches. There was a very thin sheet of bubble wrap but nothing to secure the package in the correct way like many other vendors have done for me in the past. And not just me, but all their customers. Make sure the quality is as you paid for. This was a first for me to receive a damaged item.

B00CTT9646|1.0|Packaging: Weak, printed cardboard without even a window.<br />Disk: Yeah, it's the 3D, blah, blah, blah version you can buy for $26.<br />Phaser: Full-Size, poorly made & poor build quality, poorly detailed (painted), no electronics. Nowhere near worth the price. I think the toy version from the first movie would have made a better addition (at least it was electronic).<br /><br />Summary: To put it mildly, I feel ripped off. Save your money, buy the Disk separate and the find the toy if you want a phaser.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is very useful to me as an ebay seller. I can quickly see if I have made any sells or if items have been bid on by customers. It is concise and easy to use. I would highly recommend this app to others.
B0084IHVDO|4.0|Love the movie, major disney fan. Even though I'm not fond of cats, this movies gives a different outlook on them.
B000VK99Z6|3.0|This second of three movies by this cast is easily the worst. Shawn of the Dead was clearly cutting a new path when it comes to Zombi movies. The third &#34;The Worlds End&#34; puts a funny twist on science fiction. This one seems to be less novel or funny. If you plan to watch the other two then I would definitely include this one. Otherwise pass.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun game ! Lags a little bit sometimes and the prices for things are ridiculous but fun nonetheless. I recommend :)
B003NTSBUG|3.0|For all of the hype I must admit I am rather disappointed in this movie. After friends praised it for its cutting edge plot I was rather let down. The acting was good but the story was just a little to far out there.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like how easy it is read when your sleepy. It is very handy to use when you need to lay down for a nap and do not want to use your other alarms. The blue light is e on the eyes..

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. I loved the historical information it uses and it definitely takes a person on a wild ride to many places.  Intertwines all the information together to make sense and there were twist and turns that I haven't thought of and kept me excited.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|*Spoilers*<br /><br />The first half of Season 3 is worth watching for several poignant moments. I was especially moved by  Mrs. Hughes' storyline since I consider her the most compassionate character at Downton. When she stands framed in the shadows of the corridor and accepts that she may die, it is one of the finest shots of the series. I also loved Carson's surreptitious singing revealing just how much he loves her. Also enjoyable, though brief and thinly portrayed, is Shirley MacLaine's appearance as she brings fresh air to the stodginess of English tradition.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my interest waned after Sybil's moving and unexpected death in Episode Five. As the episodes progressed, Mary, Father Crawley, and Matthew grew increasingly irritating to me. The subplots reintroducing the fallen maid and the battle between Mrs. O'Brien and Thomas were tiresome and repetitive. Bates in prison and out of prison was boring. With the introduction of the silly 18-year old ingenue, the season jumped the shark. Maybe Ted McGinley was unavailable.<br /><br />Lastly, the season ending was dreadful. Due to his expired contract with the show, Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) had to die an untimely soap-opera death and, as his car plummeted, so did the series.
1119962846|5.0|I have no prior experience with R programming or any programming for that matter. This book has been very useful for me to get started with R. It has all the necessary information and resources in one place. Some practice exercises with model answers would have been an added bonus as I think those are absolutely necessary to get a better understanding of the concepts - to follow the concepts in the book is one thing but to be able to remember and apply them correctly to a question is quite another.<br /><br />Otherwise, I think a great resource for anyone looking to get started with R programming!
1439148953|2.0|I loved the story but ending ruined it for me.  The main character is someone I was rooting for throughout the book and I wanted things to turn out well for her.

B00E018T9Y|1.0|Having gone through the book 6 times now ... I thought this might be a good outline style work i could recommend for someone that wanted an overview insight.<br /><br />This is NOT what this $2.99 product is at all.<br /><br />Reading Amazon product reviews has given me more honest AND detiled insights (including content outline / notes) ... truthfully this series might seriously need an upate to be fair to those who would invest in purchasing based upon the promised content in this series.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite movie. She first saw it when she was 5 and just fell in love with the Matilda character in the film. She's now 12, and I still catch her watching it every now and then with her little brother who is now 8. The movie is very funny and also quite entertaining. Great for a lazy afternoon of family entertainment.
6303148352|5.0|Great movie. It's very similar to \\"Godzilla: Size Does Matter,\\" which itself is a great movie. If you liked that, you'll like this one. Excellent movie on a stormy evening.
B00B9EQS98|5.0|My children love the movie. Ages 3,8,10. Its pretty entertaining! Cute story. Its a fun movie to have during Halloween time. The shipping was great.<br /> No problem at all.
B001RUXW48|3.0|Hard to envision a hip, slick and cool agent like Mr. DiCaprio forfeiting his entire life<br />to go and reside in a culture that generally represents his enemy.  Not too realistic in other<br />parts as well.  However, Mark Strong can do not wrong.....
B001RTSPVY|5.0|If you've seen this series, you want to have the DVD for EACH season.  Once it's no longer on the air, you will NEED to have the DVD's to turn to.

0425263924|2.0|However...that was a bullsh*t move by the author adding to more books to the series.  I was about 25 pages to the end, and like most, wondering how she going to tie everything up in 25 pages???  And then it ended much like the Sopranos fade to black series finale and I thought wtf!  Her message to the readers about the story continuing was like a slap in the face.  But just judging this book on the \\"quality\\" of the story, I would give it a 3.  There were storylines introduced that I thought distracted rather than enhanced the main story.  Her mom and dad, Terri and the model, the receptionist, Brent, Corinne...too much!  I know you can't right about the 2 of them in bed all the time (although she tried), but give them something else to do but whine.  I gave it the 3rd star for the hot plane scene...but the book was really a 2 star at best.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game! It is fast and does not run in the background like many other games. I am getting addicted to it.
0345803493|5.0|I don't know anyone that didn't like the book.  I love trilogies and would read E L James again. Yes
B0068MNO4S|4.0|I am familiar with the &#34;Oxfordian&#34; argument that Edward DeVere was in fact Shakespeare, and that is the story this film chooses the dramatize.  It does a nice job of giving a strong sense of Elizabethan England, and presents the Oxfordian argument fairly well, though it does take some liberties with it.  Nicely acted, though!
1451627297|1.0|I was very excited when I got this book last Christmas but my excitement started to fade with each chapter. It simply contains too much filler and is slow as a turtle to get to the point. Only watching Gone with the Wind three times in a row could have been more of a bore.
B000002HHB|4.0|If you really like Natalie Merchant, as I do, this is an album to have.  Though I must admit to liking &#34;Motherland&#34; just a little bit more.
1939416019|1.0|This book needs serious rewriting. The concept is very promising and at first I was really into it, however cliches and contradictions were being thrown left and right. The characters that had potential to develop remain flat, typical cliches where the young boy suddenly doing one heroic deed after the other. The princess and boy 'fall in love' at first sight, had barely spoken three words to each other yet apparently committed come hell or high water. A 'bully' does a roundabout turn after being saved by Thor, someone who had verbally and physically abused him until now in one day becomes a loyal follower. Contradicting views, Firth is at one point a conniving rat who then becomes a submissive blithering, useless idiot.<br />Subtlety does not seem to be skill learnt by this author as further and further you go into the book the characters seem to have to blatantly explain their thought processes.<br /><br />If this was written with a ten year old in mind, this could have been forgivable, otherwise it is an insult to the reader. I know I have just simply listed out the faults, and yes there are many more, but I think this book has potential, but it is unfortunately ruined by what feels like amateur writing.
B000006OAM|4.0|of the Merchant albums I have, it's the one that moves me least.  It's a young Natalie Merchant, for sure.  Not fully realized as a solo artist, but still very good.
B00CTT9646|2.0|The movie is what the movie is, like it or hate it, it is irritating that it doesn't have the normal material one would expect from a package like this.  However, this review relates to the Phaser - what a piece of crap!  If you look at it straight on, it is completely lopsided - the top and bottom don't line up.  While it looks good from the side, if you buy this - which I wouldn't reccomend - keep it on a high shelf.  Extremely dissapointed.
B008BDZOZY|4.0|The first time I listened, I thought: wow, what a train wreck.  I love David Byrne, and think Annie Clark is really cool and talented.  But at first, I couldn't make sense of this.  But the more I listened, the more I could see that they did a most interesting thing, relying almost soley on brass instruments in the compositions.  The more I listened to it, the more I liked its quirkiness and fascinating sound.  Today, after owning it for nearly a year, I say &#34;I like it.&#34;  I'll bet you I'll love it next year.
B009RH973I|3.0|I like the case its sturdy and lightweight the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't put the device asleep when not in use... if there was a way that we can get it have a sleep/wake, that would be great.

B005HGKWLO|5.0|Original humor, and the story played nicely so that you really felt for the characters. Not at all cheesy as many films of this genre tend to be. Absolutely loved it.
B00EU9BSNU|4.0|The deafening roar of forty-three engines at full force, the smell of burnt rubber, the rush: what's not to love about the races? I grew up an ardent fan of stock car racing, hopping amongst New England's speedways in pursuit of the incomparable exhilaration that watching greats like Dale Earnhardt, Rusty Wallace, and Jeff Gordon brought. These men were deft tacticians, athletes, celebrities harkening back to the golden age of racing.<br /><br /> In that golden age, Formula 1 ruled the European raceways. Ron Howard's latest film, Rush, explores that 1970's racing culture and tells one of its most harrowing stories, that of the relationship between Formula 1 racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. It was one of the sport's great rivalries: the dashing, English playboy against the methodical, brilliant Austrian. Exploring in particular depth the culmination of that rivalry at the 1976 World Championship following Niki Lauda's infamous, catastrophic crash, Howard returns to the screen with a sleek, exciting and engaging film that's sure to garner significant Oscar consideration.<br /><br /> Having scored all of Ron Howard's films since The Da Vinci Code, it's no surprise that Hans Zimmer is back in the driver's seat for this one. He's had a prolific year thus far, creating the controversial new sound for the Man of Steel and helming the so-so Disney flop The Lone Ranger, and he'll finish it off with another assured Oscar lock, Steve McQueen's unflinching 12 Years A Slave. Before that much-anticipated endeavor, though, Rush will hit theaters. His score for Rush is expectedly high-octane, fast-paced, and even exciting, though avid fans of the composer may find it often a little too familiar.<br /><br /> The score begins with a flurry of F1 car effects and then introduces its main theme in \\"1976\\", a solemn cello piece over plucking guitar and thumping bass and percussion. Devotees of Game of Thrones will immediately notice the similarities to Ramin Djawadi's \\"A Lannister AlwaysPays His Debts\\", one of the more prominent themes of season three, but the cue also incites comparison to some of Steve Jablonsky's work on the Transformers series, particularly \\"The All Spark\\". When the brass kicks in, the theme reveals its full majesty; a fitting, albeit typical, display of forceful gravitas from Zimmer. The theme recurs in choice instances throughout the score, as at the midpoint of \\"Mount Fuji\\" amidst an ethereal flurry of guitars and in the magnificently dramatic and fantastically built cue \\"Lost but Won\\" (though its impact falters slightly when the brass reveals just how synthetic it really is). \\"My Best Enemy\\" continues in the vein of \\"Lost but Won\\", albeit in a higher register and more cathartic tone than its predecessor.<br /><br /> The dominating material on album is the racing music. This material is appropriately high-octane and intense, dwelling in a similar realm to the sound Zimmer created for Inception's action sequences, with a heavy emphasis on period-appropriate rock influences. The tense \\"Into the Red\\" is distinguished by a notable burst of the main theme at 1:00 that will no doubt distinguish a harrowing moment onscreen, as well as some similarities to Inception's \\"Dream is Collapsing\\". The electric guitar is nearly a constant in cues like this, though some sport a much more forwardly Rock and Roll vibe than others (see \\"20%\\", \\"Oysters in the Pits\\", \\"I Could Show You If You'd Like\\"). \\"Watkins Glen\\", one of the standout racing cues, admittedly rips unabashedly right from Inception's \\"Mombasa\\" but ends with a memorable burst at 1:10 of an exhilarating, underutilized theme over some impressive, percussive elements. This brief theme can also be heard in \\"Stopwatch\\", a motivating, inspiring piece (as an aside, if the string motif caught your ear, check out \\"Re-Entry\\" from Philip Sheppard's score for In the Shadow of the Moon; it uses it to moving effect). The alternatingly understated and bombastic \\"Nürburgring\\" draws from The DarkKnight (as does \\"Reign\\") but also features an incredibly abrupt employment of the rattling \\"Mombasa\\" percussion at 4:16 that takes you completely by surprise and highlights some of the album's mixing and editing issues. But more about that later.<br /><br /> Of all the fast-paced, racing-oriented cues, the pounding and thumping \\"Car Trouble\\" stands out to me as a clear front-runner. Though by no means the most complex, it is easily one of the most satisfying due to the electric guitar and string motif that runs throughout it. It's simple yet speaks to the rush of adrenaline and thirst for glory inherent in the climactic moments of every great race.<br /><br /> A handful of dramatic cues round out the original material on album. The chilling and weighty \\"Inferno\\" lends gravity to Niki Lauda's infamous second lap crash at the German Grand Prix and employs some intimations of the main theme. Audiophiles may cringe at some of the distortion and reverberation on the track when the strings are at their heaviest, but it's still a sobering piece of work. \\"Budgie\\" also dwells in this tone, but cues like \\"Glück\\", a warm and atmospheric piece for twangy guitar, and \\"Scuderia\\", which uses the \\"Mombasa\\" motif, are more affirmative in their own ways.<br /><br /> Interspersed with Zimmer's original score for Rush are a few period-appropriate rock/pop songs such as Dave Edmunds' \\"I Hear You Knocking\\", Steve Winwood's \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\", Mud's \\"Dyna-Mite\\", Thin Lizzy's \\"The Rocker\\", and David Bowie's \\"Fame\\". It's a nice collection of source music and especially fitting given racing culture and the celebrity, rock-star status of racers like James Hunt.<br /><br /> As mentioned before, there are a few problems with the mixing and presentation that warrant addressing. As has been his controversial method of late, Zimmer employs a partially synthetic orchestra here. Much like in The Dark Knight Rises and occasionally in Man of Steel, this often leads to distortion of the music and \\"warping\\" effects that once in a while disrupt the listening experience. Audiophiles, take note. The other more frustrating attribute of the album is the editing of tracks. Each cue is cut off just a smidge too early, leaving the listener with the impression that the beginning of each new track contains a sliver of the end of the previous (evident right from the outset with the disrupted transition between \\"1976\\" and \\"I Could Show You If You'd Like\\"). Such grievances, though, do not entirely diminish the effect of Hans Zimmer's Rush. While too often drawing from previous works of the composer (and, possibly, from that of his protégés), Rush is mostly the score I expected it would be. It's an exercise in combining adrenaline-pumping action with weighty drama and, in spite of its numerous faults, it mostly succeeds and entertains.<br /><br />A Few Recommended Tracks: \\"1976\\", \\"Stopwatch\\", \\"Into the Red\\", \\"Watkins Glen\\", \\"Car Trouble\\", \\"Lost but Won\\"<br /><br />Head to moviemusicmania . com for more film score reviews! Happy listening!

0307276902|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It really made me realize what the person with addiction has to go through.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really like this game it makes you stratagize in where to put the coins to get other coins and prizes.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I now can see the cover of the book I am reading. Thumbs up! A great free app.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I Haven't been able to get on face book since I have had my kindle, for some strange reason it wont let me in and I have tried everything and talked to associates at kindle but I still can't get in.
B00464AVXW|5.0|Brad owned his roll in this. Bang up acting job! Morgan.. well that goes without saying. One of my favorite actors.  This is a must see. The plot is thought provoking. The pace of the movie is well timed. The characters  are well fleshed out and you can really find yourself putting yourself in their place. It has some shocking moments, a giggle moment here and there. Its certainly one of moves where you want to be on the edge of your seat, but you are afraid to lean forward.
B007X4ECMI|4.0|OK special effects, OK humor & lots of action. Oh ya the acting is not bad either. An old premiss done once more. Sit back & enjoy.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|Most fans of the movie didn't like it because all of the changes, for some odd reason this was the reason I did. I found it to be comical, moving, and it gave me a completely new insight to the book. I actually found myself wishing that the book had incorporated the movie more. I loved it and hope to own the DVD soon.
0062255657|1.0|Unless you're into fantasy, this may not be the book for you. I liked the author's writing style, but only got a broad idea of what the author was trying to say. Also, I don't find things like worms crawling out of a hole in someone's foot to be very interesting (or palatable). Given the number of reviews and 4 stars I thought I might enjoy the book. I was wrong. So wrong.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wow loved these books. Looking forward to see how the movies turn out. Definitely worth reading. Wish there were more
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved the first two, loved this one even more. I was not disappointed with this story. Although, to be a little picky, the plot got pretty big...well and beyond what I expected. I certainly recommend this read to all who liked the first two books.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Had heard some good things about this &#34;super group&#34; (I'm a fan of Billy Sheehan but was not too familiar w/the other two) and then I figured for $5 download how could I go wrong?  I did not go wrong.<br /><br />I'm a product of the 80's and not too often does new music do it for me.  But hard rock is back and this album screams it.<br /><br />It starts out right away with Elevate and moves on to Desire.  Big fan of I'm No Angel as well.  Each artist has their moments to display their obvious talents and it's just a great hard rock album.
0891419063|5.0|This is one of the best books about the reality of WWII. It does a great job capturing the experiences and feelings of an infantryman in the pacific theater. If you are on the fence about reading it, just do it. It really is that good.
1476734941|3.0|Interesting concept but not backed by enough solid scientific research for me; it seems to simply be the author's testimonial of his personal experience. But I have a couple of friends actually doing it & say it's working for them. As for me, I find it very difficult to starve myself 2 days a week.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The story felt very real and captured my attention.  It wasn't what I was expecting but I really enjoyed it.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has kept me occupied for hours. It's a great fun although I wish it would connect online a little better. It's fun for the whole family even when that family consists if just two adults :)
B007MAETA8|5.0|Can't go wrong with John Mayer music. My co-workers are also enjoying this CD as I have it down loaded on my work computer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even though this is a YA read, I couldn't put it down.  It is so well written and so inspiring, but in a real-life way.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00DPY95D6|5.0|If you love to read and have not found a good book lately, this is the book to get. Especially if you love drama, and thrillers. The author brings you into the lives of the main characters so well. I was so in to the book I could not put it down and finished it in a day!!! I recommend to anyone who has not read a good book lately you will not be disappointed.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love games like this.  Again, you have to decide which move to make.  Makes you work for a win
B001VTTRC6|1.0|If you think that when someone is sexually assaulted, their life is over and they should put a gun to their head and kill themselves because remaining alive just makes their family and friends miserable, then you will love this &#34;message&#34; movie.<br /><br />If this is the best Clint Eastwood can do, perhaps he should have been a comedian. He could do a stand-up act where he talks to an empty chair.<br /><br />Sorry, but I don't get it. Mystic River was an unpleasant script with unlikable characters. It was not entertaining. It was painful to watch. It was formulaic. When Sean Penn's daughter left the store, you already knew she was going to die and Sean Penn would blame her boyfriend.<br /><br />The ending was a total sell-out. Bacon is portrayed as a level-headed, competent, honest, and dedicated FBI agent who doesn't jump to wild conclusions and who tells his partner with believable conviction that he will go where the evidence leads. In the end, Bacon jumps the shark, fails to do his job, and turns out to be just one more corrupt cop.<br /><br />Roger Ebert says there was great suspense. There was only tediousness. Yes, the acting was strong, but it went nowhere except straight to an unsatisfying ending that was so predictable you could turn it off 30 minutes into the movie and miss nothing.<br /><br />Then there was the message in this movie: If you are sexually molested as a child, your life is over and you're better off dead because staying alive just makes your family and friends miserable.<br /><br />The only remotely interesting thing in the entire movie is why a black FBI agent's nickname would be &#34;Whitey&#34;. And, of course, we don't get an answer to that Earth-shattering question.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This an drive you crazy.  The game makes you think.  Love games like this, makes me work for a win
B004I4H8QS|5.0|Other than the hit Layla, I did not know most of this work until purchasing. This works contains some of the greatest guitar every compiled. Duane Allman and Eric Clapton feed each other. The other band members are exceptional and had to be to keep up. Whitlock was virtuoso in his own right. Great music!

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great game. Love the minions. and the dispicapable me villians. Great for the whole family. Kids are addicted to it. Love the purple minions to. peace OUT!!!!
0385347774|3.0|Very unbelievable and inconsistent. Neither of the main characters were very likable and you are left wondering how you are supposed to feel. The ending seemed tacked on, like the author couldn't quite decide how to wrap up the story. Sort of a page turner, but I finished the book feeling unsatisfied and unsure of what exactly it was the author was trying to say: that all rich children with parents who love each ignore their children who then turn out to be sociopaths, and/or that all men are cads, even the seemingly nice ones.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions are absolutely adorable and the game is completely addictive.  I have trouble putting it down once I start.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Most remakes are B-movie bombs an this is no exception. I've seen better acting in the vegetable aisle at the supermarket. The action scenes were ok, the only reason it didn't get one star.
074322454X|5.0|This reviewer read this book during the flurry of Stephen Ambrose's popularity around the time of 9-11.  I can't help but be reminded of 9-11, my generation's conflict, and my own personal involvement therein when I see this paperback on the book-shelf.<br /><br />This tells the story of Company E, from its beginnings under the shadow of Currahee in Georgia to their successful capture of the abandoned Eagle's Nest in the German Alps<br /><br />As with all things by Stephen Ambrose, any error or exaggeration in his writing is bannered across the internet in some form or the other, nonetheless the book is an outstanding, gripping story.  For small unit leaders in the military, this book is a fantastic primer on how important, intense, realistic training is prior to combat operations.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love supernatural what else is there to say its a great series... apparently the next season was released today and I cant wait to get my hands on it and continue the series.

B0086700CM|5.0|I think that temple run is better than temple run 2that my opinion please get this app this is my first rate ever
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It is entertaining as well as a way to learn about a country we know so little about. Of course we can not determine what is based on facts and what is merely fiction but any ways it portrayed ideas of the country and its culture.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|This is a page turner, as are all of Follett's books. There are lots of gruesome killings. I good summer read.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Can't go wrong with 5FDP. \,,/ \,,/ I've haven't heard a bad album from Five finger death punch so far!!
B0018CENUC|5.0|Well, what can you say about Toby Keith that hasn't already been said?  If you're fan this is an excellent CD.  I keep old Toby in the car and WE sing along in perfect harmony (to my ear) ha!  all the way to and from town.  About 50 miles.  Good quality CD.  Thanks
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I love the ending  and I was happy that Katniss and Peeta were together again but dad that prim died and I'm still wondering what happened to Gale.

B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Peter, Enchantment & Stardust by Author William O'Brien<br /><br />What a delightful compilation of poetry by multitalented Author William O'Brien. This book of poems if divided into four sections. Section I is titled Peter, Section II...Enchantment, Section III... Stardust, and Section IV...Poems from the Story Peter: A Darkened Fairytale.<br /><br />It would be impossible to do justice to each poem so I have decided to mention those that jumped out at me in each section of this well-written book of poetry. \\"A Truth\\" especially touched me in the first section with its hearts of whispers and breathing love...a simple truth well worth living for today.<br /><br />In the second section of poems, \\"Wildflower Valley\\" immediately caught my attention. Firstly, I am also a lover of nature and I could easily envision the morning dew and the busy activity of the garden creatures including the imaginary fairy dust being spread in the spring and summer to awaken the sleeping flowers.<br /><br />In Section III, \\"The Gift\\" is an absolutely delightful poem and my favourite one thus far. It speaks of the innocence of boys and girls and the pleasurable experience of just getting along with one's friends. How refreshing to hear the whispers of the earth's energies and to feel the warmth of its starlit skies.<br /><br />Poems from the Story Peter: A Darkened Fairytale starts off with a simple suggestion...that of feeling blessed and grabbing onto this blessing while taking the time to sit...think...and fly!  It is so wonderful to feel the exhilaration of a child's mind and all the possibilities that accompany it. To find the child within the adult and to grab onto this eternal fountain of youth is not an easy feat, but rather, an exercise that every adult might very well benefit from and enjoy. My favourite poem in this section is \\"Little Things\\". Most of us have heard the expression that good things come in small packages and this lovely poem further reinforces this belief and expounds on this well-known adage.  Yes indeed...simple pleasures are most definitely found in \\"little things\\".<br /><br />Once again I must say, what a delightful compilation of poetry! Thank you to Author William O'Brien for sharing his talent with all of us.<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00EGPIZS4 I'm Not Perfect and It's Okay]]nds on this well-known adage.

B0012GMUI6|3.0|The naked chick on the cover of the CD is very tempting and the music has not grabbed me.....yet! Maybe it'll take me more time to get up to speed!
0060989157|5.0|An amazing look into the lives of Motley Crue. Everything from Vince Neil's daughter's cancer, Vince's accident, Nikki's drug addiction, Tommy's relationships with Heather and Pam to Mick's back issues. I have more respect for them than ever after all they have survived and still live to tell about it and rock on. A must read for anyone who is a fan of Crue, 80's metal or finding out the true story behind each of their lives.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|Very unique and assembled nicely 'The Final Cut' is for those of us with musical imaginations! Give it a listen! You'll understand what I just wrote!
0399256385|2.0|I ordered this for my toddler. The first time we read it together, a flap fell off when he opened it the correct way. He was not being rough. I chucked it up to old glue, but to my dismay, two more flaps came off the next reading. My son loves spot books, so this was a huge disappointment.
B000ELJBAA|3.0|Gilmour's mastery of the imagination is enhanced when he is associated with his Pink Floyd band mates. This CD is certainly unusual and not so unusual that a Pink Floyd listener will be captivated by the experience.
B00CSYR432|5.0|Another wonderful indescribable movie from Studio Ghibli. I love everything about this movie. The scenery is gorgeous, You may want to move or at least go on vacation to Yokohama after this movie. it's worth watching just to look at the backgrounds. All the characters are likable and the story ends happily.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Some of the puzzles are easy but as you go along your brain really gets a workout with the more challenging ones.  fun game.
B00DYCFLRI|5.0|\\"Tonight Alive\\" really sets itself apart from the usual. Its not another \\"Paramore\\" band with an Australian catch. They stand alone! There wasn't a song on the album that I wanted to skip or did skip. All the tracks are good. So if you like \\"Paramore\\" chances are good that \\"Tonight Alive\\" will also be a good addition to your music library. I hope they continue to make stellar/clean music.
0425266060|5.0|If you loved 50 Shades of Grey like I did, you will enjoy this trilogy.<br />I did not find it as captivating, but it was still a must read.<br /><br />I don't know if I heard correctly, but I think this is going to become a movie also.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put it down. Really entertaining, not just sensual, also a drama, action and fantasy. A good book.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is definitely an app you want to invest in. 4 dollars may seem like a lot but time is money and you will save so much time using this app. It is not only more aesthetically pleasing but also more functional than the default keyboard for my S4. 5 stars as I have never looked back at using the default. The choice in languages alone is a feature to marvel at. Great app.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this to replace my original stock PS3 six axis controller from way back when. Works exactly as expected, albeit it's a bit heavier than the six axis due to the added rumble feature. Buying first party accessories is always the way to go, IMO.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I think there could be better instructions.. have a better help section.  Other wise fun to play.  I wish it flew together more.
B001EJGQTU|5.0|This documentary will blow your hair back.  It's outstanding.  The Robert McNamara who was interviewed for the film was NOT the Robert McNamara who served as Defense Secretary.  McNamara had the benefit of his \\"lessons\\" as well as greater historical context and perspective to draw upon to tell his story.  Regardless of what you might think about McNamara, the movie is a FANTASTIC and EXQUISITE look at history through his eyes.
B00B7PIRIE|4.0|Season 2 had one disk with distorted video.  No visible  scratches or stains on disk.  Cleaning the disk yielded no improvement.  All other disks played error free.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Finding Pride captured my imagination right from the start! I was looking for something with a well built story line, and the author certainly delivered just that! The characters and story were well developed and kept me wanting to read from page to page! Now, I'm hooked, and I'm looking forward to checking out other books from this author!
B001F12J0C|5.0|I love this purchase, a collector's item for me and I don't have that many DVDs, so it is a gret start!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A really good book and  I really enjoyed reading it for the second time already. Five out of five stars!!!
B00DNDR29I|5.0|With her sophomore album Janelle Monae continues with her Cindi Mayweather story, but this time the album take more 80's feel to it and also more of the tracks have less to with her Metropolis arc than both \\"Metropolis: The Chase\\" and \\"The Archandroid\\". The album which includes very eclectic collaborations from Solange, Erkyah Badu, Prince, Esperanza Spaulding, and Miguel; all of them wonderfully compliments Monae. The album includes interludes which in the form of radio spots continues Cindi's story and some of which are quite humorous. Highlights from the album included both the lead and sophomore singles \\"Q.U.E.E.N.\\" which features Erykah Badu and \\"Dance Apocalyptic\\" respectively, \\"Sally Ride\\", \\"Ghetto Woman\\", \\"What an Experience\\", \\"Electric Lady\\" featuring Solange, and \\"Givin Em What They Love\\" featuring Prince.  Overall very great album with a great throwback 80's vibe that sounds refreshing modern.
B00CHIY5OK|5.0|Everything about it! All over stunning album! This is what people need to hear and support artist like Disclosure! Whoop!
B008469DGY|5.0|I got this as a faotd and didn't really think I would like it. After I got the hang of it, it turned out to be pretty darned fun. It really is a fun game.
B00C061HZY|5.0|the vinyl lp that i ordered came in perfect conditions<br />thank you so much<br />my english<br />is<br />awful haha<br />bye!
B0058OUJA4|4.0|This is the first game I've had like this and didn't know what to expect. It's actually kinda fun once you play it a few times to figure it out. I guess it would be considered an 'old style' kind of game, but a lot of times they can be better than the newer ones.
140006922X|4.0|Extensive research into the first century reveals more about the context of Jesus' life and ministry than the content. The extensive notes show the plausibility of the author's claims.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This app sounds ridiculous, but it's funny as H&LL! The only thing I don't care for are the accessories options. They make the monkeys look like rappers or 'from da hood' so to speak. There should be different options to choose from like suits, sweatpants, jeans, leather jackets, etc. ANY clothing option would make a boxing monkey look funny, right?
B004TI5N38|5.0|Great characters and story! Included technical details about the construction of a nuclear weapon so was educational.  Baldacci did it again!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|as you can get on a tablet, I think. There are a few different planes, helo's, boats, etc. you get with the game, and more you can buy. The game works nicely on my Kindle. Gives you a decent idea what it might be like to fly one of these.
B00C0K6NUY|5.0|Didn't think it possible but that was better than white bones! Now I am a real fan of G Rahman M asters on. Bring on the next one
B0067R0APK|5.0|Like it but stll trying to figure out if can get movement in the weather.  I did put one icon in by mistake and can not figure out how to get rid of it.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|One of the best tetris-like games but need some time to understand all features. Very addictive, good performance on old devices (I'm using Xperia Arc). Now I have two favorite time-killers on my phone: this one and &#34;Drop 7&#34;. Still have not tried all of the game modes, stuck on Infinite. =)
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|The 5.1 DTS surround on the dvd is defective as well.  Only sound coming through left speakers (main and surround).
B004J4WNL2|5.0|It amaze me how this book was reading right into my soul, all my life, specially now in the adult life, I felt there's something wrong with me, but the only problem is my brain has a different chemistry. Thanks for this entertaining and reconforting book. I recomemnded 100%
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Pine is a great Kirk.  The new Star Trek is a great reboot of the original, and unlike other reboots, the story actually ties together pretty well, while at the same time doing justice to the original stories.  I was impressed with Star Trek 2... I would say more, but I don't want to give too much away!
B00A6RVRXG|4.0|I love Yo La Tengo; I always have.  But let's be honest: I don't think anyone really knows what they're doing--them included.<br /><br />I swear some of their songs are the most beautiful melodies ever invented (Our Way to Fall, Madeline, Moby Octopad, Little Eyes), but some I'd have a hard time feigning pride to if I found my kids producing such a sad cacophony with make-shift instruments in the garage.<br /><br />You'll hear sounds combined in ways you can't imagine on this album.  Some work, many don't.  But that's par for the course with this band.  Still, I don't seem to mind repeatedly listening to it as I try to figure out what's garbage and what's art;  I love Ya La Tengo.<br /><br />A final observation:  the Amazon reviews of this album make for very interesting reading.
B005KELR3A|5.0|my husband uses this kindle case to carry all his kindle gear.. very good quality case.  it is sturdy and he uses it all the time
B005K01VZS|5.0|Mitch is a talented writer and brought both men to life in this book. I enjoyed getting to know Albert and Henry.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|A very interactive social GPS with lots of information in real time. The cartoon characters make it goofy, so the bad news about the traffic jam doesn't kill you.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it. When i began reading this series, I felt it was eerily similar to 50 shades (with much better writing). Thankfully, about half way through the first book it veered on to its own course. The detailed descriptions of their romantic encounters get a little monotonous toward the end of the book, but the story line kept me completely engrossed.
140006922X|5.0|A great and educating read. Everyone should read this. It's a shame that the people who SHOULD read this are automatically against the book. It's a wonderful historical account. Fantastically researched. Super impressive.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I had forgotten how great this show was. My household has been through 3 discs in 3 days. ah, nostalgia
B001I9B9I4|5.0|A nice bit of romance well acted and presented. Not employed by you and being laconic I wrote what I wrote and will not again.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|It's great for taking videos and photos on my kindle fire! I would really recommend this app for kindle 5 star definitely
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Excelent story, it takes you to every corner with maximum detail, highly recomended to zombies storys reader's.<br /><br />Max Brooks Rules!
B00E193Y36|5.0|Love the band and this one is another great album. The live disc two is a fun addition. F You like 5FDP You need this one.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Did not have a disc with it. so i had to go to the Logitech site and download the drivers/programe
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Hazel, an amazing character with deep thoughts,witty humor, and a good heart. These characters all had their own traits and it was just an amazing book. I strongly recommend this book to people who don't cry easily (you'll probably cry anyway though)
1599290634|5.0|I like nearly every aspect of this art.  The imagination, creativity and detail is fantastic.  I like the fact that it is nearly all visual and very easy to look at.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy art or just visual pleasure.
B00CKR63F2|4.0|The Seal team did a wonderful job with this fantasy novel about Oria, a young girl who is thrust out of childhood in this modern day Native American coming-of-age tragedy and self-discovery. She finds love in ways she never expected, from family and new friends, while fighting an evil force with her new supernatural powers. Sheryl is a new author with wonderful ideas on where to take a story. You will never expect what happens in the final battle scenes, how she helps destroy the evil Ala and bring peace to the world.<br />I hope that you enjoy this novel as much as I have. It is a fast read and I couldn't put it down, finishing the novel within a day.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderfully writing, very touching book.  I read this in one sitting and cried the entire time.  Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B004J64QSI|5.0|We viewed this on PBS two years ago, have also seen two stage plays & then the movie, we just overall liked the stars in<br />this performance better, they brought back previous singers in the top roles at the end of this concert,.<br />If one likes stirring music, a bit of history this is a good start, or better yet read the book first. the original is long but very precise.
B00BVVA138|5.0|I was a bit skeptical of Jesse returning on vocals but he nailed it. Howard will be missed but this is a great start to the present and future of KSE!<br /><br />my favorite track and one I recommend:  The Hell in Me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a must game there is always something to do and you always make money, great game especially the goals that you have to do
B00EL8I8IS|3.0|Just my opinion but, zombies + PG-13 = oxymoron.<br />Very good movie that was cut too short with a lame ending.<br />Zombies were entertaining, scary and unique to some degree but they weren't emphasized enough in the movie.<br />Nothing new learned about zombies in this movie.<br />I was entertained till the end though.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|Nice little movie, I wish it was not as scarey and cartoons these days need to watch the violence and language.  I was expecting worse but it did have a good moral story to it and nice ending.  We have watched this a few times now and will watch it again I am sure.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|In Death of Kings, Bernard Cornwell has put together yet another must read. I've enjoyed the entire Saxon Chronicles series immensely. Well done. - Eric Schumacher, author of God's Hammer.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I think this book is funny and great book for kids and adults<br />I love the first and third books
076115678X|5.0|It has helped me in so many ways.  It most importantly helped me to love my hair no matter what.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I think the ghost of maple creek is a great game. You didn't  have to like a good mystery to play this game . It is a great game , I have played it 7 times .
B004EPYZXK|3.0|This is a \\"found footage\\" film to add to the overabundance of \\"found-footage\\" films. I thought it would be a fun watch, and it was okay, but got a little boring there just about halfway through. It couldn't keep my attention. Though there were a few good scare moments and interesting developments, as the action picked up the suspense and impact dwindled.<br /><br />Early on the film seemed cool, but the magic was lost. I suspect the home movie footage is supposed to build our concern for the characters, help us connect emotionally so there may be greater impact when the horrors unfold later. I didn't feel it.<br /><br />Good premise but I think the potential fell short due to poor direction, okay acting, and excessive focus on faux camera effects, which were over-done and unconvincing. Home movie cameras did not have zoom lenses, by the way.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because I thought the actors were a good fit for their rolls, and the space footage was pretty cool. I've seen worse films, but I've seen a lot better too.<br /><br />Interesting choice of credit music. We three kings? Oh, okay, I guess I get it.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|was pleasantly surprised... totally worth the time .. will be watching it again soon.. watch it .. trust me.. its good.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|So soothing to read myself to sleep with individualized ambience sounds. I can take my kindle to bed with me whether at home or at the hospital call room.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|For a free app, this one has a lot of features built into it.  My grandson loves art and certainly there is enough variety in this app to keep him entertained.  A good app with a lot of creative potential.  Recommend...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game because it is awesome and it is also the top ten on the charts also I love it!
B007WFTFG6|3.0|A nice little app for the very young set.  It's entertaining for the little one and I especially like the fact the it's not messy (lol).  Not the best app, but certainly not the worst either.  Can be a creative tool with a little instruction from the parents.
B000K3HTRY|4.0|An absolutely amazing movie with a superb cast!! We need more movies like this in the mainstream! Keep them coming!!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I really enjoy the challenge of this game.  It's easy to stop and start as needed.  The buttons. and scissors calls to the seamstress in me.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Was very happy with game until the update. Piece movement very jerky, jumpy when connecting pieces and rotation is more difficult. was a 5 star app but the improvements really killed the fluidity of moving the pieces
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is wonderful.  I can read it at home or wherever I am.  I have it downloaded on both my tablet and my phone. It is easy to use, lightweight, and has all the helps I need to work with.  I recommend it for anyone.  Thank you to the developer.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|An interesting look at life in North Korea.  Pyongyang with its phony properity notwithstading, North Korea is a civilization moving backward inTo oblivion.
B00CKYHH6O|4.0|The HD clarity and color is terrific.  It enhances the special effects, and thereby the morality and dramatics of the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun game, makes the time pass quickly.  Good graphics and easy to understand.  Wiould like a hint function on some of the more difficult levels.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is not light reading material. Some of the scenes were horrific, but the pace and the characters kept me wanting more. A terrific portrayal of oppression--both personal and political--and what it means (and costs) to be free. A humorous look at politicians--their egos and antics--provided a brief respite from the darker material, but for me, was not as effective as Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Well, the app is un installed. If the developer doesn't care to respond to problem reports, I don't care to have the app on my tablet. Going back to the web page, w/ all the ads.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I have to say that I'm not a big fan of office suites on the pc or mobile but this one isn't half bad. I use google docs for mobile so my files can be accessed from anywhere but this app has some features I've been waiting for in google docs mobile. I also enjoy that you can access all your google doc files from this app!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I've seen the other versions of this movie, but this one really is my favorite.
B002ZG981E|4.0|This film was meant to be watched on blu ray! If you like fantasy action thrillers than strap on your seat belts and hang on for the incredible ride that is Inception! Trust me, you havn't seen anything like this yet.<br />Great acting, writing, cg, cinematography, action<br />My only negatives would be the pacing and the length of the film which is the only thing keeping it from five stars
B0006GQMC8|5.0|could,nt get it on netflix so decided to buy my own . have,nt watched it yet  what more can i say
B00E97AZZK|5.0|Great movie. Nice to see a movie that didn't require bad language, nudity or gruesome killings. Nice job and thanks
141690977X|5.0|I watched the movie and immediately empathised with the characters, so I read the book. While the concept is not groundbreaking or complicated it really struck home for me. I can't speak for every woman but I know that in the past I psycho analysed every man I dated/liked trying to ascertain his true intentions and feelings behind each text message, email, call etc. I came up with wonderfully complex reasons for why he wasnt asking me out, calling me, texting me or basically showing more interest. I went to every reason I could come up with except for the most obvious- he wasn't interested.<br /><br />This book is not about manipulation, its about honesty. If you take what is said or not said at face value and that most men are honest, straightforward people then you have to go for the obvious reason. I know that I found it hard to accept at first and that its hurtful, but it hurts a lot less than chasing a man who doesnt want you or cherishing an unrealistic fantasy. It also hurts a lot less than dating a man who is ambivalent about you, then getting rejected. This book is about having boundaries, self respect and looking at things honestly. Its the advice you would give your little sister or best (if you are a very frank woman!).<br /><br />I try to think of it every time I find myself agonising about a man that I care about and worrying that the feeling isnt mutual.<br /><br />Anti feminist? Maybe, but I found it empowering! So it cant be all bad.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Nice to see that even though the story is told slightly differently than the first. It is still a great movie and I hope they continue to keep the crew together.
B00EQRP5LW|4.0|I really enjoy this album.  It is classic John Legend.  But that is also the major problem with it and why I did not give it 5 stars (I actually wanted to give it 3 & 1/2 stars but they dont allow you to).  The track list is great but each song sounds almost exactly like the one preceding it (stand outs from this critique are the first single &#34;Made to Love&#34;, &#34;Asylum&#34;, &#34;Save The Night&#34; and &#34;Who Do We Think We Are&#34;).  While classic Legend is good and the songs are very well written and the arrangements are on point it is just more of the same.  So I do recommend this album to anyone who loves John Legend the way he is.  Those looking for something different will find it in some songs just not all.  Yet again it is a good album through and through.
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|I always buy a new Deep Purple CD. I'm still getting used to it. It's hard to be critical when you love the band, even with the newer personnel. Great bunch of musicians. I think the average age of the group is about 67 years old. Nothing lasts forever. I'm 67. too! Still loving the Rock!!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Not as good as some of the older Clancy stuff but better than most spy novels out there these days.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers by Diffenbach<br /><br />This is an interesting read because of the author's use of a Naive Narrator. When the story is told from the viewpoint of someone who is mentally or emotional ill, dysfunctional, or too young (think Huck Finn) to really understand the full ramifications of his/her actions or that of others, then an interesting and sometimes painful dicotomy arises between the &#34;mature&#34; reader and the main character. In other words, we know more than the narrator/main character. Such tension and agony arises as we watch the narrator plunge him/herself into more destructive episodes. That is the basis of this story which is filled with dysfunctional people.<br />What a pity they did not have a strong religious base from which to make decisions such as love one another, no adultery, loyalty to each other, adherence to proven commandments for happiness (wickedness never was happiness) etc.<br />What a strong indictment of generational dysfunction and how difficult it is to escape. The mentally ill mother leaves two daughters behind to struggle with the same kinds of mental illness, - One whose disloyalty and immorality produces such guilt that it destroys the only long lasting relationship she has in life, - And one whose obsessive loyalty to that dysfunctional sister prevents her from moving forward with her own life and loving relationships.<br />Then we have the main character's mother (and dad, if known) abandoning her child, which leads that child to feel unloveable, unwanted, and  unworthy of love from anyone from there on, who then acts out in self-destructive ways, only to have the child/narrator do the very same thing to her female child. What a pity that the baby was not a boy because it seems that the male personality in this story is the only nearly sane person. And it is more than raging hormones that makes these women nuts! Grant - such a strong and giving name. Victoria - who is anything but victorious for 99% of theplot. The author needs to write a novel on the language of names!<br />The redeeming aspect of this novel for me is the actual language of flowers. My grandmother Angie Gabbott (1878) and her life time lover, my grandfather Robert Lindsay McGhie (1874)courted each other through letters wherein pressed flowers were inserted, expressing their current feelings and level of love and devotion to each other. It is very old fashioned and very sweet. Angie went on to teach the language of flowers to her children, one of which, Mary, my mother, taught to me. So my yard is filled with a variety of flowers, herbs, flowering bushes, and trees.<br />And being a self-described Shakespeare afficionado, I see the Elizabethan use of flowers describing characters and feelings as a device used through several centuries. That was what made this book fun for me. But then I'm a little weird. But knowing this kind of communication allows a certain level of refinement to enter into one's life too. Long live flower language. Let's pass it on to the next generation!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second one picked up right at the end of the first and does not disappoint. The series was made for young adults but adults of all ages will enjoy these stories.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|at Christmas time this movie was hard to find  in local stores, it was a gift for are grandsons, which is what they wanted.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Far better than the movies I cheered on the heroes and booed everyone else. The author points you square in the protagonists shoes
030716327X|5.0|This book has become what we take to the parents of a newborn.  I always keep a stack on hand.
B001FOR5XU|5.0|The book gives us a more in depth look at the protagonist and his plight Their is a relationship with the zombies that should have been in the movie
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Kindle for android is a pale shadow of the feature rich version for iPhone or iPod touch.  I would like to know when you plan to upgrade to the apple model.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is so well written! Reading it was a complete joy. I would suggest all men and women read this book. It will make you rethink time life and the human experience.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Very good I loved it you should read it so very good<br /><br />  Ps this is James bond yes I read books
B001HN697M|5.0|Great 3 rd  piece of an already great movie line cant wait to see the 4 th movie when it comes out
B00B7Y0206|5.0|For Kindle Fire HD, I have none of the problems other reviewers have described.  A YouTube account is not needed to use this app.  Some elements do require an account, but that is no different than the YouTube site itself.  I've tried other apps for YouTube but this app was instantly my new favorite.  It downloads fast.  There's no noticeable buffering during playback.  The video is full screen and appears to be hi-def.  The U.I. is intuitive.  The ads are a bit much but navigation around them is not too much of a problem.
B009O07NMA|5.0|love the new cd, more up beat and love the songs would love to see him in concert for the real deal
B005VPRG10|5.0|Great.  Just what the grandboy wanted. Lego products are exceptional, never ever can you go wrong with a Lego toy.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Love the Dvd, great story line and coming out - all the trials and tribulations of knowing who are and love story
B008RA3X5E|4.0|The nice dim feature plays a large role besides the normal alarm clock features. Would recommend this to anyone who wants a decent alarm clock application.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This headset has an awesome sound. The controls (volume and play-pause, next, prev) are also great.<br />Sometimes (and specially on Windows 8, not when using in Ubuntu 13.04) it loses connection with the transmittor. After 5 - 10 seconds it auto connects.<br />If they hadn't this problem, they would be excellent.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Tricky but useful. The application provides you with several details on the screen. The great thing about it was the moving background. It was just like if you were travelling around the globe to either get dark,light,stars,or no stars. Would recommend this application to anyone.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This story had been recommended to me last year and I finally downloaded it to Kindle & took it on a recent trip overseas. I had trouble putting it down, even to go touring! Loved the story and the relationship between Bob and his owner. A delightful read.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|The Greatest Show on Earth!!! Madonna just keeps topping herself and the MDNA World Tour is a feast for the eyes!
B000069KE0|5.0|This album turned the rock world on it's ear and it took rock a few years to realize what happened. This and their first album was the best non-pop they have ever done, chock full of arresting arrangements so satisfying, it demanded a double record release.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What a great game absolutely for everyone young or old this game is for all.Fun is the one word I would use to describe it.
B003JSSPSY|3.0|If you liked the first season you will enjoy the second as well because it is more of the same.  For me it began to become a little repetitive in terms of good guys, bad guys, plot etc.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book has changed my view on life,and I will enjoy reading it over and over again. Each time enjoying every Tuesday with Morrie.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|If you enjoy a good romp with swords, sorcerers, and the odd monster thrown in you will enjoy this show.  The wardrobe is fresh, and very well done.  The casting, with the possible exception of Zeddicus, is Excellent.  Bridget Regan is superb in the role of Kahlan.  One could nit pick about the occasionally monotonous fight choreography, but at the end of the day it's good entertainment.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Neil Gaiman can take you on impossible journeys while making them as believable as your morning coffee. I am a fan bought and paid. He crafts worlds that coexist with our daily lives and maybe Re just beyond our grasp. This particular tale is brought out to a fine conclusion and was a great short read
B00CWY76CC|5.0|never plaved a game like this one! so challenging. new kind of puzzle game. wish I could have played past room 10...
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|How can I get the older version with html? This one sucks!!!  I can`t find anything in this awful version. I loved the old gmail!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My friends and I can't get enough of this show - even my husband is intrigued...may the seasons keep coming!
0375703764|2.0|While I applaud the author's unconventional use of paragraphs, pages and direction, and I also admire the publisher for the avant-garde type-setting on the page, I have to wonder if this book were written in a conventional style, if there would be such a raucous about it. The writing boarders on arrogant and pompous, the story at times intriguing, captivating and interesting, also has footnotes and a text book allure. I tried to wrap myself into this book.  It definitely doesn't lend itself to casual reading.  When I sat down and read, it flowed a lot better.<br />I still feel flipping the book over, upside down, and one word on a page are gimmicks good writers don't need to use to get you completely involved in their story.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Hey minecraft how about survival that works for more than a day. Fix it please. Other than that great game.
B00EEN7CAK|4.0|I like coppola's style, very artsy and stylistic.<br />very entertaining and light. A window into the world of La's youth.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|Kids love it!!! They play for hours learn a lot from the game they know what to do at the airport now
B0007OCG56|4.0|A very nice movie that illustrates the lengths that any parent will go to provide a better life for their child. And of course Adam Sandler is in it so you know it has its comedic moments too!
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Silliness at its BEST! I love Mel Brooks! My sense of humor in and out.<br />Some of the best one liners still quoted by kids today.
B00542USJW|5.0|There are only a few words that can describe this movie and one of them is classic! Michael Jordan plays in this comedic yet heart-warming movie about returning to your life long dream and finding inspiration in the most unlikely places. A must see family movie good for all ages!
B003B96AOW|5.0|I love deadpool let's just get that out of the way hahaha I've played the game and I seriously had to get my hands on this figure seriously, so went ahead and bought it....THIS FIGURE IS JUST SO FLIPPING COOL ! I L O V E IIIIT so he come's with two swords, two guns,two sais and a assault rifle all fit very well in the hands but the two katana are some what harder to get adjusted so what ever you prefer for deadpool to hold, also a very well detail base where you can actually see bullet casing's everywhere along on the ground with some bullet holes in the wall having this feeling that some bad guys wasted all their ammo on Deadpool not knowing he has some sick healing factor and Wade is like ok guys my turn any way on the back of the box there is a summary of Deadpool if you don't know his origin all of that is very informative not to mention on the side of the box there is nice artwork of the character to, now there is two Variants of this figure one with mask and one with out the mask but it seems like a lot of folks prefer the masked one the most as well do I if you haven't played the game you should cause it's really awesome not like batman Arkham Asylum but it does come close of how funny any way  paint application is very well done on my there is no miss paint but for some reason mine is harder to stand so I have to move the right foot around to get it standing the way I want but other than that I would highly recommend this to a hardcore Deadpool fan or a collector cause let's be honest with each other who wouldn't want the famous annoying merc in there collection ?<br /><br />Articulation: Head moves side to side, both arms move out and forward, single jointed elbow, wrist move side to side,<br />small amount of waist articulation cause his belt hender's the movement, ball jointed legs, double jointed knees, and ankle movements side to side<br /><br />Height: 7 inch<br /><br />My final score: easy 10
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I watched on a flight.  It's a goodie.  Great picture and story dedicated to Steve Jobs.  So sweet. Would watch again.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|LOVE THIS CD!! PLAY IT ALL THE TIME. REALLY LIKE MOST OF THE SONGS THOUGH THERE ARE SOME i DON'T. OVERALL i REALLY LIKE IT
B00CSYR432|4.0|My husband and I enjoy Ghibli films, big fans! From Up on Poppy Hill, it was sort of different. I liked Umi and Shun, the two main teenagers and I liked the relationship between them but I got kind of weirded out towards the end when they thought they were brother and sister. We find out in the very end that they aren't. I guess what I didn't like about the movie was the end, it just kind of ends, but the beginning/middle of the was great!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The sound and picture quality is great.<br />Finally, it seems that the Digital Copy (iTunes) OR Vudu/UV/Flixster allows you to download the HD copy!!!  It might not be new, but I think my last digital copy from physical disc only allowed Standard definition.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I'm new to the Jo Nesbo/Harry Hole series and have loved each one. Well written, plotted and a great development of characters.  Very similar and should be liked by Henning Mankel fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a GREAT mind challenging game... It really makes you think, it is really a good brain teaser.... I would recommend this game to a friend.....
B0049J0DC8|5.0|My son is obsessed with this movie! He watched it multiple times in the 3 day rental and then received it as a gift.
B00EQNYOYU|3.0|Now I have never been a huge fan of NIN but I do like a lot of his music and I don't like what he has to say most of the time.  I have enjoyed it work on movie soundtracks as of late so I had was hoping this album would be good.  To be honest I am very unimpressed.  I don't think he has updated any of his samples in the last 10 years.  There are a couple of good tracks but in general a very vanila album for NIN.  In general the album boarded my and isn't worth the message he sends with his lyrics.  Listen if you want.
0812550706|3.0|I wanted to read this before the movie came out, wanted to see what the hype was about. I was very interested for about the first 100 pages, then it became a tedious and repetitive slog in the space-station battle-room of battle after battle after battle with the school officials trying to make it tougher and tougher and more impossible for Ender to win, but he always does anyway, yada yada yada blah blah blah. It got so I just didn't care anymore, the characters were so bland and mechanical. And what's with them running around naked all over the place? Is there something about Mr. Card that we ought to worry about?<br />  I lost interest even though Ender was finally being launched into deep space to fight the Buggers. I didn't even care, I returned it to the library without finishing it. I skipped the last 75 pages or so. This is one of those situations where the movie may actually be better.<br />  I don't understand why this is a \\"classic.\\" Maybe it's because I'm over 40 and this was written for adolescent boys and just doesn't appeal to me the same way taut, smart thrillers by Clive Cussler do.
B008JFUR10|5.0|The dialogue is absolutely awful at some points. There's really no reason to believe there's a romantic connection between the two leads. The ending is predictable, melodramatic and cheesy.<br /><br />There are large robots that fight crazy Lovecraftian monsters. It's beautiful and awesome. Five stars.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The tech support is outstanding.  I am not a superstar Apple user, so I encountered some difficulties with installation.  Simple phone call and Tino worked me through installing needed driver for MacPro.  Hats off to Tino and Alfa.  I can now use wifi on the boat and receive excellent internet connection!!
B0093H8HXS|5.0|This is a great processor, I recommend it for cheap builds, and or non heavy gaming computers. The processor is great for your every day, business, and casual needs. If you are looking to edit/game i would go with a i5 or up. But over all, great deal!
B002ZG99TA|4.0|No doubt about it,  &#34;Unstoppable&#34; is a great picture.  Unfortunately, Hollywood did take a lot of liberties in the making of this picture, and some of the scenes were just a bit on the &#34;unbelievable&#34; side. But otherwise, a great movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think it could of had a little less sex, but it was still an awesome book. I have recommended it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Excellent game, very well designed! Love it! Nice game for kids,teen's and adults alike. A must play for everyone! Install this app!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not believe my Mother turned me on to this book. It was really good book. It doesn't hurt your intimacy either.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|A cross between hunger games and Lord of the flies, this book held my attention tremendously. I think I read it in about 2 days. Can't wait for the movie. Starting second book shortly. Awesome!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book kept me turning the ages for sure. I think it gets to be a little much in the end
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I am able to sync with a devices for on the go editing. Easy to use on every device. Ty
B00319ECGU|5.0|I graduated high school in '75, so I saw Dirty Harry in junior high.  I bought a Model 29 in 1989 just because it was so great.  I've been a fan of .44s ever since (having acquired two Model 629's since..)  I load all of my ammo and love the versatility of the .44. Dirty Harry and Magnum Force are great movies.  The Enforcer and Dead Pool are fine and still fun Dirty Harry movies.  I think Sudden Impact is a crummy movie, poor plot, and Sondra Locke is a terrible actress.  Clint was crazed for a few years in his life (maybe she was okay off screen...)  I bought this set because I got motivated by an article in American Rifleman magazine about the Model 29 and it's history.  The whole story of Elmer Keith and the inventino of the .44 Magnum is a very interesting read.  I'm sure Smith & Wesson were glad these movies were made....
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|So This is not my favorite music genre, but MDBTF and Throne showed me that Kanye was clearly the hardest working and most innovative and talented musical mind out there today.  No one seems to work harder to make something new.  This disc is okay but I have not kept it in heavy rotation yet like the others.  Hardens back to 808s too much in my opine. Still impressive, just not as much fun.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I found this a great game!!!!  Very entertaining and the plant's, flowers, birds, building, and people are so colorful.  I enjoy this game.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This series is a great read. Good story line. Leaves you wanting more! Can't wait to finish the whole series.
1442361557|4.0|This review was originally posted on [...]<br /><br />As a general rule, I really do enjoy Philippa Gregory's writing. I am a sucker for historical fiction... and especially when the historical fiction centers around Tudor England or the era that preceded the Tudor rule (namely, the Cousins War).  However, one problem that I typically encounter with Gregory's writing is that it runs dry about half way through her books... and her books are usually around 500 pages (15 CDs? Hello?!) and that can cause some serious problems. So when I received The White Princess as an audio book - I was initially concerned but ended up being very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I have never listened to an audio book before so the entire process and experience was totally new to me. I couldn't help chuckling the first few times that the reader, Bianca Amato, did a male voice but found that I became totally engrossed by the story. I came to the point that I couldn't wait to make longer car trips so that I could hear more of Elizabeth's story. By the way, Amato did a fantastic job. I found that listening to the book, rather than reading it, kept me from becoming trapped in the slower points of the story and kept me riveted the entire time. I truly think that listening to Gregory's books is the better option for me.<br /><br />It's hard for me to actually comment on the story itself. If you read the synopsis (or if you didn't), you'll know that The White Princess follows the story of Elizabeth, wife of Henry VII, mother of Henry VIII, and the last true York princess. Gregory takes the facts of Elizabeth's life and embellishes in a way that is historically accurate for the time period, as well as honorable and respectful of the historical figures that she has chosen to focus on. Was Elizabeth's story interesting? Absolutely. This woman endured so much and found the will to keep moving forward. Her brothers were the missing boys from the Tower of London and heck, she was the mother of Henry VIII. I do think that this is one of the better books out of The Cousins War series.<br /><br />I think that if you're a fan of historical fiction -especially English historical fiction- you would enjoy this story. If you're like me and get overwhelmed by the who's who of historical fiction, do what I did and take sometime to do a quick Wikipedia scan and get a general timeline and family tree down. I found that it helped me tremendously. And I definitely would recommend checking out the audio book - I enjoyed it, immensely.y VIII.

0345535421|5.0|I love how the book is set up with each character getting a chapter. It's easy to get lost in the story.
B0070TRH6O|5.0|Excellent resource for parents, teachers, and others who want to understand how the child's brain develops and what is needed for parenting. This book provides insights that are critical for relational development and emotional regulation in children, and they fly in the face of what parents have &#34;traditionally&#34; thought was good parenting, for instance, reasoning with a very emotionally upset child. A must read.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a free app very additive. I play every day.  On some occassions the game will freeze on you and that gets frustrating.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I am still learning this new world of apps, but I like this app. I hard a hard time trying to make it work &amp;I think I figured it out, but it never did sound, operator error I think.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Great documentary to watch especially if you work in music or just love music! Many heavy hitting artists weigh in with their opinions about this cool old-school studio.
B007CLSE8K|5.0|I smiled throughout the whole film, Matthew Macfadyen and Logan Lerman are brilliant, as are everyone else. My GO TO movie, never gets boring. MUST WATCH, best adaptation of the classic yet!
B004JMZPJG|4.0|This camera case is the perfect size for my digital SLR. Even with a telephoto lens attached it fits. However, if you need a bag that holds extra lenses, this isn't the bag for you. There is room for a handful of small accessories, but not much more. Also, if you are really into photography and carry your camera with you everywhere, purchase something sturdier. This will be good for light to moderate use, but not heavy use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great I love it and my kids love it too. it is fun for the whole family and can be fast paced.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I got this game a while ago and was incredibly pleased. This is a very fun game. Managed to get 3 stars in every place. Changed phones, now most places are locked and telling me to buy them. If I click on restore, it says try again later. I get my restaurants back, you get 5 stars.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I waited until the price for the 3-volume set of the 2009 Blu-Ray version of the Star Trek series fell to the $100 range. The wait was worth it. Some commented that they preferred to have the old version with all of its flaws. Well, that's on the discs as well as the digitally-enhanced version.<br /><br />Other people have done a masterful detailed description of the contents. I would have liked more background of Star Trek features included, but, in the nearly 50 years since its broadcast there have been galaxies of such discussions composed and still available with a minimum of effort on the intertubes whatchamacallit. I can easily find detailed synopses of the episodes elsewhere, and Wikipedia and IMDB can provide other details not found in the disc cases. There's no pleasing the people who want a multimedia Star Trek encyclopedia included in the set. I'm quite contented with googling for content.<br /><br />The disc cases were sturdy and the discs secure and in good condition. The video was crisp, the audio was clear. And, most importantly for me, the closed captions are accurate with only brief omissions of dialogue, but dramatically better than discs of more recent movies and series.<br /><br />It's a good buy.
B0097BY3K6|5.0|What is not to love about David Garrett's music. He is a master violinist. He takes music from a land far away and reintroduces it into a treasured piece for the future. All the great symphonies of old are not forgotten, but renewed. I would love to attend one of his concerts someday.
0375413405|3.0|Julia Child revolutionized French cooking in America, but so many modern chefs have learned her wonderful lessons that a more modern, practical, easy to read book might be better. That said, this is a classic and nice to have in my cookbook collection
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I have been looking for an app like this for some time, and finally found a good one. I can create multiple notebooks for every need, and lock up the ones I want to be private with a password. I haven't found anything about Handy Note Pro that I don't like.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I have a MBP retina with only two 3.0 USBs this hub solve the issue and it's also compatible with USB 2.0 for my old hard drive and DVD drive. Great produc I had not have the chance to check the riading a writing speed but it seems to work fast.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This book is heart warming any touching! I would obviously recommend this book to all of my friends and family!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book has interesting characters with fascinating issues.  I was drawn in immediately, and my interest never flagged.  Very entertaining--a great beach book.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|There is no word for this....I just loved it. Recommend this. Is way better than my old Kindle Fire USB. Not a waste of money!!!!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a short yet long book about wolves and the klondike
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The best alarm clock in the whole wide world... Ever! I love the features on it. Very accurate no problems what so ever.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|It was so nice to see a movie that let you look through the zombies perception. And I really loved the story line of the movie. Just overall a good movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game really enjoy playing it. Love the daily challenges and weekly ones. A lot of fun with the different worlds also and items you have to collect. Never gets boring.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|First and foremost, it works!  Though it has a limited sampling of services available, it's Google and I'm sure they'll improve it in due time.<br /><br />I'd like to state for the record, that I use [...] to do a lot of my casting and the Chrome tab streaming feature has yet to disappoint.  Just make sure that if you are going to use it that you either don't have a ton of web traffic going on or purchase Connectify Hotspot, ([...] there is a 30% sale going as of this writing,) and put it on the PC you're going to be using most to stream to the Chromecast.  If you plan on using this in a hotel just do yourself a favour right now and go purchase that software and get it all set up before you leave.<br /><br />All that said, my only real big gripes with the item right now are that you can't stream from an Android device and certain services, (read Amazon streaming!,) don't work with it at this time.  I hold faith in Google that they will open these gates a little at a time and find the best solution for everyone.<br /><br />Seriously though, go buy it and Connectify Hotspot and it'll cost you a whopping $65 for something this portable. Yeah, totally worth it!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I'm kinda hard to wake up sometimes and this alarm won't get me up its not loud enough,so if I was u I wouldn't get it
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was pretty intriguing. I liked the development of all the characters. All of the character's lives connected in some way. One criticism is that I could've done without the character, Tess. I enjoyed her storyline, but felt that it did not really connect to the rest of the story. I would have enjoyed Tess' story in a sequel, perhaps. About 50% of the way through, I was ready to stop reading. The story became rather boring at that point. I pushed through to complete the book and was rather satisfied with the ending. I did actually recommend this book to a friend but I am not necessarily shouting from the rooftop about it. Good read, though.
B00E8AVNBI|5.0|DEAD IN TOMBSTONE has the makings of a cult classic. Danny Trejo gives a gritty performance in this devil may care tale of revenge. Danny Trejo's trip from beyond the grave is spellbinding in every sense of the word. Mickey Rourke's Satanic presence is an absolute send up as only Rourke can give you. This may be director Roel Rein&eacute;'s masterpiece.
B002QYNIHU|1.0|I bought this for my son for his birthday becuase he loves the cartoon.  I figured it must be pretty well made given the price of it....NOT! As soon as we took it out of the box he head fell off. Its supposed to pop back on but it wasnt very secure. I called amazon to notify them of this thinking it was a defect. They sent the replacement only to have the same exact thing happen. Definatley wouldnt recommend this product to anyone if theyre expecting to play wih it. Waste of money. Slightest move makes the head come off!!!!!!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|THOR's cast of Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Tom Hiddleston and Sir Anthony Hopkins are excellent. I thought Kenneth Branagh's direction was very good. The story line was captivating. THOR has been around a while and this film captured the very essence of his realm.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the adventures of Nate and his friends. I can't wait to read the next book. Highly recommend
B000V6MQV4|5.0|I love Maroon 5. Adam Levine's voice is so good and the music is great. If you like Maroon 5 then get this CD.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|This is the movie only, plain and simple. The movie was, is and will always be great, but a few extra features would be nice. Looks like I will need to repurchase it at Target to get what I want (after waiting several months for my pre-release purchase from Amazon).
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|Very good movie!!!! Very surprised in the quality and acting. Hopefully they expand on this. Would recommend to anyone that likes action movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. Simple yet entertaining perfect for the little girl who wants a horse. Very impressed with the detail that went in to this.
B00CTT9646|2.0|I can only hope that mine was an anomaly.  I really wanted to love the phaser.  I do love QMx as a company; they make awesome replicas, so I can only assume that they outsourced the assembly of these replicas to someone less interested in quality than the folks at QMx.  My phaser came with the spinner barely moveable and the handle off-center.  Sadly, I will be returning this and just buying the movie until QMx themselves come out with a product that I can buy from them directly.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is the first App I've had in a while that made me say WOW! I'm actually using the radio in my truck trying to finds songs that I don't know the name of or the Artist. It hasn't failed yet!
B0000027F8|5.0|I got this CD years ago after hearing the song, \\"Cowboys and Angels.\\" Over the years, I have grown to appreciate all the songs on the CD more and more. This is a CD I know I'll play for years to come because the songs are just that good. But I consider \\"Cowboys and Angels\\" to be one of the most beautiful songs ever written.

B00CSYRHG6|5.0|I approached the film with slight trepidation based on the few negative reviews here (slamming the film on being boring).<br />I have seen all Miyazaki's works and indeed I find some of them to be rather mundane (for example, I did not enjoy Arrietty at all).<br />However, Poppy Hill is a great movie - it definitely is my favorite right behind Totoro.<br />It has all great elements - loss, romance, coming of age, etc.<br />I haven't had a good cry (Umi's dream sequence) in a movie for a while. :)<br />Watch this movie with your loved ones and I am sure that you will enjoy this gentle, wonderful film.<br />By the way, love that classic song \\"Ue o Muite Arukou\\" in the movie (don't quite understand the negative comment about the movie being akin to a musical).
B005H29GSI|4.0|The grandkids love this game... they play it all the time now.  Even the older children enjoy playing it with the younger ones, and so do some of the adults!

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I just received the Chromecast expecting to be able to &#34;cast&#34; anything I was viewing in my Android tablet's Chrome browser to my TV via my WiFi network. I also expected the tablet to act as the remote, allowing start, stop, fast forward and reverse of the displayed video.<br /><br />But, so far, you get this functionality on Android devices ONLY if using Youtube, Netflix or Google Movie apps. The mobile Chrome browser does not support Chromecast, so you can't cast videos from generic web pages. That's a huge deficiency, IMHO.<br /><br />If you use a Windows or Mac PC, you can add a Chromecast extension to the Chrome browser and then you get the ability to cast any web page to your TV. Control of the video is from the PC, so you need to have the PC near the TV. If that's the case, Chromecast is just a glorified HDMI cable. So here's where there's room for improvement: it would be great if you could set up your PC to cast to your TV but still be able to use your Android phone or tablet as the remote control.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Inexpensive.<br />When used with a full PC and Chrome browser, can view any web page on your TV via WiFi.<br />Also can view video and photos stored on your Android or PC device.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Use with Android devices limited to a few apps (YouTube, Netflix, Google Play).<br />Chrome mobile needs to be updated to support Chromecast extension so that any web page can be cast to the TV.<br />No external Remote included so you need to be near the &#34;casting&#34; source to control videos, etc.

B00AZMFJYA|3.0|My mother is a Star Trek fan and I'm a Star Wars fan, so when I went the see the new Star Trek in 2010. I was blown away and bought it when it come out on DVD. The second one had an unknown villain to me, I watched the trailer about 50 times and couldn't figure out the villain. On opening day, my mom and I went to the movies, I have admit it was a bit long but the villain creeped me out. I thought \\"Who is this guy?\\" As Benedict Cumberbatch pronounced that he was Khan. Everyone in the went \\"Ah.\\" I had NO Clue who this Khan was and that was what caught my attention. I hear that the old Khan had long hair and just about as diabolical as this new version of Khan. This was a good movie but, it did lose me in the middle but got me back with this villain. Another one to add to my collection.

B00EMJD6TC|3.0|I really love Brad Pitt movies, and I'm a fan of The Killing, so I was excited to see a film that also had the female star of The Killing playing Pitt's wife (I never remember her name.).  Anyway, maybe I was expecting too much? To be fair I bought the uncut version, and now I see there is a reason why they cut the films down.  The uncut film was a bit slow and lacked the edge I was expecting.  I'm not into blood and guts but, honestly, I think I saw more gore in the cable show The Walking Dead than I did in this film!  I was expecting more gruesome zombie action than what this film delivered.  Did I like the film? Yes.  Would I see it again? Yes.  But it could have been better.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Notice I am a verified buyer of this product. I installed in on my Vizio Widescreen TV but can't use it until I get an iOS device.<br />In order to operate the Chromecast you need an HDMI port on your TV (which I have), and either a USB port OR a free electrical outlet for power. Since my TV does not have a USB port I had to find a free electrical outlet in order to plug in a good-sized plug. Three weeks later, I am still looking for a free electrical outlet.<br />I was hoping this would eliminate my need to have my PC connected to my TV, but Chromecast only supports Youtube and Netflix. Amazon, do you hear me? It does not support Prime Instant Videos!<br />When I tried to access Amazon Prime via the browser on my Android Nexus 4, I got a message saying that Amazon Prime is only available for streaming with the Apple iOS. Even if I was able to test it with an iPad, I have doubts that it would be a seamless experience (possible aspect ratio errors).<br />Amazon needs to put out a Prime Instant Video App and learn to play nice with Google in order for the Chromecast to be a blast.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The first STAR TREK reboot was something refreshing.  Pleasing enough to fans, a delightful film to those like me who only had a fleeting brush with the TREK legacy.  It featured a freshly complex plot (which demanded repeated viewings), superb acting, brilliant effects, and the stubborn mastery of J. J. Abrams, whom love or hate, always does things his own way.  What the first TREK lacked, however, was a villain.<br /><br />Enter INTO DARKNESS.  When a nobody, John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), declares all-out war on Star Fleet Command, it prompts panic, confusion, and terror.  James Kirk (Chris Pine) finds himself behind the helm of the Enterprise once more, with his trust crew in tow.  As he wrangles yet again with his personality foil Spock (Zachary Quinto), Kirk faces the greatest challenge of his young life: a mission of vengeance and nobility, once where darkness lurks in the most unlikeliest of places...and death waits for no man.<br /><br />Okay, melodrama aside, STARK TREK INTO DARKNESS is a fantastic film.  The acting is on-par with, if not better than, the first (ignoring Eric Bana's unusually wooden turn as that film's villain).  Pine gets to show a little more range, as does Quinto; meanwhile, Simon Pegg gets in some nice zingers, and Bruce Greenwood has a few great moments.  One nice surprise here is Peter Weller, as the Star Fleet commander; it's nice to see him in a prominent role again, getting some nice material to chew through.<br /><br />But of course, the talk is all about Cumberbatch.  The entire cast (especially Pine, Greenwood, Quinto, and Weller) deserves high praise...but a deliciously delightful villain always steals the show.  There's not exactly anything we haven't seen before; rather, it's we haven't seen it on this high-tech of a scale: a solid, menacing performance set against high-octane action and brilliant special effects.  What's more, for the uninitiated, the role is an unpredictable one.  The film as a whole throws a few nice knocks, and some interesting homages.  J. J. Abrams and company are keen to keep old fans while recruiting new ones.  STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS isn't an original film, per say (part of that is intentional, understand); but it's still a refreshing one, with great performances, great effects, and a killer plot.  If you like your popcorn films made by talented people who actually put thought into what they're doing, this one's for you.ce knocks, and some interesting homages.  J. J.

B0019IIPXQ|4.0|Pitch Black (David N. Twohy, 2000)<br />[originally posted 29Mar2000]<br /><br />Pitch Black has probably left the theaters in your area. This is a bad thing, because you probably didn't see it (judging by its revenues to date). Or maybe not.<br /><br />This movie is driving me nuts. I don't know what to say about it. How can a movie have so many good things going on and still manage to miss the mark as often as Pitch Black did? David Twohy gives us what would be a creditable first film, if it weren't his third. And Pitch Black suffers from many of the same shortcomings as did his last, The Arrival. However, there are a lot of things about Pitch Black that are stronger, so Twohy IS learning from his mistakes. He's just not put everything together in the right way yet. And that's maddening, especially given that there are enough good things about this movie to make it worth seeing.<br /><br />We open on a spaceship carrying a bunch of passengers, an undisclosed nonhuman cargo (which is never mentioned in the film, only in the Sci-Fi Channel show Into Pitch Black, leading me to believe there will be a sequel), and a very dangerous criminal, Richard Riddick (Multi-Facial's Vin Diesel). The ship passes through something-- perhaps a meteor storm, perhaps the rings of a planet-- and the ship is bombarded with small rocks that penetrate the hull-- and the captain's sleep chamber, killing him. The navigation officer, Fry (Visitors' Radha Mitchell), is left to try and crash-land the ship on the nearest celestial body, a moon orbiting the large planet with the big rings of the rocks that may have penetrated the ship. In order to successfully land the ship, Fry has to jettison the cargo, and the ship is still overweight. Will she jettison the passengers in order to try and save herself and the other surviving officer? Or will she try and save as many people as possible at the risk of her own life?<br /><br />Obviously, what you've got could be an exceptionally suspenseful piece of filmmaking. And it ain't. It's a confusing jumble. Fortunately, things get better form there as the survivors attempt to figure out if anything lives on this desert moon, how they're going to get off it, and how they're going to survive when Riddick has escaped and is (presumably) hunting them.<br /><br />Despite the opening mess, there are some incredibly suspenseful scenes here, though not with enough consistency to make it a credible suspense film. There's also a good deal of comedy, both intentional and not. There's a great soundtrack--Graeme Revell here has done his best ominous work since he revamped SPK's Zamia Lehmanni album for Dead Calm over a decade ago. Also, remember the name David Eggby. He's not well-known yet, but his grasp of the art of cinematography deserves an Oscar. The scenery in this film, despite being desolate, is absolutely stunning. There's one particular scene (it was thought so much of by the powers that be that it made it into Into Pitch Black, but seeing it on a TV doesn't do it justice) of the ringed planet coming over the moon's horizon that's literally breathtaking. This guy is GOOD. (Previous to this, his most notable outing was the original Mad Max, and the two share a good deal of traits vis-a-vis cinematography.)<br /><br />Another very strong point for the movie is the ensemble cast. This is really Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell's movie, and both are very, very good. I don't know what they got paid to be in this movie, but I'm guessing that both will be commanding many times that sum within a couple of years. Excellent supporting roles are turned in by Claudia Black (Farscape), Keith David (Armageddon), Cole Hauser (son of Wings Hauser, another longtime favorite of mine), and especially another newcomer, Rhiana Griffith.<br /><br />Okay, so if there's all this good about the movie... why am I not so thrilled with what happens when you put it all together? Maybe I saw it too close to The Ninth Gate. Maybe David Twohy was absolutely the wrong person to direct this (I ache to think what, say, Ridley Scott would have done with this cast and script). There are many, many good reasons to see this film, but you'll probably walk out thinking \\"that should have been miles better than it was.\\" Still, it's worth seeing because its component parts, taken by themselves, are fantastic. *** ½olutely the wrong person to direct this (I ache to think what, say, Ridley Scott would have done with this cast and script).
