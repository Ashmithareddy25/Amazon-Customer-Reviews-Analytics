1442353279|4.0|I don't know what it is, but something about Arnold Schwarzenegger has intrigued me for as long as I can remember.  Since I've never been attracted to the muscular bodybuilder types, I knew it wasn't a physical attraction, but maybe more of an appreciation of the person he is.  He has been through a lot since he arrived at the United States and claimed the title of Mr. Universe.<br /><br />I usually try to stay away from abridged audiobooks, but I think for those that are not avid bodybuilders, this is the way to go with this one. Arnold shares many of his life stories, starting with his childhood in Austria and even divulging the huge mistake he made when he cheated on Maria.<br /><br />Arnold grew up with a very strong work ethic and I was impressed to learn what a goal setter he truly is.  It made me reflect on my own goals and realizing although I strive for personal goals, it has been a long time since I sat down and physically wrote my goals on a piece of paper.  This has been a regular habit for Arnold since he became a serious bodybuilder.  Every New Year he would try to set new goals for himself  that would make him a stronger and better person.  I am definitely not unfamiliar with goal-setting, but it was just a great reminder.<br /><br />I enjoyed the narration of this book.  Arnold started the first couple of chapters and ended the book by reading the last couple of chapters.  Stephen Lang read everything in between and did a great job.  As I mentioned, I really am not a fan of bodybuilding, but I found myself wanting to hear what he had to say about the subject.  Arnold is obviously a man who had to overcome many obstacles to make it where he is today, and I think that can only be called success.<br /><br />Those that are bodybuilders will probably enjoy this book more than I did, and would benefit from listening to the unabridged version.  With themes of goals, dreams, fitness, and politics, this turned out to be a memoir that I enjoyed more than I expected.  I think this book would be a great selection for either personal leisure or a book club selection and I don't hesitate in recommending it.ected.

B0026QC0YU|3.0|OK, I love the MI movies.<br /><br />Fights, gadgets, special effects, villains, beautiful women, jokes, and Tom Cruise.<br /><br />It's just fun, but it will never win a Academy Award.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Two issues..first when pinching the screen to enlarge it and using your fingers to move around on the seek and find, you are charged with making too many taps and are deducted time. Also just when you are getting into it you have to pay for the app to move forward...that stinks...removed from my device.
B0018087TC|5.0|Absolutely great. It is a shame more people are not aware of his music. Viggo Mortensen (sorry if misspelled) should play him in a movie.
0307949486|3.0|I love audiobooks that are full of suspense, action, and mystery, as they always keep my attention with the intrigue.  After hearing such positive and glowing reviews of this book, I may have set my expectations a bit high, because I did not find the level of enjoyment from this book that many others did.<br /><br />I found Blomkvist an interesting character, who puts his life on hold to help Henrik Vanger solve an unsolved mystery regarding his niece, Harriet.  Harriet disappeared suddenly, years ago, without any explanation and is hoping that Blomkvist can help him where the police couldn't.  Blomkvist does make headway on his investigation, but realizes quickly that in order to research everything properly he will need an assistant.  That is when he hires Lisbeth, the girl with the dragon tattoo.<br /><br />Lisbeth is an odd character who adds her own element to the story.  She has amazing investigative skills that make Blomkvist open his eyes to new possibilities.  As they unveil the mystery of Harriet's disappearance, they form not only a good working relationship, but also a solid friendship.  Not only do they solve the mystery, but confront a current day predator.  This part of the novel puts Blomkvist's life in danger, bringing Lisbeth to his rescue.<br /><br />I really was expecting more action and suspense from this novel, but the biggest part was solving the mystery from years ago.  One of my friends told me the next book was better, so I will probably listen to that one also, but I will wait for awhile.  With themes of family, secrets, and mystery, you may find more enjoyment than I did from this book.  I do recommend this book for lovers of a good mystery, but not if you want some action to go along with it.
030796664X|5.0|Very well researched and explained. The examples provided were easy to relate and understand. 1 2 3 4 5 6

B00C5ZORES|5.0|I am extremely happy that FOB are back. I love this album but feel it is to short.<br />It also seems to be missing something. Maybe it's the normal song titles or the lack of spoken poetry by Pete.<br />Either way I am hoping for a bonus add on album or just another new album soon as I already have over played this one.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I started to read this book a few times but had a hard time getting past the first few curse words. But I read past them this past time and oh boy what an experience this book was. Love the humor.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Such a good story and background, love Chris Noth, he does have a smaller role, would like to see more.
0061714372|4.0|Interesting Read for fans or anyone who likes a good Biography.  I was pleasantly surprised and learned A LOT about Mustaine that I did not know.  He certainly was (and is) dealing with his share of demons.  Glad he got his story out and hope he continues his journey of a sober, healthy life.  And of course . . . keep rockin!
B005MLP71Y|1.0|Terrible writing, frenetic script, poor voice acting. There is nothing in this film that is worth watching. Please avoid this garbage.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great life lessons, for people who are dedicated to become a better person. Inspiring Classic and a lot to learn from it. Difficult to understand if you see it only once and don't know much about Classic Literature. But first you must read the book! Highly recommended.
B0071BY084|5.0|While Mr. Satriani reprises many much of his songbook and has recorded so many live albums, this effort is still satisfying. First, it features the virtuoso playing of Satch, the unparalleled. Who else has sustained a thirty-year career playing instrumental rock--music with a soul, a heart, and a mind? &#34;God is Crying&#34; is, perhaps, the most profound of all the numbers here. Yes, God is crying; but there is music, and more...<br /><br />Second, this is a fuller band than Satch usually sports, with rhythm guitar and the fine keyboards work of Mike Kennealy. Joe also stretches out live, improvising his parts in this standards, as well as interacting with the rest of the band. He has grown in this dimension over the years.<br /><br />Thank you, Satch, for all the years of composing, playing, and performing. Godspeed.
B00488I8O0|4.0|Solid album . . . the fellas are in real fine form here, very tight arrangements and of course, always provocative lyrics.<br /><br />Standout track for me is &#34;Get Back in Line&#34;, which I'll put up to anything in the past catalogs.  The profoundly dark &#34;Brotherhood of Man&#34; and &#34;I know how to Die&#34; are classic Lemmy.  This is a must have album for any Motorhead fan.  As for the uninitiated, I've already converted a few so-called metal heads into Motorheads with The world is Yours.  Its a keeper
B0053O89WY|5.0|Whats not to love about the Big Bang Theory. I already had the first 4 seasons so I had to buy the fifth. This is a great show. Very funny. As soon as the 6th season comes out (which should be Sept '13) I will be buying it also
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Amazing, although a bit dissatisfying.  Felt like the story lines could have resolved a bit more but gripping nonetheless.  Must read.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My daughter loves to play the piano and this challenges her skills. she plays it all the time, which is leaving less time for me to read. :)
B00CBRH4YU|2.0|After visiting Marina (Olga Kurylenko) in Paris, Neil (Ben Affleck) brings Marina and her daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiline) back to the states with the intent of getting married and allowing Marina to get her green card. However their relationship hits a rough patch and Marina and Neil both find themselves traveling their own paths. Marina encounters a priest named Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), who seems to have a struggle finding his own happiness. Meanwhile Neil rekindles an old flame with childhood friend Jane (Rachel McAdams).<br /><br />It was difficult to anticipate a film like \\"To the Wonder\\" since Terrence Malick films are generally pretty abstract. \\"The Tree of Life\\" felt like half a dozen storylines competing for your attention and none of them felt like they were properly resolved. \\"To the Wonder\\" continues Malick's streak of featuring incredible cinematography in his pictures. Cathedrals, trickling streams containing slumbering rocks, walking along the beach, a rose bush covered in snow, and an endless array of impressive shots of the sky and animals in their natural habitat; a National Geographic special is like the secondary storyline to Neil and Marina's relationship.<br /><br />The narrative of \\"To the Wonder\\" feels extremely erratic. It's not that it can't decide who to follow or where to go, but the path it travels seems so random that it feels like someone just closed their eyes, spun around, and pointed and then followed that path for awhile before jumping back to the previous path. The characters are practically driven by indecisiveness. Neil doesn't want to be alone, but can't seem to commit. Marina wants to be with Neil and then she doesn't. She wants to live in the States and then she wants to move back to Paris. Father Quintana wants to help people, but refuses to help himself. Even when these characters get what they want, it's like a flip switches on inside and they can't accept it. It becomes extremely frustrating.<br /><br />What you end up with is constant visits to the drive-in restaurant Sonic, repetitive trips to the grocery store, and frolicking through grassy field that seem to last a lifetime. Affleck seems to only have a handful of lines and spends most of his time lurking about; pacing around, not talking, and looking disgruntled. There is something in \\"To the Wonder.\\" Something about blossoming relationships always falling apart just when they seem to be at their peak and what appears to be two different lifetimes lived by one man. A priest is able to make others feel good about themselves yet is so empty inside and a woman is in love with a man who's in love with another woman. You're just kind of left dangling when it comes to Jane and Father Quintana and even though the story between Neil and Marina is given the most time its conclusion is massively unsatisfying.<br /><br />While it may be filmed beautifully, \\"To the Wonder\\" doesn't exactly move its gestating 112-minute duration along any faster with everyone on-screen galloping around their front yard or a field full of slow moving bison genitalia. So embrace that obnoxious ten year old of yours, hold a rooster, and lick a tree branch because \\"To the Wonder\\" is a romantic drama that wanders around so aimlessly it can't decide where to go next.end up with is constant visits to the drive-in restaurant Sonic, repetitive trips to the grocery store, and frolicking through grassy field that seem to last a lifetime.

B00597A6NU|4.0|the death toll for the bomber crews at this time during WW2 was unbelievably high. This was a really well cast movie.
B004SEUJUU|5.0|This movie is awesome. Its great to watch how it all started with wolverine and where he came from. Sabertooth (Liev Schrieber) is amazing in this movie. Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) really pulls off his character as well. Hilarious.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|This Blu-Ray DVD combo pack is an exceptional value, especially given the extras that are included. Season 2 of Game of Thrones is possibly even more exciting than the first season - definitely better special effects and more of them.  Also the acting seems even better, I suppose as the actors develop their characters more fully and the plot expands. Dinklage, Rory McCann, Charles Dance, and Maisie Williams are all riveting this season. A couple of episodes dragged for me, but possibly because other episodes were so outstanding that these suffer by comparison. All in all, the season is gorgeous, bloody, sexy, and harrowing all at once. You can't ask for much more than that.<br />As to the extras, there are twelve commentaries on these discs; some episodes having two commentaries. I'm apparently the noisiest person alive - I adore commentaries. And most of these are interesting, informative and funny, I do have one complaint. This season, like last season, listening to the commentary by the young actors who portray the Stark children is painfully reminiscent of being the chaperone at a 'tweenage' party. These young actors are talented and charming, but I wish the producers would leave commentaries to the adults - especially given the mature nature of some scenes. The behind-the-scene bonus features are all excellent and interesting. My only other complaint is the hidden \\"dragon egg\\" bonus content. I paid for the extra content and I don't have the time or inclination to go looking for it. At least allow us to opt out of the hunt and provide a link to the dragon eggs.<br />All in all though, just an amazing season and an amazing combo.
B008JFUO36|3.0|In \\"Oblivion,\\" Tom Cruise plays a repair tech named Jack Harper who travels an abandoned Earth in the year 2077 fixing robot drones. A war broke out years ago with the nomadic Scavs, the only threat still roaming the planet. While the Scavs lost the war, they destroyed the moon and made Earth uninhabitable. Now Jack and his assigned team mate Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are the only two people left while the rest of the population relaxes comfortably on Titan located on Saturn's moon. Despite a mandatory memory wipe for everyone on the planet, Jack still dreams of a woman that isn't Victoria. He begins to question his mission when a spaceship known as The Odyssey crash lands near Jack while he's out on a run and the woman from his dreams literally falls into his lap.<br /><br />The only other film Joseph Kosinski has directed is \\"TRON: Legacy,\\" so does that mean the soundtrack has to sound exactly the same? To be clear, the soundtrack isn't bad but you kind of write it off because it sounds so similar to Daft Punk's soundtrack of Kosinski's previous film. The one main difference is that there is a ton of synthesizer near the end of \\"Oblivion,\\" so much that you can actually picture an astronaut on the moon playing a keyboard guitar during the slower moments of the film.<br /><br />That sense of familiarity seriously plagues \\"Oblivion\\" because it will remind you of at least half a dozen different movies during its just over two hour duration. Tom Cruise seems to intentionally make nods to \\"Top Gun\\" while flying his futuristic dragonfly-shaped helicopter thing. He even pulls out a pair of aviator sunglasses and places them on a shelf in this delicate \\"remember this?\\" kind of manner. \\"Oblivion\\" seems to make the mistake of having an expected sci-fi plot point in its loins without much of anything else to back it up. To get there, it piggybacks on the likes of \\"I Am Legend,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"Independence Day,\\" and \\"Moon.\\" The issue is it feels like it doesn't try hard enough to leave a big enough impact to actually be remembered by the end of the year let alone six months from now. \\"Oblivion\\" is like a clone of a clone of a good sci-fi film.<br /><br />Tom Cruise spends a lot of time flying around, sticking his fingers deep into the innards of broken robots, and turning them on. All you'd need is for him to whisper dirty things to them while his fist is still inside them and you'd have some futuristic porno on your hands. \\"Oblivion\\" is absolutely breathtaking to watch. Earth may be deserted, but it's still beautiful in this empty kind of way. The lush landscapes are incredible. Pretty much anything involving the drones is a lot of fun. In a way, \\"Oblivion\\" is a lot like \\"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\\" since the futuristic technology is really creative and just a blast for the audience in general. The drones make so many beeps and boops that you know somewhere R2D2 is getting a stiffy. If you have an inner sci-fi nerd, the intense visuals and electronic sounds of the film may give you the same reaction. There's a drone chase sequence near the end of the film that is pretty outstanding.<br /><br />But somehow everything else going on is really dull. Tom Cruise is torn between two beautiful women? How tragic! Morgan Freeman shows up long enough to do his best Morpheus impression and smoke a cigar in the dark. You can see where the film is going to go, but poor Jack takes an extra 45 minutes to get there because he's got to figure out who this other woman is (which you can figure out the second or third time he dreams about her). Most importantly you won't care where the film is going to go. You can see the big finale coming once Jack returns to that cabin for the second time. The story being told is just so dry and stale. Imagine clipping coupons with a lightsaber or using warp speed on the Star Trek Enterprise to get to the laundromat to fold clothes and stretch either of those tasks out for two hours and you have \\"Oblivion.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" is visual science fiction ecstasy yet is so structurally boring that you'll be edging towards the door two thirds of the way through the film. It attempts to mold this futuristic adventure out of borrowed concepts and mimicked ideas from similar genre films, but it does not compute. It is not an effective team.br /><br />\\"Oblivion\\" is visual science fiction ecstasy yet is so structurally boring that you'll be edging towards the door two thirds of the way through the film.

B00BWJARHO|3.0|I'm sorry, but this just isn't as good as the film trilogy. The actor playing Bilbo is a little too comical. Most of the dwarfs are not very believable either.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|really enjoyed reading this book.  It was my book club selection, and received rave reviews from all eight of us!  The ending left it so we could make up our own!  Characters were well done.  Great sociopath!
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|Is not a freeplay version of bridge constructor.  Instead, it is a different twist on the same game.  Great game, lots of fun.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Fantastic, saw it on redbox and it wa sso great we just had to have it, great for all the family. Jake is soo cute. well done overall!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game where you can build anything you want. The are monsters In this game but you can disable them. I can't wait for the multiplayer and bucket updates<br />June 7,2013<br />When will the 0.7.1 update come out because every one else has now but kindle fire owners
0312933541|4.0|First I would like to say a few words about those (9 of you) who think this book is complete crap. Furthermore, one even made it clear that he disliked Archer in a big way... So the question is why read it in the first place?<br /><br />Yes, the plot does get a little predictable at times and sometimes bordering on a little too 'perfect'. But let's not forget this is just a novel....a novel designed to entertain.<br /><br />The majority of people agreed that JF can write really great novels - the way he portrays the characters and the intricacy of the plot are second to none. So those who keeping whinging about his book are definitely a 'tiny' minority.<br /><br />I have just finished reading this book and have found it thoroughly entertaining. In fact the one thing I 'hate' the most about his books is that I often want to get to the end as soon as I can because I just can't wait to see what happens next. And then, by the time I do get to the end, I feel sad because I don't know when I will get my hands on the next one.<br /><br />I have read 18 of his books and none of them has ever disappointed me. OK, the 'Path of Glory' and 'The Fourth Estate' may not be the best of the lot, but I still find them very interesting.<br /><br />I do agree sometimes his stories are a tad predictable. But this may be because, like many of you, I have read so many books and watched so many different movies that we are able to come up with a plot of our own as his stories unfold.<br /><br />One final comment I would like to make is: Isn't it more than about how a story is told than how 'predictable' it is? I think a book is one that you just simply don't want to put down and that you can visualise what is happening. I think I speak for many people than he is able to do just that!
B00000634J|5.0|I love John Lennon! This was a great CD! It had some of my most favorite songs on it!  If you like John I would recommend.
B0055SWM08|4.0|A good game..a little repetitive..and progressively more difficult.  Play at your own pace.. Restart level as often as you need to.
0385347774|5.0|Enjoyed the book. It was sent promptly and in great condition. No issues at all. Need to buy more books this way.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this game. It gets a little hard the higher up you get. I am usually pretty good at games but this is hard sometimes.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! I hope we get a lot more seasons. If you're looking at a review for season 3, you already know what I'm talking about and you probably don't need my review. If you haven't seen the show yet, start at season 1 and give it a try. If you're not into zombies and violence, maybe it's not for you. In this show, it seems no one is safe.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Omg that was the best book that I have ever read! I love the hunger games so much and I can't wait for the catching fire movie.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Incredble exploration of character.  All of the acting is superb and there is an agreeable absence of the forensic and funereal.
B00006AW2E|5.0|I think this is of much better qualty than Flowers.  And being from the U.S.A. to have the UK Version is the best because the UK version adds more tracks
B000FC0ZAI|3.0|This is one of those rare cases where the movie is better than the book; Seriously.  The book is alright, It's just not what I thought it would be.
B00BMEF8UA|5.0|I am a HUGE Iced Earth fan. Im also one of those people who feels like Barlow IS the singer for Iced earth, despite various line-up changes in the past. I liked Dystopia a lot, but was still stuck in my old way of thinking after Iced Earths Amazing 2008 Album, Crucible of Man.I don't think it really convinced me 100% that anyone could match what power Barlow brought to the band. Let me say this Album certainly showed me the error of my ways. Stu Block does an AMAZING job on this album. Song for song, he matches or exceeds my expectations for either how Ripper Owens or Barlow performed the original songs. Somehow the man is a hybrid of both Ripper and Barlow...somehow he can match the range of Barlow and the highs of Ripper while maintaining his own identity on the song.Incredible.<br /><br />This live album may even overtake Iced Earths \\"Alive In Athens\\" in that the range of material is even more amazing. Songs from Horror show make their way on here which is something I always wished I could have on Alive in Athens (through no fault of the band of course, Horror Show hadn't even come out yet at the time of that live album!)They do Dantes inferno again! Theres also a few songs from the Ripper era that sound great also. Overall, this album is powerful, comprehensive, and really shows what the band is capable of. It is a great double album and has certainly showed me that Iced Earth is much more than any one element of the band.

1416979174|5.0|Eric Carle colorfully illustrates a life lesson through a story about the life cycle of a seed...and shows that it's not always the biggest, fastest or highest flying seed that makes the most beautiful flower.<br />I purchased this book for my 6 year old to read and he loves it also my 1 1/2 year old loves to look at the bright pictures while listening to us read the story. It's a big hit!
B00139XSBA|2.0|I read the whole book; and I just couldn't get into it.  It was hard to follow and to read.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I never actually read the book that the movie is based on. So, the story line was a first for me in what was a introduction to the classic story. The acting was excellent, Keira Knightly did a beautiful acting job. Now the movie seemed like a hybrid of theater on film. I'm not a movie expert but I thought the story was played out in a elegant light manner.
B000001F26|5.0|Love Eric Clapton, and this is a great collection of all his favorites.  You'll remember your past with each piece!  Highly recommended for Clapton fans.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Surprisingly well done and entertaining. Can hardly wait to watch the next series.<br />This is a classic sci-fi action series.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Battle: Los Angeles was all you could ask of a hardcore military sci-fi: almost non-stop action and combat on the platoon / squad level portrayed with realism and attention to detail; unique and interesting aliens (and their technology); a plot which follows a clear and reliable pattern that pays homage to the best of old-time (read made with respect for the military) war movie traditions.  Battle: Los Angeles makes Starship Troopers and Independence Day look like episodes of Doctor Who.
0525953728|4.0|This is the story of Mark Owen (not real name).  Not JUST the incident that happened concerning Osama Bin Laden, but excerpts from his military career.  Mark Owen does a good job of using &#34;laymen&#34; terms and keeping the story simple enough for enough non-military personnel to read.  Too often I have read military novels and realized that they were meant for only the military community to understand.  Mark Owen does a good job of making military equipment and action events easy for the average reader to understand.  I highly recommend this book for any looking for a good military action novel.
B004XVN1T4|3.0|A story of how three men who knew each other during WWII, a Russian, a Jew and an Arab found themselves on different sides during Israels fight to remain a state. There are a few twists and turns. This is typically Follett but not one of his best.

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|Although he doesn't look like him Anthony Hopkins really captured the personality, mannerisms, and presence of Alfred Hitchcock in this movie.  I didn't know very much about Alma, his wife, but Helen Mirren as always does a good job of playing the  \\"woman behind a successful man.\\"  I had no idea that she was a film maker in her own right and she certainly brought that talent to light in the scenes where she takes over on the set when Hitchcock becomes ill.  The other stars I didn't like so much. Scarlet Johannsen as Janet Leigh--well there's no comparison as far as I'm concerned. However she was portrayed as  the girl next door type in the movie like the scene when Janet hands over a bag of candy corn \\"for Mr. Hitchcock\\" and Alma says, \\"Thank you for being professional, Janet.\\"  I guess Alma thought that Ms. Leigh was unlike the other blond leading ladies that \\"Hitch\\" adored!  The man who played Anthony Perkins aka Norman Bates was kind of insipid in his role.  But it was interesting to hear him during the interview with Hitchcock as he poured out his inner thoughts of who he was and how he related to the role of Bates.  I wasn't familiar with Whitfield Cook, either, and there really doesn't seem to be much out there about his career as a screen writer.  In the film, that is made evident as Hitchcock didn't think much of him either as well as being jealous of him.  That's another aspect of this film that I liked.  In all the scenes with Hitchcock present one sees how his mind works and how he fantasizes his thoughts about people and situations.  I was reminded of other Hitchcock movies as I watched this unfold.  He definitely was an amazing man but it must've  been totally difficult to live with him!
B006X96PF6|5.0|Enjoyed this very much. As a artist, I just recently got introduced to Loreena McKennitt.  I am a huge fan now.  I have bought this one and multiple others and am very happy.  I you like folksy and celtic or middle ages sounding music, this fits the bill. Hope you enjoy as much as I do.
0307596885|4.0|I enjoyed pretty much every one of these stories.  Ms. Munro has a spare, but open style that engages the reader.  Even when you can see what's coming, you want to read along until it does.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|This is an excellent dvd!!  I was lucky enough to have been at the Ryman for this show last year, along with my wife and fellow BeatleBuddy, who was celebrating his 50th birthday at the show, whic was on Ringo's birthday as well. Amazing performance by this version of the All-Starrs....don't let this one pass you by..

B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is highly addicting. It can be a bit slow at times though. But it's overall fun and easy.
B009IF8CH6|1.0|The show has lost all its originality. Sadly it seems to be going out with a whimper...not a bang. I loved the first few seasons.
1594744769|5.0|I am so excited about book 2 coming out and possibility of a movie~!!, I will be re-reading this book again, many of my friends are on a waiting list from me to read it.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|When reading  the book I thought they could never make a movie out of this, but was I wrong! The movie was magnificent!!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Really enjoyed this show.  I love the innocence and the the great writing. I can watch with my children and not worry about what they will take away from it.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a really entertaining game that entertains you. I love it and cant stop . Playing. If you got I know you would love it to. SO GET IT!!!!!!!!
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I put this on a Kindle Fire for my 11 year old, he's probably played it for 4 or 5 hours worth of time so far. He loves it and hasn't complained of any glitches or problems so far. It seems very challenging for him, he loves puzzle type games and trying to figure out solutions to problems. His words &#34;It's awesome&#34;
B00B2V66VS|1.0|The game might be free but all the add ons cost a lot of money if you want to play the game.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great disc from a great artist. We listen to this every day.  Family is very happy to have and look forward to the next one.
B000BISBDY|5.0|[[ASIN:B000W178XO The Legend Of Johnny Cash]]<br />This cd has his greatest songs which I love. Enjoyed by my husband and family as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We enjoyed every minute of this entire series and will watch I in real time when Season 4 begins. A Soap opera with class and kept us hanging, right up to the end!
B00B22IJXK|4.0|I enjoy adding that extra spark to special pictures and the canvas is great for toddlers to express themselves. My daughter loves it!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Love the story.  Love the characters.  Love the Beauty.  Love the Beast.  Dont like Gaston so much.  Hope you like it too.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It's OK to divert the kids for a couple of hours, but overall a flavorless, shallow jaunt. Three more words.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I forgot how good this show was! I love all the characters. It's great to be able to stream all the episodes.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Thoughtful look into the Roddenberry future - this series is fun to watch.  Exciting story lines and interesting characters deliver a nice Star Trek experience.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Glad Apple has this available to keep my FW peripherals usable with my MacBook Air. Usual quality build as most Apple stuff is.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|It is a sure classic.  One of the few that can entertain adults and children.  I waited to watch it until it was on video, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I just want them to tour one more time in the states,seen page plant twice on both tours in the 90's
B00A8V3VVG|2.0|Love the movie,but on the soundtrack half the songs are taken from records albums,but when used in the film,the songs don't sound scratchie,I notice he does this to all his soundtracks,like on the kill bill sountracks,a lot of songs were not on there,like,death rides a horse,so don't buy this cd,because all you get is a record soundtrack cd?buyer beware of soundtrack from this director,his movies are great,but the soundtracks are not worth your money!
0307279189|3.0|The thing I was most aware of throughout the book was: the author's an exaggerator. Still, it was an engaging read.  I just treated the storytelling parts like 70% truth / 30% fiction and I'm pretty much fine with it.<br /><br />I do believe that the running shoes of the last 20 years are terrible for you and that the less shoe, the better. Statistics demonstrate that.<br /><br />But when McDougall talks evolutionary anatomy and behavior is where I can't be as forgiving.  He spouts all kinds of unproven theories as long as they fit his thesis that we are \\"born to run\\".  I'm not convinced. Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.  McDougall doesn't present a single alternative to his pet theories, despite the important fact that most anthropologists believe differently than him.  When he goes so far as to imagine bizarre scenes like entire caveman tribes with pregnant women, children and elderly running long distance in unison, I knew he'd lost it.<br /><br />The author could also add the epilogue that one of his role model ultra-runners, \\"Caballo Blanco\\", died in 2012.  But he won't - because the man died, while running, of a heart condition.  He had developed an enlarged heart with scar tissue, which occurs in endurance athletes who subject their heart to sustained stress levels.  Born to run?  Died from running.  Oops. How inconvenient.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great watch for the money. Does everything it's supposed to and you barely notice it on your wrist. two more.
B005V20JKI|2.0|This is a very fun game, I've especially enjoyed playing multiplayer with my son. However, the latest update added a purchase system for in game upgrades (which is understandable) and locked several levels and characters I had previously unlocked (which is frustrating). Now I am expected to pay $2 just to continue the experience I had yesterday. If you've unlocked most of the game, don't update...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its entertaining. Wish it had different themes. The controls are a bit too sensitive. Sometime you want to jump but instead you go to the left.
0142418471|5.0|This is a really good book. John Green is a great writer. The cover is a bit less red on mine than on other copies.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great show, I was upset when they cancel it. I love the movie too. I wish they would bring it back.
B005K17RU0|4.0|like the temp and weather alerts given.  would like radar feature to pop up in case of tornado in area
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|This game and  story are wonderfully done with magical audio and graphics. It's a pleasure to explore the scenes and find all of the secrets they have to offer. The voices add to the aura of enchantment and Whine is an imposing enemy.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|could not put the book down once I started reading.  I felt like I was right there. I recommend this to everyone who has wondered what our men and women are doing when the go to other countries and fight for our freedom.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was incredibly inspiring at the perfect time in my life. It brings to light many of the things we may feel, but don't talk about. Man or woman, I believe &#34;Lean In&#34; can bring amazing perspective to the way you approach situations and your life.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Absolutely one of the best movies to come along in a long time.  Awesome actors and such a powerful and emotional story.  My whole family loved it and I just cried at the end.  Recommend it to everybody !!!
B00BCX2F66|1.0|I'm a case nut.. I've ordered over a hundred in the past few years for cell phones..and THIS is the worst fitting case ive ever seen.. 2 of the corners do not even make contact with the phone. It's not a defect that i know of..Others have reported the same issue. Shame on HTC's QC. They should never let a product with their name on it be sold with issues like this. The phone is great.. The case has no more value than a square of toilet tissue.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I wasn't sure how they would top the last album, but totally have. Coexist has brought many beautiful and emotional hours of enjoyment to this music enthusiast.
1451627297|5.0|I enjoy Stephen King.  If you can discount the time travel, not much of this book is the typical King supernatural.  The story was great.  I love how her interweaves his books.  I think both King fans, and historical fiction fans alike will enjoy this book.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|I rate this at 4.5 stars.<br />This is a tight, well-paced piece of science fiction that deserves to be held up as one of the most distinguished of its generation.  The unique look into a future society reveals a world defined by scarcity, nationalism, and corruption.  Reading this book sends shivers up your spine in the way that nuclear apocalypse stories did during the Cold War - not that nuclear war isn't still scary, but the point is The Windup Girl reaches that place inside of you that is forced to admit that Bacigalupi has presented an all-too plausible conclusion to our world's current trajectory.<br />The writing is well-designed and engaging, and several characters stand out in their development, Hock-Seng and the titular windup girl in particular.  I thoroughly enjoyed the author's depiction of Thailand, and the obvious effort he put into making it's culture a central focus.  Bacigalupi spurns the advice of Strunk and White with impunity, so be prepared to Google a lot of Thai phrases as you read.  For once this sort of thing didn't bother me much, and it seemed to fit well into the narrative structure.<br />What I did find a bit annoying was that the story was told entirely in the present tense.  This only a matter of personal preference for me, as I've always found it distracting in a novel.<br />I recommend this story to anyone interested in environmental issues, political corruption, sectarian violence, or any other number of tragic modern realities that make for good science fiction.  This book doesn't pull any punches, but it never forgets it's own humanity.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|Item was brand new like described and worked perfectly. I was so excited to get it, and even more excited that it worked exactly the way it should. Thank you!
0425264351|3.0|Thought I'd give the author a shot.  The book was pretty simplistic, and didn't seem like the author had any real in depth matter on the the things he was writing about.  Maybe it was because it was his first book, but unfortunately didn't hook me.  I'm not a fan of James Patterson, and I kind of felt like the writing styles were similar.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a really useful tool to organize your busy and changing schedule.  My whole family stays organized through this tool.
B009AMANBA|5.0|another historical aspect of lincoln's presidency, and the toughness of his personality.<br />would have liked to have seen more of his life w/his family.
0307346617|5.0|Easy quick read but a lot of fun.  Interesting take on how the Zombie War would unfold.  I almost wish the author had more follow up books to dig deeper into the mini stories that each chapter was made up of.  Left you wanting to hear more about each character.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I loved this movie, but felt that Amanda Seyfried was miscast.  I loved her in Mama Mia!!!! But, the falsetto voice they had her sing in was annoying.  But who cannot love her otherwise.  The cast, especially Hugh Jackman and Sasha Baron Cohen with Helena Bohnem Carter were awesome ~ and who knew Russell Crowe could sing.  Loved him as well, as bad as he was!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Every season of this show is fantastic and hilarious. And hilarious. That is all that needs to be said about it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great from beginning to end. Made my mind ponder what the characters were feeling and thinking constantly. Just a great book.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|im sometime late for school so i set this  alarm up and i strted to get up earlier because of each sound u can chose for it to wake u up. it is awesome. (:
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's not the kinkyness that kept the book going its how much he loved her, after finishing the last book about an hour ago, there is a void in my life, I miss Mr.grey so much right now... read it, you won't regret it
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I love all of his books anyways, and this one was no exception. It did get kind of overwhelming for a little bit but that works wonders for the plot later on. I loved it and hopefully you do too.
B001JQHQWE|5.0|Conceived my first child to this song. She just turned 40 and is pregnant with her first child so I'm going down memory lane.
B002PEP4U0|4.0|In caring for his family, this boy created something ingenious out of nothing!  Fascinating, informative, and heart-wrenching.  A cultural wake-up.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you like the ability to create an army of your liking and blow crap up.... this is your game ladies and gentlemen. Be prepared for deep thinking and strategical action.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|The usual Jack Reacher in trouble as usual.  Will keep on reading Lee Childs novels.<br />Love them. Cant wait for the next one.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a retired Woman Marine LtCol (1963-1983) I saw myself in much of this book.....sometimes to my chagrin and occasionaly proudly! I think any woman in, was, or planning to be in the workforce would benefit from reading! It's like a primer on assertiveness and I remember giving similar advice to junior Woman Marines over my career. Many of my friends have grand daughters and I have suggested that they give them copies, after reading themselves!
B008B3MZNI|5.0|This has always been one of my all time favorite live albums.  As soon as I found out that it had been released on bluray I immediately purchased it.  The picture quality is amazing!  The sound is equally amazing. Way back in 1981 I purchased the double cassette and played it until I wore it out. I suspect I will do the same with this Blu ray.  I highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed.
B000683VI4|5.0|It is a pretty good movie.  I just bought it on Amazon for less than $6.  I will get it in the mail in two days, and Amazon gave me a free 48 hour rental for making the purchase.  So now, I get to watch the movie right now over my PS3, and I will have the movie on Monday.  This is getting the movie for less than the cost of two rentals, with a free rental.  I am so excited!
1451695195|2.0|I don't know exactly what I was looking for, but I didn't find it in this book. My training in neuroscience might make me a bit harder to convince,,  but I really would like to believe his story. It might have helped if other cases of near death experiences had been included.
B007PBL9KC|5.0|I heard their radio hit and had to get the whole thing. They have a great sound and if you like other indie rock bands with a big sound and female/male vocal combos like the Hush Sound, you'l likely love this album.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|A fascinating - and at times deeply shocking - vivisection of the pharmaceutical industry and the larger ecosystem it operates in.<br /><br />Goldacre's core assertion is that major parts of the system is dysfunctional, and that the industry regulators have largely failed to do their job due to a mix of financial incentives and misguided policies. The section on how various pharma companies have essentially doctored scientific studies to get the results they needed is particularly interesting.<br /><br />Well-argued, credible, and supported by lots of research - and rather scary, frankly.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|best drawing game ever! you can do so much! and now its FREE!!!!!!!  buy it and let your imagination run wild!!!!
B007JNR4XW|5.0|This one, in my opinion is the best of them all. The other ones went in a completely different style in the street dance style but I like this cuz of the story.
B005NFYXTG|4.0|Gospel According To Saint Matthew is his best, but this movie is much better watch than it is to read a de Sade novel. I never liked the divine Marquis, but this movie isn't as bad as the pervious reviewer made it out to be. The flim is not ment to be sexually arousing or erotic, but rather show the corruption of political power.
B0094M2V7U|5.0|I love this series. Kate Beckinsale is awesome as Selene. It is non-stop action and the story lines are original. I would recommend this movie and the rest of the Underworld series to anyone. Thanks.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|While the story telling was a bit scattered, it had to be for the format, this was a great read overall. Many of the little stories within will really stand out for you. Very enjoyable, well written, popular subject matter.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Peter Jackson has done it again! He has brought to life J.R.R. Tolkien's story. Even though this will be a trilogy, the first installment wows! I can't wait for #2! Thanks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 2 year old LOVES this horse app. i help/show her what to do and she learns fast! little boring to me but watching the smiles and laughs she has is so worth it! TY
B003TJR2HS|1.0|The package I received says &#34;CableJive dockStubz+&#34; on the box but I can not tell if that's true.  I plugged into an old ipod dock<br />that works with 1st generation ipod nano but when I connect a bluetooth receiver to the dockStubz+, I got no power.  When I<br />took the bluetooth receiver to bestbuy and plugged it into a newer Ipod Dock, the bluetooth receiver got power.  So I'm not<br />sure I got a defective unit or I got the &#34;dockStubz&#34; instead of &#34;dockStubz+&#34;.  The connector itself has no indication.  I'm returning it.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|What a great movie! This movie is everything I could have ever wanted it to be, and more. Zero Dark Thirty follows Maya (Jessica Chastain) as she attempts to hunt down Osama Bin Laden. This movie is powerful, gripping, and thrilling. Jessica Chastain gives a powerhouse performance as Maya. The only complaint I can think of in this movie is that it might have been good if it went into some depth about what Al Qaeda is about and their motivations. That is a small complaint however. The tension in this movie building up to Osama's death is near unbearable. This is the best movie released in 2012. 5/5
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Loved this book up until the end; while the plot was very interesting, the end really was quite disappointing. We did not get to know the main character nor her husband very well; character development could have been better. What kept my attention was the suspense about her amnesia: its cause and whether the psychologist, husband, best friend are really telling the truth. I thought I knew how it would turn out, and it turns out my ending would have been much better than the final ending of the book.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the first instalment in The Hobbit Trilogy and is a prequel to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. The Hobbit was visually very impressive (even if there was too much CGI used) and Martin Freeman was flawlessly cast as Bilbo Baggins. However, setting that aside, this is a bloated and badly paced movie that made me wonder why a filmmaker as talented as Peter Jackson would think the movie is well paced and that three instalments are necessary to this trilogy. About 45 minutes of footage could have been cut from this movie. I still believe three movies was not a terrible idea, but this one needed more of Bilbo in it, less CGI and more practical effects, and better pacing. It is still an enjoyable film however even if it does not live up to the standard set by the Lord of the Rings. 3/5
B003O86FMW|2.0|Assanine plot, heroine spoiled, considered herself always right, selfish...not a lovable main character. Ending unsatisfactory.  Not sure I'll read the third of the trilogy.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved the novel it gave you a very accurate view of life at that time in history.  I highly reccomend this novel to the people that enjoy historical fiction. I enjoyed reading a book that was difficult to put down.
B005LAIII0|2.0|Not even close to Avatar - quite the disappointment from a visual perspective. The story was so simple the telling had to be superb, I don't think it was.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i already have this game and i enjoy it.i like playing angry birds and it is fun to play.it does give a challenge
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Amazing story, well developed, good use of descriptive language. Well worth the Kindle price. Here, then, are six more words!
B00B22IJXK|4.0|I like it!! I play with this game sometimes but It is very fun!! I like putting stuff on my own pictures!!
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|Hilarious! Loved it. Great movie to take your mind off of life's seriousness and sadness going on . This is a no brainier to watch if you just wanna relax and laugh
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It took a while to get into the back story. It is a great story of humanity and the lack of it. Very sad and sweet story.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|When the teaser came out I was insanely excited to say the least. It had been years since I had heard a Daft Punk track (I had moved onto other genres in the EDM scene and Daft Punk wasn't on my mind for a while) and this was insanely catchy and funky. The silly thing is This is EXACTLY what I REMEMBER Daft Punk sounding like since I hadn't heard them in forever. After going back and listening to their older stuff I realized it was actually quite the departure, but it sounds exactly like my good memories. It is challenging to explain. In short, they managed to capture the same exact feelings about their music that I had previously, with an entirely new direction. I can safely recommend this track to old fans, and new listeners alike.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Modern Family, The Big Bag Theory and New Girl have no competition. Great ensemble of characters. Modern Family and New Girl really do take chancee.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Interesting and fun to read!  I have read her other books and this is as good as any of them.  Enjoy!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is the first social game app I've ever used. It's a ton of fun! (and a good time waster ;))
B007CKNX28|5.0|Jack White is as young as talented. He's one of the best rockers of nowedays and this CD offers great music!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|She has a great take on vampires.  I am retired and read daily.  This view of early 20th century London and paranormal actives is very creative.  I can hardly wait for the next book.
B0010SEMP0|3.0|To start, this was no better than the first and I still bought it. If you read it before the true blood series or the fever series it's a good book- however if you have read those, don't read. There are far to many holes and lack of substance. It's an easy read-simple writing. When some one asks me for a good &#34;vampire/romance &#34; book- this will not make the list.<br />With that said- I will probably by the next one because I feel vested. I do want to know how it ends.
B003B02O3C|5.0|very unexpected and shrewd plot. I am not normally a &#34;suspense fiction&#34; fan, but this was first class; I recommend it for everyone.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|If you're a comic book nerd, you'll look past the mediocre acting and enjoy the tie ins between the show's writing and the comics. Also a fun action show, surprising for the CW.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Works good on my lower-end tablet. Game has nice graphics, fun gameplay, and decent music. I like the option  to play with or without time limits, and the ability to build houses in the village.
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|The game does not run on my Kindle.  Now I do not know how to delete it.  I would like to free the space on my Kindle for other items.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|Fine Classic, always good to have near, and this one is kindle supported so is great, recomended 100%... ahh and is Free!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Worth the download. Great puzzles that keep you guessing what is next.  I hope they make a second game soon
B004JN1D2I|4.0|the first 3 are totally awesome!! the fourth and then the fifth drop the pace a little... they stirll are very good... but don't havethe same spark and thriiller that have the first three... even so a great great series...
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Not a big budget production, but the characters have depth, are relatable and very good writing and dialog. Especially for a TV series.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great great surprise, big big fan of stephen king but have some time after Under The Dome without reading something from him.... Great Book!
B008OOYALE|5.0|we, my children and I, love this game. I have it on my phone and I-Pod and now we have my husband playing too. Very addictive can't wait to see what hatches when I have an egg I haven't seem before.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Did not develop the relationship of Maggie & Laurent fully.  All the sudden he's back in her life at the end of the book with no discussion of how or why.  Armature writing style.
B003WTE886|5.0|This is a wonderful C/D.  Words and music by Taylor Swift is sweet and catchy.  I cannot help but sing along.
B008N9AAQ4|3.0|Need subtitles every scene to locate every scene in the world, and not wait until final credits to see where was filmed
B004X75RCW|5.0|Can't go wrong with Sandra Bullock! Love this romantical comedy! First time watching a movie with Ryan Reynolds but LOVE his expressions and comedy as well! And of course Betty White...a great legend in the stars! I laughed so hard! It was great!!!!<br />I downloaded this movie everywhere that I could get access to it! Great pick me up!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I have read the entire series in less than two weeks. It is a roller coaster of emotions from beginning to end and I cannot stress enough the delicate relationships between the characters that make this series so enveloping for the reader. It is a must read for any YA/ sci-fi loving reader.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Just what my granddaughter requested.  She is a Lego fan and always tells me which sets she still does not have.

B00BR9SP6O|5.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter describes the life of Anne Neville, younger daughter of England's mightiest subject who made and unmade kings.  The twists and turns - most historical, some made up where there are no facts - are worthy of an epic drama and the minor plot device of the wheel of fortune - you rise, you fall, and you can't control which - work well.<br /><br />Philippa Gregory has done a great job switching points of view in her Cousin's War series for the subject of each book.  The sympathy for Elizabeth Woodville in The White Queen is replaced in The Kingmaker's Daughter by animosity and fear from Anne.  Likewise Margaret Beuafort's hautiness (Douglas MacArthur could have taught her humility) was replaced by a positive image from Anne's point of view - until Margaret's scheming failed and she was put under house arrest.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wish there was another book! I was eleven pages away from the ending wondering what could happen, and then it ended perfectly.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing this book is just cool beans. I loved how Amos Henry and miles help Augest. Five star rating coolbeans

B00B52F278|5.0|First, for those that may not have ever seen Spartacus on Starz and are looking to get into the series via DVD or Instant Video based on its popularity, Spartacus: War of the Damned is season 3 of the show but technically the fourth season. After the excellent 2010 5-star season premier under the title Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Andy Whitfield who played the lead role of Spartacus tragically died of cancer. Whitfield embodied Spartacus; he was a believable, imposing, rough, tough character that made viewers feel like they were watching the real guy from circa 70 BC. His untimely illness left the studio scrambling to decide how to or if the series would continue. Ultimately the studio decided to produce a prequel that ideally would give Whitfield time to recover after treatment, but sadly Whitfield relapsed and passed shortly after production of the prequel.<br /><br />The prequel was called Gods of the Arena and it was excellent. But there was something missing from Gods that made Blood & Sand the 5-Star series that it was: Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character. Then in Vengeance we got Spartacus back, but was Whitfield really replaceable? Starz took a chance and went for the Whitfield look-alike with Liam McIntyre versus finding another imposing force that could also act. Yes, McIntyre does look quite a bit like Whitfield, but there was something just a little less imposing, less rough and less tough about the guy; in Vengeance, McIntyre was a kinder, warmer Spartacus that smiled too much. But in War of the Damned something changed...dramatically...McIntyre stopped smiling and started kicking and carving you-know-what. And ultimately, War of the Damned rivaled the first season...which is saying a lot!<br /><br />Indeed...War of the Damned is one of the best series finales that I have ever sat through. McIntyre really captured the essence of what Whitfield started in season one: Spartacus as a down but not beaten man thrown into slavery determined to be free and stop at nothing to do so. The supporting cast deserves high honors as well; returning characters put their hearts' and souls' into every episode--especially Manu Bennett as Crixus. And new cast members had some tough shoes to fill after some amazing performances by the likes of John Hannah, Lucy Lawless and several others in seasons past. But the new characters filled their parts with passion and believability...especially those in the parts of Crassus, his son Tiberius, and Julius Gaius Caesar.<br /><br />As for the show itself, similar to its series predecessors, Spartacus War of the Damned leaves nothing for the imagination during its time period: love, battle, adultery, orgy, torture, rape, murder...it's all there in all its glory...and I mean ALL its glory. The events of Spartacus War of the Damned take place after Spartacus' gang of gladiators escape slavery and form a large rebellion to strike down Roman slavery, and if you know the true story of Spartacus then you know that this series finally will leave fans as disappointed in Spartacus' end as they are satisfied with the absolute best series to have ever aired on the Starz network.<br /><br />Keep the credits rolling after the final episode to see the tribute to Andy Whitfield in the Arena shouting: \\"I am SPARTACUS!\\"<br /><br />Blood and Sand: 5 stars<br />Gods of the Arena: 4 stars<br />Vengeance: 3½ stars<br />War of the Damned: 5 starsd stop at nothing to do so.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Gave it to my husband for his birthday and he is very, very happy with it. He can't wait to watch it. i suspect a Game of Thrones Marathon!!!
B0010SEN18|5.0|I've followed Joe forever. I've gotten pretty good at spotting his work so this book was a must for me. Full of stories and details, this is a ride around with one of the best NatGeo photographers I've ever seen. Again this is a book you will want to see the pictures so use a tablet. The Kindle version (which I review here) has plenty of pics which a best viewed in color. Joe is full of stories about the famous and infamous and gets the shot...mostly. If you want to see a master photographer work and tell you how he creates great photos, just buy it. I still find my self referring back to it when I try  a 'McNally' type shot.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I love these types of movies and this one goes along with the previous Lord of the Rings movies.  The ending irritated me though as there was no closure so there better be a sequel!  I would definitely watch the sequel.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is the best way to save, share and remember webpages, articles, documents, and everything online. hands down. There is no other better than Evernote.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I know, a story about cancer doesn't sound too exciting, but this book had me laughing more than crying. The writing is flawless, and the characters were so different and real. I couldn't but this book down!
B008133MDK|5.0|I am a long time Sherlock Holmes fan and this series is amazing.  It puts Sherlock in a contemporary world of laptops and blogging, which is fun.
B00A83075M|5.0|the whole family like this movie. It has a very good message for the children to care for one and another
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater with my husband, and just had to have it!  I think they've stayed true to the genre.  Looking for more 007 goodies in the future!  :D
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The new Oxford American dictionary is a good book and it helps me to understand new words every day so thank you for providing this book
B00BF11STU|4.0|I loved this movie.  The suspense.  The behind-the-scenes peek at something I've always wondered about.  Although I did find the ending a big unsatisfying.  We don't really have closure on the main character.  What happened to her afterwards?  If you can accept the vague unsatisfying way she rides off into the sunset after a job well done, then the movie is highly recommended for the rest of it.  Lol!  Enjoy!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|this is fun and challenging and addicting.  good but simple concept and easy to understand. i have enjoyed other games by same maker.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|New take on Sherlock Holmes.  They've kept most of what we like about the characters and stories and modernized much of that (Mrs. Hudson, for instance, making Watson a woman).  I would like to see Watson practicing medicine again, though, and not let all that wonderful training and education go to waste, but, alas, that's probably just me.  The stories are great!  And I hope they keep making them!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|No radar maps and not much more than current conditions offered .  I found myself clicking in a circle looking for more than was there. I downloaded  a local TV station's app that gave me what I wanted.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie, and we really enjoyed it!  All the timely references, the movie stuff, the suspense, et cetera.  Well worth watching!  We absolutely loved how as they roll the credits at the end they show you side by side the real next to the staged, the actors next to their counterparts.  Great movie!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Verrry user friendly. Has the versions I like to compare and the reading plan I was already using! I'd like to see Strong's Greek and Hebrew resources included but the Amplified  version serves as an adequate substitute for my usual needs.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it kept my attention great mix of drama passion and romance. I would definitely like to finish the trilogy after reading this one
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Not since Perdido Street Station have I read such a well realised and awesome world.<br />And I know this is a first book but man, what a book!<br />Would not even mind if this was the only one - but happy it's not.<br />The tapestry is down, now I'm waiting for the flourish. - that was so cheesy, strike that. Pretend I never said it. But it's true.
B0051GY0LS|3.0|The story is very much pitched towards younger readers with a teenager as the main character, come sleuth.  It is tad pedestrian and predictable, and was far from gripping.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I like that this game is not mindless matching. At the beginning of each round you have a bit of strategy and then just finish the round with a bit of grinding thru three matching. The interludes between rounds give you a good stopping point if you want, and don't last too long if you don't.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|A sequel which spends a bit of time rehashing the original, but a really interesting novel with a range of strong, likeable and annoying characters and historical relevance.  It is a shame that the end is contrived in the near identical manner to an earlier novel, and presented with a view to requiring the reader to buy the next version for completion of the story per se.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I was held with interest and did not really believe he could pull it off.  Loved the legal wrangling. Suspenseful
B007HO392S|5.0|This Cd is great, just love Carrie Underwood's music. She has such a beautiful voice. I have really enjoyed this cd in particular.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|This album sneaks up on you.  Each song has its own engaging story and will suck you in.  Rufus is easily the most poetic, and thoughtful songwriter of his generation.  His voice is within another realm, no one can touch Rufus.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I have seen this dvd several times and had to  have it for my collection. I love all the individuals stories leading to one.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Although Rufus has called this most recent album more &#34;approachable&#34;, compared to his other albums, the songs are far from your average pop tunes.  All the songs are a beautiful and profound interpretation of a life journey.  His voice is a musical instrument played to perfection!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fantastic as always.  My only complaint is that I've read every word of every novel and I'm hurting for more.  Right faster Vince!!!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I would have chosen this movie over Argo for the best picture of the year.  I also really liked Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field in this movie.
0784011176|5.0|I owned this movie in VHS.  I purchased this one to replace the old one.<br />I watched this cd version. In good shape, and would reccommend<br />this seller.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is the best film these guys have done!! It is a very encouraging and challenging real life possibility to live this conquering lifestyle. By the end of the movie I felt motivated to trust God more. Our grandkids agree it is good.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Just saved 50,000 keystrokes with SwiftKey. It had made the transition from physical keyboard to touchscreen-only very easy. I would highly recommend it.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|I was not impressed with this movie. And I usually like Denzel movies. Just wasn't impressed with the story or plot. Very predictable. The ending is good though. And if you have small or sensitive &#34;eyes&#34; watching this movie with you, beware of the fully naked woman in the movie's opening scene...which is quite long.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Page turning entertaining novel!  Keeps you wondering and wanting to read on! Will be looking forward to this authors second novel!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|GET IT!! The pudding has to be on the star plates for it to count, BTW. Love this game. Click the &quot;purchase&quot; botton if you agree.
B004T0E2S8|1.0|A watered down version from the Android version for the same price. Wish I could have returned this less useful version of what is SUPPOSED to be a great app.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|This is a must-read for any Queen fans.  I breezed through it promptly, loaned it to my brother and haven't seen it since!  Since my daughters are also fans, I need to retreive the book so they can read it too!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Paul Simon is one of my alltime favs! This is my very favorite album of his and I and my kids love listening to it over and over again.  What a story about how he made this album.  I saw the documentary and it was excellent.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I do not watch tv, but I love this show!<br />I purchased season 3, but am holding back from watching the season finale because season 4 is a long way off,<br />I don't want it to end.<br />A pretty wholesome show that is very entertaining .

B00BLCHZC2|5.0|It's a great show, and has high quality play back. Lots of action and a great plot. A spartacus like show without the nudity...
B003WE9TU8|4.0|i liked this book but it was not fun to read.  it was interesting though so i would recommend it but be prepared for a miss match of characters that don't interact.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is an easy read and provides very clear insight into the power of habits in our daily lives and the development of habit to get us where we want to go. I am incorporating what I learned into my daily routine to incorporate exercise into each day with the goal of making it my habit.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I enjoyed this series very much, but I never could get past Henry's dark hair. In all the pictures I've seen, he was a redhead. It bothered me. The actor playing Henry was very good. It's not that. It's the hair.
B001QC7DY2|5.0|I watched this movie on a plane ride from Buffalo NY to Spokane WA.  It filled in the time and was a excellent movie to watch on the plane since I had kids around me.  I loved the costumes and cars from the older days.  Just a well made movie and it was based on a true story as well.  I say, watch it and you will enjoy it immensely!
B002ZG98UK|5.0|Great 3D Fun for teenagers to adults who are Resident Evil fans. Great production values! A great way for the Resident Evil fans to enjoy action, guts, and gore in Full 1080p 3D - more so if you're using an HDMI 1.4a HD 3D Projector.
B005IT0V8O|3.0|As Stephen King wrote: you either get grammar or you don't. This book is good, and can help, but if you don't already understand grammar, this book will not be a lot of use.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A good season of Downton. It's sad that some of the main characters depart.  An excellent picture of the era.
1612183956|4.0|There's almost nothing I can say about Blake Crouch's PINES, as far as plot is concerned, that wouldn't be a spoiler. With the intent of working my way through the list of International Thriller Writers 2013 Thriller Award nominees, I eagerly looked forward to reading Crouch for the first time.<br /><br />PINES starts out traditionally enough with Secret Service agent Ethan Burke regaining consciousness in a small town where he was sent on an investigation and suffering from partial amnesia. From the opening chapter Crouch has the pot heating up on a hot stove, but the recipe he followed wasn't at all what I expected. As he continued to add ingredients and more heat, the mixture started to simmer and exude scents that smelled familiar but gave no clue as to the finished dish.<br /><br />In fact, there's little about PINES that doesn't come as a surprise no matter how much you may anticipate what's coming. I had a vague sense of what was happening, but like Ethan, I never really saw the big picture--sort of like seeing an unfinished jigsaw puzzle with some of the key pieces still missing--until the reveal near the end when everything falls into place.<br /><br />Along the way, Crouch sets an increasingly relentless pace that keeps Ethan on the move and readers turning pages, yet never fails to temper the breathtaking narrative with insight into what drives Ethan. PINES may not have been a dish I'd typically select from the thriller menu, but it is every bit a thriller, one that kept me up late several nights in a row. And though Crouch's recipe for this concoction came as a surprise, after tasting PINES, his nomination isn't. It's a book that still has me thinking about it long after reading the final page.
B005P06AAO|5.0|Its almost awkward just watching the show! So funny! You don't have to think about it, its easy just to zone out and laugh. Team Matty! Haha
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle's autobiography captures not only what he did, but who he is.  The fact that Chris describes his emotions, feelings and personal conflicts, not only regarding war but also in dealing with loyalty and responsibility to family, country and his fellow SEALs made this a worthy read.
B00136JS12|4.0|I was not a fan of Boston when their albums were originally released.  Over the last few years I have really enjoyed their music.  This is the first  Boston album I have purchased and I am pleased with it.  I wanted more. I will soon purchase the other original albums.<br /><br />Good clean sound with lots of brain candy effects.  Great musicianship and writing. Recommend it.
B009K72G8I|5.0|Love the darkness and the building towards Anakin's downfall in the Episode 3 movie.. but its the interplay of all the characters that just makes this seaon. The writers really found themselves in season 4 and 5.. you could see it really coming up in 2 and 3.. but 4 and 5 are just super-tv.. something I basically never say.
0307341577|5.0|It's so rare to find a novel that is well-written as well as truly suspenseful and thrilling. I fell in love with the characters. I just could not put this book down. Highly recommended, along with Flynn's Gone Girl and Sharp Objects.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use it every night. Great selection of relaxing sounds. I get to sleep within about 10 minutes every night.
0307341550|5.0|I am just in love with all of Flynn's book, but I think that has to be my favorite. Everything is perfect, especially the characters. I just could not put it down. Definitely not for those who do not enjoy their books and movies a little edgier.I would highly recommend checking out Flynn's Gone Girl and Dark Places as well.

B00362DRN6|5.0|Duran Duran (Deluxe Edition) is a 3 CD 2010 remaster of the 1981 debut album by Duran Duran and is a mix of New Wave, New romantic, post-punk, dance-rock, and synthpop. My favorite tracks are Girls On Film, and Planet Earth. The first CD contains the original album plus b-sides. The second CD contains unreleased versions and remixes. The 3rd CD contains the videos, and still more unreleased versions of songs. A great remastering that should not be missed by fans of Duran Duran. Highly recommended. 5/5.

The first CD contains the Original UK Album and on the same disc one gets the Original U.S. album mixes. The second disc contains demos, Non album singles and B-Sides, and versions and mixes. Great tracks are Rio, Save a Prayer and Hungry Like a Wolf. The booklet contains music notes, all the lyrics and many nice photographs. Truly an amazing record that should not be missed! Highly recommended indeed! 5/5.

1475143389|5.0|If you are serious about making changes to your body and health, then look no further, this book is perfect.  It's a no BS book that will let you know everything you need to know about diet, muscle building, cardio, weightless, and more.  A very simple read and it hooks you from the start. The first time I read this book, I did in a night, and have read it 4 times since.  I have recommended this book to friends, family, and co workers.  The end comes with a bonus report that leads the way in getting you started, and for the year after.  Mike's website also has blogs that will go along with this book, and is being constantly updated.  Since reading this book, my diet has improved immensely, I started doing cardio ( which used to be a nightmare), my strength has gone up, and by body fat and gone down.  Stop reading reviews already and order this book! You will not regret it.  Also recommended that you order The shredded chef and Cardio sucks for even further gains and knowledge.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|This is a classical movie for all times.  The movie is funny and the songs are timeless.  I have enjoyed this movie for years and I was glad I was able to enjoy it with my children.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I liked the book as Sheryl does a good job of advising on what to do when you get to the top.  I wonder though if her experience translates well to women climbing the 'ladder' or the 'jungle jim' bottom up.  For the most part, the Harvard education and connections she had teleported her to the top quickly.<br /><br />Sheryl makes predictions about the direction women in business is taking.  Harvard recently published an article that suggested her prediction was not consistent with business trends women (graduating from Harvard).were experiencing.  Perhaps the quote she offered in her book could be applied on a broader scope.<br /><br />Sheryl seems to suggest that the business success expectation distribution for women and men are the same.  My experience over the past 40+ years doesn't bear this out.  Women are far more diverse in their expectation for the balance between work and life.  Having read A Woman's Way of Knowing, I felt better prepared to read Lean In.<br /><br />Sabrina

B009NX409M|5.0|Meryl Streep is my favorite actress and when you put her together with Robert Dinero's quirky attitude it just makes for a great pairing. Loved it years ago when it came out in VHS (does anyone remember those?) and still love it!!
B00CBXVGPC|5.0|One of the interesting things about the books (which I very much enjoyed) is that in the end, the author simply wasn't capable of giving Hannibal the depth he deserved.  This really wasn't his fault, but he tried to create this perfect super-killer who was quite simply better than \\"normal\\" humans in every single way.  Now we're presented with this version of Hannibal and I want to say to begin with that my gut reaction to Mads playing Hannibal was that \\"This is a very bad idea.\\"  I know that he's a good actor but I didn't think that he'd be able to give Hannibal the, erm, charm if you will, that Hopkins brought to the table while playing this character.  Honestly, this is true, however he plays out Doctor Lecter's more subtle actions in ways that are very easy to miss.<br /><br />This is not a high action series, but it doesn't need to be.  If you're looking for explosions and car chases and massive gunfights, this will not be for you.  It's a measured and paced look into the mind of a madman.  There are definitely moments of violence and action, but the tale of Hannibal has always been one of suspense, and the actors that play Will Graham, and Hannibal Lecter are excellent at creating tension.  I'm hesitant to give too much detail, but there's a scene where you can tell that Hannibal is making a decision to be helpful, not because he wants to, but because he knows it would look strange if he didn't.  The measured pace, and very specific acting that this scene takes leaves you with a rather disturbing impression of the man which is exactly the target that needed to be hit.<br /><br />Frankly I think the only semi-poor choice was Laurence Fishburn.  I don't think this is his fault as an actor, and I'm not even sure that anyone would be well suited to play the role to be frank.  There are times when the character seems blunt and ignorant, and others when he comes across as better mannered than Doctor Lecter.  I'm not sure the creators know quite what they want from this character, and so if there is a weak point in the show it's this part.<br /><br />Still, this show seems to be well constructed and well thought out.  It's obvious it's in it's first season, and the characters are still figuring out their chemistry together, but I believe that in the long run as good as it is, this show will only get better.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|Even though Kate Hudson is supposed to be &#34;the star&#34; she's not in this movie!!!  I hate her character from the beginning!!!  The star of this movie is Jennifer and she and Colin Egglesfield make it a delight to watch<br />, which I have about 5 times. Love the additional characters!! Watch this if you just want a &#34;feel good&#34; movie. TWO THUMBS UP!!!!
B00B7VPKMY|4.0|This box set was originally offered as a numbered, limited one-time only release, so I was surprised to see it now offered on Amazon.  I purchased the original release, which did include the Eagles Live recording from 1980, plus a bonus CD of Please Come Home for Christmas and Funky New Year, so I can't really give a 5-star rating for this reissue, but the music's still great.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I got these as a gift for my best friend so we could play FPS online.  I have the DPX21's but was impressed with the quality of these.  They sound great!  Definitely worth the buy!  Make sure to compare the price for these to that of the DPX21 before purchasing.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is one of the cutest and the funniest games ever. You control two<br />  this  time.<br />In my opinion I think this game is one of the greatest  apps ever up there with angry birds and cut the rope.
B005721Y7Y|4.0|if u think hitting the forty your life it's over, think again.. this movie show us that, any time we want to come back to live again, we can do it, we can do whatever we want to be till the last minute of our life.. nobody is in charge of our happiness but ourselves..
B0074VA2T2|2.0|I wish the caterpillar would come across the screen or something to eat the holes. Not enough interaction with the charter.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I have spend more than 50 hours and it is an excelent game. The history, the voices, the gameplay, the music, I like everithing.<br /> I recomend it.
B008I3QZKU|3.0|I enjoyed this album from start to finish as I have with all of the band's previous works. Despite some changes from album to album they maintain a certain kind of sound that I really dig and I always look forward to hearing anything new from them. I found this album to be stronger in the front 9 of the course as opposed to the back 9; Flesh and Bone is a strong opening track and is followed by my favorite song on the album, Runaways. The Way It Was and Here with Me are two more really good songs and the rest of the album isn't bad but seems to tail off a bit. It's not my favorite Killers album, but a worthwhile addition to the rest of their releases and definitely worth picking up if you're already a fan or just are looking for something new for your library.<br /><br />Rated by song:<br />5 Star: 1<br />4 Star: 3<br />3 Star: 5<br />2 Star: 3<br /><br />Overall: 3.2 / 5 (Good)
0920668364|5.0|What a wonderful book!  It is such a thoughtful children's book and teaches children about loving family.  I will be  purchasing this book again as gifts since the message is so meaningful  The shipping was very fast.
B00C32R64G|5.0|You can't go wrong with Volbeat!  Pay particular attention to 'Cape of Our Hero', 'Lola Montez', and  'My Body'. They grabbed my attention Immediatly.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works beautifully on my 1st Generation Kindle Fire-- I would imagine that it would run just as smoothly on the new HD model. The app itself provides all of the weather information you really hope to find in one online source like animated projection maps and hourly forecasts.  So far the predictions have been fairly accurate and it updates frequently. I switched from the Weather Channel app to this one and couldn't be happier with the result.
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|I paid for a film that I did not see.  All I was able to see was the preview.  I would like to have my money returned to me please.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I like getting the DVD/Blu-ray combo, since I'm not yet fully Blu-ray throughout the house.  I have not used UltraViolet, and have some misgivings about that particular option.  This is not the future-expected &#34;extended edition&#34;, and I had considered waiting until that version comes out, but what the heck: $19 is OK, and I'll wait until all three segments are done, then get the boxed set ;-)
0061733199|1.0|My boy scout hand book has just as much information as this thing did , not worth it , do your home work and rsearch your book choices
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Not a fan.  I wanted news channels, not religion. I totally understand religious outreach, but I was really looking for news and maybe a little entertainment.
B009CWWFD2|5.0|I have read everything that J. Archer has published over the years. He is a true genius.  This was an excellent read!
B000QK7YQ2|4.0|A bit dated but still fun to watch. It is a fine history of several motor cyclist from the last millennium.
B004V6BQ3O|2.0|Picked this up to use with my Nikon V1. In the past had a Rode VideoMic which in my opinion works much better than this. Only upside is that this does not require a battery source.
0739352962|5.0|This is a very good series. I highly recommend this to anybody who is watching the Game of Thrones series on HBO.
B000OLROWC|3.0|I love the Karate Kid in all it's eighties teen angst glory. I also really like the original ending. Why cut it out??? In this version they stop right after Daniel wins the tournament. Cutting out the parking lot scene with Mr Miyagi handing it to the Cobra guy. It was better.
0545091020|5.0|The Hunger Games is a great series. It's awesome. I highly recommend this. All three of the books are great!
0525953728|5.0|I thought the book was easy and enjoyable to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a &#34;red cell&#34; approach to the Bin Laden operation. If you believe the news got the small details wrong, then this is the book to read. Morally, I do believe the author did not follow standard protocol and should have taken the legal route to avoid being placed in court.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|It is one of my most favorite movies of all time. I highly recommend this movie. It follows the book really well.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|First I would like to thank fireproof games for making this game. This very addicting and it's really fun to play. Though this game has only a few levels but the levels are very long I mean it's a puzzle, puzzles are long right!? Haha... anyways I'm looking forward to the &quot;The Room&quot; I highly recommend this game for everyone who likes puzzles but even if you don't like puzzles you should at least try this game. Who knows maybe you'll like It.
144235545X|5.0|If you are a Vince Flynn fan and you loved The American Assassin, then you will love this book too! Along with all of his other titles!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you can take your eyes off the fabulous clothing, the gorgeous home decor, and Maggie Smith's great face, you will love the acting in this finely tuned period piece that's full of human nature-cause and effect.  Characters that you love to hate, love to ridicule and love to love are all in this masterpiece. The synopsis that sums up season 1 and 2 is brilliantly done.  I laughed in the most unexpected places and will probably watch it again.  Bravo!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is EPIC 'cause it has nice graphics and always has something in store for you, and always has a theme at least once a month with new boards and limited character. May be like Temple Run ®, but then again the makers always have cool deals.
B000PY6BBI|4.0|Clever with wonderful characters and when Matthew Broderick was at his best.  Humor mixed with drama - well done. A corny ending tops it off.  Like Princess Bride, this movie will always be fun to watch. Innocence is still alive and well.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I found it very difficult to put this or the other Stieg Larsson works down.  Fast paced, plenty of twists and turns add in some romance and it becomes a great read.  It does make me want to visit Sweden!  If only you could have been with us longer, Stieg Larsson.
B000002P86|4.0|Perfect title for a perfect CD.  I fell in love with BB almost 12 years ago when I was introduced to the &#34;blues&#34;.  Since then I have enjoyed listening to different blues artist and going to Blues Festivals just because of &#34;this&#34; CD.  If you never experienced Lucille before, you will learn to hear her with your heart and soul.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is the way to go. Between the blue ray and ultraviolet I now have The Hobbit on every viewing device I own. The service from Amazon was fast and a better value than anywhere you could go. This is definitely the way to buy movies.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This is an out standing moive.  It was packaged very well and it was in new condition.  I will be buying all of my moives on Amazon.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|If you are a Civil War buff, you will probably will be disappointed. There isn't much battle tactics or history shown.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|We both love it! Couldn't wait for season two now looking for a season 3 and hoping we'll get one
B007HB5TN8|4.0|always a good story.  like all jane austin books, i can re read it time and again. the writing is good and the period in which she writes is interesting.
B002L5KL5G|5.0|Right there with Goodfellas and Godfather. This is another movie that I'll watch every time it's on TV. I got it here because after all the times I'd seen it, my wife never had! So I enjoyed it again while she got to enjoy it for the first time!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Again, there was ocean view in this movie and very much of spirituality, beliefs, and so much confident to survival.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Sat & read the book at every opportunity I had. Couldn't watch the movie in one hit, had to pause & then fell asleep. Just didn't work for me.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good.....short refreshing read...nice to read on a rainy afternoon..Will read another book from this author...Good inexpensive price for the book
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|If they were on a stage maybe it would be better. Just couldn't handle it as a movie, not a favourite.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|Ah, if Hollywood could only make classic movies like this again. Back when I was a kid in the 60's we would always be glued to the TV when this movie was on. I have owned this movie on VHS, DVD, HD DVD and now on Blu-ray. In fact, I haven't even had a chance to watch this Blu-ray yet, but I know I will not be disappointed. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe's Robin Hoods are ok, but can't compete with this movie at all. Errol Flynn is fantastic as Robin Hood and Alan Hale Sr. is the best little John I have ever seen. With bad guys Claude Rains (Prince John) and Basil Rathbone (Sir Guy of Gisbourne) this movie truly has an all star cast. And don't forget Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marian, you could not ask for a better or more beautiful actress! If you have never seen this movie then you need to check it out. I promise that you will enjoy every swing of a sword, every purse that is taken and every arrow that cuts a candles flame.
B003008RWA|5.0|It's a must see movie for everyone. Something must be done about the US Healthcare system and media has to grow people's awareness to be able to changed it for a better and much more humane system.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|We got this because our 13 year old daughter is finally old enough to become a browncoat! She wasn't sure after the first episode, but by the end of the second episode she was hooked! Unfortunately, she was disapointed to learn there is only 1 season!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I are both addicted now.  This series has history, romance and a story of what life was like in this era.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|More of the same like lord of the rings; been a while since I read the book, but seems like. Peter Jackson changed a lot to stretch this out more than necessary
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It was a page turner with a lot of suspense and action. I can't wait to start on Jack Reacher, No. 2.<br /><br />Lisa K.
B004NELBPC|1.0|Agree with many other reviewers, font too small for my aging eyes, no flipping from portrait to landscape. Fix these bugs and I'll be back on board.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great to be able to take Downton with me and catch- up in hd! Amazon made it easy - thank you!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|As the Doctor says, time is not so much a straight line as a squiggly, wiggly thingy.  That pretty much describes the plot line of Dr. Who as well with characters and references that are both forward and backward looking.  Watching season 4 with Donna Noble again has been fun since it allowed me to connect at least a few of the squiggles together, such as then the Doctor and Rose recognize Gwen as the doppelganger descendant of the maid who died in the Dickens episode or the way Jack's disappearance from Tochwood with the severed hand fits into the Dr. Who series.  I'm still waiting, however, to see when the Doctor's 'daughter' reappears.
B003SNKBXW|5.0|A very well written page turner.  This multi-layered mystery was one that I could not put down.  I did not get all of the many literary references so now I will have to read Dumas!
B000QE9ERK|2.0|This movie starts out great; the story is engaging the characters are interesting.  But this movie is completely ruined by the ending...very weak ending.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Everyone should read this, Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us.  Not only does Michael Moss, view with alarm, he very effectively describes the science behind it.  By &#34;effectively&#34; I mean I could understand it.  I'm happy to recommend this it anyone who wonders about what we're eating and most especially to anyone who's raising children.  For my part, I'll admit to mistakes in raising mine; I wish I had &#34;Salt Sugar Fat...&#34; back then.
B000001GXF|5.0|A must-have cd for Shubert lovers.  the &#34;best of Shubert&#34; as encompassed in the Trout and the fight of Death for the life of the Maiden.
0061537969|5.0|This book was really enjoyable.  Told from the dog's point of view it will make you laugh out loud one minute and cry the next as the main character and his wife deal with a terminal illness.  I have recommended it to many friends who have agreed with me.  I even enjoyed understanding some NASCAR type illuminations when Stein gives you background on  racing terms and conditions and what is required.  I had no idea that those race car drivers had so much to think about.  Read it; you won't be disappointed.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|Works quite well once you get it set up.  PITA to initially configure as their original shipping firmware would NOT log onto most modern WiFi networks requiring a hardwire ethernet connection overnight in order for it to update.<br /><br />Once that craziness was over works very reliably.  Not perfect but very good for the price.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I read Wool after reading a review in the Washington Post.  I'm not really into Sci Fi, but this is more about the main character and her determination to get through the challenges presented.  It was an interesting story but not as well written or as captivating as the Hunger Games series.  Still it wasn't a bad read.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|Fun game to pass the time. Clear lines easy to read. At times it can be difficult to drag across a word but still very enjoyable.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This books brings you back in time and like The Help looks into the relationships between the races in the South (although a much earlier era) and the particular situation of a young girl whose parents die at sea and she is left with the plantation owners slaves in &#34;the kitchen house&#34; to raise her.  It's a bit predictable at times but a good read
B00785P2QC|5.0|simple Sim city game. if like those types of games, you'll like this one. it does run itself when you aren't on and you don't need wick to keep playing.
1250012570|4.0|Is it wrong to believe going in to a novel that you WILL love the book or else you will be completely wrong about yourself? Because going into ELEANOR AND PARK, I was pretty confident that this book could do no wrong. In most cases, this would pretty much be setting me up for disaster (see REBOOT).<br /><br />Well... Maybe this was the one time where my instincts were correct. Even with a few issues that nagged me, I loved ELEANOR AND PARK. It might have been because it resonated with my life, or because I loved the 1980s and everything related to it (even though I was barely alive during it), but there was something about this book that stayed with me for days after finishing it, enough that I went out and started recommending it to strangers in the bookstore. I think they might have thought I was creepy. It's less creepy on the internet, though, isn't it?<br /><br />SO THERE'S THIS BOOK...<br /><br />I've seen several reviews point out a number of issues with this book, namely with our hero Park's parents and their relationship. Even though I should know better than to let this slide under the rug, as I read I kind of ignored it. I know plenty of real life people whom this has happened with. One of my best friends growing up is the daughter of a retired US soldier who met his Korean wife while serving in Korea, except that was during the 1980s. One of my friends now is living in Korea dating a Korean man.<br /><br />But this point aside - I think the main reason why I identified so heavily with this book was because I saw me in Eleanor. Growing up, I really was a poor, thrift store-savvy, slightly overweight girl without a lick of fashion sense. And luckily I've grown into the same girl with a little more fashion sense.  Eleanor is one of the best-written female protagonists I've read in awhile, a girl just desperate to keep her wits about her as her life crumbles into ashes slowly but surely.<br /><br />Park, on the other hand, is the type of guy I used to hang out with in high school - the type of guy you meet at the \\"others\\" table beyond the cool kids, the geeks, the nerds, the band kids, the drama fanatics, etc. Just the kids too busy listening to music or reading to care about the politics of the lunch room. Once again, a character after my own heart.<br /><br />THE EIGHTIES FOR THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION<br /><br />Rowell has a way with words. It's clean and sparse, told in a third person point of view (which, for dual POVs, is what I prefer to be honest). It's the work of a true writer when the author is able to still convey emotions and get you into the mindset of a character when you're left outside their heads. Rowell is an expert of this, and I look forward to reading more of her work if this is repeated across books.<br /><br />But where the story went a little wrong for me was that at times it seemed that more focus was needed elsewhere from our burgeoning relationship. I wanted to know more about Eleanor's family, for instance - what caused their situation, her mother's issues, her father walking out on the family. A lot of it seemed glossed over. Similarly with Park's family, I felt something was missing, like the puzzle in the story was not yet completed. Some more could have easily been added and some of the repetitive courtship eliminated.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent story for teens and adults, especially adults who were in high school in the 80s. This novel will go down as one of my bright spots of 2013, or at least the early part of it, and it has and will be a story I keep recommending over and over again to friends and the readers of my reviews. Pick up a copy of this book today. I can ALMOST guarantee that you will love it.<br /><br />VERDICT: Although at times the romance overwhelms the story, ELEANOR AND PARK is a breath of fresh air in young adult contemporary fiction.

B003U51EE8|5.0|one if the finest series ever, I've watched five seasons since January.  Outstanding performances, sophisticated writing have created a sensation.
B000FCKRDI|3.0|This one threw me after reading the first two books.  I thought the shyest Wallflower would choose another man, but maybe in the end, she got the right match for herself.  She went after what she wanted (subconsciously?) and she got it.  More power to women everywhere who are &#34;Wallflowers&#34; now, but whose time to shine will come...
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Too short.  I couldn't  put it down..  a beautifully written book.  And yes . I did laugh out loud!  And cried.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very fun and addicting! I love this game! Couldnt put it down! Cant wait to play the next one! Awesome
B00005JL96|4.0|Stitch is so funny.  Crazy little alien learns all about everything.  And how can an unstoppable Elvis loving alien not be funny?
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|In the end, it is almost exactly how I pictured it. (Obvious Spoiler) The Dark One is locked in an Eternal prison, forever sealed from destroying the Wheel of Time. Amazing, worth every penney.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I couldn't even finish watching this after trying to watch it for over an hour.  The main character is obviously out of his mind and the whole movie is warped as a result.  I usually enjoy even the worst Sci-Fi flicks.  This one I could not get into.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|The music is just as moving as  the movie, I love instrumental sound tracks and this one has become one of my favorite
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie will be good for children, but I think it was really made with adults in mind.  Children of the early 80s who used to frequent arcades will be able to pick up on all of the little nuances and inside jokes.  Great concept for a movie.
B00B22IJXK|4.0|This app is very entertaining, there's a lot to do! Lots of editing and color options and even a fun meme creator.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I like to build a castle and a modern house it's a really fun game it's not just about blocks and stack them like Lego  it's about having fun and imagine what you can build  you should try this game it's really fun.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|The Golden Compass is the first story in a series of 3 excellent books by Pullman on freedom of the human spirit. We need to loved free and make our own choices.<br />This story is not only captivating and imaginative but suspenseful. We care deeply for the characters.<br />This is aimed at young people but I am 60 years old and find a lot of deep meaning in the eriting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you get to be a horse owner in the game and buy as many you want and win composition and level up buy new places  do a quest and much more try it free.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|Schwarzenegger at his best!  You can't beat the opening scene w/ Arnold demanding the dude's bike and clothes--especially coming back after the barkeeper comes out w/ the shotgun and looses his shades!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is way better than temple run and easy try it for free and also you can get a lot of characters.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|It's one thing to offer a 3D only version at a discounted price, but to offer this movie with only a 3D version (I don't count the digital copy...I like owning physical discs) for over $30 is not only ridiculous, it's insulting.  I've willingly updated several of my classic Disney DVD/Blu-Rays to 3D but apparently that kind of loyalty does not go rewarded.  It's a greedy money grab which is not terribly shocking, but very disappointing.  As other reviewers have noted, in my home I am the only one who watches movies in 3D.  Some family members just don't like watching 3D movies while others prefer watching them in their own rooms.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering your review forums which allow folks to make informed decisions before shelling out top dollar for significantly less product than what the studio has previously offered.  Not only will I not be buying this product, but, if this trend continues, I will not be upgrading anymore of my Disney movies to 3D (or Blu-ray for that matter).  If Disney's (and any studios who follow suit) goal is to bring sales of 3D TVs, glasses, players, and movies to a screeching halt, then keep going in the 3D only/full price direction.  3D at home is already too expensive and somewhat of a niche market.  Those of us who buy 3D movies and equipment are a pretty savvy bunch and expecting us not to notice such a less for more offering is, well, wicked.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I realy like this app so you can bild what ever you would want like a casle  or a house
0345529057|5.0|I love these books. I had to take a break at one point to recover from the shock of some of the plot twists.
B00AKEMHCA|2.0|this game is fun but your data will soon or later get erased like mine did i was rank 86 and then all of a sudden i get on my tablet to play it and my entire game was erased and now ibhabe to start all over again

B003JTHXOK|4.0|I couldn't put the book down.  It was easy to read!!  I can't wait till the movie comes out on DVD.
B0010SKSTO|3.0|The book provides a good overview of &#34;tells&#34; (body language which provides insight into what a person really thinks/feels) from various areas of a persons's body (head, eyes, legs, etc).  However, the content would have been more valuable if some means of prioritizing what to look for from among the large number of &#34;tells&#34; discussed was provided.  Worth the read in my opinion nonetheless.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|I have had this for a few days now and still can not get it to work the way i want on my kindle fire, maybe its me but i was warningthere is a learning curve for this app. Once I get it working the way i was sold on,  I will increase stars but it really takes alot of time to set up and that is most likly where I went wrong
B0016JBCJW|5.0|I love this film it's color and destination, dry humor and all the characters have something to offer in this film. Amazing not to be missed.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|it is very loud and works perfect. It is way better then my smartpphone and easy to use. highly suggested
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was worth the time to watch.  It was kind of weird in the beginning but unraveled well. Enjoy it!
B000FA675C|5.0|I really enjoy Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series.  The Da Vinci Code is his best book in my opinion.  Though some of the heroics are a little unbelievable, the overall story content and symbology are interesting and informative.  I find myself learning a lot about religious history (or his opinions on it) w/o reading a text book.  Langdon is a great character who you cheer for.  He's highly intelligent but comes off as believable and sincere, not pompous.  The adventure keeps your interest throughout.
B0001US62I|4.0|I first saw this movie years ago and, when the special edition came out, I bought a copy.  Angel is hired by a strange man (played by De Niro with an odd set of fingernails) to find a missing man who goes by the name of Johnny Favorite.  Along the way, he uncovers a strange tale of voodoo and spells and danger.  Eventually, he makes contact with Epiphany, a Voodoo priestess, and begins to get closer and closer to the truth.  Unfortunately for all involved, as he leaves a trail of bodies in his wake wherever he goes.<br /><br />A strange movie with a wonderfully dark atmosphere that builds up as you watch it, but it might be a little slow for some.  For the faint of heart, some of the scenes could be a bit much.  Mickey Rourke does a great job as ever...who but him could have played Harry Angel, really?  De Niro, well, this is not a shining role for him and I might have cast someone else.<br /><br />Some of the set-up seemed pretty obvious...Louis Cyphre, really?  But the final twist can definitely catch you off guard.<br /><br />The special edition includes documentary pieces regarding Voodoo, in particular in New Orleans, and that very much adds to the understanding of the movie.  Its worth getting...
B004XWMXW4|4.0|Enjoying this CD a lot.  Very innovative interpretations.  In particular, listen to  Where the Streets Have No Name and Misiriou which you will recognize from the film Pulp Fiction.
0307477479|5.0|A Visit from the Goon Squad is something.  And that ambiguity is intended, as different members of our book club viewed it very differently.  It felt like a book of short stories -- initially disappointing for some -- but it then emerged as a novel presented in glimpses, with uniting themes, and character revelation more than development.  The theme of passage of time as a goon was supported by portrayals of serial striving, self-destruction and redemption.  It was a compelling story, and also a series of successful experiments in writing.  To share both sides, some felt the book was merely clever, or -- I hesitate -- too cute.  In fact, it might not have been beautiful in a traditional sense, and certainly Ms. Egan did strive to show off.  But if she does strive too much and self-destructs following such success, I'll place a bet on redemption.  I also won't be surprised if we find ourselves living in something very similar to her final chapter in a few years.  All-in, this book made for a great discussion on innovations in writing style as much as thoughts on connectedness and redemption.  Grades ranged fairly broadly from B to A+.  I was in the latter camp, thus the 5 stars!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Word suggestions feature is awesome. It is much better than any other keyboard I've used. I also likes how it remembers whole sentence sometime if you use it regularly. Whenever I change ROM on my phone, this is the first thing I install.
0385536828|4.0|The story is a love letter in the form of a spy novel, as one member of book club put it.  And it has interesting themes for discussion, in the novelist as a spy, and the precursors to decay (sweet tooth, you know).  But most folks at dinner didn't particularly like Serena, who seemed fairly vain and shallow and let herself be defined by a random stream of men.  Maybe though we should be more sympathetic, as she was just finding her bearings in the not-quite-yet modern world (it was hard to recognize a period piece in a period within easy memory).  I think our views of the book overall were tough because we've been taught to have high expectations of Mr. McEwan.  But this work that's partly about the process of writing and reading seemed a bit self-regarding, almost self-conscious (including repetitious comments on the Booker).  Still, we liked the structure, including the short stories within the novel.  In full disclosure, we all got an email from one absent member after the wrap-up was sent, explaining why we didn't appropriately appreciate this novel -- partly because we don't understand young women.  So please feel free to consider us unreliable reviewers.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I was also having same issue as others when I was updating with latest version. Then I uninstalled the existing version and then reinstalled. Everything worked fine. As far as channel lineup and other features are considered, it is the best app hands down!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Although the plot is pretty improbable and predictable and the characters get sexy with each other too quickly, the characters are interesting and the actual writing style is great so I can suspend my incredulity enough to enjoy the read.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I liked the previous version. I would rather it did not run all the time. This version may take some getting used to...
B005LAIIKI|1.0|I usually dont post movie reviews even though I have bought countless movies on Amazon ranging from dramas to sci -fi to westerns to comedies.  I rented this film at Redbox because that is what I usually do with new movies prior to committing $20+ to an actual purchase.  All I can say is, I watched about 1 hour of this movie and turned it off.  I dont have anything aqainst Quentin T.  I think his movie Pulp Fiction is a classic.  I loved it.  I dont have any issues with violence in movies, or the use of certain words.  Doesnt bother me at all.  I just found this movie quite amateurish.  The title song at the very beginning of the movie reminded me of Charro.  It was laughable at best.  The music in the movie clashed with the movie itself.  The acting was ok.  Leo DeCaprio is always good, he is an excellent actor.  The cinematography was nothing more than a poor man's imitation of Stanley Kubrick.  Even the editing was shoddy.  Maybe its me, I can readily acknowledge that maybe I dont get QT.  But at the same time, I am very open minded.  My movie collection spans all genres of film, old and new dating all the way back to the 1920s.  I sat to watch this movie with an open mind.  Actually I had no POV before seeing the film.  BUt as I said before, after watching this movie for 1 hour, I turned it off.  It didnt have the feel of a western, it didnt have the feel of a civil war piece, it didnt have any feel to be quite honest.  I love immersing myself into a movie.  I tried with this one.  Just couldnt do it.  Anyway, thats my take.
0452284937|4.0|I first stumbled across Tracy Chevalier nearly a decade ago when I happened upon \\"The Virgin Blue\\" in my local library. After devouring that, as well as \\"The Lady and the Unicorn\\", I turned to \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". Perhaps it was because I had recently finished something completely different from this type of book, but for whatever reason, it didn't sit well with me. I knew it was probably better than I had remembered, so I recently went back to it. I was right to re-read it; this is a beautiful book.<br /><br />The book focuses on the story of Griet, a maid in Delft, Holland, in the late seventeenth century. Her father is a tile painter who has recently lost his sight to an accident with a kiln, and to make ends meet, she must go find work. When a local painter who knows of her father's situation through the guild offers to take her in as a maid to clean his studio, she moves out of her childhood home and into a world of art, beauty, and complications. For the man who has hired her is none other than Johannes Vermeer, a celebrated (though very poor) local painter.<br /><br />It is in the Vermeer household that Griet first awakens to the world of art. Through being exposed to Vermeer's paintings (and conversations with the man himself), she begins to look at light, color - every aspect of life - in a new way. Though she often clashes with his controlling wife, Catarina, and his daughter Cornelia, Griet enjoys her work. She may be a humble servant, but she gets to watch some of the most exquisite art being created, day by day, brush stroke by brush stroke.<br /><br />In the course of her work, Griet develops a severe crush on her employer, around the same time a butcher's son begins to show interest in her. And while Vermeer thinks highly of the maid, he's more focused on his work than any effect it may have on other people. Through the complex (and yet simple) relationship between the painter and the maid, Chevalier sets the tone for what may have inspired one of the seventeenth century's most famous paintings.<br /><br />As in all of her books, Tracy Chevalier does an excellent job at creating a world that draws you in, one line at a time. She nearly paints the scene where this all takes place, brings characters to life, and puts the reader in the position of both understanding Griet's troubles, while at the same time wanting to warn her of what must inevitably come next. It's truly a book worth looking at.
0446364495|4.0|Such a beautiful story of 2 people whose lives were simply aligned with the stars for just a moment of time. How fortunate they were to be able to experience more than with each other than thought they would ever imagined. But at the same time misfortunate due to the sincerest commitment of their current lives....Reality and love simply doe not offer any guarantees.
B00C49H3WI|5.0|My husband & I watched the 1st, fast moving episode.  It was suspenseful, intriguing, mysterious, & drew us in immediately.  It was one of those sci-fi shows that should not be believable, but is. In fact, perhaps it's too close to present reality, making us uncomfortable, because the main character (a strong female lead) is one of several clones, and finds this out accidentally.  In reality, scientists have actually cloned animals, etc. What's next?<br />And, finally a sci fi story about an orphan who is both strong, fragile, wounded & resilient at the same time, but finds herself, always of walking the edge, extremely vulnerable, yet she seems to be super street smart, resourceful, & manages to survive one nightmare or trauma after the other. (Almost like a Jason Bourne thing, yet Sci-Fi world.)<br />She is also not without aide, as she has a best friend (he's gay,) to die for, who would obviously take a bullet for her, and make it fun at the same time.  He's a guardian angel of sorts.<br />It's hip, edgy, dark, well-rounded with characters that are people we have never met before, which is interesting, and somehow real, but in some other world/reality.  The director/writers take us to another lifestyle.  Here we can at once experience all those human emotions with them, and yet it leaves it us voyeurs, because we can relate and experience all those same emotions with them, but are not even close to being in that kind of lifestyle or situation in our daily lives.

B00BF123WG|2.0|I found this movie to be great for the information it provided although it was sometimes hard to follow.<br />Other than that, I was pretty much unimpressed based on the hype and Academy Award nominations.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I had bought this specifically for a documentary I was making for our local hospital. During the first few minutes of using it, I got some terrible interference that was entirely too distracting to be able to use in the video. This delayed my recording by a week, as I had to get a different mic. I ended up just getting the Rode Pro hotshoe mic that ended up working great. Its not ideal for interviews, but the sound is outstanding in its price range. I would love to return this mic, but I can't figure out how.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|In anticipation of getting to actually watch the movie, I reached out to the book for story line. Good read and very discriptive of the<br />background of Pi. While I enjoyed the film and it's scenery, with out reading the book firtst, there was a lot I would not have understood.<br /><br /> Strongly Reccomend. As a Kindle book, you can enjoy at your leisure.<br /><br /> Bill Hall

B009AVCAJ4|1.0|I love this movie, and have for years.  I think it is one of the first anime I saw.<br /><br />However, as other reviewers have complained about, the English audio track on this disc is garbage.  It sounds tinny like it is coming through a cheap PC speaker.  I was switching between audio tracks on the fly and it is only the English track that has this issue.<br /><br />I like to watch most movies in their original language with subtitles, but Ninja Scroll is a different story for me because when I was first introduced to this movie we only had the English dub on VHS.  So hearing this movie in the English really takes me back, so many memorable and cheesy lines.  Really disappointed that it is almost un-watchable.<br /><br />It was a gift so I will be keeping it for the Japanese audio version.  Still a great movie, but really pissed about the quality control.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Wonderful!!  After finishing, the story continues to haunt me, making me think of the twists and turns.  Great read, that you don't want to put down.

B00358ESI4|5.0|It brought out so many emotions.  I was married to a man that was a Vietnam Veteran and he has deep emotional and mental issues due to his 2 tours there.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun but timer needs to be longer. I enjoy playing it! Would like a more relaxed  mode of play. Others in my family enjoy it too.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|Those that review this book and author as self absorbed, spoiled & whiny clearly have no understanding of clinical depression. This is a memior; it's SUPPOSED to be all about her feelings and experiences. Just because Elizabeth Gilbert lead a priviledged life does not exempt her from depression, nor does it devalue her feelings and her expression of them. Open your minds.<br />That said, this is a beautifully well written story with a lot to say. Enjoy it, read slow.
B00BWJ91XK|2.0|I finally got around to watching The Hobbit Movie. I can't get over all the undocumented stories and characters that were added to the movie yet had no connection to the original story. Granted some of the characters existed in other Tolkien publications they were never mentioned in the Hobbit. The movie makers just made crap up from their imagination. It made for an interesting plot but it wasn't related to Bilbo's story,&#34;There and Back Again.&#34;<br /><br />I knew things might not be good when I realized they cast Arthur Dent from HitchHiker's Guide to play Bilbo Baggins. He also played a character in Love Actually who was a stand-in for a porn movie. It was never clear if I was watching an action adventure or a BBC Comedy. One scene would be an intimate connection between characters with classic scenery and another had a cartoonish goblin king falling on top on Dwarves after one of them said, &#34;We'll that could have been worse&#34;.<br /><br />Sadly, I know I'll watch it again but I'll continue to view the animated version by Rankin/Bass to be the best version of The Hobbit.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What if JFK had lived? Stephen King takes this question and weaves an incredible time travel story around it. I only wished it had been a longer book! I did not want it to end.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I had a lot of trouble enjoying this book., it could have been 300 pages shorter.....would have been far more interesting.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I'll save the wordy prose for some other time because of you are reading this you probably are not on the fence about this album. You are probably reading this to confirm that everybody else thinks what you think...that Earth Rocker is another awesome Clutch record. True. Very True.

B005B19UPE|5.0|I used this book as a book club reading with my residents. Some had read it before and others it was their first time. They loved it!. The personal sides of the story were what drove you to read on. The historical side made you want to know more about the roundup and how it affected people and history itself.  The only thing was that it left you hanging as far as the relationship between William and Julia.  :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love to play this games and it's really easy to use and see on my Kindle Fire.  I used to have one from Brainium but this is better.

B004S5FW1U|4.0|Apart from far too much footbal the main thrust of the book covering love, being lost, betrayal and trust is inspiring yet painful.<br />Hope prevails.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Fun. Will be forgotten. Tries to be epic, but lacks character. Enders Game, Bio of a Space Tyrant and the Foundation series this isn't.
B002RI9XHO|5.0|This is a classic of modern English and one is taken to the events described as a ringside observer.  Whilst Orwell is writing in what to him was the present the reader knows what is coming in terms of later world events.  There is still a clarity and immediacy to the prose which allows one to understand what the motivation was to participate in &#34;someone else's&#34; war.<br /><br />If only others had had the decency to stand up for what Orwell did and as a result of reading this book I will attempt to do the same.
B000OPPBEQ|2.0|Took me back to VHS as there is no scene selection (or even a menu for that matter) on the movie Blu Rays. Upon starting, it goes straight into the movie and there is no option for a menu, fast forward or Rewind is the only way.  Popped it into the computer and same results,  not even a table of contents. It works tho, which is why I gave it 2 stars; but I hope it was worth the money they saved not taking the extra step to make something so fundamental as indexing.  I wish I didn't buy but I don't want to be out the shipping, so I'll just deal with it.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I Love this book!!!! The teachers at my kids school read this out loud at a mother's day tea and there wasn't a dry eye in the room.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Hardly more than a romance novel.  I read all three more to be able to sneer at the series with my snobby friends.  Read Anias Nin if you want some good Erotica.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|This game is horrible. They say that it is free but you can only play it for a short time until the only way to play this game is to pay.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Hardly more than a romance novel.  Read some Anias Nin for some real Erotica.  There is also an Ann Rice series &#34;The Beauty&#34; series I think which blows this out of the water, although  I must admit to getting bored in the second and third books.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|No spoilers.....An engineer's route to survival in a hostile world.  Loaded with clever and realistic science and engineering processes while keeping you enthralled with a great story.  Highly recommended!

0691152640|1.0|\\"This time is different\\" is based on shoddy research. Google the Reinhart-Rogoff study and you will find dozens of articles chronicling the fact that when they finally released their data in April 2013 there were serious errors. Attempts to replicate the study which were not possible before the data was released revealed that it could not be replicated because the data was used selectively, some data was omitted, and there was a significant error on a critical Excel spreadsheet. Reinhart-Rogoff have admitted the error in the Excel sheet but despite a number of economists arguing that the released data actually disproves the idea of any \\"threshold\\" in the GDP-debt ratio, but have stood by their results. Apparently math is not a criteria for their version of economic research.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book!  It draws you in from the beginning and keeps you interested. Great character descriptions and development.
1455527475|4.0|Some reviewers have commented on the fact that this book does not provide any smoking guns or grand revelations - which is true - however I found it to be a smart and honest depiction of a day to day worker, chasing his dream and finding success only to become disgusted on how the business erodes his integrity. Anyone who has ever worked for a large corporation will identify with the hypocrisy of values and ethics preached to the grunt workers, while the top office makes decisions based solely on profit.<br />The book does not try to explain the complexities of financial instruments, but Smith does enough explaining to tell his story. A few reviews have complained that Smith is writing to trumpet his own success, but really it's necessary to understand his positive experiences, so that we can appreciate the enormous decision he makes to leave.<br /><br />The book left me asking--was banking always corrupt, and he was just too young and naive to see it? Or is there something in our modern culture that has degraded standards and ethics, so that behavior once considered unacceptable and shameful is now tolerated for the sake of short-term profit?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever. Ever since I started playing I can't stop it is amazing check it out
B004BSFSTA|4.0|Marshall Majors are in a class of their own. I own 14 sets of Headphones/ear buds and place Marshall among the top three. What makes them unique is the way they reproduce that VOX amp sound of the 60's/70's so well. By that I mean they excel in mid-range and treble tones and are more subtle on the bass, which is exactly what the VOX sound was all about. Just to be clear the other two in my 'top 3' are more bassy and/or more even toned (muddy) which is fine for Jazz and Classical music.<br /><br />One item I see repeatedly regarding the Marshall Majors is their 'tight' feel. That is easily remedied by simply bending (gently) the head band to open it wider and put more distance between the ear cups. Mine were like a vice grip until I did that simple procedure and now they are 100% improved in comfort.<br /><br />Remember that headphone sound quality is in the ear of the beholder, and with the unique sound characteristics these offer consider them as an addition to your headphone/earbud collection, an addition that captures the crisp clean sound of the VOX guitar amps.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Get the combo pack. You'll be glad you did, as then you can watch it anywhere. Good price too. Portrays the play pretty well.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|I can see the draw of this app, but the interface feels a bit grade school.  I built a few bridges and I like how you can test to determine it's structural integrity, but you're on your own with respect to using all of the materials at your disposal in the correct configuration.  The hints that display when you attempt to build a new bridge are not too terribly helpful.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|The best of John Grisham I have read. A complicated plot and much is in the title!<br />Liked best because I didn`t see where the story was going while, really raced along. A pity that the ending seemed an anticlimax..
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great show! Storyline moves quickly with plenty of characters and action, keeps you interested and waiting for the next episode
B007SGM084|5.0|Without a doubt these three books have been the best I've read yet! They all are seriously hard to put down once you've started. It took me 5 days to read the three of them! The story is not only sexual but it is also very romantic. The love story behind everything is breathtaking! I definitely recommend this book to every woman that wants to dive into a full-on sensual world, Anastasia Steele and Cristian Grey is ALL you're going to think about for a long time!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I liked this game, but I'd like to have less hidden objects and more puzzles.<br />Overall it was a good game.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I don't know if you could make a museum piece using this app... bit it fun to play with and easy to use / figure out.  I really like the zoom feature and some of the different effects are interesting.  The only thing missing is a &quot;back &quot; button to erase a mistaken touch... and it could very well be there... I just haven't found it yet.<br /><br />Pro artist of too many years ;)

B00BNNJHXO|5.0|I put this album on play 10 days ago and have not listened to anything else since.  I probably repeat the entire album 3 times every day.  I guess I can see why other people say that this album is not as heavy as their other stuff.  But if you are a music fannatic, especially metal, then ask yourself this...How can music really get any heavier?  Maybe actual, literal murder on an album, but that would be illegal..because it's murder.  This djent crap that is popular now is what I have in mind when I think of how great this Soilwork album is.  Everything these days is a game of who's the fastest, who's the most technical, who's the most obscure and random.  What about who's the most listenable?  If you appreciate the flow of catchy and timeless guitar choreography, if you like drums that almost speak to you like they have an opinion about what's going on in the news, if you like lyrics that seem to use some type of subliminal messaging that makes you wake up in the middle of the night thinking&#34;  Man, what did he say on the song?  I don't know.  I have to know right now,&#34; then this will be a good album.  I've you're looking for a contender for those played out contests I mentioned about, then you will not find them here.  This album has nothing spectacular about it and that's the charm.  Everyone else is trying to be something and here is Soilwork, take it or leave it we don't give a s@#4 samwich.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Castle is an awesome series! Far different from all the other dramas on television. With an excellent cast and well written script, it's the best show on tv! Check it out!

B0084AZXKK|4.0|Never read this story before nor have I seen the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. The characters names were familiar as this is a true classic.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|One of the best sci fi films ever made! It continues from the tv series firefly. All the favorite characters are here in a feature length film. Full of action and surprises, you won't want to miss this one! 5 out of 5 One of my favorite films!

B00151HZ3S|5.0|I've collected most of the complete Rings out there, and though Solti's and Von Karajan's are most often held up as examples of Ring recording excellence, I must admit that, having received the Haitink Ring, it is far and away the best. It is totally  captivating, the conducting and orchestral playing astounding and enrapturing. So is the recording engineering. The singers are at their prime in this recording, and to be honest I didn't think I could possibly be so swayed, but I am. Haitink has created a total, all-encompassing world in which the listener is thrillingly immersed. This recording is absolutely a MUST for any Wagner fan, or for anyone who wants to experience a unified and perfect musical and dramatic world.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great game for what  I paid.....loved the plot and not long or dragged out ....can't wait for the next game.....keep them coming!

B009LGO88E|5.0|Easy to use and works just fine with the American version of the 3DS XL. Totally worth it for certain games.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Excellect movie at a good price. I really enjoy it and it is nice to be able to watch it when I want without commercials.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Good acting, unfortunately only two seasons due to failure of vision at Fox. Again. The only serious critique I have is of how the character John Connor is written; he's kind of a lame whiner for &#34;the leader of the resistance.&#34; The acting is fine; it's the characterization that's off, and for that I don't blame the actors. Still, this is a fairly minor quibble about an otherwise excellent show.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Has become a go-to when there's nothing to do!  Great ideas!!!! Would recomment this app to all of my friends and enemies!!!  :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|Inventive plot twists and turns. A surprise a minute. When you finish you're not sure who's the villain. Ending suggests a sequel. Spirited book club discussion: marriage. Phew! Won't win a Pulitzer but will keep you turning pages.

I've tried moving my alarm clock across the room, and even varying the noise it makes to keep myself from going back to sleep. However, doing a math problem in order to stop the sound has really helped me be more alert in the morning and get started with my day more efficiently. Thanks Xtreme peeps.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Love this series. If you like the HOB series, you will love the books as they provide much more detail. Can't stop reading!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This book is laugh out loud funny.  Considering that the main themes of the book are the end of the world and the battle between good and evil and that the authors take these themes seriously that's no mean feat. The story follows the actions of demons and angels, witches and their persecutors and of course the antichrist himself. There is an unexpected depth to even the silliest characters in this tale and a belief in the potential for goodness without sugar coating the potential for evil.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|It seems they tried blending genres, action with a more laid back genre and the two just didn't mesh well for me at all. The film would have turned out to be so much better if they kept it solely as an action film.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Saw these movies with an old flame a few years back, and purchased them on my own so I can enjoy them too! Highly recommend to anyone. Very interesting, especially if WWII is your thing.
B00C32TPZE|5.0|I absolutely love it and what a birthday present to have it come out on my birthday.  Picks up where Heaven and Hell left off.
0307951529|4.0|I would suggest that this is a good gift for high school graduates. The book covers what our school system used to cover in home economics.<br /><br />The text also provides compelling evidence that American ingenuity and hard work still can create awesome start ups without having to be prodigy or even going to college. With the price of college and universities rising this book might inspire some to forgo college and invest their efforts on starting a small enterprise.<br /><br />Worth the paper it is printed on, get it for high school graduates!

B007L4HFDI|1.0|The UV digital copy stinks. You are forced to open a sony account and watch the digital copy using a Sony viewer. This is a terrible idea for you cannot watch your digital copy in iTunes or the viewer of your choice. I have other UV digital movies as well that I have had to open a Flixster account for. Now I have multiple UV accounts that will be a pain to manage.<br /><br />The movie studios are screwing us with this UV concept by forcing you to view in multiple different places and it's a bad move.

B008QYT7DI|2.0|The Little Prince is a must read book for children and adults. I loved it as a girl, and recently felt like reading it again for myself and to my kids. So, I got this Kindle edition. It was disappointing, actually. Not the book itself. The book by de Saint-Exupery is still priceless. The Kindle version... not so much.<br /><br />First: It can't be transferred to Kindle-Touch device (I guess, because of the colored pictures). If it is only meant to work on certain devices, but not all, it should say so.<br /><br />Second: I read it on a tablet device. The size of a screen is about the same as Kindle, if not bigger. However, the font was really small, hard to read, and could not be adjusted! Adult can still read it with some struggle. But if you mean to buy it for a child, get a magnifying glass too.<br /><br />Third: The Highlight function is disabled for this book. One of the best features of Kindle books, that allows readers to highlight the memorable places - disabled! in a book that has so many philosophical points.<br /><br />Get this book in print and enjoy it the way it is supposed to be enjoyed!
B00B22IJXK|3.0|I thought this was like what the images showed. But turns out its not. You can't add what the picture has so what's the point of downloading this app?
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good read. Very surprising and suspenseful. The characters were well formed I hope the ending is unpredictable. Can't wait to finish
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was definitely something that kept me drawn in, and the perfect story to keep me focused on content while doing my treadmill workout.  I found myself wanting to extend the time walking just so I could read 'just a little bit longer.' I did, however, find a few parts a bit choppy -- but not glaringly enough to make me put the book down. I've been on a reading binge for the last couple of days, and this story was meatier than the last couple eBooks I've read. Thanks for a great distraction!

I would HATE to be married to someone like that. Paul Rudd and his two girls in the movie are pretty darn funny if you can ignore the Mom. But I will say that after watching this, you'll NEVER want to get married! Ha! (And this is a woman's opinion!!)

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The game is slow and repetative on top of all that a person has to purchase all the game content. I would rather purchase a game for $20 than have to continue playing this game. For a game that should be semi educational this one is not.  For a game that is listed to be free it is not seriously misleading.

B00432QAKK|5.0|There are two versions of this TV series, one is about $35 and the other is about $60 and both are on DVD not Bluray.  The $40 one comes with two spindles half the discs on one and the other half on the other side all stacked together, so theirs no protection on the discs and they are free to spin on one another.  The $60 one is the one I preferred because the discs are all individually stacked with space in the middle so that they are not free to spin on one another providing protection.  I recommend the $60 one before they stop production on these because of less packaging on the $35 one. Every one is trying to save a buck.

0307949486|4.0|This book started off so slow it literally took me 3 weeks or more to get past the first 100 pages... I was simply totally uninterested. However once the plot starts picking up and the mystery starts, I finished the other 400 some pages in a day. Very terrifically executed. All the holes are filled in and I don't feel like their were too many plot holes, and much of the stuff that seems irrelevant turns up to be important in the other books.<br /><br />That's right I read the other books in about a week. Both the Girl ...Fire & the Girl...Nest. But there's 1 problem there's also a lot of stuff thats not important. I feel like the authour had to write a damn 3 page auto biography of every new character that was introduce. NOT every character NEEDS a backstory! And this is simply something that becomes worse throughout the books. Nevertheless I wouldn't say they are bad books, but you must steel your self to read through all the fluff, and the author really likes to drag out the ending to the very end for a rather lackluster ending. Well that's unfair, the endings are certainly good, and some of the parts of ALL 3 books will have you on the edge of your seat, but when it comes down to it, the reason it seems dull, is because the author simply confuses tension for dragging out the plot. So by the time the big reveal is actually revealed you already know almost everything that's about to happen.<br /><br />This is the worst in the 2nd & 3rd book. Honestly IMO the 2nd & 3rd book could have been 1 book and it would have been excellent. The plot would have advanced a lot faster. And there wouldn't be so much drag or needless fluff about Blomkvists: Escapades of a Journalistic Gigaloo. Which could pretty much be a whole book by itself.<br /><br />The books were good, but I though they would have better potential and better sales if the author would simply get to the point. By the 2nd & 3rd books we go from following 1-2 characters, namely Blomkvists & Salander to following 10 - 20 characters, all with their own life story, plot elements, love stories. It's just too much to keep up with and drags down the plot.<br /><br />Nevertheless I'm not here to judge the other 2 books, I'm here to judge the first one and I give it a 4/5. Could be better, but half way in it gets good and is worth, assuming you learn to deal with the infuriatingly detailed writing style.<br /><br />PS: Also all the graphic scenes, I don't think added or took away. I didn't really care either way as long as they tied into the plot and made it better...10 - 20 characters, all with their own life story, plot elements, love stories.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Having seen the first movie I felt I should read the books. I am glad I did they are a good and quick read and kept me interested from beginning to the end. I didn't enjoy the writing style which felt choppy to me and the ending left me wanting more, but other then that generally a good read. I would say if you like the first movie and enjoy a little more detail this series would be good for you.

B0065GC0BA|3.0|**This review contains spoilers<br />Me Before You tackles a very serious issue in a light, breezy chick-lit kind of way, but without denying the gravity of Will's situation as a quadriplegic. I take my hat off to the author for addressing the subject of euthanasia and for not bowing to the pressure for a happy ending. Even though I knew how it was going to end I found myself hoping it would somehow all work out, but I'm glad she showed how important it is for people to have choices. One of the messages of the book is that even if you don't agree with other people's choices it's important to respect what they want. No one can dictate how another person should feel when faced with a catastrophic injury or terminal illness and in these situations I for one would like to have the option of voluntary euthanasia available, regardless of whether I use it.<br /><br />I've read some of the other reviews about how negative this book seems to be towards quadriplegics, implying that they have no quality of life and would be better off dead. I didn't get this from it but I do see where they are coming from. If someone like Will can't handle this kind of life with all his wealth and privilege, then how is an average Joe expected to cope? It is frequently suggested that because Will led such an active and exciting life before his accident that it is extra hard for him to adapt to limited existence and this is a valid point, but I think the book would have benefited from a bit more balance. Louisa does have contact with some quadriplegics through a website who have come to terms with the disability and live fulfilling lives. If she had wanted to show Will that it's possible to go forward and find a different kind of happiness it seems to me she would have taken him to visit these people so he could see for himself. At least one character should have been introduced to counterbalance Will's perspective as disembodied voices on a chatline just didn't do it.<br /><br />As I mentionedabove this book is light-weight, even with its subject matter and sad ending. If it's complex characters and deep insights into being a carer or living with permanent disability that you're after then it's probably not for you. Some of the events strained credibility - Louisa and Will falling onto the floor several times when she tries to help him into bed while drunk, for instance and the way what we can only assume was a gang rape is glossed over is quite disturbing. For what it is it's an easy, breezy read that will appeal to lovers of chick-lit.

0451205766|5.0|The Godfather story is insurmountable, it is beyond a classic, it is unashamedly ignorant of cultural, geographical or age boundaries - it resonates with all of us and has so ever since it first appeared in print in Mario Puzo`s epic novel in 1969.<br /><br />Nino Rota`s world famous main theme song is etched in the depth of my memory from my childhood days when the music filled my grandparents' house in Iran. My grandfather loved the movie and music and from that tender memory, the Godfather has held a special place in my heart all my life. I knew the music many years before I watched the movie first, and that came a decade or so before I read the novel.<br /><br />Now, and only now, after reading the novel do I understand why he loved this story so much and why he repeatedly watched and listened to the music. Now I feel closer to my grandfather and marvel at his taste in what I find to be a remarkable story. How I wish he could be here today to tell me his thoughts on the Godfather, now that I can appreciate it. We may express the gratitude we feel toward our families while we have the chance, but why is it that the true understanding of that gratitude often greets us bitterly late in life?<br /><br />The ingenuous story and remarkable characters aside, the writing of Mario Puzo is of highest quality. Puzo's novel speaks to every reader from every walk of life, and evidently through different generations. It runs through themes understood by all humans: family and brotherhood,  sacrifice and justice, trust and betrayal,  revenge and retribution, business and friendship - friendship that the Godfather held so tenderly and seriously, friendship that he offered openly and generously, friendship in the name of which he offered favors and collected them in due time.  In the core of this magnificent story is Mario Puzo's writing. On the surface, it mostly appears to be a crime novel with grotesque scenes and unhappy outcomes but it is only the surface. The writing is solid, authentic, lustful and obsessive through and through - it takes your imagination into the scene, it places you inside the situation with the character and it demands that you fully partake in the intensity of every moment.  The story endures and the writing of this remarkable author is the solid foundation of support which upholds it.<br /><br />\\"Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Court Number 3 and waited for justice....\\" And so we enter the under world of Italian immigrants in New York city. We encounter characters we can never forget. The depiction of these unforgettable characters - Luca Brasi, Tom Hagen, Sonny Corleone, Kay Adams, Johnny Fontaine - while secondary to our main characters, paints a permanent picture before our eyes in the hands of Mario Puzo's masterful prose. Through these characters, we get to know our heroes, Don Vito Corleone as the head of the Corleone family and business, and the mastermind of the ingenious mafia world, and Michael Corleone, the Don's favorite son, who refuses to follow in his father's footsteps, joins the army and keeps a distance from the family, until one day in the deep countryside of Sicily, he meets his ultimate fate. Perhaps, in its essence, in its very core, the Godfather is a story about father and son and their undeniable bond, which can be weakened but not broken, in the company of family loyalty and devotion reciprocating that of the Corleone family.<br /><br />\\"I will reason with him.\\" - Don Corleone's famous motto, a phrase that, when used, immediately translated to Tom Hagen, his consigliere, that the Godfather will not be persuaded otherwise, and that it would be in the best interest of the opposing party to acquiesce to Godfather's terms because no matter what terms presented to them at this time, if they should fail to agree, it would most certainly be subject to harsher circumstances.<br /><br />Some of the sub-plots running through the Godfather, non-central to the overall theme and missing from the movie, still make up my most cherished parts of this genius story. The indelible, lustful, raw passion which Lucy Mancini and Sonny enjoy for a short while is on top of that list. Even the sweet brief romance of Michael Corleone and his first wife, the Italian bella Apollonia, deliciously described as it was, pales in comparison to the passages imparting the details of Sonny's wild affair with Lucy. Mario Puzo proves no less a gifted author in his creation of the erotic love scenes between the impassioned lovers. The love making is predatory as Lucy and Sonny devour one another with voracious appetite. When Sonny dies, Lucy's whole physical being aches for him, a loss and a wound that Sonny's wife is far from experiencing. With the move to Vegas, thanks to Hagan's arrangements to take care of \\"extended\\" relations of Sonny, Lucy embarks on a new life and adventures, including the nature of her relationship with Jules. Large or small, Puzo takes the time to first develop his characters fully - even if in isolation of others - and then to carefully weave each into the central plot. There is a reason and time for each character to play their part, pay their dues, return a favor, or bestow an act of friendship to the Godfather. The Don, the mastermind of Mario Puzo's creation, is the only one who knows well in advance of others - and that includes the reader - how and when each chosen one will be called to action.<br /><br />The Godfather is a masterpiece and a classic, and a story that once read and consumed, leaves its readers and viewers changed permanently.ovie, still make up my most cherished parts of this genius story.

B008JEJPSC|4.0|This review is for the widescreen Blu-ray version of Annie starring Albert Finney.<br /><br />I saw this movie back in June of 1982.  It was made to be viewed in a theater.  On a TV screen, it tends to look a bit overcrowded.  I can't recall ever seeing a more active musical with literally a cast of thousands.  And with the startling use of depth of field, you have way too much to look at in some of the more expansive sequences.  The two stars (Finney & Quinn) are practically lost in the opulent circus/party scene with all the lights, a b-zillion people, a fountain, acrobats, fireworks, and an elephant!  There is such a thing as too much.  As for the music, a lot of my favorite songs were cut and replaced by lesser efforts.  I've always thought the casting of Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan was a bit strange.  Albert Finney (Warbucks) was loud, Ann Reinking (Grace Farrell) perfect, Edward Herrmann dead on as Franklin D. Roosevelt.  And then there's the redoubtable Geoffrey Holder as Punjab, also perfect.  The biggest surprise for me was finding out that Shawnee Smith (The Blob, Becker, and Saw) was one of the orphans!  As musicals go, this one is a sentimental favorite.  Supposedly, there is a remake in the works.

B000X12QQ2|5.0|The most under-rated band to come out of the British Invasion went out with a big bang with this album. It's right up there with Sgt. Pepper and Pet Sounds. I like the simpleness of the songs which is complemented by the absence of \\"big production\\" sound treatment.<br />It could be that the other CD version had better re-mastering so probably sounds better but even if this is the case, this one has extra songs that sound almost as good and that's a no-brainer to me-two albums for the price of one.

B00C1BU7V8|2.0|When I saw the commercial for this movie I was excited. The Civil War has always been something I was interested in so I thought this movie would be right up my alley but there were things that ruined it for me. There was language that was uncalled for and out of place to begin with. I don't mean to imply that I think people did not swear at that time but it added nothing to the movie, also I think the writers put there own spin on it and so did the actors. From the speeches that Abraham Lincoln wrote and the things he said shows someone who had a firm belief in and respect for God. I think this movie would have been better and more family friendly if they would have stuck to the truth. They took God out of most of the movie and put what they thought would be more of a draw to the over 21 crowd and it turned what could have been a wonderful movie into one I will not be seeing again. Sincerely, Kaysie.S

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have viewed the entire series (through season three) more than twice and LOVED every minute of them.  Season two more than fulfilled my expectations after Season one's stunning story line began.  With all the characters intertwining the plot lines I enjoyed each different nuance.  From one minute to the next there were few clues to where it would lead.  If I guessed one thing it was surpassed with unexpected pleasure in an entirely new and delightful direction.  I cannot describe specific plot lines to avoid giving away any pleasures for new followers but if there is anything to expect from this program it is that you will love the characters, you will learn all there is to know about each and you will even find you have a huge desire to get to know the real life names of each cast member. I put my highest recommendation on Masterpiece: Downton Abbey Original UK Version Season 2 because it is complete with all the intended use of historical reference while promoting an entirely enjoyable foray into a delightfully presented 'soap' of extreme entertainment excelled by no other television nor movie. Epic in scope covering early 20th century England story lines of aristocracy and servitude from respective lives showing honor, love, respect, dedication,  duty no matter what station of life and human beings with all their foibles and daily striving for happiness and the all too human dictates.

B0097AQEOK|5.0|Cost effective (I paid $35 including shipping) for the 10 albums included in the set. I hadn't owned any of Joni's albums prior to a couple months ago (only had a few tracks on compilations). I scored Hejira, Miles of Aisles, Blue, and Shadows and Light, 2 of which are LIVE, (In my limited observation Joni's at her best live). Those acquisitions prompted me to search this set out and become familiar with one of my generation's truly great artists' most significant work.<br /><br />The Studio Albums indeed come in a compact box that fits all 10 discs happily in a small footprint fitting nicely in our standard cd storage systems, taking up about the width of (4) jewel cases.<br /><br />The discs don't contain additional tracks, sonic upgrades, or written annotations. The discs are stored in decent cardboard 2-panel sleeves with nicely reproduced album art including lyrics (although the print is microscopic). There's even a few additional lyric sheets.<br /><br />The physical cd's are newly mfg., and are lighter and a bit more flimsy than the few standard cd's I acquired as stated above. About half have the gold colored Reprise label, but with black printing and no additional colors on the logo. The Hejira cd is misspelled on my disc (it's Hejire). Sonically, they're fine. Not jaw-dropping and no WOW-factor, but they sound excellent to me.<br /><br />This set is exactly what I was searching for. Instead of paying $3+tax for a used vinyl album with surface noise, name written or plastic-labeled on the cover along with the obligatory dog-earred corners, I was able to score a brand-new noise-free cd.<br /><br />I've played Song To A Seagull, Clouds, and Hejira while reading and composing this review, and I'm definitely glad I invested in this set.<br /><br />All the best,<br />GT<br /><br />May 15, 2015<br />EDIT: Since originally posting this review, I acquired most all of Joni's catalog on cd, including the original releases of Blue, Hejira, & Court & Spark. The sonics on the boxset discs are inferior to the std and HDCD-encoded releases. It also appears the company utilized cheap cd-r's dubbed using less than the best source available.ppears the company utilized cheap cd-r's dubbed using less than the best source available.

Sit down with your family and a small box of your favorite candy and prepare for a great time!

B0000C83KH|3.0|Ok, I am an avid collector of high resolution music and when I saw Iron Maiden on amazon I went for it immediately. I have to say that I am thoroughly unimpressed with this release as far as sound goes. There is absolutely no crispness to the sound, the highs sound as if they were cut via some noise reduction, the vocals a buried and the bass is muddy. There isn't much in sound going on here and certainly not worth anything over 10.00. In addition, the frequency sampling rate is only 88.2. I didn't think that DVD Audio was anything under 96khz. The 5.1 surround sound of this release isn't great but also not the worse I have heard.<br /><br />Overall a disappointment. More so because I really like Iron Maiden and this particular release. I rated this release three stars because the music is good but the sound lacks in a big way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend.  I read it in three sittings, and as soon as I finished, I started on the second book in the series.  I loved Katniss!  She was a tough girl who fought her way through every dismal situation, which is rare in young adult books today.  I liked the dynamic between Katniss and Peeta.  I also liked the development of the secondary characters.  The plot was inventive and unconventional.  This is a book I will read again.  WONDERFUL piece of writing!

B006LSZECO|5.0|I paid almost $13 for the Kindle version, which I rarely do.  However, there was a lot of hype surrounding this book, and I had a friend to recommend it to me.  I wasn't disappointed.  The characters were well developed, and the plot kept me guessing to the very end.  The ending was a jaw dropper, as in \\"I can't believe that just happened!\\"  This was one of those books I read very quickly because I just had to keep reading to see what would happen next.  Buy it!

B0089EHWQE|4.0|My wife ordered this book from Amazon.  She read it for her book group, and here is what she told me:<br />&#34; Everyone in my group (both male and female) had lots to say about it, and they were all glad to have read it.  It's a touching story about a young woman hired as an emotional caregiver to a desperately depressed and angry quadriplegic.  She tries heroically to help him realize something to live for, and in the process, receives something precious from him.  The patient becomes the catalyst for the caregiver's change.  The book is full of material worthy of discussion; assisted suicide,the social class system, family dynamics, self-determination, societal attitudes toward the disabled, love and compassion - there is much here to think about.  It's a well constructed novel, and the characters become personal.  Lou and her family, Will and his family, Lou's OCD boyfriend all become real.  As I read along I could practically hear the music swell and see the credits rolling.  And sure enough, I've heard that it's been picked up by MGM&#34;

1400069807|4.0|If you're looking for a book about Salt, Sugar, and Fat, and about how the Processed Food Giants got everyone hooked on their cheap foods using these ingredients, this book will not disappoint. It is wonderfully written, marvelously entertaining, well-researched, and a very good book. There are a few minor flaws others have pointed out, but I would like to briefly mention some flaws any readers should keep in mind.<br /><br />This book talks about sugar, but does not spend a lot of time talking about the chemical properties of different types of sugar, or the health risks of sugar substitutes, or even the difference between eating sugary fruit or a sugary processed food. It talks about fat, but does not spend much time talking about the differences between artificially hydrogenated trans-fats and naturally occurring fats. Even worse, it repeats the false idea that artificially created unsaturated fats (vegetable oils, corn oil, canola oil) are better for you than naturally occurring saturated fats (red meat, butter, coconut oil). This is potentially dangerous misinformation. Likewise it should have been mentioned that drugs to lower cholesterol have no beneficial effect on heart disease, that cholesterol and high blood pressure are NOT diseases, but rather risk factors.<br /><br />I also take have serious issues with the overall treatment of the subjects of fat and salt. While ANYTHING can be hazardous to your health in too large an amount, the diet of Westerners is so high in carbohydrate/starch that the HEALTHY fats in food (along with fiber) are the only thing that somewhat balances the equation. The author ignores the fact that we need fat to live (a cholesterol or fat deficiency can cause a whole slew of brain damaging diseases and will almost certainly lead to heart disease, diabetes, and chronic inflammation). Thankfully the author DOES mention two of the people he interviewed who are quite healthy, one eating tons of old-fashioned cheese, the other tons of olive oil (pure olive oil has ENORMOUS health benefits). But if you read this book knowing nothing about the subject, you might jump to the conclusion that ALL fats are bad, and especially all saturated fats, which simply is not true.<br /><br />In the salt section the author does mention the fact that salt is necessary to keep alive several times, but gives the overall impression that salt is dangerous. Again, he fortunately mentions that it is relatively easy to recalibrate your desire to eat salt, and cutting down by a modest percentage in your salt intake will undo the damage (as opposed to refined sugar which is pure poison).<br /><br />I admire this book for what it's trying to do and it's overall message is sound (for the most part). You just need to see the balanced picture and not rely on this book to tell you the whole story. For instance the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) has been characterized elsewhere as a radical group of vegetarian extremists pushing their agenda with little benefit (people like them got movie theaters and fast food chains to switch from healthy beef tallow and coconut oils to vegetable oils that cause heart disease and cancer). And while the reporting in the book is sound, the author is no doctor or nutrition expert, else he would have pointed out that your body does not metabolize fats and carbohydrates in the same manner. If you reduce calories but not carbohydrate percentage, your body still stores the excess as fat, while unused fat and protein end up getting flushed from your body (which in excess can be hazardous to your health, but has the benefit of making you lose weight, increasing your HDL, and lowering your LDL and triglycerides, and making your blood sugar drop like a rock [as long as it's healthy fat and protein not man-made junk]).<br /><br />Other than the points mentioned, this is a most excellent book. It explains in great detail the history of processed food from product research and development,marketing, retail, and manufacturing points of view. You'll grow to appreciate the miracles of engineering in food to make gazillions of sugar and salt types for different needs, the epic battles between corporations for a share of consumer spending, and the moral fights within individuals who create products as they struggle to survive and keep people employed without destroying the health of millions. When you are done with this book you will come to understand that much of the world's ills are the result not just of very large trends (people being paid less have to work more and therefore have to have food that is more convenient and cheaper) and basic psychology (humans were designed to want to eat fat and sugar because in nature that is where all the nutrients are located), but also simple self interest. Good meaning individuals in corporations tried to enact reforms, only to have the government stand in the way, the public fail to make dietary changes, and shareholders cry bloody murder as their stock value slips as the result of a company acting responsibly for a change. Good meaning individuals in government tried to enact reform and were stopped by corporations. And individuals outside of both find themselves facing both government AND corporate opposition.<br /><br />In the end, I DO recommend this book to get a better understanding of the business of processed food, and the role that fat, salt, and sugar play. But to get the complete BALANCED picture, I recommend watching Sugar:The Bitter Truth on YouTube, Food Inc, Fat Sick and Nearly Dead, (and perhaps most importantly to balance your view and see that a high fat diet can indeed be very healthy) Fat Head, and reading Fast Food Nation. Then you will have a somewhat complete picture of the entire problem and be ready to make the serious lifestyle decisions that lie ahead.marketing, retail, and manufacturing points of view.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great read funny and up beat, Mira Lyn Kelly did a great job at writing this book, looking for some more from Mira Lyn Kelly
B004SBS8LA|5.0|First I'm going to say what I think about the app. It's awesome. When you think about it, it's basically the same thing but you hit different stuff. I think it was cool how they do Angry Birds with a theme a bout a 3D movie that was coming out at the same time.<br /><br />As for haters, I can't say anything about the crashes but this: Sending e mails will get you NOWHERE. Again I say, nowhere. Companies never pay attention to their support mail. If you want to solve anything, call them and make sure they listen. And people say it's not ad free. It is! There's a difference between ads and updates Rovio cares enough to tell you about. Like, their biggest sale ever. Or, an update on one of their apps. Ads are annoying rectangular blocks that crash computers.(and videos you're forced to watch.) People say it's basically the same levels over and over, but it's not. Because from my view, I see over 5 packs of levels all with different backgrounds, 4 new powerups, and like 10 bonus levels. Not to mention the hidden fruit you hit to unlock those levels. And it's not just \\"freeing birds\\", you also get to kill monkeys(which is funny).<br /><br />I hope everyone has listened.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|You will fall in love with this book, I could not put it down and it left me thinking about this book for weeks
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This app has all the options you need.  It has all the features you need to make the play as difficult or easy as you want.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|at time it would freeze and the only way to fix the problem was to remove it from and the kindle and than reload back.<br />this caused you to have start the whole game again and lose all levels played
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is a joke at best. 95% of the time when I run it on my Motorola Electrify, it freezes and force closes. It's constantly screen freezing. It is not my phone either as I have done a reset and complete reboot. Ever since the past few updates, this has gotten progressively worse. Do yourself a favor and use an alternative. And the &#34;one click install&#34; ads right in your feed are ridiculous too. Because one couldn't accidentally push it? Especially when the screen lags quite a bit and responds 10 seconds after you push something?
B00005JLCI|3.0|I HAVE NEVER LIKE SHAKESPEARE. NOW I KNOW WHY. IT'S A MOVE THAT MAKES YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP REAL EARLY.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong is a stress reliever for me, I normally play when I get home and before going to bed.  It also helps with memory skills.  Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B22IJXK|4.0|this app is pretty cool I would recomend batting it if you like to make things look cool or like drawing things I enjoy it although I don't have any pictures since the kindle doesn't have a camera its still fun but if you do have lifts I thinking it would be a little funner but if u dnt u can just draw something and makenit look cool.
0316224588|5.0|Ian Rankin continues to write some of the best crime fiction in the world.  This book is no exception and should please everyone familiar with Rankin's work and with Inspector Rebus.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|I could not bring myself to suspend my disbelief..... and I didn't buy this book to read like the funnies. Scalzi has penned some excellent works; this is not one of them. Sorry John, I have great respect for your abilities, and have really enjoyed your other books, but this one just drips too much clever dialog. And I don't like satire.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Get the CD from the artist everyone is talking about: Rodriguez.  He was overlooked in the 70's when this album was released, but he's white hot now.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is fantastic - I always look forward to the next season.  There are always interesting plot twists, beautiful scenery and costumes, and great acting.  What more could you ask for!
B00BESM14U|5.0|this movie was surprising good-well done for both young teens an adults who remember. Only issue is the ending-it's predictable.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Does exactly what it says it will do. Opens up to FB and allows me to navigate easily.  Nice to put on favorites and find quickly.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|A good app. Basically the paid version. It does have a lot of glitches and occasionally doesn't open for me. But worth getting.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|I have an HP printer, and it worked great to find my printer and print my PDF docs, but did not recognize my Word docs. I need something for both so this app did me little good. I have uninstalled it.
B001R4MEYI|4.0|I have always had a curious wonderment about this band.But as i got the album The Hunter and seen them in concert, I realized these guys are a progressive metal band.In articals that Hinds,Kelliher and crew done after the album came out,its clear they all take a crack at contributing to each song and bring it all together in studio.Not an easy feat.This is a great metal album,even if you really cant pigeon hole these guys!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is so good! The characters are so proper! The attention to the details of the time is fascinating!
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I am not a huge Clutch fan.Have saw them do only 4 songs live.I cant wit till ROTR this year to see the whole set.Earth Rocker is a very good album front to back,possibly better than Robot Hive Exodus.If you like clutch, your really gonna love this.And it does rock from front to back.No real soft spots!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|It is a match 3 game with a little twist where you have to build a village. I am just hooked. Every chance I get I pick up the tablet and turn it on! Love It!!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Nice thing about KISS is that they know there sound and when they do an album,you know the product your getting.This is a classic KISS album and if you like KISS you will like this album.Not as good as &#34;Pyscho circus&#34;.but still a rocker.
B00ABMZRVO|5.0|Stunning in it's candor, captivating in it's authenticity! A brilliant portrayal of how love can be liberating, frustratingly sweet and mostly empowering.
B000001EL7|4.0|was a great album.Had great rock anthems and party songs on it.Gotta recomend it as a fan.The rocker &#34;I stole your love&#34; and Aces' &#34;Shock me&#34;,great songs.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|What a great read. Enjoyed every page of it The description of the desert & the different lives of the people .It teaches a lesson to all who always want more than what they have already.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I live the product very much w/the exception that the music for bedtime &#34;Snooze&#34; is too lively... I would have thought that the selections from which one chooses would be more subdued... quiet music... also wish there was another &#34;white&#34; pick, rather than just &#34;rain.&#34;
0062101897|5.0|This book is worth every penny! It has so much information and so many new pictures. I gabber loved every moment of reading this book!
B003QS9WIE|5.0|i loved the movie... but to rate the product i would say... i wish they had a way to turn on the subtitles. I am sure a lot of international audience would enjoy this movie.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|I loved this when I watched it on HBO and now I love it even more by just hanging in my DVD shelf. It has the full concert plus some interesting extra content like interviews and backstage scenes. If you're into JT don't think it much and click add to cart and take this one home! And even if you're not too keen, if you're reading this... There must be a reason, get on the JT wagon and let's ride!
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this book along time ago before watching the movie. I love the theory behind it.  It really makes you stop and think, what if.
B000069HK2|5.0|Came in, in such a perfect physical state. This album is great, you'll get probably the most raw sound from the band! Every song meets perfect, I promise you won't regret if you buy it... Remember to support your favorite bands like this one by purchasing their merch :)!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|disappointed as love Nicholas Sparks books.  this one was slow, metered, and one you can guess each step of the way.
1582432678|5.0|This book will make you question any desire you ever had about becoming a mother. It's amazing the deep-in thoughts that are described in it, all of us have probably think of them to one point and it seems like a painful journey to realize it's happening to you. Sure, there are some complex 'big words' here and there, but to me that's simply an insight of the type of person Eva is. Bet you know someone right now who's like that, too.<br /><br />Anyways, to not spoil the story much, I'd really advice for anyone to read the book first and then to watch the movie because they both flattered each other and work so well. The movie stays true, gives you faces; it's such an amazing flick. The story-telling gets to you and everything falls right into place when you've read the book before hand. I found about the movie prior to the book and I loved it; however it made a whole lot more sense and it felt well rounded when I watched it again after reading the novel. Probably one of my favorite books as of now.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I got this games for my son and it really keeps him occupied if I have to go somewhere. He is autistic and it is hard for him to be out in public places so this game really comes in handy.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|No problem at all with these stickers. Made a great difference to my daughters bedroom makeover. Bought with the Disney Fairies and the Glitter Castle both which I would also recommend.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|A quick way to get weather locally and nationally. I really like having this app on my phone and readily available.
B007SGM084|5.0|This series is not for everyone, however, I enjoyed it.  Try to make up your mind for yourself versus all the reviews that bash it.  Women deserve a little romance and enjoyment in their lifes as well.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I got this games for my son and it really keeps him occupied if I have to go somewhere. He is autistic and it is hard for him to be out in public places so this game really comes in handy.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|its almost midnight where I am and ive been editing pictures of me and my boyfriend for half an hour! this app is my late night addiction!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|one of the best movie ive seen in a long time...Jennifer Lawrence was absoluteness amazing in her role.  Would recomend to anyone wanting to see a great movie
B007EECSFA|5.0|This story kept me turning the pages. A wonderfully written mystery, and I couldn't imagine a better ending. Very well done!
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Just what I've expected. A incredible movie with all the extras that made it just perfect! The cover is beautiful =)
B006O2QNOU|3.0|This movie was about human greed at the corporate level. The average person wouldn't be able to understand what it was all about.
0545265355|5.0|The hardcover edition in this box set is just fantastic! The high quality of the books is just that: incredible!
B003U4UPTE|4.0|I think this is a pretty good series. The story line is quite different and keeps you wondering what is next.
B007H7XJD4|2.0|Please...I'd rather watch paint dry or grass growing. He was not a Spartan. Those were men and warriors. That is why it went to home movies quick.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|You just have to love her! What a heartwarming story this woman is...and what a spectacular voice. Just love anything and everything she sings - keep it up Ms Boyle!
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|Now this movie was another twist on apolcolyptic event. It is unlikely that people becomes vampires due the have to be created from a source vampire.
B000002PCS|5.0|I love this music and can never seem to get tired of it....even walked down the aisle to the Rachmaninoff music! So so beautiful.
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|Why do I have to write alot of words when the rating should be enough. Is it an advertisement or something?
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|The soothing sounds combined with the  concentration is a great relaxing medium.  I love it.<br />I give it 5 stars!<br /> It's also good for exercising the mind.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Took me 2 to 3 hours to complete. Once I started I couldn't stop playing until I finished. Fun game not to hard and not to easy. I'm thinking 99 cents would be a better price but you can tell the developer put a lot of time into the game. Good combo of puzzle and story
B000X5SPBI|5.0|But after finding it, I cant stop. The show keeps your attention and wanting more! The last episode of the year always leave you hanging and waiting till the next season to see what happens! The granny is enjoying every minute of the  series.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|It's a nice homage to the spaghetti western.  There's some adolescence, for lack of a better term, in Q's execution, but he's trying new things while still managing to stay within his wheelhouse..no small feat!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|This album is something completely different from every other they have produced, but it is still amazing! Fall Out Boy's sound has changed and evolved over the years and some people don't like that. FOB continues to amaze me with their music though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I hadn't seen any of the series as of early this year. My youngest daughter (14) likes playing zombie shooters for the XBox, with her sister, so, looking for something to do with her, I asked if she wanted to watch an episode with me. \\"Not enough zombies\\", was her basic reply. She had caught bits and pieces of a couple of shows. Having heard the positive reviews, and knowing a show couldn't constantly have swarms of zombies, like a game, I coaxed her to try the series from the beginning.<br /><br />After the 1st episode, we were both hooked. It became a nightly ritual, watching an episode, or two, or three! The clock, on school nights, often set the limit. The series is about people who find themselves in a post-zombie-infected world. Survival with the zombies and your own 'clan-members' becomes the goal. And it doesn't take a swarm for a favorite character to get bit and be gone. And that happens more than once! Just when all that starts to stabelize, they encounter another clan, another new society. Do they merge? Under who's rules?<br /><br />Must be watched from the beginning, in order, to fully appreciate it all. Well worth your time, zombie fan or not!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think my brothers are the most important part of this thing cause they almost beat it i will kiss them. But why would do that they almost beat it i will be a good girl and I am looking for someone to help me out
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I always enjoy Judi Dench and an English cast.  And there are a lot of life lessons in it for a person my age!
B000FA675C|4.0|I bought this book for a kindle I recieved as a birthday present. I read this when it was first released. I thoroughly enjoyed rereading it and do believe I got more the second time!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|A great story line that pulled me in again and again...<br /><br /> A must see for anyone who likes action and drama!!
0517543052|5.0|Open Your Mind, Step Outside The Box With Ram Dass & Explore Life In the Now - Great Book a Must Read!!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I had accidentally deleted this episode from my dvr and the rest of the series kept recording, but I couldn't watch it until I had watched this one.  We couldn't find it anywhere for free and finally bought it on Amazon.  It was fast and good quality.
0071766588|5.0|I think this book can help me a lot on my English. I love it. when i finish this book i think i will get a high scour
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think this is the best game ever its like u have to pass every level to get the elements of harmony and its good for little kids so they can learn about friendship and get them courageous about things
0071771263|5.0|I think this book can help me a lot on my English. I love it. when i finish this book i think i will get a high scour
B00005U122|5.0|I chose this rating because, I'm happy that I was able enough to order it.<br />I will definitely order from this seller again. They shipped promptly:, and very fast shipping method.<br />So as long as my father is happy with the item then that's all I really need to know about okay. And he sure is.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|A nice story, quick read, but one that hit the wall about 2/3 in.  The ending is not believable and I couldn't trust that Julia actually was distraught and spent two plus years pinning for William.  A shame, as this knocks the book down a peg or two for me.  Again, worth the read, but not an award winning effort.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|eddie vedder at his best i love the music he makes it is very mellow and just a great dvd
0345525558|5.0|I'm so glad that our bookclub picked this book.  This story is absolutely stunning, about a very troubled young woman who finds sustenance in flowers.  The characters in her life are all important to her path -- and, what INTERESTING characters they are!  Don't miss this read!
1250012570|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet: a really good book with a really good story line. A bit predictable at times, but definitely not at others. Definitely read it!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Season 3 of Downton Abbey is very good, but not great like seasons 1 & 2.  The departures of two main characters meant rather clumsily adding one new one while leaving open the impact of the other's absence.  The cliffhanger aspect works to keep interest piqued for the next round.<br /><br />The interjection of modern social issues was a bit ham-handed, leading some characters to behave in ways that seemed contrary to their established personae.<br /><br />Overall, though, good show.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't rest until I finished the book.  It was Written with excellence and the story line was superb.  Perfect ending.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This movie was actually my first experience with Les Mis except for the song 'Bring Him Home' in High School show choir. I was very impressed with how well done the movie and casting was put together and presented. The fact that they could find this many big-name actors that have decent singing voices is another credit to the producers/directors. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who likes a good musical.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|An excellent production.  It took awhile for Ramin's voice to warm up (not surprising for a live performance), but then he was sensational.  The concert that took place after the stage production was wonderful.  All the Phantoms were there singing together along with Sarah Brightman.  Don't miss this if you are a Phantom fan.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|It's great to have a good read. With loads of characters you can really either like or hate. Yep great you've gotta read books before I watch the series
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|Of course, the live show is so much more amazing, but this does a pretty good job of portraying what it is like to be at the live show.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|There were some parts I didn't care for, but overall a very good sci-fi movie. The movie relates well to the Hawking's warning of sending out messages informing possible aliens of our location within our galaxy. A cool movie !
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Difficult to understand when you play it. Complicated. Perhaps I'm not smart enough. But I have a rather difficult time making the horse do things.
B005WKH3A8|5.0|Very good movie, especially when you consider that a number of astronauts have claimed to have seen alien activity over and on the moon. If the footage is genuine, it has real implications for further lunar exploration.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Good product no problems with it scans new apps keeps my kindle running good would recommend to friends and family
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This is the best series I have ever seen and everyone I have referred it to is also hooked and every show is a page turner!
B0001ARCFA|2.0|I just purchased these AKG K 240 headphones through Amazon. The ones I got didn't say made in Austria. The box it came in said made in China. I thought maybe it was counterfeit goods until I visited the AKG website and found the same headphones and clicked to see that they provide no audio frequency bandwith or other technical specifications. Even my cheap $15 sony earbuds gives me this information. Am I to assume that these are your &#34;fool the public&#34; line of head phones? Please respond.
B002KGEORM|5.0|The greatest series I have ever watched and all my friends love it. The only bad thing is having to wait for season 6 to start!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A unique look at a man's mental illness and connections he attempts to make with his family and friends in the aftermath. I haven't seen the movie, but I am interested how they will make this movie work because of the internal dialogue. A great read!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|i dont personally play this but my bf has downloaded it on my kindle and he steals my kindle all the time to play it lol
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is probably the best game I have played in a long time. It's is a thinking game which requires logical critical thinking. The puzzles aren't too hard but can be challenging. I hope they put out more rooms.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|one of the best games love it so much i got the full version only thing is there should be bed for u to sleep on
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A very useful app, I highly recommend it for use with most any app. Easy to use and to understand.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of final fantasy games. this one did not dissapoint at all! I would like to see a version of the original final fantasy tactics on aneroid.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I did not order this app.  It came with the computer.  I find it very immature.  I have better things to do with my time than play dumb games.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Even though I'm a woman, I enjoyed it to the end.  There is a lot of killing in the movie but the plot is great!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it it is fun but it takes a little while to start.it is fun four all ages love it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Interesting book to read. it keeps you interested in the episodes of gunfare from the start to finish - not for the light hearted
B000SEGQNS|5.0|I haven't even finished this book yet and I have already picked up infinite words of wisdom!  It is well organized, systematic and easy to understand.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I have become a real fan of Jack London. He tells such a great story using language in such dramatic and descriptive ways. The Sea Wolf is a great example.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Read this book. Get rid of wheat. I am not a big bread eater, nor do I eat a lot of pasta- but read the labels, get wheat out of your kitchen and you will be surprised at how much better you feel. I felt different the third day- lost 7 pounds in 2 weeks and I only have about 15 more to lose so I am not obese- just thick in the middle. You owe it to yourself to read this book.
B008CRC506|5.0|I saw the pilot on you tube. Had to have it after that.  Kit McPhee is the best I have ever seen.  Love the show, Love the cast, Love the music Love the story line.  The Seans shot on the streets of New York WOW!
B0089LOKHG|2.0|This was a fairly good third book, until the end. There is no tying up with what happens with Alex and Julian, who she ends up with. What happens with Hana? I fell like she just rushed the end of the book. Like she got sick of writing. That's a huge let down after you've invested so much time into the characters and the books.
B000002WNP|5.0|This box set doesn't have the movie song, which I think is awsome. The movie songs kind of stink. He still has energy on most of the songs and I like how he does the song Memphis, Tennessee. I love the music when he just got out of the army. Definately a keeper of box sets.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It is always fun to enter a newly created world with an opportunity for new adventures and situations. This book provides an abundance of both. The characters were fun and likable or evil as required. Here is a place one would like to be allowed to explore on their own which such a novel allows one to do with secret delight.  Unfortunately, one suspects that this may be as far as the author's imagination may go despite the very fertile ground laid out by the first book -- think \\"Dune\\" and \\"Lord of the Flies\\".
0307750922|3.0|Another good book by Lee Child but, certainly not his best.  The plot seemed to drag on a bit and I didn't feel the same intensity that I felt with other Reacher novels, like Die Trying or Persuader.  The ending seemed unfinished and I was left feeling a bit unsatisfied.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book so my experience may have been different had I read it.  Dick Hill was the narrator and while he has a beautiful tone to his voice, I didn't connect with him as Jack Reacher.  He sounded older and sometimes he talked slowly, which made me a little impatient.<br /><br />Overall a decent book to add to the Reacher collection but if you're looking for your first Reacher novel, I would not start with this one.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|Fans of the first two books won't be disappointed in this one. If anything, it's better than the previous novel.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I don't know why I waited so long to watch Lost! Every episode will have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I LOVE this game!!! Keep creating games, Zeptolab! Om Nom is so cute/awesome. I started this game and I'm obsessed with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think everyone should have this app it is awesome. Everyone that I know has it and I honestly think everyone should have it.  :)
160059672X|5.0|love all  of sherry serafinis work and this book was no exception.  pictures was wonderful and instructive, instructions clear and consise and anyone who loves bling bling would love this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I had face book before and accidentally removed it from my kindle.  When I reloaded it ,  I liked the new version better.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I loved the movie and have seen it so many times that I thought I should read the book.  It wasn't exactly the same, but was close enough that I could really enjoy it.
B00BI745AA|2.0|I know this got spectacular reviews but I did not enjoy it myself. It's an amazing story. I don't think they needed to be so &#34;graphic&#34; about the seedy side of life. Just can't beat the original Broadway play.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|It took me a few episodes to adjust to Donna after having the phenomenal Martha Jones around. Once I got used to her though, I loved watching her challenge the Doctor. She's crazily rambunctious and it was a joy having her along for the ride.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to watch this great movie, but I'm so glad I did!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. I found it to be well-written with a nice twister at the end, and the conclusion of the book felt like a complete ending/closing, which I always like.
B008393Q2O|5.0|I really like this app so much.  It has really come in handy.  I have a big wedding coming up with lots of things to do everyday, and this app has really helped me so much.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This movie has a funny story line and is performed in an outstanding way by all central characters. It is a cute and funny comedy.
030758836X|3.0|Going through the tedious diary entries and finally getting into the plot took a while. When I got to the ending, I was shocked. What a dissappointment. Not very realistic -- the story or the ending. This is the first book I've read by this author. Don't think I'll be reading another.
B005CAAXXM|5.0|Finally a new band discovery that near surpasses all the bands I've loved over the years.  This album is highly recommended to anyone scurrying to find something new after their Opeth, Porcupine Tree, King Crimson, Katatonia, etc. desires are hungry for more.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was one of my best movies of the year, no doubt!<br />Jennifer no one else could've done it better!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is a no holes barred show where you never know what is going to happen next.  Usually I am able to guess what happens in these types of shows but this is so well put together I am completely surprised about each episode.  If you like feeling like this then get hold of this series and see if you agree.  Test it like they say and only get hold of one episode and then go forward from there.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This story was amazing. I've only read the first book but I have a feeling the rest of the series will b amazing! Must read!
B000GTLQXU|3.0|The acting was good. The special effects decent. If one likes disaster films and following the group trying to escape it is enjoyable.
B0034G4OZO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. It has an Indie film vibe in my opinion. And super clean for how funny Zach Galifianakis is.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|My kids are crazy about sonic and really enjoy this game.  It's definately worth the 1.99 that Amazon charges to download the game.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|It's nice to have the DVD and Digital Copy for Laptops, and the UltraViolet for watching on a whim at a friends house. And the Blu-ray for the big screen.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Fast-paced, frightening in exactly the right way, and quite an interesting view of the early Communist movement in Russia.  I was impressed by how earnest the author tried to portray most of the characters who thought they were working for the good of all (but in fact probably were not), and how delicate the balance between justice and injustice was during this period.  As the first of a trilogy, I am now interested in reading the sequels...
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Played the physical version of this with my brother and sister and thought it was great. Picked up the digital version for the Kindle Fire and love being able to play it where ever I go!
B00A17AD36|5.0|Love the sound of his voice, and the deep, dark, languid beats of this album.  However, as other people have pointed out, his sound and themes get redundant - this album is perfect for playing in the background of a chill event or activity. Despite its weaknesses, for the price per song, you can't really beat this album.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It was as if Lincoln came to life. The performances of the actors is superb. Excellent script and direction. Worth the watch!
0582419379|5.0|The book is out of print a book I started reading in high school over30 years ago and never finished always bothered me.  Now I have found it and can't wait to read it!
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I really liked this movie although there were times when I wanted to shake Anne and tell her to get a backbone (which she eventually did). I wish Cpt. Wentworth would have stayed true to Anne all the way through the film and not have pursued Louisa at all. It would have made his &#34;suffering&#34;( while longing for Anne) much more rewarding when they did finally reunite.
B00908DDZM|5.0|A friend asked me if I had heard about Same Love and I hadn't so I went to youtube to listen to it. Fell in love with it. Found a bunch of other songs and performances and became a fan instantly. Felt like I had to support their art with a purchase. I have had the songs on repeat!<br />Some songs are upbeat and have you singing along. Others are heartfelt and deep. But they all have an amazing message. And their story shows you what hard work and dedication will get you.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Django is a on it's way to being a cult classic along the lines of the Kill Bill movies. Great action and dialogue make it a must see!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was the perfect combination of funny and romance...loved it!<br />Well written and entertaining...a great book all around. Can't go wrong with the price!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Couldn't stop watching this fast paced show, I'll be glad when season 4 is included in my service. Good good
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this. I really love the storyline. I think it's very creative and I couldn't keep my nose out this book to be honest. I DEFINITELY recommend this book.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I think it's great so much fun. My mom has it on her phone too. I have so much fun on it. It is fun for everyone.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|a new type of character with alternate realities existing on top of each other and peeling  off the layers and entwining  the  characters is  such a refreshing  approach to new series.  can't wait to read the next  one.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|We use this app daily on our Kindle Fire. We keep the fire plugged in at night and use the nightstand mode. the display is bright enough to clearly see the time and other functions but doesn't lite up the whole room to disturb sleep. We also like that you can use songs from our library to wake up to instead of the usual alarm sounds.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|1. The Next Day.<br />Right out of the cage this song snarls and shreds and builds intensity until the breaking point with db's vox assuring us \\"Here I am not quite dying, my body left to rot in a hollow tree, its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me\\" and if you listen closely to the remaining lyrics about paper bodies and pain and diseases and purple-headed priests and the great line \\"they know God exists for the Devil told them so\\", it all adds up to one killer track knocked out of the proverbial ballpark for me. Repeat listenings improve this and every last track on the album, I know because I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />2. Dirty Boys.<br />Then we segue into a unique sounding song for Bowie. This is a low down sleazy dirty saxaphone dirge with remarkable guitar tones and angular rhythms. With lyrics about buying feather hats and stealing cricket bats and smashing windows, making noise, and running with dirty boys. . . what's not to like?<br /><br />3. The Stars (Are Out Tonight).<br />Another rocker knocked out of the park. 3 in a row?  We've barely scratched the surface of the new classic songs, and after listening to this one many times (it's a grower) I've determined this is the 1st 'classic' potential radio single with enough melodic catchiness and professional groovedom to please everybody. When he croons about Brigitte, Jack, Kate and Brad behind their sunglasses \\"gleaming like blackened sunshine\\" we are led to understand a brilliant poetic metaphor contrasting the celestial kingdom with Hollywood's and the public's overt glorification of celebrityhood...a topic that no one knows better from personal experience than David Bowie.<br /><br />4. Love is Lost.<br />A moody song that I've heard from more than one 20-something year old is their absolute favorite. Personally I can think of better tracks off this record but it pleases me to know that our younger generations adore this tune. I like it a lot myself because it's haunting and has a strange arrangement. Realize now that Bowie's lyrics throughout this album are nothing less than stellar. Beginning with these refrains \\"It's the darkest hour, you're twenty-two, the voice of youth, the hour of dread, the darkest hour and your voice is new, love is lost, lost is love, your country's new, your friends are new, your house and even your eyes are new, your maid is new and your accent too, but your fear is as old as the world\\" we are treated with more of the sharpest and incisive lyrics from Bowie's career, and that is saying something.<br /><br />5. Where Are We Now?<br />I'll never forget hearing this song for the first time on db's b-day earlier this year, and sitting before my computer screen utterly mezmerized by the equally brilliant video. I had to put up with the typical kneejerk bored reactionism from a host of dullards that this tune was \\"boring\\" or \\"melancholy\\" etc and YEAH it's melancholy as all getout and I'll tell you right now it equals and sometimes surpasses my favorite tracks off the entire album. It is that good. The way it builds slowly to the epiphany of \\"As long as there's Sun, As long as there's Sun / As long as there's Rain, As long as there's Rain / As long as there's Fire, As long as there's Fire / As long as there's Me / As long as there's You\\" brings tears to my eyes everytime I hear it. Truly a phenomenal lead-in track which cleverly manages to defiantly refute the seething masses' apathy, I consider that move of first releasing this \\"downer\\" of a tune (which evolves into quite the opposite in fact...much like the paradox of existence) as truly brilliant. A \\"check-mate\\" if you will right from the start. Where Are We Now? truly shines as one of David Bowie's greatest songs ever written in my opinion.<br /><br />6. Valentine's Day.<br />What can I say? Well there is no doubt David Bowie's got something to say. I will never tire of listening to this song for the remainder of my life...perhaps it has something to do with the fact its release coincides with the arrival of my newborn first son, with his \\"tiny face\\" and \\"scrawny hands\\" and \\"icy heart\\", not to mention we almost named him Valentine, actually...or maybe it's merely the fact this is the best radio pop song David Bowie has recorded since. . . .I just don't know when. Easily since 1980's Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) famous and everlasting track \\"Ashes To Ashes\\". I'm going to go ahead and dig into this song here for posterity, defending Bowie's lyrical intent and meaning behind it. With the subtle yet striking opening lines \\"Valentine told me who's to go / Feelings he's treasured most of all / The teachers and the football star\\" he sets up what in my rich experience of listening to rock music for the past 35 years is the most devastating critique of American culture I've had the pleasure listening to. This song is my #1 choice for the next single and definitely my favorite in terms of sheer pop catchiness and melody. From the opening drum taps to the introductory guitar riff and on through to the glorious end, the song Valentine's Day may be the most profoundly stated song in the history of modern rock'n'roll to me. It is a very brave statement in defense of generations of kids bullied by our increasingly out of touch society's penchant towards encouraging the cultivation of \\"rape culture\\" and overt machismo. Never in my life have I been so moved by the intent behind the meaning of a song. Not only is it the catchiest pop song on the album, but that fact (along with the \\"Yeah, yeah's\\" of the backing chorus championing our titular hero) perfectly contrasts the dark underpinnings of the theme. Add this song to the growing list of \\"mass shooting\\" songs (Pearl Jam's \\"Jeremy\\" and Korn's \\"Thoughtless\\" immediately come to mind) and you have the unparalleled Leader of the Pack in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned David Bowie has remarkably achieved \\"The Final Word\\" on this theme with Valentine's Day.<br /><br />7. If You Can See Me.<br />And now we come to another well-played segue into a brooding, dark song filled with postmodern tension. Returning to his \\"Big Brother\\" roots with the eerie refrain \\"If you can see me / I can see you\\", this track is yet another masterful studio recording featuring great lyrics such as \\"I will take your lands and all that lays beneath, the dust of cold flowers, prison of dark ashes, I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief, I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft, I'll burn all your books and the problems they make\\" . . .really a frightening tune if you can manage to get your head inside it even as it gets its head inside you. By this point of the album we are honestly scoring 7 out of 7 and what makes it even better is the diversity of styles and sounds making each track unique yet flowing into each other in a manner that only one who's mastered the art of conceptual rock albums could achieve.<br /><br />8. I'd Rather Be High.<br />By this point in the album, the \\"critical cynic\\" in me is just dying to throw you readers out there a condemnation or two, just to appease your bitter little hearts. Unfortunately for the legion of mindless haters out there (yet joyously fortunate for the rest of us) I cannot offer a single droplet of disdain about this, the eighth track off The Next Day. I'd Rather Be High is as glorious an anti-war statement as I have ever heard, simply jam-packed with beautiful elements. We are looking at yet another catchy single easily as great as any other from this album, in fact whenever I listen to it I become so enraptured that I am immediately swept up in it to the point I believe with all my heart it is the best song, period. From the gorgeously endless wavy rhythm of the guitars to the incredible biting and beautiful lyrics, how could anyone with ears and a brain deny the power and majesty here? \\"I'd rather be high (I'd rather be high), I'd rather be flyyyyyying (I'd rather be flying), I'd rather be dead (or out of my head)than training these guns on those men in the sand, I'd rather be high...\\" amount to the sentiment I sympathize the most with from the entire album. And just when you think this tune has shot its load, you ain't heard nothing yet until you hear the sixty-six year old David Bowie croon with as much tricky passion as he's mustered in generations \\"I'm seventeen and my looks can prove it, I'm so afraid that I will lose it, I'd rather smoke and phone my ex be pleading for some teenage sex, yeah.\\" See what he did there? Yet another example of his mastery of fiction into song. By shades and degrees Bowie reveals himself as a genuine \\"author\\" of fictional scenarios and invented protagonists via the medium of music. If this song is not a triumph then I don't know what is. Tied with Valentine's Day as the perfect single for this day and age. To think the Thin White Duke yet speaks for today's teen generation during his ripening years is proof in the pudding for me that he is not fading gradually away, far from it. The decade he spent laying low has proven to be the wisest move the 70s superstar could possibly have made. By this point in the album, if you are not entirely convinced that David Bowie is at the peak of his powers as a genuine artist, then all I can think of to say is...you're not paying attention. The underscoring theme of The Next Day is the ironic contrast between the lingering perception that his glory days (as Ziggy Stardust, etc.) are in the past, and the inescapable fact that nothing could be further from the truth.<br /><br />9. Boss Of Me.<br />Although it took me longer to appreciate this song fully, I do recall that the opening refrains grabbed me right away; \\"Tell me when you're sad, I wanna make it cool again, I know you're feeling bad, tell me when you're cool again.\\" That little snippet caught my interest from the get-go, but it took longer to groove to what I now consider an awesome chorus \\"Who'd have ever thought of it, who'd have ever dreamed, that a small town girl like you would be the boss of me.\\" Bowie's sardonic lyrics never fail to amaze me, and of course it's the manner in which he sings them that lends them their particular twisted meaning. It may have taken a dozen listens to finally click, and now I can't get enough of this song. At this point the album is still clocking in at 100% . . . and I am amazed.<br /><br />10. Dancing Out In Space.<br />Now we come to a real curve ball. I'll admit to hating this song the first few times I listened to it. And I'll even admit that the first dozen or so times I listened to the album, there were a couple or three tracks which reminded me of outtakes from his notoriously panned '87 (and cry) album Never Let Me Down. And to be honest...it let me down, bigtime. But check this out. Eventually the bassline to this song became so infectious, I could not deny its inherent danceability...on repeat listenings, I became impressed by the thought that late night clubs across metropolitan cities on Earth would be playing this new Bowie song to packed houses of dancing partygoers, and my indifference to it has now morphed into real appreciation. It's the snappiest song off the record for cryin' out loud! I'm just not into \\"snappy\\" songs since I stopped going to clubs years ago. But I'll say this much. Listening to Dancing Out In Space brings the old urge back and makes me dream of the good old days when we went clubbing and all the world was our oyster. If this song doesn't snap you out of your trance I guess you're better off dead.<br /><br />11. How Does The Grass Grow?<br />Blood blood blood...that's how. Now we return to the more serious and brooding side of the album, after having been given some super nice breaks during the last three songs. Featuring one of the most chilling lines in recent memory, \\"Would you still love me if the clocks could go backwards? The girls would fill with blood and the grass would be green again. Remember the dead, they were so great (someof them). Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya...Nya ya ya ya ya ya ya. Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud mud.\\" Here we are eleven cuts deep into Bowie's twenty-fourth studio album and we are gifted with yet another stunner. By this point all I can do is shake my head with wonder. If I could talk to David I'd say that I missed him more than he'd ever know, \\"waiting with my red eyes and my stone heart\\". Well I can personally vouch that the ten year wait has been more than worthwhile.<br /><br />12. You Will Set The World On Fire.<br />At long last, here it is. The single track off The Next Day that I honestly don't care for too much. Sure, its got an easy throwaway catchiness to it, but that's exactly why it quickly wears itself thin. This song comes as closest to sounding like an alternate take from Never Let Me Down. It is perhaps the song which best exemplifies what the cynical side of us most likely expected from Bowie at this late stage of his career.<br /><br />13. You Feel So Lonely You Could Die.<br />If I had one question I could ask David about the meaning behind any one of the songs off The Next Day, it would undoubtedly be \\"Can you tell us if the the song You Feel So Lonely You Could Die is based on a real person, and if so, who it is please?\\" Here is the most grandiose ballad off the album, and it's a bittersweet symphony indeed. With powerful accusations such as \\"HIdden from your friends, stealing all they knew, lovers thrown in airless rooms, then vile rewards for you\\" and \\"But I'm gonna tell, yes I've gotta tell, gotta tell the things you've said when you're talking in the dark and I'm gonna tell the things you've done when you're walking through the park\\" and \\"there'll come the assassin's needle on a crowded train, I'll bet you feel so lonely you could die\\" are powerful indictments indeed, but they merely pave the way for the climactic fury of \\"I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam, I can read you like a book\\" all building towards the ultimately satisfying lyrical annihilation of whomever the subject of this inspired ballad is, \\"Oblivion shall own you, death alone shall love you, I hope you feel so lonely you could die.\\" Just...wow. This penultimate track surges back 110% and I can't help but think that Bowie intentionally put the one \\"throwaway\\" track directly before it for added psychological effect. If not, it sure ends up working that way for me.<br /><br />14. Heat.<br />The album closes with this slow burner which also took me several listens to fully appreciate. In the end, that's what I love about this album. Bowie has offered us a challenging listen with a sprinkling of poppy, easy-listening scattered here and there, creating a dynamic and fully realized rock album, the likes of which I haven't heard from him (much less from a lot of bands today) in many years. When he concludes the album with lines such as \\"My father ran the prison / I can only love you by hating him more / that's not the truth, it's too big a word / He believed that love is theft / love and whores / the theft of love / And I tell myself I don't know who I am / My father ran the prison / my father ran the prison / But I am a seer / I am a liar / I am a seer / I am a liar\\" etc, us old school fans are reminded and the new ones are tipped in that he is playing the role of author, here. He has created a brilliant fiction in writing The Next Day. And for me it has been the most engrossing and satisfying rock album of 2013.<br /><br />In conclusion, 93% of this album (that's 13 out of 14 tracks kids) is \\"the proof in the pudding\\" so to speak that Bowie remains in Tip-Top form at the age of sixty-six in the year 2013. How cool is that? To think that the proverbial \\"Next Day\\" (today) is even better than the glorified Olden Days of Yore is as welcome a message as we could honestly expect. It took me listening to this album for at least a month before it all gelled together for me. You may hate it, love it, leave it or remain indifferent...I don'tcare. As a long time appreciator of Bowie the mercurial songwriter, crooner, and uncrowned king of the alternative scene, I could not possibly be more pleased than I am with The Next Day. As solid an album as I could have dreamed. So let there be Another Day...and the next...and the next. I am confident he can continue to deliver good music for another several years to come. Yet I also expect he will retire with grace before he indeed may begin to \\"fade away\\"... And on that note, I also expect it's entirely possible this may be the Last Album. I only say that because he could not possibly make a grander exit nor have produced a better Swan Song. Still. Bowie is obviously genetically programmed for boundless energy and creativity. So if he asked me...I say don't stop now, David.  Well I'm getting older myself so I won't even mind if he starts gradually fading away from this pinnacle in his extraordinary career. Generations of people have felt this way since I was in my teens, so I'm going to say it now...we love you David.t a small town girl like you would be the boss of me.\\" Bowie's sardonic lyrics never fail to amaze me, and of course it's the manner in which he sings them that lends them their particular twisted meaning. It may have taken a dozen listens to finally click, and now I can't get enough of this song. At this point the album is still clocking in at 100% . . . and I am amazed.<br /><br />10.

B00BHMETKC|4.0|First off, it was a good movie worth watching but it was not as great as I thought. Everyone hyped it up so much for me I was really excited going in. But already I knew what was going to happen and killed some of that greatness for me. Still I enjoyed it and I recommend it I just didnt think it was as goood as every said.
B0094K1K42|1.0|Awful. Uncomfortable to watch. Theron does a good job playing a crazy, but she doesn't carry the film. Would not bother.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Going in I didnt know if I would enjoy this movie but after watching it I was very happy and glad I saw it, well worth it.
0761129235|5.0|Less is more!  Dream big ... but start small.  Nothing takes the wind out of your sails as filling them too full.  Are you feeling overwhelmed?  Robert Maurer leads the reader through the process of making big changes by taking small steps.  The small book is readable, understandable and usable.  Go for it!  Carolyn Dunn
B009IJJB8G|5.0|Jonny Lee Miller and the enchanting Lucy Liu are, quite simply, mesmerizing in this latest and highly effective rebirth of Conan Doyle's deathless consulting detective, Sherlock Holmes and his perennial sidekick, Dr. John (now Joan) Watson. I used to think no one besides Basil Rathbone could ever play Holmes, but the late Jeremy Brett managed it so well that I then became convinced that no one could ever replace him. He was Holmes come to life. Then came Benedict Cumberbatch - a truly remarkable actor who recreates Holmes in a thoroughly delightful and very different way, working now in the computer age. Now come Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, the first female Watson, in this very modern version set in present-day New York. Many familiar names from the original stories appear - Moriarty, Sebastian Moran, Irene Adler -  which adds to the fun, even if they are drastically altered. This series is unflaggingly entertaining and I hope it runs for many seasons.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The movie was really good - believe me, I thought a lot about it trying to fly out of Chicago during the recent storms. But after repeated difficulties using Amazon's Instant Video, even after upgrading my download speed, I am done with Amazon Instant. Too bad, I've been an Amazon customer for a long time, and I know they could do better if they cared to.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Love this album.  Couldn't stop listening to it for a month.  IMHO, best Deftone's album since White Pony.  R.I.P. Chi.  Gonna miss you.
0930289234|5.0|Read it! First graphic novel for me. Sold on the genre for sure. Was dynamically complex and full of emotion and plots within plots. perfect read.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|this book is a little slow at times being that it involves only the events that surround king's landing. i missed hearing about jon snow, danaerys, and of course, tyrion...worth the time for sure though
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I saw HG in the theater after reading series and during all of the hype. I loved it then and loved it even more on video the second time around.
B009AMANH4|5.0|By far the best movie that I have ever seen,Daniel Day Lewis even had the right pitch for the voice. The only reason I say that is because Lincoln was know to have a high pitched voice, often starting a speech with Mr. Cheerman. Well worth seeing this, its a piece of history that you don't often find in movies.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|The main city scene is well interspersed with flashbacks to the island.  This makes it all the more interesting! Hope it gets funded for another season.
0780756908|4.0|I found this book very compelling.  It captured my interest from the get-go and held it.  Read it and see if you agree Ayn Rand's ultimate individualist should be her hero.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Disclaimer, I am a big Woody Allen fan and I have a huge crush on Xavier Bardem.  (I'm 45 and my tweens find this pathetic).  If not for the fact that this was a Woody Allen film with Xavier Bardem, I probably wouldn't have bought it although I really enjoyed it and will not doubt watch it again on a rainy afternoon.  I think this was one of his first moves from Manhattan and that eventually brought him to make Midnight in Paris - which I loved.  Good move.  If you like Match Point, I think you would enjoy this.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We waited to see this until just now! It's terrific!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The acting is outstanding and the production itself is riveting.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|This is a very interesting insight into the life of a very good leader in World History.  It gives the human side of Margaret Thatcher.  Both she and President Reagan believed in capitalism  which  brought both of our countries out of depressions.  It was very well played by Meryl Streep who rightly deserved the &#34;Academy Award&#34; which she received.
B008DVW7DQ|5.0|I almost didn't purchase this marvelous DVD because of incorrect product details. The DVD is 161 minutes not 91 minutes and the aspect ratio is 16:9 and not 1.33:1.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This was both historically correct, and educational.  However, I would have liked to have learned more of his relationship with God, which this film didn't reveal to us.  I do recommend this to anyone who wishes to know what happened in our nation during President Lincoln's time in office.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Does it's job.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy is admittedly trashy BUT terribly addicting. Does it set a great example for younger girls who are impressionable and depend on books to tell them how relationships are supposed to go-NO. BUT younger girls really shouldn't be reading such an adult novel. I do not read &#34;romance&#34; novels but this one didn't read like that. I enjoyed this read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn throws Rapp into another porridge of lies, fractured alliances, and treason - right where he needs to be.  Good characters, woven through a tapestry of twists and deceptions that keep the intensity flowing over the potholes and craters of the Afghan countryside. Get this.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I love Stephen King books and this one was no different. I can't say exactly why, so you'll just have to read it yourself.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is fun even for the adults. I have had to fight over my kindle with my daughter and then install it on her tablet so I could have mine back.<br /> It is easy to play and requires no special skills except to pick which animal or which house you will buy next.<br />My only complaint was at the very beginning where I had to sit and for five minutes while my first house and pet came. Once you get a few going there's plenty to do while you wait for new arrivals.<br />I do wish that not so much required real money to get, but even with that it is quite fun and plenty is available with what the game offers.<br />Little girls will be the biggest fans.
0670026603|5.0|This is such a beautifully crafted and emotionally driven love story that when I reached the last ten pages, I had to briefly pause. I simply did not want it to end. I needed to mull over what I had already read and hope against hope that there would be a fairytale ending, but I knew however the author concluded this novel, it would be well done.<br />When it begins, we meet two of the world's \\"beautiful\\" people, planning a future vacation together. She wants easy, lolling on the beach, he wants rough, hiking and parachuting. On that day, when he leaves to go his high powered job, where he is CEO, he checks his phone messages and finds many missed calls. Because it is raining, he decides to leave his motorcycle behind and runs out into the storm to find a cab, not an easy task on nasty day in London or any major city. As he walks/runs, he begins to retrieve his messages, and his phone rings. Somewhat distracted, stepping into the cab, tragedy strikes Will Traynor.<br />Now, fast forward, two years later; we meet Louisa. She has just been fired. Her family relies on her salary to survive. Her sister, Treena, is a single mom, living at home as does her ailing grandfather. Her dad expects to soon lose his own job. In what has been a largely futile job search, Louisa finally answers an ad for a caregiver. Although she has no previous experience that qualifies her for such a position, she surprises herself by getting the job and then wonders, what she has gotten herself into, since her charge, a still handsome man, is rude and angry, most of the time. Once a free living, adventurous man, he is now helpless, confined to bed or a wheelchair. He is now a quadriplegic with little use of anything but one hand, and that, only minimally. He cannot adjust to this new unhappy condition. Louisa is not sure she is up to this job, but she desperately needs the money so she remains and works even harder.<br />Let me warn you reader, keep tissues on hand. As she cares for this defenseless, ill-mannered man, she comes of age, rather late in life. This is a tragic, bittersweet tale of unrequited love, not because there is no love, but because the love cannot be fulfilled. Will Traynor has a secret which will ultimately change the course of Lou's life and his. Realistically, in his former life, their love never would have been allowed to see the light of day. It was the disastrous accident that brought these two people, diametrically opposed to each other, into the same sphere of influence. Coming from two different worlds, one rich, the other barely eking out an existence, one ambitious and adventurous, the other far less driven, living in the shadow of a brilliant sister, and content with very little, having very little ambition, one disabled, resentful, wishing he could do the things he once did and one able-bodied who has no wishes to do much else with her life, one will wonder how on earth will these two will even be able to interact in the same space, peacefully? Could two so different human beings find any common ground to travel? Well, in six months time, against all odds, Louisa brings color and joy into Will's world, and he teaches her to expand her horizons and reach her potential. She wants nothing more than to do that, together, with him.<br />The author has taken a very grim topic and with the artful use of humorous dialogue, has made a very difficult subject easier to read about. Having to depend on someone for every need, having pain almost all the time, being unable to sleep, haunted by memories of what you once were and never will be again, essentially a prisoner in your own body is devastating, and the reader will feel that character's extreme distress and his wish to bring that suffering to an early end. The reader will feel her frustration as Louisa agonizes over which is more important, her obligation to her job or to her boyfriend.<br />Although there are times when serendipitous coincidences or uncharacteristic behavior seems contradictory, the books mainly succeeds in inspiring the reader to think about a truly controversial topic, euthanasia, and to explore the reasons it is sometimes considered and the ethics and morality of the choices made by those involved in these kind of life and death decisions.s contradictory, the books mainly succeeds in inspiring the reader to think about a truly controversial topic, euthanasia, and to explore the reasons it is sometimes considered and the ethics and morality of the choices made by those involved in these kind of life and death decisions.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Season two was incredible! Rivoting story, very well acted and even moderate accuracy. Highly recommended show, couldn't stop watching episode after episode.
B007JNR4WI|5.0|Great movie for the entire family. High quality resolution is great. Family had great time watching this movie. Need more like them.
B005LAII80|1.0|This was one of the worse acted-directed-produced-edited movies I've seen in years.I was expecting Sly to return but no one could make this worth watching,Can't understand how some folks actually enjoyed this movie. The main character just had no emotion, a pixelated toon could have shown more.
B004SBX112|2.0|I've downloaded and enjoyed all of the Angry Bird games and have enjoyed them; but the SEASONS version is not as fun as it is frustrating. It's the first of the franchise that I didn't want to finish.<br /><br />First, the weapons are pitiful. For example, I enjoy using only the number and types of weapons I'm given -- the rest I can use later, once I'm through the game. To find myself facing targets with only cardinals is maddening. Or those yellow pointy headed (small) birds against structures of reenforced wood interlaced with cement! The underpowered projectile birds simply either remove small chips or bounce. The sweet spots are few and very difficult to hit, and the damage is minimal! And when you do get a good weapon (projectile), there's mostly just one followed by three or four worthless ones. In one play, if you want to hit a snowball at the top of a mountain holding back some boulders, you have to hit it directly on to drop the boulders. Extremely close isn't good enough.<br /><br />Finally there are what I call &quot;immortal widgets&quot; -- green little piggies that no matter what happens manage to end up under a pile of concrete and steel, well fortified against attack. No matter where you hit the enemy piggies, the same one tends to end up in the same place, safely ensconced in the rubble!<br /><br />So this version needs a bit more time on the drawing board. Like I said, it's more frustrating than fun.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|there are a lot of cool affect and things you can do with this app. I love it, its really cool. I draw pictures for my boyfriend with it lol. :)
B009FZFONO|5.0|At first I found The Walking Dead too intense and too gory, but I got into it and now that Season 3 is over, I'm still hooked. Yeah, people still wander off alone as if they've somehow forgotten they're in constant danger. Yeah, some of the conflicts aren't explored enough while others are examined ad nauseum. And why anyone would settle into life in a prison is beyond me... But these are devices to keep the story going and to keep us guessing.<br /><br />My only fear is that the show goes takes the path of Lost. Please Walking Dead people - DO NOT lead us in circles just to confuse us. We're with you as long as you keep things somewhat logical. And for heaven's sake, please don't kill Darrell.  He's awesome.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|a cute game to help past time!! really great<br />I wud enocourage all to down load. No problems at all on my kindle fire hd
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Overall I liked the plot, the characters and the flow of the story. It had a good earthy feel to it and came across as very real at the start. With so much centered in the DA's office and courtrooms it wasn't overly legalistic, but it did start to drag and become bogged down in the middle and there was a sense of it becoming overworked and disconnected from the plot.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed it - would recommend it and would be happy to read more by this author
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games are a easy read and their amazing. The hunger games would be a good book for 3rd -5th graders.<br /><br />5 stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game. It keeps me busy playing on it. I really like playing others on the game too.
B00499NHLC|5.0|A tight, smart and thought provoking show with concentrated excellence without overly trying to stretch things out. Great limited episodes are better than a lot of mediocre one.
1401937519|5.0|As a cancer survivor along with the other four friends who I purchases the book for...I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to pursure personalized spitituality and self-love and worth.
B001N4TIHI|2.0|The original is enjoyable.  This remake is marginal.  I would watch the original again, I wouldn't watch the remake.  Too bad this movie didn't make full use of the talent that these actresses possess.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love it! Watch out you will get hooked! Energy refills quickly. Cost of extra city bucks a little high. But very fun.
0439023513|4.0|Love the series.  Great characters.  Half way done with the book and I can't put it down.  However, my opinion of the main character has changed quite a bit.  I find Katniss a completely unlikable person in this book.  Self absorbed, childish, cold, bratty, amoral, cowardly at times, abusive, etc.  She was always a bit of that in the other two books, but she still had some good qualities.  Most of those are gone here.  On the positive, it makes her interesting and realistic.  After all, she's only 17 and lived a horrible life.  She's damaged goods and makes no bones about it.  On the negative, it just kills the love story.  There is almost nothing there that I can see someone falling in love with, much less even wanting to be friends with.  It becomes difficult to root for her at times. I don't want to say too much without spoiling the book.  I'll update my review when I finish the book.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The harsh facts of His life  we're enough to make JAmir give up but wormhole arrived he gained strength and joy.
0553328255|5.0|Although the print is not large, it is a nice 2 volume paperback boxed set. Great for the traveller or at the bedside.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I get so many great ideas from Pinterest. Everybody should be on Pinterest.  I can't believe the coolest things you can do with stuff you might normally not even think of.  Thank you to all Pinterest posters.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|Timeless ideas demonstrate that if you use money (which is a tool) wisely, you can live comfortably and enjoy the truly important things in life.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I waited for over a year for this Box Set to get to the right price.  But the movies are classic, so I would've waited longer.  I'm glad to have them on Blu-ray.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Transfers pics from my camera to my ipad with lightning seed. I haven't used the USB adapter yet, just the sd card one but it works perfectly. I would imagine it would let you connet other USB devices as well. But like I said I haven't tried it yet. It will transfer RAW photos as well as jpeg. Makes getting photos on my ipad a breeze.
B0094MFITS|5.0|Family appropriate and a good watch.  Watch these in order.  There is some reference to previous shows but are good as a stand alone too.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Great movie. Marvelous actors. Very surprised and pleased with Russel Crowe's voice. He sounded better than Hugh Jackman. The song &#34;Stars&#34; is my favorite from the show and Mr. Crowe did a great job with it.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|This film has it all : great acting, humor, witty dialogue, beautiful scenery, great plot,  action, and romance. It's my favorite Hitchcock movie by far. The book was good but this is the rare case where the movie was better.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The more I use it, the better it gets. I am impressed with the predictions, &amp; SwiftKey just keeps getting better. The swipe method works well too, but I don't need it much because the prediction is that good.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Similar to Reached, Crossed ,Matched series by another author but its characters were developed nicely enough that it was original.  I liked it a lot in the end.
B0080XN3C6|4.0|She has a fantastic voice.  Very skilled.  Problem is, the songs are cluttered up with too much background noise at times.  I've watched a couple of YouTube videos of her singing some of these same songs but with a significantly scaled-down accompaniment, and I liked those versions much better.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|best game ever&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!  soooooooo cool loved it so much had great graphics and I really liked the option of other sharks.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and since it had been a while since I read The Secret, I decided to read it.  Some of the same concepts found in the book &#34;The Secret&#34; are further explained. The power of love in your life helps you live a more full life.  Sometimes we need to remember to pay attention and not just go through the motions of daily life. Loving yourself and others on purpose and with action gives you the power to attract more of what you want in life.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|a lot of insight on &#34;ways of thinking&#34; that are more common then you'd think. a genuine love story.  i appreciated the movie too and i  find interesting the changes that have been done to plot and characters
B005DJREJS|1.0|This is a story of a normal teen having sex everyday with few consequences like every normal teen. Wrong. I was discouraged that this is the example of a modern show geared for the teen demographic. It portrays the character only seldomly and briefly considering that she constantly &#34;puts out&#34; for a guy who doesn't want an actual relationship with her. This is laid up as an acceptable sacrifice. Not to mention the other characters constantly talk and partake in it as if it were as normal as eating breakfast. Sex is not just physical, but emotional too. Just because a young person craves sexuality, doesn't mean they are at a time to indulge in it. Though hardly any would like to admit it, teenagers are not adults- they are not fully mature physically or mentally and cannot fully understand the consequences of treating such an intimate thing without the greatest of caution and restraint. Too many teenagers already lack solid examples of healthy relationships and decision-making. Unfortunately, most turn to the TV or internet for their source of education. If this is the example of reality available and heralded to them, it is sure to ruin many naive and misled lives.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|awesome. game w/ no money needed. only have had 1 problem where game froze up &amp; I had to reset my kindle. everything was saved though. so no complaints.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|It's true that the subject is depressing, but it's a beautifully written book and I loved it. It may be one of the best memoirs I've read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first book and was hooked. A great story full of interesting people and twists and turns. I highly recommend this series and can't wait for more from the silo residents.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I put off buying this book because of the reviews trashing the ending. I finally bought it because there were so many great reviews. I wish I could get my money back. The writing is not bad, but I got so bored I would forget I was reading it. I had no desire to get back to my book and find out what happened. I stopped reading half way through.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow is the only way to explain this book. I could not put my kindle down until I finished it. Very well written. Realistic, funny, sad, everything at once.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This movie is the funniest cartoon movie. The writing for this movie is great. Humerous yet good story and lessons
B00C6Q511Y|5.0|I had bought the Ryan doll from the same series and was so impressed with him that I had to buy the Ken doll as well. Arrived in 2 days and I fell in love with it as soon as I opened it. Again, like the Ryan doll of this series, the knees don't bend which I don't mind coz he stands well. His face is a bit more happy than Ryan's. Love the hair and the outfit. Looks very real and like the photos. Shoes are metallic chic. I am having fun posing him with my Glam fashionista doll. (Ryan makes a great pair with the Artsy fashionista doll)
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I just downloaded Full Facebook on to my Kindle Fire HD.  I really like it.  It is touchy when enlarging the type so that I can read it but I will get used to that.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|ithis game is  awesome and its addicting all my friends love to play it and are always trying to get me to share this game with them
B00AG472DS|5.0|This movie is well made, and I think this film was definitely oscar worthy, but was mistakenly passed over when Awards considerations were being done. David Fincher did a great job telling this true story based on the book by Robert Graysmith. Although the Graysmith book has some holes and question marks, and focuses in on his suspect, the movie is divided up equally between the crimes, the investigation, and various suspects. If you are planning to watch a 'slasher flick', this is NOT the movie for you, in fact, the first 30 minutes or so of the movie shows the murders, and the remaining two hours focuses on the hunt for the killer, and the obsession that overtakes those involved in trying to identify the Zodiac Killer. It may be a bit slow for some, but if you are heavily interested  in the case, then it moves along quickly from one storyline to the next.<br /><br />The bonus footage is fantastic,and features interviews with those who were directly involved in the case, as well as a complete breakdown of the crimes and a segment devoted to Graysmith's suspect.<br /><br />The Blu ray quality is pretty good as well, and I was happy to finally buy it at a reasonable price considering it has been out of print for quite a while.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of my Favorite movies, and although I do not agree with some of the conclusions reached at the end of the movie (as far as a suspect),I am happy to refer anybody to this movie!
B005K17RU0|5.0|i love this app its works just fine<br />its getting better and better<br />so keep up the good work and keep ud safer
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Would definitely recommend this book to someone. I couldn't put it down until I was Done, it's a really great read and something I would read over and over. The whole book is one big cliff hanger.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose the 5 star rating because the story is great. I like how the story develops her character through what she went through in life.
B002RMVAZ8|1.0|Effort to re-frame Hamlet in a time. Typically that is not an easy endeavor. From my perspective it didn't appear to work. On the other hand others might better appreciate the effort.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|Great to rediscover Willow again. Sat with the family and enjoyed Willow on a Saturday night, took me back 20 years. Still enjoyed the movie,
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very entertaining and helps keep the brain busy after a serious illness. Grandchildren love to play and learn colors also
B0079K4WEE|2.0|If you want to experience what it's like to die, this is the movie for you. In that &#34;sense&#34; I think the movie worked its magic. However, I felt very depressed after watching it. Take caution.
B0063IH60K|4.0|What you see is what you get. I have not seen any issues or bugs and it runs well. Lots of adds with the free version.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I thought Gone Girl was poorly written and found both main characters to be weak and rather unlikeable. I think they deserved each other. I found the narration by each protagonist  taking turns, rather annoying though I have enjoyed this technique in other books. The ending was also quite unrealistic. A.E
B0024FADAQ|5.0|One of my all-time faves. My kids love it and I love it. It is a good family flick, guaranteed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun little game for killing time. It does get boring after a while, when you start winning more coins than you lose and you know you'll never run out. But the bonus prizes are enough incentive to keep it interesting beyond the first five minutes
B00C10N3EW|5.0|recent download and this is great, and now I find he is coming to do a show here, WOW!!! Very COOL!!!
B00AESN8XY|3.0|Cant get passed viral on any level. (i think thats how the game is designed) There are too many unlock features that you have to pay for.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Took me a little bit to get into this story. The character is OCD and it can be very over the top at first. Once you figure out what is going on and get into her character you get used to it and it is a good story. Couple twists and turns, slightly predictable, but would definitely recommend.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|very entertaining story, well written, can't decide which part I liked better, the current story or the history of the character - but the way they seamed together in the end was great. very funny with a bit of an edge, both the good and the bad guys get what they deserve in the end.
0802473156|5.0|Wonderful and practical book! I'm single now but I think if we coul go back in time this book could have saved my marriage. A lot of common sense and I see how this concepts can  help everyone. Other reviewers can do write a better review as long as English it's not my primary language. However I think 5 stars qualification speaks by itself.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|It doesn' stand up very well, It falls down when I try to read<br />when I have it folded like it is supposed to be.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I really recommend that you read all of these books in order.  This was suggested to me and I am very glad that I did.  Very suspenseful and absolutely a great read!!!!
B000002H4C|5.0|As I'm writing this, I'm playing it on my computer. I knew I'd like this! Weird movie but a stellar sountrack.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I am a long time lover of Kay Scarpetta and her neice Lucy.  This is just as good as the first book i read years ago
B00000J7SS|5.0|THIS is his groundbreaking album.  Kind of Blue, yeah, Birth of the Cool definitely.  But on Bitches Brew he throws caution and formula to the wind for sheer innovation.  Many well-known jazz musicians on this record.  Great album, hard to categorize or pigeonhole it.  Sheer jazz improvisational magic!!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I absolutely loved the narrative of this book! The author's perspective on life really makes you view every day living in a different light. Very fun and easy read!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Good movie.  Not as good as the others but I liked it.  Daniel Craig is by far my favorite Bond
0786838655|5.0|I decided to try this book after seeing the movie, which was ok, and because I needed a quick,  mindless read after all other books I've been reading lately.<br /><br />I quickly read this book and it turns out it wasn't so mindless. I love mythology, Greek especially, and this book was just filled with references to what I already know, but in a fun and unique fashion that's worth taking the time out of your day to read.<br /><br />Percy Jackson is just your normal, run of the mill kid. Sure he has problems, but what kid doesn't. He's more accident prone yes, but ehh...things happen. But what Percy doesn't know is that he's the son of Poseidon and that his little accidents are about to make sense. Nothing in life is just an accident.<br /><br />Percy, through a series of unfortunate events, ends up at a place called Camp Half-Blood and there he learns who he is. He also learns that he's a wanted person because people believe that he's stolen Zeus' master bolt and that is not a good thing.<br /><br />He goes on a quest to find the bolt, return it and in the process you are introduced, or re-introduced to a cast of characters and monsters from the Greek mythology you may have gone over in school.<br /><br />This isn't a rehash. That's boring. Riordan explores this area in a fun and fresh new fashion. The monsters are named the same, but they appear in new guises and in America! Even some of the old heroes \\"tourist\\" spots show up like the Lotus Eaters Island in the form of a casino.<br /><br />You meet Hades, who really isn't so evil, but ruling the Underworld isn't a fun job, and his sidekick Charon, who wear Italian suits. It's an upgrade from your grade school stuff.<br /><br />In this book, as opposed to the movie, which I have no idea how they're going to fix this big behind problem, you meet the force behind the rest of the books. Kronos, who's stuck in Tartarus, a deep pit in the Underworld.<br /><br />Riordan makes mythology fun and exciting. I'm 26 and enjoyed it for what it is. It's not Harry Potter, though some things are similar(but that's another discussion). It's something new with something old. I'd recommend it for the child's audience it's meant for. And it is a good introduction to those who didn't get Greek mythology the first time around.d it for what it is. It's not Harry Potter, though some things are similar(but that's another discussion). It's something new with something old. I'd recommend it for the child's audience it's meant for. And it is a good introduction to those who didn't get Greek mythology the first time around.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Only interested in the Blu-ray and it's extras features! Would be nice to combine the Blu-ray from the just Blu-ray and the extra features from this pack into a just Blu-ray AND extra features without all the extra fluff for a cheaper price.
1423101499|5.0|The fourth book in the series and it's probably the best one so far.<br /><br />This book starts off with Percy meeting a new monster. Empousai. Basically monster cheerleaders who, as normal, try to kill him and his friend Rachel Elizabeth Dare, who he met on his last venture.<br /><br />Getting back to camp he and Annabeth find an entrance to the famous Labyrinth. They also find out that Grover has a week to find Pan, Luke is using the Labyrinth to get into camp and that camp may be destroyed if they don't find Daedalus first.<br /><br />Riordan takes the legend of the amazing maze and twists and turns it to make it new. The Labyrinth as a growing, changing thing? Yep. It has ties to Mt. St. Helen's, a forge; the Rocky Mountains, New York and a few other places. It also has time to different time periods from the ultra modern and new of Daedalus' workshop to the ancient Greek and Roman. It also tends to hide people, a dead milkman anyone and maybe, just maybe...Pan and a dodo bird.<br /><br />Riordan also introduces you to more obscure and unheard of monsters. Kampe, telkhines, and a giant who's mother is Gaia, Geryon, the list goes on.<br /><br />They must find the Labyrinth's creator Daedalus. Will he help them or won't he? His decision may make or break them. If he decides not to help can Camp Half-Blood continue to exist?

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|A very sad account of teens with cancer.  Well written but I would not recommend it to the young adults in my family.  Teens have enough problems without them worrying about living with or getting cancer.  Hazel and Gus helped each other cope.  Sadly cancer took one of their lives.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Very few shows can sustain a itself season after season, this is one of those that can, now I wish damn football didn't mess up my DVR recordings of season 4!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I've always been interested in firsthand accounts of any action taken by the military.  The author does a good job in his descriptions and flow of the story.
B009S33I68|5.0|From a military man's point of view, this is a great book. It provides accurate and descriptive accounts of the war.
B00007KWHG|5.0|We saw Jersey Boys and loved it, but we wanted the original group's songs. We LOVE this CD. We dance our pants off almost every night.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|This case appears to be a very good case and offer good grip and protection for the entire phone.  Well worth the price.
1451695195|5.0|If you are questioning NDE's this book is for you. It is not the typical NDE in that Eban Alexander(author) was in a coma for 7 days and is also a nero surgeon. A good read left me with a lot to ponder
B00B22IJXK|4.0|it is a great app in my opinion but if it had more cool features it would have earned a 5 star rating for me. some of those features are the brushes shaped like leaves. overall it is a great app.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|This app is just like the free version - doesn't work! It only lets you watch a couple of videos. The pictures showed a search bar but there isn't one! The manufacturers either need to fix the problem, or GIVE US OUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!! To all those reading this please don't buy this app! It's not worth $2.00!
B000AMSSAW|1.0|I got this DVD and it can't play on my DVD because the United States is not the correct region for it to play. Also, it is all in foreign languages. This person saw that he was shipping it to the US. I feel like I could have been warned that it would not work in the United States.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book can keep from doing other things for 3 days because of all the excitement with the drama like you where watching to movie as you read the book.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Watched it when it was on tv and have watched it many times since and it just keeps getting better.  I recommend it to all my family and friends and the always like it too.  Long live Serenity!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a great game for people who like draw.I like how you can connect with your friends while playing.this is a really good game.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This story is a good read , it is fun and easy to read . I really enjoyed going to Oz and sharing the adventures .
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is a very good game to play. Once you start you won't be able to stop. I have all the additions to this game. I LUV IT!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|The best price for a terrific nessary app.  You get details about the weather in your area!  So far I have not been disappointed using this app.
B007L5GDGW|5.0|This game is fast paced. But the graphics are beautiful enough to watch as a bystander! LOL My grandsons have the stamina for it, I don't. If you enjoy these types of games, you will not get bored with this one!
B00AKKS278|5.0|This book has transformed my life ! I am up earlier than I have ever been in my life and getting more accomplished,focusing on what matters most and have enormous energy ! I am actually happy to get  out of bed and start my Miracle Morning ! Hal's tips on setting up your space to what you focus on have been life changing for me ! I am seeing success in my personal life as well as my business !
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This is one of the games I downloaded for the grandchildren, but find I play just as much. I use it to unwind after a stressful day. The graphics are bright and colorful.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a great time with these puzzles it really make you think. I hope they make a new one soon.
B00846WWVM|4.0|I downloaded this game for my grandkids purely for the cuteness of it. And it turns out to be a pretty good game! A little complicated (aiming the hose) for very young children, but my 8 year old has no problem.
B003DS3GC0|3.0|It's hard to watch because there are several scenes of sexual torture of young boys.  In the second half, when the boys are now grown up, they take revenge, but that part of the story is poorly developed.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|No matter when I am clicking through the movie channels, if RIO is on...I am a gonner.  The colors, the music, the LOVE story, the 'message' in the move.  ALL  ARE 5 STAR!<br />ALSO...no matter what movie Jesse Isenberg is in...he will always be BLU
B0080M3OGW|4.0|I liked the clever way it showed the actors almost meeting in several scenes.  Meryl Streep was great, as usual.  But I thought Robert de Nero wasn't right for the part.
B003G94BZC|4.0|Season 5 introduces the new, regenerated Doctor, Matt Smith.  The episodes continue in the vein of the rest of this series, with new adventures, new aliens & new problems to solve.  The Doctor's new companion, Amy Pond is introduced.  She is in love with her boyfriend, but loves the traveling adventures & often brings Rory with her. No love interest in these episodes.  In my opinion, Matt Smith's acting is not the same caliber as his predecessor, David Tennant.  But it is the nature of this character to evolve & change, leading us to believe another Doctor will be presented in a couple years time.  My favorite episode in this season was the Pandorica.  Don't miss a minute of this one, or you'll be confused with all the time-traveling!  The Weeping Angels double episode was also quite interesting.  And River Song shares many more adventures with the Doctor this season, as she comes back in time to help in various adventures.  I love the series & look forward to more adventures with the Doctor.
B00340LM8C|3.0|It was interesting to see again after so many years, but it really doesn't stand up well over time.  The actors seemed stilted, and the story was so unreal.  Grace Kelly seemed so fake.
B0042816YK|3.0|not totally thrilled with this movie as I know it was based on a true story but just not believable
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really liked that although there was some predictability within the plot, Sparks throws in some curve balls to keep the story fresh and ever changing.
B000683VI4|5.0|whoever does not love this movie is ridiculous as this is the most romantic movie of all time hands down
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Best game in the world better than six guns worth it for the price i recommend this game to everyone
B009KS4XRO|5.0|ever one in the family loves it. very easy to play. i love to play it at all times. x
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This movie was very good, very cute story about being ok with who you are. While I liked most of it, I couldn't get past some of the character voices.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|written for tweens to make fun of their parents, a stupid movie and a giant waste of time and money
B0049IWQJW|5.0|This is my first time seeing it and I've never been a fan of talking cars but it has a wonderful story and a great family film. Pixar has yet to disappoint.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Season 2 didn't disappoint!  Each episode could come soon enough for me!  The character relations was great and kept me on the edge of my seat.  The conflict between Rick and Shane was very tense!  The end just set me up for an even bigger Season 3!
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|Movie was funny and engaging. Slightly awkward to watch at first but it is a great story. Recommend for sure.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|I was surprised and I enjoyed season 1 I can't wait to watch season 2 I hope this one will pull me in!!!!
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|To be honest, the trailers for this movie didn't do it credit at all. It is a wonderful film about believing in yourself and it shows it in a positive way. I love how all the characters meld together and not to mention the visuals. A favorite of mine for sure.
B00A8LYYI0|3.0|Well, I enjoyed the 1st SH quite a bit as these movies are what I like best - weird, creepy, horror types.<br />I waited a long time for this and finally picked it up cheap.<br />The acting is stiff and the dialog is cheesy, but about halfway into the film it got pretty good.<br />The special effects rock and the sounds keep you engaged (assuming you have a decent system to play it on). Beyond that I was little disappointed...I guess the anticipation and build up was what did it.<br />I could go either way recommending it. Good thing I picked it up cheap - I would not have paid full price anyway just for that reason.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|While my husband watched this movie and seemed to enjoy it, I did not. It didn't hold my attention but it is an overall good action film, specially if you're used to the sameness that Bond films have turned into.
B00BMEF6IO|4.0|I love BMTH.  Seen them in concert many times, enjoyed their walls of death immensely.  The problem with this album, while it's still good, it's not as deathcore/metalcore as their earlier stuff, and I hate to say it, but it's becoming mainstream to a degree.  The start of their first song sounds like they stole it from Lacuna Coil.  I can hear other parts in other songs that feel they were a riff on other bands.  I still enjoyed it though, but not as much as I would have liked.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|I've read the book and watched the movie. The story is captivating and definitely comes to life with all the cg. Not one of my favorites but one I wouldn't mix watching again.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Started watching this television series from season 1. It is a fantastic series with a very interesting and, at least to me, unique style of script writing. If you start watching Supernatural from the first season you sill notice how seamlessly story lines are weaved into episodes throughout the seasons. The last couple of seasons seem to follow a pattern set by most long running television series in that it is starting to deviate from the strong scripting that made this series from a darker more supernatural mystery series to a more lighter cartoonish style. I hope there is more juice in the tank so that the writers can take the storylines back to the original style. Then hopefully this series can live on for several more year otherwise it will probably not be renewed after next year.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Awesome game, hours and hours of fun free golf. Challenging courses, great challenges, multiple ball options. Cant wait for part two.
B005I3PAUO|4.0|Great story. Baldacci's ability to construct a complex plot and marry it to an enthralling storyline that draws you in is showcased in this book. Once you take it up it's hard to put down.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This Belkin (read: quality cases) case for the Kindle Paperwhite does just what I had hoped it would-- provide a  nice fit and a safe harbor for the niftiest of all the Kindles.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|After what seemed like an eternity of teasers, clips and loads of fake leaks, the song is finally out!<br /><br />In my opinion it was worth the wait. I can't stop listening to this song! Pharell was a great choice for vocals, his voice perfectly blends with the track, which even as an instrumental would be amazing. It's definitely NOT Discovery, so if you're expecting that you may be dissapointed.<br /><br />Since this is the radio edit i'm positive the album version will be even better. It only reinforces my desire to buy this album the instant it's released.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|This is the last of the Star Trek series for me and I like it because, like Star Trek Voyager, it follows a similar formula to the original Star Trek.  Which is exploration and discovery.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|this game is great because I always wanna check in on my dinosaurs. unfortunately it costs a ton of dino bucks and coins to buy decorations, expand land, and dinosaurs. I recommend it because its fun to learn about new dinosaurs.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the single greatest app for alternative keyboards.  Perfect  and efficient.  Love it. I reccomend to all android users.
B009J2VQSK|3.0|Liked it, but without the movie to back up the music, it is lacking in its appeal with many of the songs.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|It's nice to buy an album and listen to the whole thing again!  The videos are great too!  Good Job, Joe!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It is a truly inspiring story of how two \\"enemies\\" can become the best of friends. A true meaning to keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is a great series. I watch it with my 16 year old son and we are addicted to the series!
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Watching this movie brought back so many old memories.  I love the way Yentl is portrayed in this movie  The acting was pretty good for an older movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching it again!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was held captivated by sky and holders love story!  How interesting how the pieces all fell together till the end.  Sad but sadly the truth of young victims of sexual abuse by their supposed protectors called parents! But it hurt worse to find out that Leslie probably killed herself because of the abuse.  I seriously admire Holder for his maturity and his view on the people he loves HopeLES!
B004MPESSY|3.0|This is not as good as the 1st movie I only rented it to see if it was worth purchasing and I decided not to
B00338QENI|1.0|Author seemed to want to self congratulate herself throughout the book.  You can read everything about what happened to the Lacks' family on the net in about ten minutes.  The facts present a serious medical ethics issue and are of great importance today.  The problem is nothing new has been presented here and it really rambles.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I waited for years and years and years for this book. It was not worth it.<br /><br />I want to start off by saying that George RR Martin is a master author. He does a classically solid job of putting together a tangled web of insanity that is Westeros/the world. I have no objection in that regard; that's why I read his books.<br /><br />However, the problem is that it's not even as good as his first book in this series. My favorite part was definitely Arya, because I want her to come back and take over Westeros. I hope that GRRM doesn't kill her, because he has a habit of killing the nice characters with whom you sympathize.<br /><br />My second favorite bit, behind Arya, was the way that Kevan Lannister ALMOST saved the kingdom. It was very much in line with what GRR Martin said about a good man not being a good King and how Jimmy Carter was the best man but possibly the worst president in his lifetime (look up GRRM on the Youtube channel Authors@Google).<br /><br />The book wasn't worth the time that I spent reading about all the other characters, though. If it had been worth 6 years of waiting, it would have been mind-blowingly phenomenal. Instead, it was just ok and a simple continuation of the story. Disappointing.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Dragged on.  Couldn't care about either character.<br />They deserve each other.  Read it for book club.  Several other members felt the same way
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Michael Lewis is a stellar author. I hate statistics, but I loved this book. It's very surprising, but this is the only book that I've read that doesn't make statistics into a sad lullaby. Lewis does his normal excellent job of finding the people and the human interest inside of a bigger story. This is a book about focusing on data and using it in the sports world.<br /><br />If you've ever heard of Wayne Winston, this book explains a lot. Winston should write his own book, but that's for another day. Winston is one of the guys who helped develop Microsoft Excel and he worked for/with Mark Cuban to develop his basketball team, the Mavs. He teaches sports statistics at Kelley in Indiana and Lewis' book really helped me understand what Winston does.
B001U887LK|4.0|I thought these would fit better as my other pair is a size larger and are alittle too big.These should have fit better but seem alittle tight.They might stretch after a while so no bad review here.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|If you've read and enjoyed Dan Pink's [[ASIN:1594487154 To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others]], then you'll like this book. It sorta takes the same kind of approach and some of the same studies, but it puts it in another context. Dr. Adam Grant is a Wharton professor who is not at all like what I expect a business professor to be. He gives generously (time and effort) and he shows how giving is a good thing.<br /><br />The coolest part of the book was when I learned the truth about Frank LLoyd Wright. I used to identify as a libertarian and of course FLW is the basis for Howard Roark in [[ASIN:0452273331 The Fountainhead]] by Ayn Rand. Dr. Grant blows the idea of geniuses being on an island up, because he shows how FLW only was productive when he had help. It was a two-way relationship, to be sure, because FLW was a true architectural genius - but his apprentices were necessary for his work.<br /><br />You may also see that the best networked person in the world is a reviewer of this book: Adam Rifkin. If you want to know more about how he got there, you should definitely read the Adam Rifkin section at the very least. If you've read [[ASIN:0385346654 Never Eat Alone, Expanded and Updated: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time]] by Keith Ferrazzi, you'd think that Keith might be the best networked person in the world. I certainly thought that Keith was close. But Adam Rifkin is obviously the best one. If you want to see proof, there's an infographic showing his connections - just read the FORTUNE piece on him by Jessica Shambora.<br /><br />In school, I took an extensive negotiation course with a labor negotiator/mediator/arbitrator who had 30+ years of experience. I can say quite confidently that you would get the most important bits of that class if you read this book. Just because negotiation and organizational behavior use different words for the same things, you may not think that they are the same. If you want to understand how to be successful and be the anti-Ken Lay (or Jeff Skilling, as Clay Christensen talks about in How Will You Measure Your Life?), then you should definitely read this book.l and be the anti-Ken Lay (or Jeff Skilling, as Clay Christensen talks about in How Will You Measure Your Life?), then you should definitely read this book.
B0000D8HDF|5.0|I probably started listening to classical music in the late 1940's thanks to all the snippets of classical music used as theme music on radio shows. Over the years I've had hundreds and hundreds of classical records and gone to symphonies, but nowhere along this musical path had I ever heard of or actually heard Liszt's transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies. Early this year the Eugene, OR classical music station played the transcription of the 5th Symphony. Wow! The playing was exciting and true to the orchestral structure as far as I knew. Amazon has several versions of the works, mostly individual pieces. Mr. Katsaris' is the only collection of \\"all\\" the transcriptions.  Unless I did not get one of the disks, my set only included 3,4,5,6,7, & 9. I am not a musician so I can't comment on the technical aspects of the playing, but as a music lover, I found the playing exciting and actually helpful in appreciating the orchestral flow of the music. I recommend these recordings enthusiastically.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I can't wait to get the next book, I had a hard time putting this book down. Deborah Harkness is a very good storyteller. I really enjoy time travel books and will dive into the next book too.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I'm not doing a bookish review here. Just to let prospective readers know I loved this book, and grinned, snorted, chuckled, and laughed out loud a lot while reading. It's funny, and I have recommended it to many people. We all need a laugh. Laughing is good for us - it's like really quick yoga/meditation.<br /><br />I'm married to someone like this, who's so adorable and loved by me and his many friends. I guess that's what made me laugh. It was laughter borne of recognition of someone we know and love.<br /><br />The hint of autism is not really needed. All of us human beings fit somewhere on a sliding scale where a definition like 'normal' is not relevent, and doesn't actually exist.
0786182466|3.0|A good story for those familiar with New Orleans and south Louisiana culture. A bit too much of a farce for me but still worth listening too.

B0064MGU98|5.0|Outstanding actors and a well-written series.  I couldn't stop watching if I wanted to.  Entertaining and educational.  Finishing up Season 3 at this point.  Am I hooked or what?
030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl, written by Gillian Flynn, is a page turning thriller about the mysterious disappearance of Amy Elliott.  Amy Elliott and Nick Dunne had been married for five years the day she went missing.  The story is told by both Nick and Amy, going back and forth from the day they first met to the tragedy of the day she went missing.  This book has many twists to it when identifying what happened to Amy.<br /><br />Amy, coming from a fast paced life in New York City, now must adjust to their new life in Nick's hometown in Missouri. Since both Amy and Nick lost their jobs and Nick's father has been sick for a long time they needed to make a change. Their change, however, takes a toll on their relationship.<br /><br />The story is told going back and forth between Nick and Amy's description of their marriage.  Determining who is telling the truth and who is lying makes the book hard to put down.  Although I was expecting a different ending, I would still recommend this book to others. Gillian Flynn did a great job keeping my intrigued in the book and I am interested in reading other books she has written.
B00BIK3FAI|1.0|what is this about its not based on a movie so what the heck is it based on I mean come on I wouldn't. spend 2 bucks and 60 cents on this crap it make ls no sents. its just BULL
B0082RX1P4|5.0|I bought this book to use for a research paper I was writing about Zappos. I learned a lot I didn't know about the company.<br /><br />This book is about CEO Tony Hsieh's experiences before Zappos and his journey from advising and investing in the company to working full-time for it to becoming CEO.<br /><br />I really liked how easy this book was to read; very casual writing style. I also really enjoyed the company e-mails that were included within the book; they really gave an insight to how Hsieh communicates with his company and maintains his company culture.<br /><br />You get a lot of behind the scenes Zappos information you can't get in an article or short video interview.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire to awake my teen...so many features and never force closes.....I totally recommend it! Five stars across the board!
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Floating island concept is meaning less<br />screenplay is good overall..<br />flying fish scene is good.<br />more of documentary type movie, but overall we can watch once.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|It's amazing to me how they keep this story line going and going getting better and better and better! One amazing shock after another! It's fun, scarey, sad and unbelievable. Can't wait for the last 6 episodes coming soon.
0263899403|1.0|You know a book is boring when it takes you two days to reread the same three chapters and you still don't remember what you just read.  I got to 20% and called it quits for good.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|Dollar for dollar, this is probably the best case on the market. Yeah, there are better ones out there but you will pay an absolute minimum of double the price to get anything even a little bit better.

B00BP4WAZS|5.0|a movie a parent can enjoy with their kids and be a kid too!  my kids watched this over and over!
B0096MM9GG|2.0|Why?<br />The game is a really good one and the feeling of the classic remains with shiny graphics<br />As other mentions the problem is with the controls is stiff when moving around<br />In app purchases are a bad idea that and the controls are why I give it 2 stars<br />Fix those and I will rate again
B009NPA3Q4|1.0|Phillips got incredibly lucky when he was handed Greg Holden's \\"Home\\" by the American Idol producers, even though Phillips himself is quoted saying he really didn't care for the song, and would never have put it on the album if he didn't have to.<br /><br />Take away \\"Home\\", (which Phillips sang a poor karaoke version of the original by Holden), and this freshman attempt at trying to make a professional album with his limited amateur talent and songwriting falls flat.  All songs sound like a continuation of the song before them, which turned the album into one solid non-stop poor attempt at a Dave Matthews impersonation.  The vocals are unimpressive, limited, cliche` and again best described as amateur.<br /><br />This CD belongs where Phillips belongs - on a stool at the corner coffeeshop on Saturday nights, playing for tips.  Once 'Home' wears off, Phillips will end up a very lucky 1-hit wonder and go the way of his predecessor Lee Dewyze - into the junk bin of American Idol embarrassments.
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|Considering the amount of money it costs us to go to a decent theater with recliner like seats and watch this movie, (which we don't do anymore) it was well worth $9 to watch it in the comfort and safety of our own home. I have a 42&#34; LCD Visio for just that reason.<br />We both like Aaron Eckhart's work, and this was up to his previous standards at least. The writing was well done, but there was a problem with the sound. And I know it's in the film not Amazon Instant Video. Some &#34;background&#34; sounds and music made it hard to hear dialog.<br />Worth $9 to see before release...YES.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very well made and acted series #2 of the Good Wife.  All the characters were believable and likeable.  The action in the series was exciting and I really wanted to get to the next story to find out what was going to happen.  I wish Amazon Prime would offer more of the Good Wife series,  so the story can just keep getting better and more enjoyable to watch.
0525953728|5.0|I am not  a big fan of reading, but I could not put this book down.  After the backlash from the Navy for this book I think they have nothing to worry about. Mark took the proper steps not only to protect his identity, which did not wok, but went above and beyond to protect his brothers and national security. Through the reading it is clear that he is not looking to be a hero, but more to tell his story. Without giving to much away not only is this a firsthand account of Bin Laden, but it shows how hard it is to be a SEAL and try and live a normal life.  The book tells how he grew up and how he just happened to be at the right place at the right time. It is a great book and proceeds go to a great cause.  God bless the SEALs
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is very fun, I love it. Very fair price. Much more better than the older version. It's twice the fun, now instead of feeding one frog you feed two. Ten stars if I could.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use this for work for notes and screen captures. Really love the automatic cross device sync, as I use it on my Kindle Fire, work laptop, and Android phone.
B000FA675C|4.0|I liked this book and I recommend it to others. But i liked the first book, Angels and Demons, better.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Ugh!  I wish I could like this app, but I don't.  It's truly terrible.  It's nearly impossible to accomplish anything in the game - like the initial task of setting up a windmill.  I play on a Samsung Galaxy S3 and a Kindle Fire.  It's also difficult to exit the game.  I'm seriously considering deleting the app from my devices.  My daughters, who adore MLP: FIM, never play it.
B009IF82SK|5.0|Big Bang continues to make me laugh with every episode. I highly recommend it. It is interesting to see Sheldon's relationship progress.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a stunning app and fun to play.  The only downside is that some of the levels induce motion sickness, for me at least.  I thought our 7 and 4 year olds would enjoy it, but ultimately my spouse and I are the ones who play it most often.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I really like this movie with David Bowie, saw it along time ago, and it just as cute now as it was when I first saw it . Fun movie to watch with the little ones.<br />Thank you
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I use this app all the time and is an absolute must have if you make any purchases on Amazon.com.  I use this all the time on my Android tablet and now I use the iPhone version with my new phone.
B000000WF0|5.0|I really like this cd. I first thought it was the Rolling Stones, but found the it was a group called the Verve. I'm glad I finally found it.<br />Thank You
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It was a hard book to read but at the same time it was hard to put down. There were times when I was so anxious to see what happened that I had to keep reading. I had many different emotions while reading ROOM. Well written!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had to get caught up on the first two seasons because Season 3 was coming up. I enjoyed them immensely! Quality of DVD is excellent and I enjoy the series so much!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|For anyone who likes documentaries, this is one of the best!  The product is native HD from start to finish, so this is great for HD widescreen TVs.  And the footage in the series is excellent as well.  I highly recommend this.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|My husband love horror movies and collects them.  He has wanted this movie for awhile.  He was very excited to get this for Xmas. We had seen this together as one of our first movies...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game requires quick thought and reflexes.  The graphics are good and the game moves along at a good pace.  There are goals to reach and rewards  are awarded.  I  would recommend it.

B0058S0OMS|5.0|My husband love horror movies and collects them.  He has wanted this movie for awhile.  He was very excited to get this for Xmas. I dont thinkI can watch it though;)
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Story was very confusing for the longest time. Stick with it; you will eventually get answers. It took a bit before it really pulled me in. I think this was due to the author's paragraphing style with so many one sentence paragraphs, sometimes 8 or 9 in a row. This interrupted the flow of the story, making for a choppy read. The mystery kept me reading, and I ended up really liking it. Reminded me a little of the TV show X-Files.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|This was a Xmas present for my husband and he palys it all the time:)  The video online is great too...
B0018AO8TA|5.0|This was my first dead album,  I played this Nazz and Quick Sliver Messenger Service all of the time!  This album is still a favorite for my daughter and myself

B005BDZQKU|5.0|a good movie in a good bluray box with german language. Thumbs up, I love this thing. Buy it and enjoy
B000ICRKLM|3.0|As commander of the Stargate, Higgenson..TORI to me...is my main attraction. I'm compelled to be in awe of her beauty, so I love it when she appears. The plot and supporting characters are just tolerable enough so as not to tarnish her presence
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Able to keep notes on everything. Very easy to use. Like the fact you can make separate books for each subject.
B000003TA4|3.0|I know why Dave Grohl, and everyone else involved with this album, were so surprised at its success.  It's truly an average album with a couple of good songs on it.  The famous studio it was recorded in delivered a decent, yet not exceptional, recording.  If you're looking for something magical here, good luck.  I didn't find it, twenty years ago, or today.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Much used I know, but this really is a&#34; sweeping family saga&#34;, Mr Follet has writen, an absolute winner. if you have an interest in world history, this is for you.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This book is a good history but it really has no relation to the pillars ofnthenearth except for it happening in the same city. I liked it though.
B008VBYN80|4.0|fine<br />I liked it good the game gave me feels and I had much fun controls buggy four more words done
B00370J7E0|4.0|After rumours the group has created an album just as compelling although it works better as a unified work rather then a series of hit singles. That said it stands nearly equal to rumours
B00192KCQ0|5.0|best band ever, highly recommend for any metallica fan or someone who is just starting to get into metal music(thrash metal), or just all around loves all types of metal music. awesome band awesome cd. Metallica sets the mood too for any situation
B00881VLCE|5.0|The best puzzle app I found for free.  Have downloaded a few extra puzzle sets as t hey have an awesome choice.  The way to do a puzzle without losing any pieces or straining for back.
B001CISHU4|5.0|great album for anyone that loves metal music. more of a viking music kind of band. they kick ass. highly recommend this cd!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is the story of one of few escapees from a North Korean prison camp, where the harsh conditions rival that of the Soviet gulags. The book says a lot about one of this era's greatest human rights atrocities, and even more about the human spirit.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|couldve been alot better, the movie was of course action packed but it got boring quick. they couldve done so much better for a resident evil movie.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|The costumes, acting, scenery are all excellent. Although it follows the life of Henry VIII, not sure how much of it is true. But it is a really good series, especially if you enjoy shows like Game of Thrones or Pillars of the Earth.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|this movie was alright it wasnt great, it was a bit creepy but not much but it was just wayyyy more disturbing/messed up. its an okay movie for if you dont know what else to watch
B0025WX2YW|5.0|As you become more familiar with the characters and what is happening, this series just keeps getting better! The costumes and scenry are excellent and the acting is great.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|highly recommend, action packed, funny, great acting. recommend for anyone that loves action movies. this is a must see movie
B0076DCT2G|4.0|As always in DeMille's writing, he describes the surrounding area and just enough background Information to keep one interested to the end.  Patiently waiting for the next release.
B007X15GRQ|4.0|not a bad movie at all, one of the more better movies that star Mark Wahlberg. i do recommend this movie
B0094BB4TW|2.0|It very seldom runs properly.  The apps in Facebook that I use on my computer and my iphone will not run on my Kindle Fire.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I do like the second version I just hope they do more with this series and let us be zombies in the second version too
0375703764|4.0|This has been one of the most difficult reads I've encountered in my twenty-some years as an avid reader. It is also one of the most creative, thought provoking, horror novels I've ever read. If someone knows of another avant garde piece of contemporary fiction as peculiar as this, please let me know. My brain could definitely use another workout like that.<br /><br />The story is really two stories mashed up into one thesis-esque documentary. One story being the thesis on a fictional Navidson Record, researched and written by a recently deceased old man known as Zampano. The other story is that of Johnny Truent. He is the man that discovered Zampano's writings, and has begun to put them together in a book.<br /><br />The main story, the Navidson Record, is about a never ending hallway in the Navidson family's new house in Virginia. One day, after returning from a family funeral, the Navidson's return to their home to find a door that was never there before. Photojournalist, Will Navidson, begins taking measurements of the house and finds that impossibly the inside of the house is about 1/4\\" larger on the inside than the outside. An ensuing obsession begins for will. As the obsession grows and he bring more people to help research the anomaly, the hallway begins to grow infinitely.<br /><br />Navidson's long time partner and mother to his children, Karen Green, is repulsed by this mysterious hallway and makes Navidson promise not to enter it. This promise goes against the instincts of the adventurous photojournalist, who has made a living traveling the world and putting himself in harms way. This begins a serious fracture in the relationship of the couple.<br /><br />Read more at: [...]
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I liked it until I knew they would get back together again and then I found it disappointing as I really did not like the character of the female in the story.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love following my NASCAR folks and UNC basketball people for my updates.  Love that everything is so short and doesn't take forever to read.  Also really appreciate getting news updates that I wouldn't get as quickly through other media sources.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I loved playing this game! Played the levels over and over! Not as easy as it looks. Wish there were more games like this or at least more levels! Would buy it for sure.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Full of surprises! Characters are interesting and deliver plenty if suspense. I would recommend to anyone who wants a book they can't put down.
B00BCX2F66|3.0|This case looks beautiful. It's sleek black, with a red faux-suede interior. The case fits the phone well and snaps to the back of the phone easily. The flip feature works nicely, as you can prop up the phone and watch videos hands-free. I do have a couple of complaints though. The front part of the case that covers the screen initially closes right on top of the phone. But I've been using for only 2 days and now since I've opened and closed the cover several times, the front flap no longer rests right on top of the phone right away. I thinks it's too lightweight of a material. I'm not sure how the similar cases for the Galaxy or iPhone are, but I would think they could insert some small weights into the edges so that the flap closes snugly each time. Also, at the point where the case bends for the flip feature, creases have started to appear. I think the core of the case if probably made of cardboard, and I'm concerned that if I use the flip enough, it may eventually tear. There are also noticeable gaps between the plastic top and bottom of the case that snaps onto the phone and the rest of the panels. I have noticed some dirt can get in there, and I worry this would cause scratches on the phone. I have to make a habit out of taking the case off every few days and removing any debris from the interior of the case to prevent this. Overall, the case looks nice and is lightweight, but I think it should be better constructed for the price, and especially for being an OEM HTC product.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful book. One for your must read lists. Nicolas Sparks out did himsef in this one. Can't wait to see the movie now.
B008V8FVTI|1.0|Really tired of sick movies that show children being sexually abused! Gross! We cut it off before it was over. I was very disappointed that the movie took that turn. I think that movies of this nature exploit victims of sexual abuse and are disgusting to watch!
B0084BMUFA|3.0|Fun book for kids to learn how to give love. I'd enjoy read it with them before going to bed.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|I've owned Casablanca on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-Ray. This is, without a doubt, the best that this film has ever looked. The blacks are dark and deep, the cigarette smoke threatens to roll right off the screen, Bogie and Bergman have never looked better. I won't insult your intelligence (or your taste) by reviewing the film itself. It's a timeless classic and everyone should experience it at least once. I know some of you are nodding your heads in agreement.<br /><br />The set itself is sturdy and robust. It includes a wonderful book, a set of coasters (that a drop of condensation will never touch in my home), and a series of small reproductions of the film's posters. All of it is informative and compelling. The entire set is an example of quality materials and manufacturing. The real question is, why isn't it in your cart?
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Foo Fighters, Stevie Nicks, Queens of the Stone Age, Lee Ving, Trent Reznor, and Paul McCartney. What more do you need to know?
030758836X|5.0|Love that it was written in first person.<br />Short chapters<br />Each chapter a surprise which meant I could not wait to read the next chapter,<br />Great read....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me feel so many different emotions...I would say this is a must read book...you will love it....I would not stear you wrong....make sure you have the time to read though because you wont be able to set it down till the last page is read.....
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|My kids and I love to play this game!  My son especially loves to play this game with me!  Awesome!
B008393Q2O|4.0|The times I've used it I've liked it.  If I change my opinion I'll come back and change the rating.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It's a really good book. I loved it. It took some really unexpected turns too. I didn't expect Jace to be Clary's brother.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|As it was free it is a great deal!  The polished look does standout over a lot of the other free ones and seem more factual too!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Umm it was ok it wasn't that good thoughts another one .sorry<br /><br />Make another one make it more of an Greg's log gets better like he has a girlfriend but she cheated on him
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was a book that I could not put down.  My family was luky they were fed while I was reading it.  It carries you away to become part of the story.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I like this game it has everything a story many characters. It is full of adventures and challenges. You can play anywhere and each game is not too long.
B0097S0TM0|4.0|Not bad at all. Purchased for my wife to run with, for a half marathon.  I have listed to it while driving to work all week long.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is the heart of \\"American History\\" at its finest weaved into a book that should be a movie. Where are you directors looking to when you get inspired? It certainly isn't James Rollins. Yet it should be. It appealed to me and I don't normally like these types of books.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|I found the first book quite entertaining, but got a bit tired of the sex and orgasms on every page by the time I got to this one.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Enjoyable and a terrific ending but he's done better. Interesting that this time he's written in the voice of a woman.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|The accuracy is questionable they didn't mention that Virginia and seven states seceded because he refused to surrender Fort Sumter probably causing the war.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|This app gives you an overview of what's going on in the world. Lots of info on lots of different subjects. Nanoo
B000FA675C|5.0|This was a great book and a fast read.  I finished it in 2 days.  Even though I had seen the movie I really enjoyed the book more than it.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Very powerful beats, with some nice lyrics and melodies, that for the most part, keep it light and positive. I like to use this as good cruising music on a sunny day.
