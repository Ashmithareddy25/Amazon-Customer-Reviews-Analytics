B0041KVW2K|5.0|The music never gets old. The 13 vinyl record albums showcase the music the way it was meant to be presented without all the watered down instrumentals and mix 'n match compilations originally released in the United States. Prior to Sgt. Pepper, the U.S. record albums were quite different from their Brittish counterparts, with many great songs omitted. The 252-page hardcover book included with the set contains many of the best pictures ever taken of the fab four, in both color and black & white. It is a trip down memory lane with all kinds of great information on the making of each album, accurately depicting the mindset of the band and society at the time of each undertaking. The set is a must for Beatles collectors and avid fans with a good turntable.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|An intriguing plot following the lives of a 7-year old Irish girl enslaved in America on a Virginia plantation during the late-17th century.  It follows the life of Lavinia, living with and treated like the Black slaves on the plantation.<br /><br />While the characters are well developed and varied, and a plot that moves quickly, I gave this 4-stars due to the lack of detail of the dialect of the slaves.  If you overlook this, you'll get wrapped up in a fascinating story with several sub-plots, all of which are believable.  Among the interweaved story lines is the division of classes among the slaves, their closeness of their community on the plantation, the injustices they endure, and the principles they live by set against the dysfunctional family living in &#34;the big house&#34;.<br /><br />The book is told from two points of view:  Lavinia's, from her arrival to the plantation at age seven through her mid-20s as well as Belle's, a bi-racial slave whose mistaken relationship with the plantation owner (the Captain), is a continual influence on her and other's lives.<br /><br />This book examines race, class and society as well as interpersonal relationships, family and community, physical and emotional property, faith, morals, marriage and love.  Although under a different laws and centuries later, the themes and situations throughout this book is as relevant today as in the past.<br /><br />The reader is transported to a different time and structure in America but the characters and voices are alive and relevant to present day.

B000N0WCLC|4.0|I won't get into a summary of the plot, my opinions on the acting or its significance to the real world.  That has been covered many times by other reviewers.  I just focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />I don't have the Standard Definition DVD so this is not a comparison.  The video transfer appears quite clean with a very warm coloration, no artifacts or aliasing to be seen.  There is little to no grain that is noticeable and there are plenty of details in the dark and shadow areas.  Since I have not seen the SD DVD, I cannot make a comparison between the two but I am sure that there is some upgrading with the  Blu Ray version though I doubt there would be a night and day difference.  On the negative side, I noticed that the bit rate was low and, for the first hour at least, varied between 8 and 20mbps.  That's pretty low for a Blu Ray transfer but the imaging did not appear to suffer.<br /><br />The audio defaults to DD 5.1 so be sure to go to the audio menu and choose the PCM 5.1 which is lossless.  The audio levels are all proper without any roller coster effect to the volume.  For the first 45 minutes of the film, almost all the audio is on the front stage without any real use of the sub or rear stage.  However, with the first firefight and thereafter, there are plenty of opportunities for discreet use of the rear and side channels and the uncompressed audio does make use of them.  Your LFE channel will also be frequently brought into play.  For the most part, the rear channels are used for ambience but when used discreetly, they really add to the film.<br /><br />There are more extras than I can list here and all appear worthy of watching over a long period of time.  There really are many.  Thankfully, there are no preview ads for other movies.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksof some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B001OQCV6K|5.0|We own both movies, and watch them on a regular basis. Very good movie, and the fact that it comes with a digital copy is awesome as well.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I loved this movie! I think what made it so good was the actors themselves..everyone of them was perfect. Not to blow the ending but the little boy was so intense..amazing.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Visually stunning movie, despite what critics call a &#34;jaded&#34; storyline. The visuals and action more than make up for any perceived overused story.  The packaging is attractive, and the extras are great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is addictive,alot like Tetris.It challenges you even with it's simplicity.Fun for ages(8 & up).Find myself playing this for a long time.
B007FEGH7Y|5.0|THIS.ALBUM.IS.INCREDIBLE.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to hear, on a lark, \\"Full Circle\\", and had to check these guys out.  I'm soooo glad I did!<br /><br />If I had to describe Half Moon Run's sound, I'd say they are a fusion of Fleet Foxes (esp. \\"Helplessness Blues\\"-style), Neil Young, The Eagles, Fun., Iron & Wine==even some Supertramp!--with some definite surprises here and there. I love that the songs don't all sound the same, as often happens with new artists.  Each is deeply unique and melodically complex, though none come off as being musically pompous or overcomposed.  Genius, really. I'm so glad I stumbled across these guys.  Can't wait for the next US tour.
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|It's fun & the graphics are cute.The only problem I found that there was is too much dialogue.Easy & fun puzzles that I think all ages will enjoy;)
B005CRQ3GQ|4.0|J'aime le style de l'auteur, cela ne m'étonne pas qu'elle eut été best-seller, au fait j'ai regardé les films et l'envie de savoir davantage m'a poussé à acheter le livre format Kindle, ma curiosité a été satisfaite. Je m'en inspire d'ailleurs de J.K. Rowling pour me lancer dans l'écriture parce qu'en outre de faire agir ses personnages, elle les fait penser, anticiper et réfléchir.

B00973DDN2|5.0|I'm not a die hard Killers fan. I have loved some of their songs and purchased them individually, but never purchased an entire album.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|says its open and ready to use but wont go past opening page cant play bummed out! !!!!!! help i wanna play
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is awesome, and I am glad that they still make the initial game cost free.  To compare, it is a lot better than the first! My only gripe is that you can't skip objectives like in the first game. In essence, what that means is you can't complete objectives randomly so you're forced to try and do the ones they give you before you can get a new objective to work on. In the first game you could look at all the objectives and pick and choose which ones to go after in whatever order you desired. Not the case with this one. Also, if you complete an objective before the game unlocks it for you, it won't count it and you have to do it again once it's unlocked.<br /><br />I just hope they've fixed the cheat that could happen on the Ipad -- just so genuine numbers can be counted. Otherwise it plays well on my Kindle Fire and on my Samsung Galaxy 3
B00735HGQ6|3.0|A good read but it was so long and a bit tiring in parts. Clever mix of characters and their insertion carries the story.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|This book in the Hunger Games Trilogy is an excellent read after the first book 'The Hunger Games'<br />and the second book, 'Catching Fire'<br />Was targeted at teenagers but is also suitable for adults of all ages.<br />It romps along with an exciting theme through all three books.<br />An easy read and a lot of times 'un-put-down-able'.

B00870ZH3U|5.0|I watched Phantom of the Opera at the royal Albert Hall and fell in love with that production. I agree with some reviewers in that Love never Dies is completely different. It's style is more gothic but the score is still very memorable. I love Ben lewis' portrayal of the phantom in this particular production. I also love Ramin Karimloo in POTO. However, I prefer Ben Lewis for Love Never Dies because the whole production is so different. He is meant to sound older, darker, more masculine. At this point in the story, he is a broken man pining for his lost love. I love his deep baritone voice and the way he is stylized is almost vampiric, like he has truly become a Coney Island freak. I think Lloyd-Weber meant for that.  His facial expression and body language were particularly moving and believable. I also loved Sierra Boggess in POTO and she is incredibly talented in other productions as well. Again, this is a wholly different production. Anna O'Byrne was a perfect Christine for this production. Andrew Lloyd Weber cast the  Lewis and O'Byrne for a reason. Their voices are very complimentary. They have such great on screen chemistry. They really knew how to act for the theatre and for the camera. One thing POTO fans can appreciate is the use of dramatic entrances and exits and the use of gas lights and smoke. There are a couple of particular scenes that come to mind. When Christine first gets off the boat, and walks into the crowd of paparazzi, the music and for and lighting make it look like she's walking out of a dream...It's beautiful. Also, the phantom's entrance prior to \\"Beneath a Moonless sky\\" is breathtaking. There are some tid bits of POTO lyrics. For example, when the phantom sees Christine get off the boat, he sings,\\" I am your angel of music, come to me angel of music.\\"<br /><br />About the camera...I understand that they wanted a really dramatic look. They intended for it to look more like a movie, less like a theatrical show. I wish they would have zoomed out more and shown the scene changes. It seemed like there was too little time between each song to really let the songs sink in. Still, the sets, costumes, score, and performances were phenomenal. Just wish I could see it live! Definitely worth the purchase.d out more and shown the scene changes. It seemed like there was too little time between each song to really let the songs sink in.

6304696515|5.0|Two wealthy, idle aristrocrats plot to seduce and destroy innocent people for amusement and revenge in this brilliant 1988 movie. The production is sumptious. The acting is compelling, and the story is tight and moves with the speed of a snake strike. The wealthy degenerates are so charming in their dialogue and glamorous in their finery that the viewer at first almost sides with them in enjoying their mischief. However, creator Pierre Choderlos De Laclos was a moralist and critic of the immorality of his time.<br /><br />France in the 18th Century was becoming more politically unstable because of the income desparity between the classes, and the insensitivity of the ruling royalty. The rich felt themselves superior to everyone else. The high born characters in De Laclo's tale are all upper class, but either ruthless and selfish or naive,innocent or hypocritical victims. Hence, the French Revolution in 1889, when Royalty literally lost it's head.<br /><br />There are parallels to the go go 1980s when military spending was increased,the rich were favored in government as never before, while aid to the poor was decreased, homelessness increased and the income gap between the classes was widened as never before. No one actually said, \\"Let them eat cake\\" either in the 1700s (Marie Antoinette was framed) or in the 1980s, but the ruling policies certainly gave this attitude. One can almost picture Valmont or Merteuil stating the 47% remark that Mitt Romney so infamously espoused in that little youtube clip during the 2012 election campaign.<br /><br />To watch Dangerous Liaisons in the 2010s is to experience what our current government debate is: favoring the highest 1 percent over the majority of lower income wage earners and those unable to find jobs, or disabled. In the film the 1% wins in that Valmont and Merteuil achieve their goal, but at a terrible price to their own society.<br /><br />The story was filmed once before and several times after scriptwriter Christopher Hampton/ director Stephen Freers' version, but only the South Korean 2003 Untold Scandal by E-J Young rivals 1988's Dangerous Liaisons in style and substance.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I enjoyed the book. I recommend this book to whomever wants to know about the inside of an professional kitchen.
B0047VLFS4|3.0|A fair depiction of events that occured.  The movie was able to capture the atmosphere and intricate movie sets for the time period.  Very good acting by the cast all around.  Although the depiction of Hypatia was good, I would like to have had the movie touch more on her accomplishments, but it did capture the spirit of her character.  The scene with Orestus and the christian bishop who was her student (forget his name) at the end, before she was killed by a mob, was powerful, and demonstrated that salvation is not found in faith but knowledge.  Her grounded personality continually questioned her environment and others, stood in stark contrast to her former student who was not allowed to question his faith, and was bound to follow what he was told, no matter who was killed or the destruction followed.

B00005MK9Y|5.0|I had the 2-album set in the 70s, then got them on cassettes when we got cassette players for our cars, then graduated to CDs so I still had them for my cars, and this has always been the best of all Marley that I have and the one I still listen to every single week.  I  just wish this live concert had been recorded for DVDs.  I would be in heaven to see \\"Babylon by Bus\\" put on DVD!  I love all the cds I have and the movie dvd and watch it over again, but nothing would make me happier than to have this particular CD set/concert put on DVD.  They must not have recorded video when this was done, and boy, what a shame!!!  I would be the first to order several copies!!!

Then some Mexican narcotraficante in US custody escapes, in an elaborately planned and staged scheme, and is headed for Arnold's town. You can pretty much figure what happens after that.<br /><br />There are great chase scenes, sneering bad guys with a seemingly endless supply of expendable spear-carriers, and shoot-outs with everything up to rocket launchers. The characters are amusing, and Arnold gets a few good lines (including something like \\"It's people like you that give immigrants a bad name\\").<br /><br />Good commodity entertainment, but otherwise mostly forgettable.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0765325950|5.0|Let me begin by stating that i have read every book leading up to this one at least twice, and have been looking forward to this one for years.<br />For Fans, the end has come. This book is everything I could have wanted to end the series, and while i got the feeling that there was some content withheld, it was gripping from cover to cover. Brandon Sanderson did a great job of completing Jordan's Masterpiece. I will read this book many, many more times in the future, and recommend the series exponentially more.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|There's no problems I ever experience with Temple Run 2 on the Kindle Fire during gameplay. I can set it to the highest of quality and it will still run very smooth. However after a few hours of playing it will begin to crash on me while playing. Eventually I will try to open the app and it begins to crash at opening every single time. This is my third time re-installing. Would absolutely appreciate if I didn't have to.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|The more I listen to this album the more I love it.  I am loving the fact that I'm getting a great mix of their heavy metal style, mixed with some of their darker, more meaningful lyrics.  It's not like any of their albums before but more of a compilation of previous albums and styles.

B005K0HDGE|1.0|I can say that I've read most every other book he's published.  None of them are as drawn out and dull to read as this one.  What took 800 pages should have really been about 400, there was much time spent developing the love story that in the end, had no real impact, it just felt like \\"filler\\".

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read all the books by Nelson DeMille, so I was eagerly anticipating reading &#34;The Panther&#34;.  To me, this was by far the weakest of any of his novels.  Entertaining, but not any depth.  It seemed like he was trying to write a story around his one-liners.
0062200909|4.0|Love all the detail and art work used to make an awesome film, I recommend this book for the fans.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The first book was no where near as good as this one. I can't wait to read the next book
B0086213XW|4.0|The story frustrates on the certain level - the main character might just have to get a full time job to fill all the free time she has to feel sad (not to be confused with clinical depression), though I can relate (remember having pretty similar feelings in my late 20s, being in the similar relationship). There is not a hint at any kind intellectual or spiritual activity, which is strange. But the movie is nicely shot, with convincing acting by very enjoyable Michelle Williams (I am a huge fan since her Brokeback Mountain role) and both male leads. It worked for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like the game becouse its fun to have a horse you can train and groom and all that but it sometimes. takes time to load but I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I like! :)

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again, I am left on the edge of my seat, and in tears. Nicholas Sparks always knows how to keep his readers engrossed. Well done.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is great game to play on my kindle fire. very fun and I like how there's so many different levels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is my first kindle book and I just fall in love with the story! It was completely unpredictable and was perfect to entertain myself after of work. I recommend it 100%!!!
B008CJ0KBU|4.0|Born on the outside, Bo finds herself thrust into the secret world of the Fae. Her refusal to submit to millennia-old system, and her affinity for the humans whom her Fae peers disdain, put her in constant peril, but also give her insights other supernatural beings don't share. Now she has to venture into a world beyond belief, discovering herself alongside the world she never expected.<br /><br />Lost Girl, a strange Canadian import that began life in the same syndicated hinterland that gave us Star Trek: TNG. It also delves into the same urban fantasy milieu as HBO's True Blood, bringing it down to a PG-13 world more palatable for basic cable. If you like the novels of Jim Butcher or Seanan McGuire, you will surely find something familiar and enjoyable in Lost Girl.<br /><br />This show has a certain retro quality to it, reminiscent of old Doctor Who or Dark Shadows. Though its technology is more up-to-date, it's also not as current as it could be (the CGI resembles early X-Files). And like on those classic no-budget shows, the production circumstances force the creative team to create stories that never stint on the human element.<br /><br />Like those older shows, this one has to perform strange work-arounds to conceal the fact that key scenes recycle sets and have small casts. Sometimes these kludges come across pointedly, and require us to simply go along with the story. Modern TV audiences, accustomed to being led by the hand, may balk at this. But the show rewards viewers willing to make the leap.<br /><br />Not everyone will like this show. It asks you, the viewer, to participate in creating the reality in which the characters move. The characters are antiheroic, often unlikable. But these qualities give Lost Girl its edgy impact. Its refusal to kowtow to TV conventions gives it an immediacy lacking in most mass-produced programming. The future of TV fantasy looks like this.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|WARNING CANNOT SAVE BETWEEN LEVELS! so either you win the ENTIRE level or you have to start over :( major negative. wouldn't have bought it had I known. stick to the free version on your PC
B009X00E18|4.0|I must say this one had me scratching my head for a few minutes.  I was looking 'for the rest of it'.  Without the kindle in it, it looks and feels flat and oddly like it is only one piece.  Then you see that the cover is actually a folding piece that is used as the easel.  I will say that it is very easy to put your kindle in securely - and also easy to remove.  The cover folds back nicely and can be held in place by the elastic band in the back.  However, the easel is just off somehow.  It folds over and is supposed to catch in a groove on the back but it's like a balancing act to keep it in position. It is light-weight and attractive and I guess if the easel isn't all the important, then I'd say YES.  For me, though, I do use the easel function a lot and so for me, this isn't 'the one'.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you like solitaire you will like this because it is solitaire! has an undo button for cheaters (ok so I use it too) and cool card designs. ur supposed to be able to customize your background but it doesn't work for me :( maybe it will for you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have had this game for like 20 minutes and I love it. You need to get this app now.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love to draw, even tho I'm not good at it,so this is great! only problem are, no notifications that it is your turn and finding enough friends who will play with you often enough.
1476719071|5.0|This is such a great story. If you love a good bad boy with a heart, holy crap this is the book for you. Plus it is hot, hot, hot. I can't wait until Walking Disaster comes out.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it's definitely convenient and I'm pretty sure most people can navigate it, eventually. just wish I could save the pics I like like I can on the computer
B00AREIAI8|4.0|nice game. I love horses anyways, so this game is fun to take care of a horse for myself virtually.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this is just the app I was looking for!!!! cant wait to see what free. updates come up!!! :)
B007BFSYMS|4.0|If used properly the app and the adjustable settings the user should be pleasantly pleased with this application. Great by for free!
0307950654|5.0|So what did happen after Miss Elizabeth Bennet finally married Mr. Darcy and settled down at Pemberley?  Many are the writers who have attempted to answer that vital question left so tantalizingly hanging by Jane Austen, but none have done so more ably than P.D. James in Death Comes to Pemberley.  And that is only to expected, for James' ability to craft subtle mysteries with finely tuned characters places her at the apex of her craft, alongside Miss Austen herself and a very few more.<br /><br />It is six years after the events in Pride and Prejudice, and Mr. and Mrs. Darcy are happily settled at Pemberley, the parents of two small boys.  Also living with them is Darcy's young sister Georgiana.  It is a busy moment for everyone, for Lady Anne's Ball is due to be held again for the first time in several years.  Right in the middle of the preparations Elizabeth's flighty sister Lydia Wickham arrives in hysterics, screaming that her husband has been murdered.  During the ensuing turmoil we meet or become reacquainted with a host of characters, including Elizabeth's sister Jane with her husband Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy ably assists with the investigation, and we are treated to a fine description of the unfolding mystery and its intriguing denouement.<br /><br />P.D. James makes a sterling and highly successful effort to write in the language and cadences used by Austen.  She displays the same talent for ironic commentary and trenchant observation as Austen, and she gives her readers additional delight by putting her own fine writing skills and ability to create memorable characters to excellent use.  If by some chance you are unfamiliar with the story of Pride and Prejudice do not pass this by, for James provides a Prologue which clearly summarizes the plot of the earlier work.<br /><br />Discriminating readers who admire Austen and James (surely there are few who could love one but not the other!) will find Death Comes To Pemberley an essential part of their libraries.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I water till mid night to get this game and it was all worth it because it is way better than the first one
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Great quality materials and easy to use. I like the rotating aspect the best. Highly recommended and great value for the price.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I would recommend this app for horse lovers. This app you own a horse and you look after and care for your horse. You can also enter into competitions and play minigames too. If you are deciding weather to get this game I would get it, you always have something in the Stables.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|If you only saw the TV series (2011) based on book 1 , or if you just happen to pick up book 1 GAME OF THRONES, you might be a bit sceptic the first 2-3 chapters, but trust me, as with a lot of movies & filmed series the book is always much better and becomes addictive once the first 3 chapters are done. You get immersed in a world of Dire Wolves, Kings & Queens, diplomatic plots (trust me it's not boring politics). You get a glimpse of a world beyond a wall which only really comes to life in book 3 & 4.<br />In A Feast For Crows, book 4 in the series of 7, again the plots change, Kings and Queens reigns are shifted, honour codes are broken, far away lands where mysterious creatures live: giant mammoths, wildlings and &#34;Others&#34; get featured chapters, whilst the main characters find themselves in much different situations then before, a very realistic and still fantasy driven story. The beauty of these books is that every chapter is written from another person's perspective, now in book 4 you find out what might have happened in book 1 to 3 with other characters in other lands. You find out to your surprise that some characters far away from each other are crossing territory and actually meeting without knowing that they are involved in the overall story of other characters, they are linked in blood, honour and destiny. That's why I love these books, you get actively involved with all volumes at the same time. Every chapter leaves an open end and starts with a different character right after, so you need to read on to find out what the outcome is of your previous chapter...That's what makes reading Game of Thrones very addictive, in a bit of literature English giving you that look and feel of another era, wanting you to devour chapter after chapter after chapter to find out what happened with the personalities you love.<br />I'm definitely a big fan ...
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Solid art, music, and, most importantly, gameplay. If only the archers and the priests knew they are a support class and need to keep their distance from the front line, but this does not take much away from the overall experience.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is the kind of book where you fall in love with every character and draw out the book because you don't want your relationship with the characters to end.<br /><br />It's real, heartfelt, and a fun story. Plus, the sequel makes it even better!<br /><br />Perkins is witty, and creates a story that you can wish you were a part of.
B0056BBO1W|5.0|I LOVE this album!! I love Pitbull's music anyway, one of my favorite songs is Shake Senora it reminds me Beetlejuice everytime I hear it. Love it!
B005HSL626|4.0|This game works well and can be addicting.  Who would've thought chopping up fruit with your finger could capture your attention.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My six year old loves it. I play it too! Haha. She loves seeing her pets 'come to life' life in the game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If you told someone you were going to write a game where someone launches small birds from a slingshot they would conclude you were either unemployed or showing early signs of becoming a serial killer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was apprehensive, but this delivered. I couldn't put it down!! On to the next book in the series!! I can't wait!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It's a good product and runs well.  Couldn't run a lot of my applications without it.  It has some nice features running on the Kindle that I don't seem to have on my laptop.
0061120073|4.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith is a story that lingers in the minds of young adults worldwide. It is wrong, farfetched even, to say that this book is just about a girl and her life in New York City. This is a story about life at its limit and a girl that learns to grow up. Fragile threads of a seemingly dull existence and the tragedies of poor family are what holds the bindings of the book together. It is the rich past that makes it suddenly an adventure worth reading. The peace in it provides the finally perfect piece for the restless minds of people like me, who read this story. It teaches me that no matter how wrong the start, there is always a conclusion that fits incredibly well, despite the trail of sharp and cutting glass that a shattered mirror leaves behind. This is a journey spun beautifully by Betty Smith through her concise but stunning words, woven to life by her cunning twists of characters. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, a journey of life, misfortunes, and maturity, will become a towering figure that roots deep into your conscious mind.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Personally I prefer more hidden object mini games; the ability to play the varied hidden object sites from the main screen AND play a domino solitaire during the HO mini games or skip if too difficult is a generous boon from the creators.  Thank you, the game is up there with the best I've played.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I will give it a 5 but read the title it crashes and I don't like it not it a I hats it.!
0765325950|5.0|I have been waiting for the last book to be released. It started out a little rough with all the story line being explained  before chapter 1. But it has gotten better and I am actually sad that the series is over. Maybe they will turn it into a movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this was not as good as i thought it would be.  at some points the plot seems to drag.  and overall it is somewhat anticlimactic.  i was a little disappointed.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Hollywood should take notice and realize that the trash they have been turning out the past decade or so is not what people really want to see, they just don't know there is an alternative. Keep up the Good Work, Mr. Kendrick! We purchased several copies to give out at Christmas and to help spred the word about quality movies being produced outside of tinsletown.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I had trouble finishing this book.  the writing it hard to get into, the plot is not really there.  I finished it because i wanted to know what was going to finally happen in a book where almost nothing happened.  It's also quite depressing with the details of yesteryear's orphanages.  Although that might be the best part of the book - the history that you get out of it.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  I didn't think that I would love it as much as I do.  Go Robert Glasper and team!!!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  the plot is good and kept me interested.  I would read more books by this author.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I love these types of games. Only reason not giving 5 stars is this is demo version, if they offered the full version for free, most definately 5 stars (I'm not cheap, i just don't purchase ANYTHING online, no matter how &quot;secure&quot; the site is).
B007FEFLTO|5.0|this was a good book.  not quite as good as the first one, but still good.  i would recommend this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a great book! I never thought I'd like such a racy book but I did I finished it in three days now time to start the next one!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|this was a good book.  i had trouble putting it down.  a definite page turner.  with a surprise ending that i definitely didn't see coming.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|I love the Godfather series. I was glad to see the collection in blu-ray. I was expecting a higher quality than what I got. Since the movie was made before all of the new recording innovations this version seems to try to push the film image further than it was designed to go. No matter how I adjusted my TV the image was extremely light in some areas with dark drop outs in others. I prefer the original cinema format ..which reflects the directors original vision
1881273989|5.0|Loved this book.  Makes a lot of since and if you pay attention to people you'll see a difference IF you apply the logic from the book.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I was all set to review this at a 1 or 2 stars because it refused to register where I had it. Before I wrote this review, I checked it on my Kindle one more time. What do you know, it's working! Time will only tell if it will work consistently so I'm only giving it 3 stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book overall was just amazing, there's a huge plot twist that definitely could not have been predicted , there's tons of character development with not just the original characters but also the characters introduced in this book, it's worth your time to read
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The characters tore my heart to pieces, you would never believe what happen to them and yet they overcame this and found a way to love each other.  The ending will leave you speechless.  I hope the author could find a continuation to their story.  Prepare yourself mentally for this story its simply irrestible.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Really all the classic things you'd want in a heist/action movie, but so much more.  With stellar direction and editing, this story moves along fluidly and always entertains.  But goes deeper with flushed out characters and great performances by Renner, Hamm, Affleck and others, that bring them to believable life.
B00B5D32XS|3.0|Just finished watching the finale of Season 2, and all I could say was, \\"Really?!\\" I started the season hooked because the storyline seemed to draw me in. The weekly opening credits are the scariest thing of the whole season, and I thought the Asylum theme would be scarier based on that alone. What started out as exactly that, slowly turned into a version of SAW, with aliens. The first few episodes were great, but subsequent ones started to dissolve into unexplained ridiculous nonsense. The acting is superb, but some of the secondary storylines are so far fetched and unrelated (i.e. aliens) I started to get bored of the whole thing. I reserved judgement until the final episode of the season, and sadly, the finale was rushed with tidy little vignettes of what happened to each main character that was 'still standing' through the majority of the season. I will wait for Season 3, but what began as a compelling setting, storyline,characters, etc simply just got smashed together with little to no sense. I know these writers can do better, and I hope the next season will flow a bit better instead of seeming like they are trying to cram every imaginable scary scenario into the script whether it fits or not.
B007M45PMU|5.0|One of the best of the neo-folk movement happening right now in music.  Great heartfelt songs all the way through.  Definitely not your standard bubblegum pop.
B0071BY2OG|5.0|Great movie. More inside info about the racers in Moto GP. More insight as to things that happen in racing at the top level.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Wow, I never really thought bluray made a huge difference when viewing a movie, but this changed my mind.  You almost feel like you're in the world of Monsters Inc.  A classic on its own, this version will surely please anyone in the family.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Although the ending was predictable, I enjoyed the early intrigue and easy flow. I recommend it to all Grisham fans!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love it but when I tilt it it doesn't move on my kindle fire it has great obstacles but it skips
B009ZE27US|1.0|You can scan yourself 50 times and get 50 different responses, and most of them have zero to do with you.  Magic 8 Balls are more accurate.
0747582971|5.0|What can I say? Never have I read a book that has broken my heart the way this one certainly did. Certainly this book had to be inspired by the secretly recorded video of the savage public execution of a woman at Ghazi Stadium while her children watched. These execution of women seems to have been a common occurrence under the misogynistic Taliban. [...]
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Better than any of those run of the mill bubble games.  Very challenging and addictive game.  I am hooked on this game.
1451696191|5.0|This made a good gift. My daughter loved it.<br />On her recommandation I would read this if I was young.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i have not used all of the features yet but what i have done so far is great . excellent free app.
B0086700CM|4.0|I got temple run and it was awesome.Then I unlocked all the characters, power ups,and wallpapers.After I unlocked everything I didn't like it that much.Then I discovered Temple Run 2.I got it and it was better than Temple Run.The good thing is I like both of them,but Imangi Studios, LLC. here's another review.
B002NUZ93S|5.0|If you miss those crazy cool songs that remind you of the 80's this album is a must you won't be disappointed.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is awesome.My dad,my brother and I like it.I know somebody who dosen't like Phineas and Ferb,so she didn't get it.Please get.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|This is an easy to follow guide to productive work out strategies, combined with diet and nutrition. It gives very swift results in return for self-discipline. Something on dealing with common injuries that arise would have been nice to see.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played in my life. My five favorite parts on this game is the waterfall the tunnel the rope the jungle and the main menu. This game is TOTALLY AWESOME!!!
B00631VJIC|3.0|Great tunes expected, less than well mixed sounded muddied on several different systems.  Sounded better on television thats for sure.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I use to wear Seikos but for some reason I stopped.  I tried this watch and I just love it.  The date and day is quick and easy to set.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Dexter doing what Dexter does, how could it get any better than that.  Good price, great show you just can't go wrong.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Season One had me hooked.  Season Two had me creeped out: extremely disturbing storyline.  I'm still watching, but hoping for the quality of Season One versus the gruesome violence of Season Two.  How much perversion does one tv series need?  Jessica Lange still rocks as well as all the other excellent actors.  Let's work on the story.  PS: Still singing &#34;The Name Game!&#34;
B008ALAHA4|1.0|I hate having to buck this thing around but I'm left without any choice. Who wants to buy years worth of apple products? I'm getting rid of all of them for sure.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an awesome set of books can't wait to read the third. Kind of sad to think that it will be the last one.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|This was a gift for my grand daughter. It is one she really wanted, and was very happy with the DVD. It gives me great pleasure to see her react the way she did when she received it.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This should be a nice change from using a movie i have seen 100 time. 16 17 18 19 20
B004LROUNG|4.0|The story flows well from the begining.  The characters are endearing and the little guy slowly wins.  If Grisham wanted to start a series, this would be a good one!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I had friends and we had a strategy for winning but after a while I kept blacking out and didn't let me play I was mad but I am about ti jnsall it again and j hope it works
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love this! Thank you for this wonderful app ! Because of it I drift away to a sound slumber with ease :)
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Its a great story portrayed by great actors. The characters are deep and damaged but are brought together in this beautiful story about friends, love, and life.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This is a childish teenage novel and should not be recommended for adult readers. I wish I could give it back!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|many choices to choose from  lots of fun keeps grandson who is three busy in the car store or doctor offices
0385344228|2.0|Well Written - Unpredictable - Terrible Ending that leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Call me unsophisticated, but I like a happy ending! At a minimum I like having some closure.<br /><br />American's like happy endings. I think our refusal to resign ourselves to accept the unacceptable is a large part of what make the USA a great country.<br /><br />We certainly have corruption and bad acts sometimes go unpunished, but at least the wrong doers must hide in the shadows and worry they will one day be exposed and punished.
B0046H95RM|3.0|The book its quite interesting although i do not like the end of the book too much. I was thinking about another end
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Its a god album. Sounds a lot like old stuff with just enough modern mixed in. Couple of bad songs, but albums have that.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|You might expect the long layover between albums to hurt this release, but it seems to have had the opposite effect. The Whirlwind is more interesting than SMPT:e and less musically repetitive than Bridge Across Forever, making it the best of three very good albums.
B0025KVLS8|4.0|I bought this for a basket themed &#34;A Hard Day's Night&#34; It was for a benefit and it fit very well!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I lost so much sleep over this book- because I couldn't stop reading it! Another Grisham Great! I don't know how he does it. I seriously hate reading books. I never knew how it was possible that people actually read for fun. That is, until I discovered John Grisham! He is truly a brilliant  storyteller!!!!
B00005NNT1|5.0|Our children had several disney movies, but did not have this one.  I was happy that I could find it for them.  It is a great movie for children.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|buy it plz its the best game ever it is better then number 1 tile in scathe asa pop up in youtube and look at the one with the pool
B001EC3JME|2.0|I bought this holder because there was a pic of it holding a Fenix TK75 on one of the forums.  Little did I know that to make it fit you have to jam it through the wrong way.(90 deg to normal insertion). Putting it in the normal way will never work.  Way to tight.  The TK75 is maybe a bit fatter than a Mag D cell light.  I can't imagine a large Mag fitting either.  This may be OK for some of my smaller lights but saying it will fit a large diameter light is ridiculous.  Yes I realize it is supposed to be tight and you shouldn't plan on taking the light in and out all the time but I bought it solely for a large diameter flashlight.  For that purpose it is worthless.
0765325950|5.0|I love R. Jordan's work and I can be counted on reading the entire book in one sitting. I won't not even go the bathroom. I just get a cork and a trucker's buddy and I'm all set.<br /><br />The sheer drama of this story is what I love. I had an alcoholic drink one time and it left me with a feeling of hopelessness and a dizzy head. These books are the opposite. Also, when you read these books vs. having an alcoholic drink no one wants to take photos of you at your non-finest moments and post them to social networks sites.<br /><br />My nephew was so into social network sites that his mom (my awful sister) said she didnt know how to control it  and i was all like \\"are you freaking kidding me? Just take away his phone.\\" And she was all like, \\"I couldn't do that. How would he text his friends?\\"<br /><br />See my point, people? Technology can be abused.<br /><br />another wonderful R. Jordan tome.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|My favorite thing about this app is that it is able to sync my notes from my phone to my Kindle Fire to my computer. Other than that, it's just a standard, note taking app.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|Tom hardy and guy pearce create 2 classic characters.  The soundtrack puntuates the story perfectly.  Seen it 3 times and itstill gives me a rush
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Loved the suspense and the wonder as to how it word turn out. Definitely a page turner.
B004S49YVU|5.0|The Camel Club - once you start reading this series you won't stop. David Baldacci is an exceptional writer who totally engulfs you with the characters
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is more than 101 games in one game!! and the mini games are so fun u play games to unlock games!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked Dr. Alexanders scientific approach to the near death experience.  He analyzed his experience to the extreme.  Very easy reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is really cool. it seems like the horses are real and you can really interact with them. there are many different types of horses that you can purchase as well as their name, how they look, and all sorts of things. I would definitely recommend this app.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I don't have any complaints whatsoever. (But I didn't want to give it 5 stars because I don't what the future will contain) :D. But yeah, it's awesome! (:
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was not crazy about how this book ended.  But have continued to wonder if the ending is a setup for another book.  I enjoyed this enough that I would read a sequel.  Hoping the author has one in the works.

B0086700CM|4.0|It's some much better than temple run 2 and I like the football person why is there such as temple run 2.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|In true Maroon 5 style, you will have these songs stuck in your head.  This will stay in my playlist for a long time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun but one thing it is like impossible to name your horse because the name you choose has to have never been chosen. Then it's like impossible to earn coins then it is so hard to enter completions because the game says improve your horse s heath or love or our horse isn't allowed in to this competitions. But it is a fun game but it's not for everyone.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Easy read.  Easy to understand.  Practice these four agreements and change your life.  Very simple and powerful.  As easy as following the rule &#34;if you don't have anything good to say about someone don't say anything&#34;.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|you could go blind trying to play lots of ho games but not this one.  the graphics are clear and beautiful.  the story is enjoyable and leads you to the correct step without dragging you by yhe nose, didnt insult your intelligence.  puzzles are entertaining and clever.  i hope to find more games like this from these developers.  good job.

1449433251|5.0|Its Calvin and Hobbes. Its all of it. What more can you say?<br /><br />The kids love it.<br /><br />Cost is the only downside! But these are much nicer looking in the living room than all the tattered paperbacks we have floating around the house, and its the whole set.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use it everyday.  It is very easy to use and is set up very nice.  You can easily add locations and look at maps and get updates about alerts.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|Like many others, I am disappointed in the quality of these vinyl pressings.  The packaging is beautiful, the albums, faithfully re-created, really nice book, BUT, the most important thing, the music, was sacrificed for cost savings (based on another reviewer's comments).  Nearly every album has a least 2-3 songs with skips.  \\"Hey Jude\\" is virtually unlistenable.  Since I spent $349 for this set, I would have gladly spent another $50 for better quality recordings.  Sadly lacking.

B00AKEMHCA|1.0|This is not the first time I've seen a great game ruined by ridiculous and unnecessary changes. ie now you can pay for almost everything you do in the game. It's become allot like what facebook did with Farmville. If you want to advance in the game expect to pay for it. They will nickel and dime you to death. The new version of Bloons TD sucks in my opinion.<br /><br />DON'T BUY IT!!!

B001NHNG64|4.0|I am relatively new to the Jack Reacher world, and this was actually the third Reacher book I have read (I started with &#34;One Shot&#34;) because it was the one upon which the recent Tom Cruise movie was based before going back to the beginning). As many other reviewers have mentioned, I would start at the beginning before reading this one so that you get a sense of who Jack Reacher is. But once you know that, this book is highly enjoyable. As is Reacher himself, the reader is in the dark about why the events are happening for a long time, but the storyline gradually unfolds very satisfyingly with a terrific foil for Reacher (whom I kept envisioning being played by Philip Seymour Hoffman). If you like Jack Bauer, James Bond, and Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher will be a worthy addition to your heroic nomad pantheon.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great book, great information when you are a gardener!!  The entire story was interesting, heartwarming, painful and then happy.  Great book
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have never been a fantasy reader, but this one grabs hold of you from the beginning and won't let go! I have now read the whole series and cannot wait for the next book! Full of emotions that contrast and the typical hero always wins plot is banished so if you don't like that it might not be for you. This will be one that I read again and again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a excellent read and the suspence kept you going. I read the book before seeing the movie and I enjoyed them both.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever!! you should totally get it. You get to take care of your horse go to competions. Don't have a doubt and get this game!
B005EHQGTS|4.0|This program is pretty nifty.  Took a little to get the external find, and get my desktop &#34;wake up on lan&#34; able, but once i did that, it's awesome.  The latency is minimal over wifi, i can't tell it, and with a good bluetooth keyboard, i was able to (although was a challenge) run a heroic on World of Warcraft as healer on my kindle.  Mainly just nice to be able to start up my desktop minecraft server from anywhere as well.  Picture is clean, and all in all great product.  Only thing that can be difficult is i wish they had some form of a better 'mouse' replication instead of operating on a 'touch screen' version.  I know there is a mouse mode but doesn't seem to operate well on games that aren't touch based.
B000IDEORY|4.0|I would recommend this movie. Good story line. Such a great cast. I enjoyed it so many years ago and enjoyed it as much now.

B000V5ZTV4|5.0|A refreshing look at the beauty, joy and responsibility involved in being a parent. Reading and re-reading this book has helped me work towards being the parent I want to be, especially after times of change (new baby, starting school etc) when my relationship with the kids needs work.
B007SGM084|5.0|Amazing and intriguing i started and finished this series in a week i couldn't put it down. So much more of a story than i thought there would be and of course the steamy parts are very engrossing. Thank you for this series.
1932100660|4.0|I'll let the cat right out of the bag.  The aim of this book is to open your eyes to the health dangers of animal based food products and to extol the virtues of a whole foods, plant based (vegan) diet.  Before you roll your eyes and groan, hear me out.<br /><br />The author of this book, Dr. Colin Campbell does an excellent job of outlining some of the very real health dangers associated with meats and animal proteins.  In particular, the link of these foods to certain types of cancer (colon, breast, prostate, and a few others) is very compelling.  Further more, the link of dairy products in children to type 1 diabetes is absolutely staggering.  In fact, this link is stronger than the link of smoking to lung cancer is.  Smoking increases your risk of lung cancer 10 fold.  Infants consuming cows milk based products increases their risk of type 1 diabetes by 13 fold.  In addition, he cites several studies linking casein (the predominant protein in dairy) as being highly cancer promoting.  The gist is that casein itself does not cause cancer, but it promotes the growth and spread of it rapidly and that by abstaining from this protein you can effectively halt the spread of certain cancers.<br /><br />Those are a couple of the highlights from the first half of of the book.  As someone who is very concerned with diet and health, it was absolutely enthralling and enlightening.<br /><br />Why haven't you heard of any of these things before?  Well, the meat and dairy lobby stand to lose billions of dollars by having their products vilified by official health organizations.  They spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an yearly basis to ensure that these products receive positive scientific press and the federal nutrition recommendations do not discourage the consumption of these products.  They will even go so far as to blackmail and strong arm respectable scientists to achieve their goals.  Make no mistake about it. Industry cares far more about their profits than they do your health.  This book outlines and clarifies this with great detail and does an excellent job doing so.<br /><br />So why give this book four stars instead of five?  Well, the center portion of the book is the weakest for me. This is the part where Dr Campbell goes through and lists the effects of animal based foods to various illnesses that plague western society - including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and eye/brain disorders.  He is obviously a very intelligent man and he makes some excellent points, but while he spends 360 pages vilifying animal foods, he spends approximately 2 pages (I am not exaggerating) talking about the dangers of refined starches, sugars, and carbohydrates.<br /><br />How someone could write two significant chapters of such an important book as this and not mention the link of elevated insulin levels to both diabetes and heart disease is absolutely stunning.  In fact, this one omission is so damning that it really challenges the premise of the entire book for me.  The issue I see is that Dr. Campbell is so intent on vilifying animal products that he has not stopped to consider the very serious dangers of refined plant products.<br /><br />The title of this book comes from a huge study of nutrition and health done in China back in the early 80s.  It basically correlates certain types of modern diseases with dietary patterns in China.  People who live in the more poor, rural parts of China eat a mostly plant based diet and have few of the &#34;modern&#34; diseases talked about in this book.  Once these same people move into more urban parts of China and their diets change to that of a more &#34;western&#34; style of eating, they adopt many of these chronic illnesses.  The correlation is very compelling, however it is not the whole story.<br /><br />There are zero doubts in my mind that a whole foods plant based diet is more healthy than a traditional western diet.  People who eat a whole foods, plant based diet are not eating animalproducts, but you know what else they aren't eating?  Soda, fruit juices, sugars, candy, crackers, bread, pastries, etc.  All of these things have been proven to be strong promoters of heart disease, diabetes, and a number of other western illnesses.  Despite these facts, the condemnation of these products takes up literally 2 pages of this 365 page book.  WOW.<br /><br />Now before you think I'm trashing this book too hard, let me be clear.  This is an excellent book and absolutely worth buying and reading by anyone concerned with their health.  Just understand that while this book is not the last word in nutrition, it's a very good start.  Dr. Campbell is obviously an extremely intelligent and accomplished researcher.  The points he makes on the dangers of animal foods are very compelling - so much so that it has prompted me to make some changes in my own diet.  I will be reducing my consumption of meats and dairy (I've already stopped eating whole eggs) and filling the void in my diet with vegetables.  After two weeks of this, I already feel better and more energetic.  You owe it to yourself to add this book to your collection.products, but you know what else they aren't eating?

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Brilliant and captivating could not stop reading, brought back very sad memories for me as I was also an abused child
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I got the album for my daughter, she is a big BVB fan. What can I say, she absolutely LOVES it. I have to admit, ones I started listening to it I got hooked on some of the songs as well. GREAT album !!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I will start out with the pros. Temple Run 2 has amazing graphics/details. Also, it has new stuff like zip lining, jumping and sliding over new obstacles like a spinning blade thing, and driving through a mine in a mine cart. I enjoy Temple Run 2 more than the original Temple Run because you are challenged more. (Its more entertaining!!!)<br /><br />  The two cons are that it is slightly laggy and the game often thinks you wanted to turn instead of jumping. This game is officially one of my favourites. My friends and family also enjoy it A LOT too!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Oh man; I must reconsider those excellent books that I rated 5 stars, because THIS book is an actual super-star for me. I've never read anything like it. It will not appeal to those who have no interest in science, or engineering, or extended struggle punctuated by many life-threatening events.  An astronaut is abandoned on Mars when his crew mistakenly believes he was killed in a weather-related flurry of damages. I have recommended it to my previous co-workers at JPL and Wenner-Gren Labs.  (BTW, my title is a quote from Dylan Thomas' &#34;A Child's Christmas in Wales.&#34;)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like how quick and easy the game moves. I didn't think that I could win but I did. All it takes is some strategy. Now it is addictive!
B005LAII12|5.0|It was side hurting funny.  I watched it alone but I think my neighbors could hear me laughing.  I could not stop even when the tears started the laughing continued.
B002ONC9NC|1.0|I lasted 45 minutes. The back cover seemed interesting, but it didn't live up to the hype. This is a story of a pathological ephebophile seducing an innocent girl. Unlike Lolita, which was stunning, our main character (Peter) is a manipulative liar. He gets his kicks off getting away with lies. Our first introduction to him in the rain is probably a calculated lie, every interaction with the parents is a lie. In fact, it's all about him and what he wants. He doesn't seem to care about this girl or the fact that he is wrecking her life. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Peter's \\"friend's\\" girlfriend is the only one with any sense. She sees that Jenny is just a kid, but everyone else around her treats her like she belongs. Nobody bats an eye at the totally inappropriate coupling of an old man with a teenager.<br /><br />I thought Carrey Mulligan, who plays Jenny, did a good job of making her goofy and innocent. She made me remember what it was like to want to be grown and have no clue what it meant.<br /><br />What made me turn it off is that the whole thing just disgusted me. I couldn't sit there and watch a narcissist molest a young girl. The difference between this and Lolita is that Humbert was conflicted and in his way, he loved Lolita. There were so many human elements that made the viewer sympathize. Peter is just purely manipulative and selfish.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I have used this ap several times and have been very pleased with the illumination I received.  Not a straight beam of light - more of a wide swath but adequate to see something you are looking for in the dark.
B00125WAWS|3.0|When I came across this movie, I was excited! Denzel, Whitacre and a story about the first black debating team to go against Harvard- how could you go wrong? There were many good- even great- moments, but it wasn't as good as it could have been. The story was solid. The scenery TOTALLY set the mood. There were diverse characters played by good actors. The historical aspect of it was interesting, but it felt formulaic and preachy. And although I am not a debater, I am a logical thinker and many of the arguments didn't seem to be based on logic at all. As I said, I am not a debater, so I could have this wrong, but it seems that that is what it is all about- a contest of logic. You defeat propaganda, red herrings, emotional arguments, and fallacies with logic, right?<br /><br />Hint for Oprah the next time: Just let the story tell itself. Don't try to tell people what to think or create a feeling. If it's a solid story with a good cast, the magic will happen effortlessly.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Ok so how the hell do you turn this crap off. Great app but no damn off button.. please fix this problem asap.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The case fits perfectly and is easy to use. It arrived undamaged and well packaged. Although the screen protectors I bought from this company were defective this case was good quality.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Started a little slow but once into it I couldn't put it down. It kept you guessing right to the end!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Extremely well done historical drama. I was immediately drawn in to the charaters lives. Can't wait for more epidsodes!!!<br />5 stars!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Fun but sometime frustrating game.  Great to have when you have nothing to do - waiting at the doctor's office etc.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Have to admit, I am prejudiced because I am a true Nicholas Sparks fan.  This book did not disappoint.  There were some surprises, which made it even more intriguing.  Got predictable toward the end, but it had to be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Originally I thought the hunger games series was just another set of books for the Twilight crowd, oh was I wrong.  I have been consumed with series since the start.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works just great on my kindle fire. Really nice summary of time remaining for all sorts of applications, from 2d, 3d games, to streaming videos and browsing. No problems at all. Great app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was amazing. Great character development and really kept you guessing as to what was going on while at the same time providing tantalizing clues the whole way.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a great follow up! I'm gonna waste plenty of time playing it. Power ups and character unlocks is a nice addition. Zip lining, bumps and dips, rushing creeks, a big freaking ape chasing you... I forgot how bad my reflexes are. Definitely worth downloading.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Bunch of twist and suspense I love it every page there is something going on I couldn't put the book down\\"if we burn you burn with us\\"
B005Z271Y6|2.0|I LOVE Adele, and her performance is amazing, but impossible to watch on this blu-ray or DVD.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the constant cuts every few seconds are nauseating.  You can't even focus your eyes on anything, because the views change so fast.  What a shame.  Hopefully, Adele's next concert video will have a different editor/director who will let us watch her mesmerizing performance.
B0036WHM1E|5.0|I seriously will never get tired of listening to this album. One of my most favorite songs of all time is &#34;Draw Your Swords.&#34; I really hope that A&J do more music together after their current solo phase.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you don't know about Joss Whedon's Firefly, get the DVD and watch it now.  Cowboys in space with complicated characters, drama, humor, It's addictive.  Nathan Fillion is the captain with a cinderblock on his shoulder.  The rest of the cast is equally compelling as are the story lines.  I still want more.
B003YOWU1Q|5.0|I absolutely love Ray LaMontagne and have seen him in concert a few times now. This is such a great album!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OHHHHH MY GAWWWWWD I LOVE THIS GAME....I HIGHLY RECOMEND IT LIKE SERIOUSLY!!!!!! I DONT THINK IM GOING TO SLEEP TONIGHT
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Very uplifting. Makes me think of how I am spending my life. Ok would have preferred to see more of the relationship.
0142001104|5.0|about once a year I re-read this book, and frequently purchase copies to give as gifts for friends and colleagues.
0143112724|4.0|Having read several breathless, glowing reviews of this book I awaited its arrival, breathlessly. And yes, it's good. For me, it is, as some 'technical' books are, too pedantic. Some explanations of where/why/when to inject this word here or better still there left me confused. The placement of the possessive \\"'s\\" is an example of where the book seems out of date. Example (and I write this from memory), Strunk argues it's correct to write \\"Charles's horse\\" and not \\"Charles' horse\\". I always thought the second application is correct. But... who am I to argue? It's entertaining to a point. Did it move my Earth? Not quite, but I do see its value.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood is such a fantastic actor at any age. If you love baseball and Clint you will love this.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|... those were the first words that Sixto Rodriguez said on stage in Cape Town on March 6th 1998, after hearing the long standing ovation from his fans.<br />I was born & grew up in South Africa in the 60's, 70's & 80's, and to now see this movie (twice, so far) and to see The Cold Fact Man who we all loved to hear and to whom we were so drawn by his words, is absolutely incredible. Like Steve Segerman says in the movie - he opened up our lives and our minds over there in SA, and now it is as if the man who we all thought was dead, LIVES. And his humility, despite now receiving some long-deserved level of recognition, is simply awe-inspiring. THIS is a real story of the beauty of the human spirit, and not only of Rodriguez's, but also of the team of South Africans who were determined to find him, bring him back to life, and show him how much he was loved. If this movie doesn't move you emotionally, check your pulse.
0375842209|5.0|This is a compelling, beautifully written, powerful book. I loved it. It's been a few weeks since I finished it and I still think about the characters and the story. It took me a while to figure out the relationship between the main characters and the narrator, but it all makes sense and is a genius way to tell the knife's edge story of life and death, joy and sadness, hope and despair. I wish I wrote this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addicting, and really,super, duper fun. It's funny how when you bump into the wall twice, the first time gorilla monkey or whatever the second time he rips you apart. I love this game. Whoever reads this should get it
1439156816|5.0|I don't like Stephen King as a writer, but I really enjoyed this book. He's an amazing storyteller and it may actually get me to read one of his novels through to the end. On Writing has some tips and advice for writers, but mostly I found it full of reassurances and encouragement to keep going, even when you think you're writing is aweful. If Stephen King can write what he thinks is crap and still keep typing, then maybe so can I...
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This battery app has been working great. As a power user its good to have nn app that is pretty useful when it comes to power use. Takes the guessing out. Thanks to Smallte.ch.
0316069884|5.0|An important book to read if you want to find out about where the meat you eat comes from. Especially if you want to make an informed decision about whether or not to eat meat, or what kind of meat you'll eat. Jonathan Safran Foer bases the book on 3 years of research into farm factories in the US, so the Canadian perspective may be different. But if you want a good reason to become a vegetarian, read this book. It's intelligently written, with a philosophical approach to it, and as an added bonus, it's written by Foer who is an amazing writer.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|One of the best cds the band has ever recorded, no music is less than perfect for the ears! Still with Tarja in the band, the songs are just great and no disappointment for Nightwish's fans at all.
0061564893|4.0|This was an engaging and fascinating read. There are a number of websites dedicated to debunking Menzies' book, but if even half of what he writes about is true, it's pretty amazing. 1421 outlines Menzies' theory that hundreds of Chinese treasure ships circumnavigated the globe and charted most parts of Antarctica, North and South America, Africa, Australia and Greenland, among other places. It all sounds plausible, my only question is why did the Chinese ships avoid Europe completely? Still, a great page turner.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|alot of nerve racking fun  and really hope you try it  the birds are funny sounding..so get your now ok.
0205313426|4.0|Excellent grammar tips. Succinct and to the point. Written in the style of American writers of the early 20th century, which, although not that long ago, makes it a bit of an antique. The grammar tips are timeless though.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|After a slow start and I got more into the story there were a lot of vivid love scenes which is not what I expected. The latter part of &#34;Hopeless&#34; tied things together and made for an interesting read.
0061433063|5.0|Terry Pratchett is my guilty pleasure. Like all his other books, I Shall Wear Midnight is funny and fantastic, with a unique outlook on humanity and our capability for grace. His style is often very sarcastic and sly, but also very compassionate and generous, which I always love to experience. There's heaps of entertaining slapstick, but Pratchett has a lot more to say in his writing. No, really, he's deeper than just the awesome puns.
B007HO392S|5.0|Every time Carrie makes another cd it gets even better than the one before.  She just continues to evolve as a singer and she's awesome.  The first 3 songs on this cd are already HUGE hits.
0743297334|5.0|I am a Hemingway convert. I love how strong and clear his writing is. He only writes about the things that are beautiful and important to him, without really getting into his feelings. He simply states the facts, but from the facts he chooses to reveal and thoes he doesn't, you understand his perspective. It's remarkably sparse that way. The book was published in 1926 and it does have a slightly old-fashioned style about it - the colloquialisms people use, the slower pace, the things Hemingway and his friends do for fun - but the perspective is ageless. The focus on human beings and their interactions, irrespective of social class, education, nationality, is poetic and universal. I could (and probably will) read it again and again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This horse game is amazing and I have tried every single horse game out there and this is the best one.I would highly recommend this game
0452273331|5.0|I read [[ASIN:0452011876 Atlas Shrugged]] a few years ago and loved it. The Fountainhead is also a great book. Ayn Rand spends less time focused on her philosophy of Objectivism in this book than she does in Atlas Shrugged, but she does touch on its main points. Rand has a very engaging style and her books are filled with fantastic characters. Sometimes they come off as archetypes, kind of two-dimensional, and this is true for the Fountainhead. Howard Roark, Dominique Francon, Peter Keating, and Ellesworth Toohey are all exciting characters, however, and I loved reading about their struggles living in the first half of the 20th century in New York. It's easy to love some of them and hate others -- she's that good at creating tension and developing an amazing and well-paced plot. I'd recommend The Fountainhead as a good introduction (just 700 pages) for anyone who hasn't read Ayn Rand, before plowing through Atlas Shrugged (over 1000 pages), which is more involved and has a greater emphasis on Objectivism.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|The setting is definitely interesting.  The storyline believable enough.  Technical details don't all add up well, and there are a few major holes in the basic premise, but these are minor to the enjoyment.  If it were a little tighter technically and a little tighter on the major premise, it would be a 5.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game because there is alot of horses that u can buy and do stuff and its kinda like th reqlly life like the game and stuff like that so ya i love this game
B0082EFM2C|4.0|This has quickly become one of my favorife albums to listen to. I loved her sultry smokey vokce from the beginning. You won't regret a purchase here.
B003K7BQZI|5.0|So my husband and I stumbled across Dr. Who on instant play and were curious about it. We had heard great things about it, but never watched it. Now, my husband and I are not huge nerds, but we still loved Dr. Who. I couldn't tell you who played the Dr. in the 1970's version, or name the actors of the previous 8 Dr's, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the new Dr. Who. Chris Eccleston was the first Dr. and he did a phenomenal job. He was quirky and strange, and made me somewhat uncomfortable, but I loved him anyway. The 2nd (or 10th) doctor was David Tennant. He also played Barty Crouch Jr. in Harry Potter 4. I've got to say, that he is by far my favorite out of the 3. He was deep, but funny and you can't help but fall in love with his character. Matt Smith was the 3rd (or 11th) Dr. I hated him at first. He annoyed me so much! But honestly he kind of grew on me. He is still my least favorite, but makes for a very interesting change of character. If you like sci fi or just plain adventure, you have got to watch this series. I think it was a series made for passionate fanatics and non nerds alike. We all can appreciate the experience offered to us by Dr. Who!
B005T87QCI|3.0|My son is obsessed with this movie.  Watches over and over so we had to get this game.  Its ok, its a little hard
B006KAWI2C|4.0|it was as marvelous as expected. But it took quite time to receive it, of course maybe delievered by ship.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My husband and son play this all the time.  THey are addicted to it.  Very happy to keep them busy.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Looks like a great game.  I can get the audio, but the video freezes up before the game starts and I'm stuck just listening to just the background sound effects.  Too bad, because the graphics are so good, they look like photographs!  Not sure even what your guy looks like.  I scrolled through all the available levels to play, and the closest thing to what looks like a playable character is some girl in a bed.  Not sure I'll even be able to play that level!  I had to read the book in college and I got to tell you, I never got it.  But I remember it was about something like killer TV sets so I bet it's a cool game.  If only it would actually start.  Oh well.  I guess I'll just have to play Paplinko.
0765325950|5.0|This book is as expected, and yet it was still awe-inspiring.<br /><br />We expected a last battle--a climatic finish to the series, and that's what we get. I found myself stopping every hundred pages or so, just reveling in the fact that I really was reading a thousand page battle scene. The scale was truly worthy of holding the title of the last battle.<br /><br />It's been noted by a number of reviewers that characters get shafted, and certain plot trails were tied up in a less-than-epic manner, and I agree completely. The reasoning though, is probably the nature of the overall plot of the final book which essentially means non-stop action. It felt like there was too much present to properly share the spotlight.<br /><br />I'm slightly torn on the structure still. On one hand, 1000 pages of action is everything we could hope for, yet it did mean the book read like I was strolling over a large hill with a slight incline. The lack of contrast made the book feel less defined, and I was slightly weary by the end, rather than in shock from wonder.<br /><br />I give it 4.5/5 stars, as it is still quite spectacular-- just well within the boundaries of what I expected.
B005IQ39AY|2.0|After you lose takes forever to reset the game. Also weird things like clearing the board but stills shows active game or have balls left and it tells you you failed level. No way to contact support. I've deleted and reloaded game still does it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Winter is coming...actually, it's already here. But thankfully I have this book to keep my mind from freezing. Good times, you won't be disappointed.
B007TML4EI|5.0|A friend of mine has this game...I wasn't interested at first since the picture and name made me think it was a child's game.  My friend played it while I watched and I was hooked!  It is an engineering game of sorts.  The goal is to protect your &#34;dummy&#34; from different dangers; huge sledge hammer, trash compactors etc.  Each danger is a different level.  Your job is to construct a structure that will keep the dummy safe and do it within a budget.  Having to think this through, build & rebuild and watch your budget is really a thoughtful and fun exercise. I am completely addicted to this game already and if you like a thinking game as well as a fun one, I think you will like it as well!  Enjoy!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My 9 and 7 year olds love the variety of games. They like to see who can do the best at each on  of the games.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|This book fired me up to the possibilities of the &#34;maker movement&#34;.  I have been telling everyone about it and look forward realizing some of my own design ideas!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is a much easier read and easier to follow and understand than Good Calories, Bad Calories.  Mr. Taubes does a great job explaining and recapping the scientific studies giving direct analysis without being dry.  He gives all the links and references one needs to follow to do your own analysis.  Good Calories, Bad Calories goes into a lot more depth of the studies and results.  Why We Get Fat shares all the knowledge in a quicker format without sacrificing any of insight.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|What can I say?  I fell in love with Phillip Phillips on American Idol and his album definitely stayed true to who Phillip is as an artist.  Love it!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If there was anyone complaining about the 2nd book not having enough action, I think this one made up for it. I was hooked from the beginning. I wasn't expecting some things to resolve the way they did, but they made sense in the end. Great conclusion to a great trilogy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so good. Books usually make me feel a certain way and I have never read a book that has made me feel this much. I would recommend it for anyone, especially if your in high school.
B0084AYLK8|3.0|I appreciated the opportunity to read this story using a free download, this being the first book I have read using my new kindle. This is the 1st time I have read this book and its unusual story of a drunken young husband selling his unwanted wife & baby daughter & the following twists & turns of the plot. Unfortunately when I reached chapter 20 I discovered some pages were missing making it difficult for me to follow the story & spoiling my enjoyment. .
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Stick to the books please! They at least have a storyline that has a point. If Damon didn't want to come back then replace him like the Bond series did.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Awesome...good puzzle game.  Tons of fun.  Best thing you can say about anything... it works. Give it a shot now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of  the best books I've read this year.  I was an emotional mess by the end, but we enjoyed every moment.
B005D4YGXK|1.0|When I opened the box . The box had everything correct on it. They had put wrong style shoe and color shoe in the box . Now I have to return them. : (
B001GUXJQA|3.0|Ok not as fast moving as I like, but I still liked it,Harry is a sympathetic character and a good guy
B000FC2L1E|5.0|1,000 more pages of spellbinding adventure leaving you ready for more.  Looking forward to the next one in the series
B0028YPDVW|5.0|I bought my niece over 20 Schleich animals and she loves them.  She brings at least one everywhere she goes. She likes lining them up on the dining room table and she takes one with her everywhere she goes.
B000IZA9NK|4.0|This movie rather requires a mindset capable of using Saturday Matinee serials as a frame of reference. If you can accept that, it's a lot of fun. Yes, there are incongruities in the plot (and lots of them, for instance: Why evacuate by parachute the breeding stock from the rocket when it malfunctions if it's still going to incinerate the earth anyway?) . Unlike other reviewers, I don't really think the acting is anything to write home about, particularly Gweneth Paltrow. But, view it as you would a comic book and it's marvelous. The flying robots in the beginning are reminiscent of the Superman cartoons of the 1940's (worth a look themselves). The visuals and angles are also of a comic book perspective (especially the initial half dealing with the city shots). The whole thing is pretty much CGI and looks it, but it doesn't matter; it's just fun.
B005VOXQ1U|5.0|I bought my niece over 20 Schleich animals and she loves them.  She brings at least one everywhere she goes. She likes lining them up on the dining room table and she takes one with her everywhere she goes.
0670023329|5.0|I rated this five stars due to incredible story of one man's journey from the most notorious prison camp in North Korea to freedom in the west.  Somewhat depressing at times, but demonstrates how valuable the freedoms and liberties we have, that we too often take for granted. Gives you a different perspective on life.<br />RJ
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome! Don't even think twice before getting it. Like Nike&reg; :  Just Do It!!!<br />If you don't have this app, you are ob misery!!! Sorry for you people who don't have this!
B00633W614|1.0|I expect a novel to conclude without making it a requirement to buy yet another installment.  This was book two and still no resolution. Tricked once, your fault, twice mine. I will not be buying number three
B006LSZECO|5.0|It took me a few chapters to really get into this book but once it took off, it was a page turner.<br />Very suspenseful and I could not wait to read more.  Highly recommend.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I enjoyed everything in this book from the main characters to the first person view of the novel.. Some over used words throughout the story but nothing you couldn't quickly get over.. I really enjoyed this book and it had my start the sequel right away.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Was recommended to me by a Friend on Friday...Finished it by Sunday.<br />One of those &#34;I just can't put it down&#34; books.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's fine for a quick check, but I am glad that I don't rely on it all of the time.
0765325950|5.0|This is a satisfying end to a 20 year journey for me. I am please with the way things ended and I hope that everyone understands the depth of the story we all just read. Also, Brandon can now focus on his own amazing career now that these books are done. Kings 2 is GOING TO BE AWESOME!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a great way to pass time and includes some great classics to play as well. When you play more and master the games, the more games become available to try.
B005MMY534|4.0|After watching the first three episodes, I've formed some opinions.  Here they are!  FIrst off, I think that the show was beautifully cast.  Arthur is perfect, and Eva Green as Morgan Le Fay is even better!  The writing is interesting, and the sets and costumes are very well-done.  My chief complaint about the show is the cinematography; the use of a &#34;shaky-cam&#34; technique here and there makes it feel as if the scene is being shot on someone's HD pocket video camera.  It's distracting, ruining the suspension of disbelief, and pulling the viewer out of ancient times and back to 2013.  If you are interested in King Arthur or fantasy adventure, the show is worth watching, but I'm more likely to keep watching &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love the smiles it put on my kids faces! After a few minutes of figuring out how to sync the kindles all 3 are showing the app for this and were able to play immediately.  Great app for teaching young people physics! This app deserves 10 STARS!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I got this as a gift for my partner, since I gave her a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas. She loves it, and loves that she can prop her Kindle up with it to watch a video. It seems sturdy enough to protect the device, and it's at least as attractive as the picture. There's really not a lot more to say about something so simple, but it was definitely a good choice. The item is true to color based on the photograph, at least as it appears on my computer screen.
B000FC10WU|4.0|I really love they way the English express themselves which is a big reason I enjoyed this book.  The characters were so snobby, but each with his or her own skeleton. Miss Marple is an old busy body , and I couldn't help but like her.  She is very perceptive and bright.  She is a favorite character of mine.  I shall read many more Agatha Christie mysteries in the Miss Marple series
B000Q7ZO8U|3.0|The movie was great and the delivery was quick - no concerns there.  Somehow our credit card number was stolen and 6 other purchases were made after we bought this movie.  We hadn't used this card in several months and this is the only purchase we made with it.  Not sure who's fault this was but it did not make us happy!  Luckily, the credit card company was able to stop the transactions.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Good app, ive tried others but i like this one. brown noise is my favorite. Ocean sounds are less obnoxious than other apps. I would give it more stars but 19 MB? wow
0486275590|5.0|As a school teacher, I am always looking for resources to use. This book is a treasure! Classic literature with high interest for today's youth. (Anything pirate raises their interest!) This edition is an excellent buy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is one of those books that I couldn't put down.  Literally.  So yes, the housework, laundry, life had to suffer for the day so I could finish one of the best books I have ever read.  The closer to the end of the book I got, the more of a dread in my stomach I got simply because I knew I would be finished with Hopeless.  This book will be a re-read for sure!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really liked the game. it feels like a sequal too me. they did a fantastic job on this game. but look out I used the wave me and it e Utes me out of my game and stole a gem. the save me didn't work. I am never using it again.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Very, very good. Always love Flynns books and this was no exception. Was nice to see a gentle side to Rapp. Could he possibly get a new love interest soon? Can't wait for the next book!!
B0041KKYEW|5.0|One of my favorites. There are many reviews that sum up why you should watch this film better than I can. I'm a blu-ray cheapskate and usually wait for titles to go under $10 before I purchase. This is one of maybe 5 in my collection of 120 or so I would make an exception for. The picture quality is great, the sound quality is great, the movie is fantastic, I haven't even touched the bonus material and I am happy with the purchase already. You can't go wrong with this one.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|pretty much the title. loved the first one and this one was fun till it stopped working. once it's. fixed ill give it 5 stars
B000MRAAJW|1.0|But the entire pack of discs was unplayable because of damage. Purchased from the Amazon marketplace, however amazon customer service took great care of me. I have become hesitant about purchasing optical media from Amazon lately, if the customer service weren't so good I would never again purchase a disc of any kind from the site. In the span of a month 5 different discs arrived loose and scratched badly. The situation has always been resolved quickly and to my satisfaction though so I can't fault Amazon for that. The few minutes of footage that worked looked amazing and sounded quite good on my 5.1 system. I can't comment on the actual product much further than that...the packaging was attractive I guess.
B005LAII80|4.0|Like blood and guts and tons of empty shell casings flying everywhere then you will love this movie. If you liked Robo Cop then you will love Judge &#34;Dredd&#34;
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My little cousins just love this game! This game is a great game for the younger kids... it keeps them entertained too!
B008B3H4VQ|3.0|I am a huge Linkin Park fan and have been kinda disappointed with the material they have put out since their smash debut LP. It  was well worth it's price and was a great deal. Hope to deal with you again soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well-written, nothing superfluous in this young adult novel.  Stands well on its own and the two remaining books need not be read - but it will be a pleasure to do so.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this is a great app for kids who cant have horses it gives them a chance to reasonable.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I enjoyed most of the songs but some were weird like the intro song but other than that id say a good buy especially for the price its going for!
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|this is very easy to use even when you don't have much time. doesn't require much space or equipment to perform
B00B2166BS|5.0|This is a must buy if you own a Nexus 10.  It charges your Nexus 10 quicker than the standard microUSB and much safer from accidents (tripping over wires, pulling on the cord).
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game crashes so much. I played it once and fell in love with it. I had to take a break from it and do chores. I came back and it wasn't turning on. PLZ DONT IGNORE THIS MESSAGE. LOVE YALL.:x
B007BFSYMS|4.0|This app does just what it says.  Sounds are pretty solid to good considering it is coming from my phone speaker.
0684824906|5.0|An extraordinary chronicle of a period of time in American history, and a thorough and fact based story of a great man's rise to prominence in the political world of Washington.
B00A3ATW4M|1.0|After using Jonathan Coulton's brilliant cover of Baby Got Back without contacting, crediting or compensating him, Glee's producers told him he should be \\"thankful for the exposure.\\" That's amazing considering they claim his work as their own.<br /><br />Don't sponsor jerks- especially jerks who hide behind an anti-bullying message. These uncreative oafs deserve none of your money. Instead, check out the creative people they have been ripping off.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Wish this game had been a bit longer for the price. It only took me a few hours to complete it, including the bonus chapter. But I would recommend it if you enjoy hidden objects games with a storyline. This required little brain power to solve the locks and such because your character displays a lot of on-screen 'thoughts'.  Enjoyable but not very challenging. Good game overall.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book was page turner at some points. Others it was dry but still very good. I finished it in about  a day an  a half. Wouldn't mind reading  it again  or a sequel!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It wasn't one of her better ones.  Felt like too much time was spent &#34;inside&#34; Kay's head.  Still a good read though.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|exciting can't put it down book.  Lee Child has hit it out of the ballpark with this one again. a must read
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The world my grandsons project except they don't know an Auggie. I usually don't write reviews, but this book is really good.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston & Child have never disappointed this reader.  They have done it again with this new novel.  Loved the book.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves to play this game. Its very cute and colorful. Best part was free. So glad i picked this game for her.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Very fun skill game not to easy not to hard, challenging enough to keep you addicted, easy to learn how to play
B003VS0CX8|4.0|Was great to watch all the extras and learn about the actual history behind the family.  I'll be watching this over and over for sure!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This CD is a great Christmas CD for anyone who likes to listen to Christmas music and Rod Stewart Its a very nice Cd. I bought one for all of my friends and family for Christmas and they all loved it, It doesnt have to be Christmas to enjoy it its great.<br />ILOVEROD.. :}
B003EEMIV8|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 2.5 yr old son. He loves it. The truck is very durable, especially for his demanding garbage pick up schedule. I imagine this will be a truck his kids will play with one day.
B00064VR0W|5.0|Rod Stewart live at the Royal Albert Hall is really an enjoyable show even if you dont really like Rod by the time you are finished with the concert you are bound to be singing some of Rods songs. A show for all ages. The great Rod Stewart..<br />ILOVEROD.. :}
B002UM5BXW|5.0|This really tells a lot about what goes on in the kitchen before you are served your dinner!<br />His TV appearances tell somewhat different stories, but they are in different countries.  This is in the US where we &#34;trust&#34; kitchens to be clean and the chefs to be clean and sober.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Can't wait to read the next one.<br />I refuse to watch the movie until I finish reading all the books.
B003E88TKS|5.0|This movie had kind of a depressing story behind it but it is very funny and honest.  Great actors and a great plot make a great movie!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So stoked to read the book. I have not been able to put these books down. Guess I will have to buy the next book cause the anticipation is killing  me.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Like the title says, can you go wrong with Adele?  Never!  Love this CD and love her unique style.  :)
B002VUFKG6|5.0|For those who read &#34;Eat, Pray, Love&#34; and fell in love with Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style, I would recommend this book. Her contemplation on marriage, including some research and many ancedotes, helps weave a tale of a woman who tries to reconcile her need to marry with her fear of matrimony. Being from a split-household myself, this book helped me with my own journey as well. A very good read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|i love this<br />its book its awesome<br /> i recommend it to people who<br />like seals and like a good navy story
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This has to be King's most thought provoking novel.  I was ten years old when JFK was assassinated and well remember the adult mood of the country.  For the most part, King has captured life in that era very accurately - as he should since he is slightly older than I am.  While the ramifications of changing history has a huge impact on the world (in the book), it is really a small piece of the story.  I found it more closely aligned with a history lesson and journey back in time - albeit a very entertaining one.  It is not the standard &#34;scare the bejeezus&#34; out of you that he is so fabulous for writing.  This book should appeal to a much broader group of readers.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Thus book is really good.  : )<br />I recommend this book for people who like comedies. It is also really funny.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I told my husband to read this book even if it seems like a \\"chick book.\\" Thank you, Liz Gilbert.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is both fun and a challenge to play . i think that it is fun for all ages.
B000KNUPZW|5.0|The VHS is in good condition and the box is also.  The VHS  is being sent to our granddaughter for a present and she will be most happy to receive it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this app is a big hit with my younger kids, and the older ones too. its a lot of fun.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Heard so much about Homeland that I had to see it. Superb acting. Episode to episode you can't stop watching. You want to know what is going to happen next. No problems with ordering or shipping .
B007N5YIUS|5.0|all my kids love this app, they all think it is both fun and funny to watch. great family app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome!! Absolutely could not put down and it been a while for my eye to stay with any book!! ;)
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I like how Michael Connelly writes and keeps you in suspense until the end of the book.  I've read many of his books and even though I did not like, &#34;The Safe Man&#34; I will still read his books.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|Maybe not the best graphics or most user friendly interface, but considering the age of this franchise it's pretty great. Also, as a FAOTD it couldn't be beaten.
B001BANK32|5.0|Nothing at all like the movie, which made the book that much<br />more exciting. Waited too long to read this masterpiece.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a well liked game on many platforms and of COURSE it works on android. Just a phenomenal indie game, this all coming from a guy who doesn't see &#34;indie&#34; as a good thing. A great christmas free app of the day, also! Thanks Amazon!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of reading but this book is absolutely amazing. I laughed, I cried, and felt so many things I haven't before,it gives you a different perspective in life. I give it five stars because it was more than I expected I would give it a trillion stars if I could. I recommend this book to mostly any age group but mostly teens.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love the book i have read the rest of this series and I love them all i would most definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in any greek mythology or anyone that just loves a book with action....i am 13 and this is my favorite book series so please read it .....but i would recommend that you have read the rest of this series first or else it makes no sense at all<br />It
B008SVS3FC|3.0|John Hiatt needs to take a vacation. The fact of the matter is, he's just been working WAY too hard, and, as a result, his work has begun to suffer. Releasing six albums in the last ten years (four in the last five!), Hiatt now almost seems to be going through the motions, repeating and rehashing himself. In so doing, he's lost much of the edge/spark/originality that's made him so special for almost four decades.<br />  Make no mistake about it, MYSTIC PINBALL is Hiatt's strongest album since 2003's BENEATH THIS GRUFF EXTERIOR, with a number of classic moments to be found here. However, there's also a lot of filler, and that's just something you don't expect from one of America's pre-eminent singer/songwriters. Consequently, what is really a 3.5 star album is getting rounded down, vs. up.<br />  The disc opens with the bluesy \\"We're Alright Now.\\" The track has a spirited vibe to it, what with it's tight arrangement, crisp instrumentation and gutsy lead vocal. However, you can only write so many \\"happy\\" or \\"sad\\" songs before they all start running together....it's like \\"Wait a minute...wasn't this song on MASTER OF DISASTER? Or was it THE OPEN ROAD?!? O.K.....but I want more!<br />  \\"Bite Marks\\" is a step in the right direction. Right from the opening note, you know this is classic Hiatt...once that wink-and-a-nudge vocal kicks in, you know this is going to be a fun ride! And when Hiatt growls \\"You like it rough/Down in the mud/Your idea of fun is drawin' blood\\",,,well, it's clear that Hiatt needs (and thrives on!) this kind of grit and edginess! An absolute gem!<br />  \\"It All Comes Back Someday\\" is a prime example of the ghost haunting Hiatt's work nowadays....it's a nice enough song, but there's nothing about it that makes you go \\"Yes!\\" We've heard this melody before...we've heard this vocal before....we've heard this STORY before! To quote Cher in \\"Moonstruck\\"....\\"Snap out of it!\\"<br />  Things rebound brilliantly with \\"Wood Chipper.\\" Now, THIS is what I'm talking about! Between the slinky, sly arrangement and smokey lead vocal, things would be good enough, but when you toss in lyrics like \\"Well, I'm from the Midwest/I know enough to cut a path/Around a wood chipper/And be careful/Of any conversation/A man starts by callin' you skipper?\\" THIS is what John Hiatt is all about! LOVE it!!!<br />  On the flip side of the coin, we have the droning \\"My Business.\\" What can I say? This track is 3:00+ of wasted time. It's sort of like a pre-show sound check jam that wanted to be a song when it grew up...but failed. Leave the Blues jams to others, John!<br />  I'm on the fence over \\"I Just Don't Know What To Say\\"...on the one hand, once again, this is nothing new...we've heard this all before. On the other hand, the instrumentation is gorgeous (particularly Doug Lancio's guitar and Hiatt's piano), the lead vocal is absolutely heartfelt, and the lyrics are so sweet (\\"I know you're shocked/At my loss for words/'Cause I can talk/The wings off a hummingbird\\"). We'll call this one a draw for now!<br />  The next two tracks shine a huge light on Hiatt's main problem...domestic life, be it full of discord or bliss, is starting to wear thin, even boardering on boring. Maybe he needs to take a break from the first person naratives, and write more about those quirky characters he's created in the past. (Or combine the two, like in \\"Wood Chipper\\").<br />  Mind you, neither \\"I Know How To Lose You\\" nor \\"You're All The Reason I Need\\" are bad songs ~ how can you NOT love the line \\"Then I'm neatly dressed in my emptiness\\" from \\"I Know...\\", while there's a crisp energy to \\"You're All...\\" ~ but that's just not enough.<br />  \\"One Of Them Damn Days\\" is another Blues romp, but this time it works. The arrangement is equal parts supple, smooth and spicy, while Hiatt's lead vocal is relaxed and assured. There's nothing forced here....things just flow. And I love the line \\"I was shaking, reaching for my cup/Trying to stir my life around.\\" Nice!<br />  Evennicer is \\"No Wicked Grin\\", a lovely ballad. There's an everyman quality to this song that just makes it stand out...honest, real, no sense of filler or spinning wheels...my God, I can't even pick a favorite lyric because every single line is perfection! Neck and neck with \\"Wood Chipper\\" in the race for MYSTIC PINBALL's top track.<br />  \\"Give It Up\\" has a nice, easy-going groove to it. In the \\"old days\\", they would have called this a really strong \\"album track\\", and it is, but I think it might be too little, too late. We needed a \\"Wow!\\" moment right about now, not a \\"Nice enough\\" one. Too bad.<br />  Things wrap up with \\"Blues Can't Even Find Me.\\" I hate to say it, but Hiatt is almost starting to sound a tad bit....whiny,,,here. (Man it hurts to say that!) And I'm just going to leave it at that.<br />  So, where does John Hiatt go from here? Well, I think he needs to take a little break. Seriously. Keep writing, but no recording for 3-4 years. Do some travelling...observe other people. Get out of his own head (and life). Then, when it's time to record again, A) really edit the song choices, and B) maybe do a duet or two with the likes of Rosanne Cash and Aimee Mann. There are moments on MYSTIC PINBALL that prove John Hiatt's still got it. But moments aren't enough.<br />  (As to the contradictory nature some might think this review has, with me wanting Hiatt to move on, but also to provide us with \\"classic\\" Hiatt moments....I think he CAN do both....he needs to stretch, while still embracing his strengths. And, as with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics).nicer is \\"No Wicked Grin\\", a lovely ballad.

B008QI6EHQ|3.0|I LOVE READING BOOKS ABOUT HITLER AND THE HOLOCAUST, BUT I FOUND THE AUTHOR WAFFLED ON.  ITS A TRANSLATION FROM HITLER'S GERMAN VERSION, SO IM NOT SURE IF HITLER WAS A BORING AUTHOR OR ITS THE ENGLISH AUTHOR THATS BORING.  I FOUND OUT A FEW THINGS ABOUT HITLER THAT I DIDNT KNOW, BUT ITS A BORING READ.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just a fun, simple, addictive little game - perfect time waster - I pick it up for a few minutes several times a day, never bought extra coins.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|The alarm time just came and went with no sound.  I do not think it can wake it up when the alarm time comes.
B0027MJU00|2.0|Really really dark, too gruesome for my tastes.  I know the reviews said the same, but I thought how bad could it be?  Well . . .
B007HACDLK|5.0|When I started the book I thought this is a guy's book!  This is one of the best books I have read recently.  and  it was hard to put down till the end.  It was fast paced and had some terrific twists.  I was wrong in my initial observation and happy to say this is a great book for everyone.  Mr. Flynn you have a new fan.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|If you like the characters of Douglas Preston, you will like Two Graves.  It seems like Pendergast may even be \\"bested\\" this time.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Honestly,I hate to pay full publisher prices for Mr Rankin's books. But this was well worth the fun and great writing so there worth the extra cost. I like Rebus am a pensioner. THANKS IAN<br /><br />..
0739341243|5.0|Helpful for an Extroverted mom of Introverted daughters.  It builds them up.  It helps us appreciate each other.  Hard to be introverted in this world.  Typically they feel down on them selves even if they are brilliant - just because chatty people seem more popular.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I expected a little better - seemed Clint Eastwood was the exact same character as in Gran Torino and we enjoyed that movie.  Slow moving and predictable with all the cliches. Bummer
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great controller. Very ergonomic for the hands. Fit is good from small to large hands. Vibrate fuction is strong and can easily be felt.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I have read this book over and over. It is beautiful story about a young woman and the realization of her own worth. A true classic.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|11/22/63 is one of the best books I've read in years. The ethical questions, the romance, the history... I simply couldn't stop reading till it was over!
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I ordered 5 top-rated styli and tested them. The Cosmonaut was BY FAR the best. Others try to be like a pencil, which doesn't feel right, since the iPad surface isn't paper.<br /><br />The surface of the iPad is more like a whiteboard. Hence, you need a writing utensil that is more like something you would use to write on a whiteboard - The Cosmonaut. This explains its magic and why I found it the best.<br /><br />My recommendation for a notetaking app w/ it: NotesPlus.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|First game I downloaded when I got my Droid phone.  Easy to level up. I even downloaded the Cookie version.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|Great album. Listened to it in the 90s and still listening to it today. It's a must buy for any pearl jam fan
B00873GRU4|4.0|What a pleasure to read a book with a different storyline. Different, thought provoking and an amazing concept. You can visualise it. It shows that the human race never wants to stagnate, no matter what the situation, we continually want change, no matter what the cost.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It was a classic storyline for underdogs but all in all a really good FUNNY movie!!! I even laughed out loud a few times.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Great game! Easy to play on ematic-pro. Good graphics. Enjoying the various setups fot the tiles. Worth the low cost

B00542UMIY|5.0|Not a movie I would have rented, but my grandson wanted to watch it and I was pleasantly surprised with how nice a family movie it was.
0894803123|3.0|I guess I was expecting more cookbook style recipes but hearing the back story and all that of Ben and Jerry was interesting too.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|No matter how many times during the holiday season my kids and I watch this movie, it always seems like the first time.  This year we were traveling for the holiday, so I purchased the movie for the road trip.  It is worth having!

B000MRA6AK|5.0|I heard this CD playing at someone's house, asked about it and decided I wanted a copy too. Ordered it and am still very happy with it.

B0063B2BNE|5.0|I absolutely love this television show, it has great actors and a great story line that is constantly evolving and growing around the characters.
B005XLN97M|4.0|This was a gift for our granddaughter. She loves it according to my son. We didn't put it together so am not able to discuss that aspect but it looks awfully cute and the price on Black Friday was great.
1846551455|5.0|Jo Nesbo's 1st book and what a great read it was.  I would recommend it for anyone that is a mystery buff andlikes a great book.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|This is an all time favorite movie for me (and many others), and even though it's on TV every holiday season, I'm glad to finally own it for myself.  I think NBC holds exclusive rights to the movie and therefore only airs it a couple times a year at it's own discretion.  Even more reason to own a copy.  This version includes classic B&W version as well as a color disc. To be honest, my family and I initially agreed that it's borderline blasphemy to watch the color version over the original ... however, we were all also curious enough as to what the color version looks like that I'm sure we'll watch it eventually.  Maybe next Christmas.<br />No complaints about packaging or delivery.  Solid Amazon purchase as usual.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Played the game for several hours yesterday, only to have it crash and could not get it to come back up. Incredible disappointment. I was ready to give it a 5 star review for graphics, controls, new twists, change of characters and great background design, but cannot give a game that crashes anything other than a one! Please fix!
B004I9CXHW|4.0|as described and works well...highly recommend. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n
B0026OR1UK|3.0|Another way of inspiring others to do better.  This book is a good read for people who want to work toward improving their performance.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I bought this book, never having read Stephen King before, but being interested in the Kennedy assassination. Had to laugh at myself as I got into the book, because it was nothing like what I had expected. But once I got beyond that, I enjoyed it very much! I liked the time-travel idea, as that gave King a great vehicle to explore the Kennedy assassination in a very different way. It held my interest from page one, and I totally got into the characters and the idea of traveling back in time from the 21st century to the 1950s & 60s. There were some rather obvious pieces to his storyline, but all in all, it was good. Though I don't agree with King's version of how all this happened (the lone gunman vs the conspiracy theory), I'm glad I read the book.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|good fun. nice to connect with old friends and new ones too.  can't think of a way to make it better.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I am such a huge Walking Dead fan, but a lot like lost they keep killing off my fav. characters.
0446580848|2.0|I have most of DeMille's books and aside from The Gold Coast, the John Correy books were my favorite.  This book, however, was a major disappointment.  Why?  Where do I begin?  1) This book is way to long.  This story could best be told as a short story.  You have hundreds of pages where nothing happens.  2) Once a fan of the John Correy wise cracks, Demille has made them way to much a part of this book.  You can get into no rhythm with the characters because it is feels like DeMille is just trying to \\"one-up\\" his last remark. 3)  There is almost no interaction between Correy and the primary villain leaving you to wonder WHY? 4)  The books leaves no clear resolution - you spent 400 pages describing Yemen, couldn't the author spend 50 pages telling us how they leave?  All in all, I will still read the next DeMille release, but if it is like The Panther then it will be my last.  I just want the hours I spent reading this book back.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Far as the documentary itself goes it's complete as in \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" it goes into step by step blow.  I was charmed by his daughters particularly his oldest and youngest as human beings, actually the whole family including Rodriguez struck me as very intelligent very literally and cultural adept people all the while boasting about being poor which alot of us are whether we want to admit that or not.  Anyway it's a very heart touching story to watch on this document.  My main concern is if this document will hold up on repeat viewings although i didn't check out the other features of the DVD i only watched the documentary and it was very good loved some of the shots of the places Rodriguez walked in South Africa and Detroit...loved the way he walks it seems it's a theme i seen him on 60 minutes and he did some walking in that documentary of 10-15 minutes...anyway if i'm a publisher i'd contact Rodriguez to write a book of poetry i checked out his music and he has some really mind blowing songs and he definitely was a writer of technique i don't think he just wrote those 24-30 songs and that was it he was writing a long time if you see the techniques and writing devices he used...had he continued writing or was on say Columbia where they could push for air-play we're talking a major songwriter in the Dylan, Cohen, Simon class...it's not to say they had the biggest hits (they did have them) but they were the most literary songwriters and Rodriguez goes into their class had he written 8-10 more albums, with just 2 he'll remain a what if wonder...but i won't take away anything from the most amazing story i've ever come across in terms of a musical artist, the only reason all this buzz is here because there was a buzz somehow for him in South Africa which has been estimated he sold 500,000 to 2 million copies...unfortunately all bootlegged and no royalty rates paid which the documentary covers all that and they did show his award for going platnium, maybe gold?  by now it's probably gone gold i'm sure of it.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|This is a good show. One of the few things I didnt like was that they took Steve out and replaced him with a new husband for Marcy after keeping her single for awile. My favoritew choriyeor has always been the daughter Kelly. You should get it.
B005PITQHU|5.0|This is an excellent introductory book for people looking to get more serious about photography.  One of the most important concepts Peterson introduces in the book is \\"the photographic triangle\\", which pertains to aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.
B00006FDCD|4.0|I remember that childhood movie very well. When I saw it on T.V. for same reason the two parallel stories where chronological. I saw the childhood part first then when they are old without flashbacks. I don`t know. When I see it now, it`s better but that`s how I saw it when I was young.<br />A beautiful story of friendship and of the meaning of the loser`s club. I liked the book as well.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This was a great movie and really left me wanting more. I liked it even better than the original Bourne movies! Watch it!!
0061733199|5.0|Talk about alot of knowledge in a book. You can read this for days and not keep all this knowledge. A great book for any bug out bag.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|While this book is not a happy, uplifting sort of book, I found that I couldn't put it down.  The story takes you into the mind of a young woman who is being held captive by a kidnapper and raising the son he fathered.  A very deep, thought-provoking book that keeps you reading!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|A very good selection of books to read!  Easy to read on tablet, along with very nice features. Happy to have this app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the unexpected twists and turns in this novel.  The last 1/3 of the book seemed to drag on a bit, but the storyline was unique and interesting enough to make up for that.  You get to know the characters better and better as you continue reading.  I'd recommend to anyone.  It's quite a page turner!
B0093OGBL6|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Ms Moriarty did an excellent Job in depicting this true legend! This book is full of wonderful things that I did not know about Michael! I recommend this book for any true fan! You will not be disappointed!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a nanny to a 6 and 8 year old girl. I wish they could each have their own horse and save progress on both. That's the only problem we've encountered; they both love it and want it as their own game and I haven't been able to figure out how to have two games going :-/
0545265355|5.0|Bought this box set as a gift for my son.  The books are well made and have dust jackets that are<br />attractive.  Print is easy to read.  The box itself is well designed and sturdy.  Shipping was fast, arrived<br />in two days.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|My twin grandboys just love this game. They even facinate me on how quick they pick it up. It is one of the free game apps and is very challenging for the younger children. My boys are only 4 years old and one of them already is a master at this game!
B002ZG98J6|5.0|Great movie with good action scenes, mysteries, and a fun story line.  Can watch it many times and still enjoy it!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I think I have this movie memorized. It gets funnier and funnier every time I see it. I think I have watched this at least 25 times since I bought it. It shows up beautifully on my computer and kindle.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Some good tracks, I Need Your Love, Figure 8, Hanging On Lights, and more.  If you like Lights, check out the Bassnectar remix, it is even better!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|most people know if not everybody that graphics add so much to games. I loved the first, but the second is 20x better.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|well if you read these books then your smiling like the rest of us. I liked all three, even though Chelsa Handler said they are very poorly written, who the heck is she, her show sucks!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read, really quick reading.  Tons of twists and action.  If you are offended by teenagers killing each other, don't read the books.  If you are smart enough to distinguish fiction from real life then enjoy this great series.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|yesssss way better than the first! ! get it just get it lol plus amazing graphics I Omg cant explain just get it
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Its a fun game but it seems like some of the levels there is no way to get all 3 stars. Oh well, it is still a fun game.

B007ZD17XO|5.0|Finally a game that keeps my attention. I can sit a play this for hours. I totally recommend this game.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This is such a fantastic album. I can't stop listening to it. It reminds me of a blend of the Beta Band and Yeaysayer, just the right amount of trippyness, and some great melodies. Loads of tracks will have your head noddin for hours on end.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It really makes you think!! Who did I married!! What would I be capable of doing??? Very interesting turn off events!
B00B2IK4LO|1.0|Does Amazon really have such poor quality control that they'd let some rogue fan submit a bunch of unapproved fan-made remixes, and try to pass it off as an official release?  This is pathetic!  Tracks 2-3 and 5-9 are 100% unofficial bootleg mixes, not approved or relased by Interscope Records.  Simply baffling that this hastily-assembled collection of mostly amateur remixes actually made it to Amazon.  Let the buyer beware!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This novel comes out totally unexpected.  At first, I thought I knew just how it was all going to go.  But, the author comes out with new unexpected twists through out this book.  Very well written and a page turner, no doubt.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Like others have said, there are some bugs on the kindle fire. Even with sensitivity at 100%, it misses my swipes sometimes. But I found that after a while that goes away and it runs just fine. Love the Disney twist ion one of my favorite games!

B005LAII80|2.0|If you haven't seen this movie, rent it first.  I was tempted to buy it cold, based on the overwhelming number of five-star reviews it has, here on Amazon, but it wasn't even a good rental in my opinion.<br /><br />The majority of the film takes place inside of a dilapidated apartment building, and it's basically 95-minutes of bullets flying back-and-forth.  They never really flesh out the world Dredd lives, the \\"Hall of Justice\\" which he works for, or even Dredd himself.  I never got a sense of who this character was, why he does what he does, who he does it for, or why he's so special.  That's one thing the Stallone movie got right.  In the first film, Dredd was an actual person; one who took himself very seriously.  His job meant everything to him, and it was his dedication to it that made him one of the best there was; but these obsessive traits also hurt him in his personal life.  Over the course of the movie, he loses a mentor; he loses a brother; but by the end of the movie, he gains a friend and a love interest!  He also faces corruption within the force.<br /><br />In this movie, they don't explore anything in detail (besides slow-mo effects), and Dredd is no different than any of the other judges that appear in the film.  They all talk in dehydrated voices, they're all devoid of personality, and they're all interchangeable with Anderson--Dredd's partner de jour--being the only exception.  This movie feels like it's more about her, as she tries to prove her worth as a judge, than it does about Dredd, who is just there to be her chaperone on her first suicide mission.<br /><br />At no point does Dredd seem intimidating, and neither does Ma-Ma, whose constant lack of energy suggests she has no will to live.  Yet, we're supposed to believe that this lanky, lifeless drug-addict was capable of taking over a 200-story apartment building, loaded with heavily-armed criminals, that were already fighting for turf before she arrived?  I'm not knocking Lena Heady.  I love her as Cersei on Game of Thrones (a REAL villain), but here, she's cast as a walking, talking corpse.  Her character here is so lifeless, it would have been less out-of-place on an episode of The Walking Dead.  As I type this, I can't help but think that the people that enjoyed this movie are fans of the show, who have been starved for action by watching the past three seasons on DVD, back-to-back.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|i have read all of the Reacher books and have enjoyed all of them. Can't wait until the next one comes out !
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's the best book I have ever read!!!!!!I can't believe the story line! You have to read it!! Read it! Read it !
B004EPZ03O|3.0|First, I should say that I've been a Muppet fan for umpteen years.  Jim Henson was a genius, and I miss his sly humor and creativity.  Kermit is still my hero.  That said, I have been looking forward to seeing this latest Muppet movie.  I really like Amy Adams (she was great in &#34;Enchanted&#34;!)  On the positive side, I liked the story, liked seeing some of the older Muppets, and was glad to see/hear that Steve Whitmire is doing an admirable job (better than initially) as Kermit.  The cameos were fun, and Jack Black was a good choice to be starring with the Muppets.<br /><br />I know that Muppet features are made to appeal to kids and adults, on different levels, which this accomplished, but not to the degree of the Henson era.  Maybe I was comparing this one too much with the original &#34;Muppet Movie,&#34; with its wonderful cameos and puns and special effects.  The only word I can think of to describe this feature is &#34;hokey.&#34;  Yeah; I know it's supposed to be corny, and I expect (and enjoy) the corniness.  And there's probably a fine line between corny and hokey.  In my opinion, this movie crossed the line.  I miss the chemistry of Henson and Oz, and to me, you can definitely sense the difference between the original and current performers.  It was an OK movie to see once, but I probably won't watch it again.  I'll look forward to &#34;The Muppets....Again,&#34; though.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have been waiting for this book for a while. It gets back to the original storyline and is one of the yet.
B0063GORYU|4.0|My only standard of comparison is the MS version that came with my laptop.  On that basis, this is as good or better.<br /><br />I like the setting options.  I like the way &#34;Hints&#34; or &#34;Tips&#34; are displayed, showing all possibilities in sequence rather than only the first that comes to scan.  I like the way the stacks are spaced across the screen.<br /><br />The only things I don't like may merely affect only those who are relatively new to touch screen playing. The card may slide past the intended stack and be rejected because it isn't eligible for that stack.  And, often enough to be annoying, a card may not stay on the intended stack after the moving finger is removed but whisk over to the farthest eligible to the right.<br /><br />Overall, very minor dislikes compared with quite a few likes.
B00005K3OT|5.0|It arrived on time, it was packaged perfect for the product, it was in great shape and we enjoy it.
B00AOOIIVA|3.0|After checking out all the reviews I was torn between this one and paranorman. I wish I would of bought paranorman instead. It wasnt that funny. My 10 yr old son thought it was just ok too.

B009A87X80|5.0|I can never get enough of Eva Cassidy. I have enjoyed all of her music and was not disappointed with this one either
B001DHXT20|5.0|It arrived on time, it was packaged perfect for the product, it was in great shape and we enjoy it.
B0031RS69G|5.0|As the title says, loved to humour, loved the story and loved the character. I agree that the later Discworld novels are getting better and better, but as a starting point this is as The Colour Of Magic is as good as it gets. I laughed, I giggled and I chuckled. A very enjoyable book - I think the luggage will probably become my all time favoured character.

B004SBX112|2.0|really looked forward to this, but could not actually get it downloaded. It was a waste of time and change .
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I love being able to find old friends, keep up with their families and all the fun things they are doing.<br /><br />I do not like that it is hard to control who can see your pictures and information.  Plus the fact that they are always changing things up and it is hard to keep up with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great graphics and high game quality.  I absolutely recommend this app. It is AMAZING.  So much better than any other game I have played before. You should totally get this app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game, can not get enough of it.  I have to play at least one game everyday.<br />Easy enough for anyone to play but always a challenge.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I picked this up after watching the Les Mis movie. I'd been warned that the historical narrative made it hard to get into, but I've enjoyed reading it so far. I have appreciated the back story to each character, highlighting the shortcuts the musical/movie had to take.<br /><br />Definitely recommended if you're not afraid of long sentences.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game, easy, but challenging. It makes you think and is very addictive.  Great game for all ages.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This is a awsome show I love it! But the first season was alot better though. The new season is also alot longer then the first witch I like i wish the first one was longer but this is my favrite show sence lost
0385535147|5.0|The Racketeer was a very interesting and compelling novel. It lived up to Grisham's reputation and might even have succeeded in embellishing it.
B000002L68|5.0|I love Prince and his music so I had these songs a long time ago on tape now I just had to have the CD.  I love all of his music and plus we are born on the same date.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like the interesting and complex story, with quite a surprise ending.  It paints successfully a very depressing picture of the judicial system.
1451695195|2.0|there is very little discussion on his so called experience in heaven,the book is mostly of his family and his time in the hospital. very disappointed.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hi I'm Emily woods<br /> I'm a tiger woods wife<br /> He is amazing<br />I thought he was cheating on me with  Donald trump<br />But I was wrong
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Like many others have figured out this game is fun until they start asking u to pay for energy, emergencies building. Find aim e way for people to play without having to keep shelling out real money. If you only have 2 upgrade once then I would have done it but I am not going to keep paying 11.99 to play for 3 hours. Not worth it. Shame on u for even thinking ppl would do that. Game would be best game yet except for the cash issue.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and my dad does not have to by me a horse<br />Yay lol yay lol yay lol yay lol yay lol yay lol yay minecraft is better yay lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game ever just wish it would be easier to get gems<br />Awesome horse game<br />You should really get thus game
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book. At first..I thought..ahh..I'll try, and quickly got sucked in. Then all of a sudden...wait..that's it...ahhh...quick..download Book Two...hurry........Stand by..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is one of my favorites.  It really keeps you thinking.  Some levels are complicated, but all are fun.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I loved this sci fi/time travel/telekinesis movie.  It was different than any other film of any of these genres that I've seen before and I thought it held up all the way through the movie. I even liked the ending though some people don't.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt was great as Young Joe; Bruce Willis did a credible job as Old Joe. I liked Emily Blunt as Sara and absolutely loved Pierce Gagnon as the young boy Cid.<br /><br />There were some fun special effects and some cool futuristic touches. All in all, a movie I recommend.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|This is a great collection of songs. Sara shows good vocal range a fresh song writing style and a bit of whimsy.<br />This is one artist that will be fun to follow.
B0092QITO2|5.0|I enjoyed the original [[ASIN:B000IHL52W Total Recall]] so I was a little apprehensive about seeing the remake. But I liked it - a lot. I mean, Colin Farrell is in the remake. Much better eye candy than Arnold. And for the men's enjoyment, Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale - both beautiful as always.<br /><br />I liked the Asian lean of the Colony and the special effects were fun. The storyline was enough different that it wasn't a strict copy of the original but there was enough of the original framework that I wasn't totally lost.<br /><br />If you liked the original, I think you'll like this one too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't wait for this season to start! It is great to have access on my Kindle Fire HD anywhere I go!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I thought this was an incredible purchase! 3 bluray movies for 30$. The latest movie was 20$ as a standalone. This was an amazing value.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This is the pefect little baby. I bought her for my 7 yr old,  and while she is very little she is adorable. You will not fe dissapointed.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it as a way to pass some free time. Like the horses and cant wait to fill my stable<br />. Will play this dureing lunch hour
B004KRQFI0|4.0|Enjoyed the mixes on this CD even though there are not many tracks and then it remixes those tracks already on the CD.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys exciting club beats.
125000568X|5.0|this was a great product id get more if i could!! nothing was missing and it got here on time!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|great book - just what I ordered<br /><br />blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I read this book for a book club not thinking I would like it at all.  At first I was turned off by the fact that the chapters were flip flopping between characters, but I began to enjoy the different perspectives.  Once I got past chapter eight, I couldn't stop reading.  I had to know what happened next.  The romance was lovely but the mystery of what was going to come of Logan and Elizabeth is what kept me intrigued.  I thought the ending was sad but felt like the story was complete.  I'm going to watch the movie with my book club, hopefully it does the book justice!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I didn't give this version a chance because all I could think of was the bad Stallone movie. I was wrong. I would equate this to the comical Batman movies vs Batman Begins. It was well made and the script was very good. Karl Urban is fantastic as Dredd. I hope they make the rest of the rumored trilogy. Give it a chance.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is super awesome I really recommend you should get this app it I really good for the kindle fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001HN69AE|4.0|I'll preface my review by making a few initial points: I am not a die-hard Dragonball fan but I am an anime fan and have, over the course of many years, caught much of the series. I enjoy the series and love the mythology and characters but yes, I am one of those people who got a bit bogged down in the filler. Back in high-school and college I had many friends who lived and died by Dragonball Z. I completely understand that as there are series that I am like that with. I make this point because I think I'm actually the target audience even though that would seem contrary to making a movie based on anime with a huge following.<br /><br />My friends (the big Dragonball Z fans) and a few of the people I overheard in the theater (could also tell they were huge Dragonball Z fans) absolutely hated this movie. I get that and I respect that and here's why. I think DBZ fans even more than some other fans (Star Wars, Star Trek, etc) hold this series very very dear and expect it to live up to the standard of the anime mainly because this is a series that takes an investment (both in time and money) to call yourself a die-hard fan. There are hundreds of episodes to watch and this series has been repacked many, many, MANY times especially in America and many of those fans have repurchased it every time. That's a huge commitment and they expected to see a return on that investment. But that's not what they received.<br /><br />This movie is most definitely a reboot of the mythos. I mentioned Smallville in my review title and I think that pretty much sums it up. When Smallville started I was a little put off by the changes they made but by Season 10 I was sad to see it go. This is Dragonball if it were a teen sci-fi drama. But it's also one of the only retellings this story has had. Superman has had many incarnations. So has Batman, the X-Men and any number of other superheroes. But Goku and his pals have pretty much only had one. Sure there is the manga and the anime and there are differences but it's still that same core story. This is a fanbase who haven't really had a retelling and for some, that's a big pill to swallow.<br /><br />I'm not going to say this is a perfect movie. It's predictable, it does make some odd choices even for a reboot and a few of the performances are a little stiff (I thought Chow Yun-Fat's Roshi was pretty standout and really seemed to have fun with the role, James Marsters's Piccolo was also good and appropriately stiff I thought but then again I love James Marsters and Piccolo was always one of my favorite characters) but it also makes some good nods to the original in telling it's rebooted story (even though Roshi is in the city he manages to live on an island, Goku still has a big appetite, etc). Overall this is a fun, family-friendly, fast-paced and exciting movie with some very good action...it's just not for Dragonball Z fans.<br /><br />And that's one final distinction I'll make. I've tried to be careful where I typed \\"Dragonball\\" and where I typed \\"Dragonball Z\\" (hopefully I didn't mix up) because this isn't an adaptation of the more hyper-kinetic action-packed Dragonball Z which I think disappointed many of those fans. Granted this is again a reboot and changing canon but this is definitely an adaptation of the first, more adventure-based series. I know there are many many fans who are fans of all the series but I also know people who are fans of Z and really don't care much for the original series or GT because it wasn't as fight-based as Z is and I wonder how those who are fans of the whole franchise (as opposed to mostly Z-focused) approached this movie. My older brother was a big fan of Z and had seen some of the original and GT and was a little let down by the movie but still thought it was kinda fun and when I got him to look at the movie in the light of not being based off of Z he actually agreed with me and saw it in a better light.<br /><br />It's a shame it didn't do well and didn't get to continue. I've read recent interviews where some of the actors kinda felt like the movie was laughable. Even in Japan it was seen as kind of a joke and isn't held in high regard but again, I get that. This is a series that is probably one of, if not THE most important and influential anime series EVER and I get wanting to treat it like the Bible. Completely understand. But I think some fans may have warmed to this Smallville-esque retelling of events and may would have even had some fun seeing the more familiar, action-oriented Z storylines told in a new light. Ah well.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're a casual Dragonball or anime fan, you'll probably like this or if you're looking for a good, okay for the whole family action-adventure story then give it a try.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The author has a funny writing style and main character which I could (as an engineering) identify myself verymuch. Even if in the middle of book there are some boring parts, it all comes together to a glorious grande finale.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I and even our grown children and their families love &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; not only for the excellent actors and story line, but also for the historical setting, period dress, rules/manners of the era. We have enjoyed many of the British historical nonfiction biographies and fictional accounts of events and times produced as a series. We search for entertainment that does not contain nudity or gratuitous sex and unnecessary &#34;blue language&#34;. Thank you, England.
0307730697|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates what the men and woman, who serve in our armed forces, sacrifice for our freedoms!  Adam Brown is one of my heros.  It is amazing what he overcame to become a SEAL!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am a free lance photographer and i have to take note on the go and not having to read back over hand written notes and retype them later is great.  Just email the note to myself or my editors, perfect.  What i would love to see is an option to switch from typing to handwriting. Sometimes i need to get signatures from clients and having to  leave evernote and start another app seems unnecessary.  First world problem i know.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have missed all the past seasons and wanted to catch up...this was a fun, inexpensive way to view season one
B00005ABTT|1.0|It was a great disappointment. My husband and I are avid Bond fans and have collected all the James Bond films with two exceptions: the newest one, Skyfall, not in DVD form yet and Never Say Never Again.  After looking in all available local stores, decided to try Amazon and was delighted to find it. It was right before Christmas and since it didn't arrive in time, I typed and laminated the tittle, placed in a gift wrapped box and gave to husband for Christmas. An IOU.  On New Years Eve, we got the DVD, sat down to watch it, full of happy expectations and it would not play.  We did not know about \\"Regions\\". We bought it from Amazon or an Amazon approved vendor and didn't expect to buy a bootleg item. We were very unhappy.  I returned it, of course, and we are still looking for Never Say Never Again, thought not on line. We have always been pleased with Amazon so we'll continue shopping there but will be a little more careful.
B000I9VOO4|3.0|Superb acting by all the players, particulary Gregory Peck.  However, no one who loves this movie should neglect the book, which has a quite different set of emphases.  The courtroom drama is quite good, but disproportionately emphasized, with the result that the simple charm and poignancy of the childhood narration is lost.
B004IE0NY2|5.0|New dredd disappointed me, so I had to rent the original.<br />Plus this older one was closer to the original comic book series
0743270754|5.0|This is history at its best: hypnotizing relation of Lincoln's personality and genius garnered from the vast treasury of his personal correspondence.  A Pulitzer prize winning book with a scholarly mastery of detail at its best, it is nonetheless so readable and charming a narration that it could have been the product of a novelist as engaging as Dickens.
B0056369RO|5.0|It's the full album XD I'm not really sure what it wants me to say. It was music I wanted and I got it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am usually bored especially in the beginning of books. I have not read many books because of the boredom factor. This book had started out kind of slow in the very beginning but, got interesting very early on. It was like my subconscious kept saying what's  her story?  LOVED IT!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was very easy to follow but still kept my interest and made it a very addicting game. The animations were a little sloppy but all in all it was a great game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun. I enjoy playing it. So much better than the first one. If you don't have it you need to get it.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Majorly, totally, butt-crazy in love. I love the story, I love the writing, and I love the setting. I love the secondary characters, I love Anna and I love, love, love, love, LOVE &Eacute;tienne St. Clair.<br /><br />There are two things I don't love about it, though: the name and the cover. Unfortunately, those two things made me dismiss it for months. Sure, I had it in my TBR pile, because I was vaguely attracted to the description on the back - about a girl sent to boarding school in France, where she meets a totally swoon-worthy (and totally unavailable) boy. But, I'm ashamed to say, I judged it by the cover. That cover is cheesy. And the name? Also kinda cheesy. So I assumed the book would be cheesy, too. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that. I enjoy a bit of cheesiness. Like I said, I still picked the book up. But I dismissed it as a back-up read, something to have on hand in case I was bored or in need of a quick fix of fluff.<br /><br />Then I came across countless reviews that said it was oh-so-amazing. I began to think maybe I'd judged it too harshly. So, curious to see what all the fuss was about, I picked it up on Sunday, at around 5pm. By 1am I was more than half way through and deliriously tired, but still had to force myself to put it down. Because I was already in love. The story was charming, the characters real, the chemistry sizzling, and woven together it was all so refreshingly normal. But that doesn't mean it was ordinary. Far from it. Yep, I admit it: I was really wrong about this book. Which is my hard luck, because it means I spent months with this awesomeness right under my nose and didn't know it. Sure Anna and the French Kiss is fun and it's fluffy, but it's so not cheesy - and it's most definitely not a back-up read. It's a must-read. Like, now!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I've played most of G5's games and this is one of the better ones. Easy to follow, great graphics and story. Highly recommend.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It's a great app for my kindle. It's very efficient and It allows me not to worry about the power for several day. Finally it doesn't need to fully charged for days.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Very pleased with this case. As others have said in their reviews, the stand is a bit flimsy. But it works fine for watching videos.
0887081770|3.0|I love Eric Carle, and still do. I also love this story. However, I seem to have not looked at the dimensions of the book, it is tiny!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game itself is great, a vast improvement over the original. My biggest complaint is that it will not let you close the game.  The only way to exit the game is to hit the home button which leaves the game running in the background. Seems like an important thing to fix.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|This book is for  people who love the classic books! You should not read this book if you don't like pirates.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Well at least the third installment had a little more story going on than the second. But I think she could have done it all in a single book and chopped half of the three books out. You could see her writing get a little better as things went along. It's quite the fantasy of a story, to be sure. So much was unbelievable though, even for a romance. And I'm still scratching my head over the time frame and ages of Ana and Christian.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a fun game but has some lagging problems once in a while, its controls are basic so its easy, and very fast paced. The graphics are exceptional compared to the temple run 1, and there is a lot more<br />In it the store has a lot more and has incorporated diamonds (like most free game nowadays) over all a good sequel to a crapy game!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The writing didn't get even acceptable until halfway through, so I suspect it was her first foray. Her story hooks you because it's so titillating, but the ages of her two protagonists are unbelievable. And the rate at which our girl 'grows' experiencially is also just ridiculous. And of course, it's one big cliche. Somehow though, you don't put it down because of the entertainment value, which is embarrassing.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I as so excited to see that this concert finally became available on DVD.  It's classic as I was to go to that concert many years ago.  Great purchase and find!  Best Christmas present ever!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I'm pleased that E L James and crew made a bunch of money for themselves, but honestly, this one didn't even need to be written. It's really just one long sex scene. Which is fine, I guess, if that's what your looking for at the expense of a story line.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Tho very technically written,I did enjoy all the information. A must read for anyone who cares about our food we eat....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is awesome you should get it I play it every day it so awesome I love it pice
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book read all her books. Easy read even better reading it on a tablet. Recommend to other readers. And cheap
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This reminds me of the iPhone app until they updated it . needs lot of work . please update as soon as possible .
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a very good book. I recommend it for fans of Rick Riordan. It is part of a very good series.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I have had the backpack for one month now.  I received it for free with the Rebel T3.  I chose this over a traditional camera bag.  The first few times I have used it, I thought it was a little awkward.  But now I am getting used to it.<br /><br />I can also fit my MacBook Pro 13&#34; in the middle zipper pocket!  Wow!
0316227706|5.0|I first seen this book at the mall during Christmas time.  I picked it up and laughed so hard that I stopped people walking by and they shared a laugh with me.  What great shots!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a fun app. I wish that my rescue was real!!! There are a few bugs like it has to force close every other time I open it but overall good app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This doesn't really need an explanation of why it's so awesome. But if you need some words of encouragement about whether or not to buy it: JUST DO IT!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I maded a awesome castle.then a nether portal shut my device off because it was gliching and it deleted my whole file I worked monthes on this game is stupid
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love playing Minecraft so that's why I bought the Pocket Edition. However, it is so hard to maneuver around. Because the screen is so small it's hard to build in a fast manner, which is what you normally want to do with Minecraft. Part of me is upset that I spent money on this, but the other part of me just keeps on playing it. Maybe in a few weeks I'll have built a house. Lol.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|Getting started I was impressed with the abundance of features. That lasted until I had worked on a few variations of pages and notebooks. I tried some of the templates and had trouble scrolling from bottom to top of page. Then I wanted to continue working on a page I'd started earlier. The scroll swiped like a rubber band and allowed me to see text boxes and drawing objects towards the top of the page, but bounced back to the bottom the instant I removed the stylus. It was impossible to edit something at the top of the screen.<br />I also found the tool sets cryptic and not organized like any Apple or Microsoft, or other android apps<br />I am deleting the app as soon as I submit this review.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|A richly textured novel that breaks stereotypes, causing the reader to struggle with preconceived notions of society in third world and post industrial societies.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't know there was more than one book...so after getting to the last page of book one, I had to keep on going. This one was just as hang on the edge of your seat, what could be next great!!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Great game!  Great variation on puzzle games.  Challenging, but not frustrating so.  Offers hours of gameplay.  Definitely worth the download!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After hearing about all the whoha, I had to read this book. I had no idea it was as descriptive as it is. Everyone probably dabbles a bit here and there when it comes to sex. But to jump in with both feet like these characters do is just a terrific way for the average person to get to explore the possibilties. Grab a seat and get reading!!!!!!!!!!
B00AKKS278|5.0|For those of you that are not familiar with Hal Elrod, I highly recommend that you check this out! You will not be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Once you get the idea...it is just the same thing over and over. Takes about 2 trys to get it.
B00A757EFW|5.0|a great game for all kids i love it i am so happy nothing more to say than that  !!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not a way to live your own life, so what a great adventure this was!! Wish it just kept on going.
B009O36EO0|5.0|Unique voice, nice mix of ballads and danceable tracks that make your hit the repeat button over and over again!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's addictive to play and really fun yet kinda hard if you don't got a way to get gold  \\"(>°~°)>---  hehe
B00846REIS|5.0|everything about this book is wonderful!! This book series has been so refreshing to read and has made me so happy! I would recommend reading this book series.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Very good condition. This is one of my favorite pixar disney films yet. I may take up archery myself. Merida is one cool female character.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book so much, it was so hard to put down! Such an amazing storyline and perfect characters!!!
B00946WMXY|3.0|Typical Bond movie.  Has its cheesy moments like they all do, the women always fall for him, computing feats are always dubious.  The action is half decent.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|One of the best movies of all time! This is a great action movie that my brother told me I had to see. So glad I listened!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love, love, love Downton Abbey Seasons 1 & 2.  I will start Season 3 this weekend.  We need more of this type entertainment.<br />I want to find out more about the house.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was so funny I watched it twice in 48 hours that I had it. I plan on purchasing it int he future!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The kind of book you read in an evening and end up feeling good after you read. A different kind of love story.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|One of the best tv shows I watched when growing up. I love everything about Daria. So happy I finally own the series!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|What a surprise and a treat this movie is.  Anything with Judith Dench in it promises to be engaging and well-acted.  This movie was exceptional.  The story was interesting and enthralling!
B00340I4KG|5.0|Nic Cage and John Travolta....are you kidding me...AWESOME. The first time I saw this movie it blew my mind. Love these overly action movies!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|The product really works, got my blades sharp easily but I got disappointed with the Tapered diamond rod, which I used a couple of times and that's it, it got smooth and don't sharp well anymore. Maybe I was expecting it to be heavy duty and it is not. But for sharpening small blades it's pretty decent.
1401230423|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my brother. He loves this series so we got it for him for Xmas and his Birthday.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This series is a great recreation of the books.  Though I may have changed a few things or added something else, it captures the story in all its glory!!!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Starts a little slow but has really good action throughout. Would love to see a sequel to this movie. Worth renting!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i just downloaded it its great but needs a few updates on graphics and needs a few adjustments other than that its a blast
B000X418UO|5.0|Awesome old school Nic Cage. This movie is non-stop action. Even though I've seen it more than 50 times I love watching it when I'm doing stuff around the house.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the person really has been enjoying it. Also it was shipped promptly and arrived in a timely matter.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|NEW and more awesome especially with the giant king monkey chasing you! What would you do? Epic game guys don't you thin
B007H9B8FS|5.0|Garbage are my favorite band, living.  Great talent, charisma and artists that have their own sound.  You really can't go out and get exactly from anyone else what you'll find here.  Their music soothes my soul.  Love the message, the sound and the emotions.  They don't need any gimmicks, its about the music.  Seen them in concert.  Even left the country to see them in concert.  There's only one song of theirs I can't always listen to and it isn't on this album.  If I'm angry, sad, mad, glad, horny, or whatever there's always something to throw on and feel better to, or think about or get inspired by.<br /><br />Someday I should really redo this review to include information that would better describe things in a way that would really help one decide, but don't most people listen to songs, before they buy them?  Or buy songs unheard from artists they already love and trust?  Really, go listen to some samples, play some vids and get hooked.<br /><br />This music has been there through the best and worst years of my life.  Including this album and 2012.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! So full of emotion, it'll literally take your breath away. Holder and Sky are my new favorite couple. A definite must-read!!!
B00701L5XS|4.0|It's kinda large in bytes.  My shoelaces still come untied.  It's great for learning knots.  This really is a useful.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Pay close attention to the dialogue and especially the characters.....otherwise (like many bad reviews on AMAZON) you will feel like you wasted time...time is not wasted but well spent when one focuses in an attempt to dissect the plot: that is half the fun a some movies..NO?. Bale and Jackman do a fine job. For me it was as jaw-dropping as the end of the 'Usual Suspects'.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|i LOVED this bag when i first got it.  I've had it just over a year and it's already torn to shreds and needs to be replaced.  the hooks on the front are broken so nothing will stay in there and the main zipper broke.  the bag is almost useless at this point.  I thought it was a great bargain, but instead i should have spent the money and gotten something with better quality.  don't buy.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I like this app and the sounds that are available are nice. However, it keeps freezing up and restarting my phone. Will wait for the next release. (HTC Droid Incredible)
0345803493|5.0|This book is hot and steamy, great read. I recommend it to everyone.  I love all 3 of these books
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book it was awesome very exciting n thrilling. I can't wait to read the next one. I'm excited
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I had to get this on my Kindle fire so I could read the books I imported.  It is great.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|Krall has a soothing voice and easy style.  Great for background listening.  If a more upbeat tempo is desired, then other artists are probably better.
0345803507|5.0|These books are off the chain, I recommend them to everyone.  This book can get you hot and bothered. GREAT Book
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Another great love story from Nicholas Sparks.  He never fails to deliver. Great book to curl up with on a dreary winter day.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I would really love to rate this app but it won't allow me to listen to it. Some one else wrote that you have to rate it before you can use it. How dumb is that?!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent escape from day to day stress.  The book flows well and I could not put it down.  Can't wait for book two.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Very awesome game wifh fluid graphics and flawless gameplay. Its actually really addictive, thats definitely no lie. The only trouble that i have with it is that there isnt really that many levels and the final level is pretty well impossible to beat.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|I'd heard a radio interview of Shin which prompted me to purchase this book. Unfortunately the entire book contained little more information than the 5 minute radio interview. Interesting read but I felt the content was drawn out and padded with additional general information in order to turn (what still is an incredible story) into a full book, rather than an article.
B009B50QOU|4.0|Its not 90's Greenday classic but close !! they obviously have some sort of formula they keep locked in a vault b/c the new pop punk bands can't seem to figure it out.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have had no problem with this app except for one feature. I haven't figured out (or it can't) how to set saved searches. Other than that it works great.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Fun read. I really wanted King to stop using the word obdurate, but he obdurately refused. At times a little wordy, but the plot kept me reading.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app. fast play with hints if you need them. The settings have lots to choose from as well as choosing from one to four suits to play with.

B007W4OZ76|5.0|Sorry for the short review, but here goes -<br /><br />This app is exactly what I wanted so that I could manage downloaded files and access my Dropbox from my kindle fire. Works great once you download the original program and the add on.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|I have only seen the Special Edition Home Video Version of &#34;Avatar&#34;(3-Disc Blu-Ray Box Set),Disc #1 with the extra 8 minutes added to the movie for a total of 24 extra minutes of new footage put back into the film and it looked and sounded perfect! I am very much looking foward to watching the 45 minutes or more of extra deleted scenes never seen or used before,as well as the other extra bonus features like behind-the-scenes footage,interviews with cast & crew,special effects featurettes,a huge gallery of production art,production photos,behind-the-scenes photos,promotional photos,movie poster photos,and much,much,more.This Special Edition Box Set is well worth it for the &#34;Avatar&#34; and James Cameron fans,as well as for serious movie fans too,I very highly recommend this set.A+ for the Video/Audio Quality too all the way!

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The premise of this movie was potentially very funny and entertaining.  Instead it quickly degraded into unnecessarily foul language and toilet humor, with very few laughs.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks book.  Wonderful.  I have almost all of this books and I have read them twice.  I always promise myself I won't cry but lets just say, I get the most out of the book when I do cry.  Right???  Keep on writing.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I listened to this album when I was in jr high. It is just as good now as it was then. Classic.

1451695195|4.0|A fascinating look at a neurosurgen's experience of connecting to a realm not of this world. It gets a bit medically technical at some points, but the story is fascinating.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|YES THANKS SO MUCH I LOVE THE ORIGINAL AND THE SEQUEL LOOKS STUNNING CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY AGAIN THANKS&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;<br />ANYONE WHO GIVES THIS 2 OR 1&#9733; IS JUST ANGRY THERE'S A SEQUEL
B006LSZECO|3.0|Had a difficult time getting into the story but got more exciting as I got into it. Ending kind of leaves you hanging.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Lots of fun, my 11 year loves this game and so do I amd I am 38 years old! Worth the download.  Also not a bunch of annoying ads.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|One of my all time favorites. Well worth the money. Everyone should see this especially children. Best childhood movie in the world.
B008S4FZHI|3.0|To be fair, I liked the book, can't say I loved it though.<br />There were certain parts that were boring. Although I understand there might be plenty of people who have never read one of P. Cornwell's books, her describing her main characters over and over again (on every single book) might become a little bit tedious.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Got this for my dad for Christmas and he absolutely loved. David Attenborough voice is great with the footage provided. We sat there for hours just watching this program over and over again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|U no I loved the first 1 but this 1 is the best so far so I suggest this app
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I bought this for my family, and my parents and my in-laws loved it! Difficult to pick any one person as the best!!!
B007AJFSJW|5.0|This is of highest public significance!  You are negligent if you have not read this. \\"Natural\\" experiments support the theses.
B00ATCIPQA|5.0|Those who challenge Dr. Alexander's findings cannot disprove Dr. Alexander's experience now can they?  To accept this account or challenge his statements of did he or didn't he is an individual belief.  My NDE left me amazed, confused, and convinced, but I neither spoke of it nor read anything remotely related to NDEs until I read and listened to Proof of Heaven.  Dr. Alexander's descriptive narrative brought to me validation of my own remarkable journey. With each reading and listen I have come to the same conclusion: I have experienced a very personal journey and life-changing event.  It is a gift I embrace and treasure.  The aftermath of my NDE has brought me knowledge, peace, and happiness, not fear. With each passing moment in my life, I give thanks for what was originally perceived as a near tragedy. I am forever grateful for my life event and memory of my journey.  I am pleased to recommend the book/audiobook and CDs for Proof of Heaven.<br /><br />Linda W.- Texas
0345803485|1.0|I am not the type of person to want to write a bad review. I have to express myself on this one though. This book was SO BAD that I read 3/4 and threw it in the trash in disgust that I wasted my time reading any of it!<br />I am also a little disturbed that this was actually a best seller. What in the world is wrong with people? I'd like to think that it only sold so many copies because everyone was so curious as to how a book could ACTUALLY be that terrible. I have to admit, it's part of the reason I bought the book myself. I WANTED to like it, but I have to agree with all the other horrible reviews I've read.<br />The characters are boring. I also couldn't figure out what the plot was. It seemed like the book was me witnessing two boring idiots having a dysfunctional relationship and I kept accidentally knowing too much about their weird sex life. AGGGHHH I wish I could forget what I have read!
0679745653|5.0|The book came just in time, and in very good conditions. It's almost brand new; the money was worth it.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Good game & fun to play nice graphics and easy to learn just like the other birds games that are out
B007BFSYMS|2.0|Nice selection of sounds although some of them are not  what I would call soothing.  Vacuum cleaner?  Two stars only for intrusive requests for comments an lack of quit option. &quot;Force close&quot; is not an exit button. Fix and I will give it better review
B0047SF41G|3.0|The action was OK, but let's face it, none of the stars in this Predators movie is up to the muscle-bound fury of a Schwarzenegger or a Carl Weathers.  You really want to think that Earth's best is going up against this alien scum - you don't really feel that with this cast.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Got to admit, one of the funniest SitComs to come around since Scrubs.  We are glued to the episodes, sometimes watching 4 or more in a row.  Very Very Very funny!!!
1400069289|5.0|Charles Duhigg's discussion of habits in people, organizations, and societies is an interesting read.  Each chapter tells several stories in parallel of a key component of habits and gives useful advice on how to apply to every day life.  Want to know why your diet isn't working or your plan to quit smoking hasn't taken hold?  Check out this book to see how to change the cue, habit, and reward cycle.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I feel like this movie got the shaft when it was marketed. A lot of people would enjoy DREDD if they gave it a cance!
B003L77G6A|5.0|It's &#34;The Big Bang Theory.&#34; LOL Is there REALLY anything else you need to know about this set? LOL I'm an uber-fan of the show. It was a Christmas present to myself and Hubby. LOL
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This just became my favorite story. It is simply impossible to imagine this story until you have seen the whole thing. Inspiring in so many ways and beautifully told.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This story is  a convincing view of the world from the eyes of a young man with autism. The story is moving. The mystery is intriguing and the insights are enlightening.

B000YFYOAS|4.0|You have to expect gore when dealing with vampires killing vampires and the favorite weapon is a sword.  Lots of action, reasonable story line.  Just don't let the kids watch.
B000I3W1XS|5.0|The movie was really great, I fully intend to watch it again, i also hope it comes to prime. Thank you

1601251505|5.0|It has every thing you want to know about the DnD 3.75.... well except the creatures, that's another book. Great book thoug.
B0058O84G0|3.0|I can recommend this book. It is an easy read, and the characters are clearly defined. The diverse stories about them, and linking them, are interesting and give a good picture of what was going on in the world at the time. I subsequently saw a printed copy at a bookseller, and could not believe how thick and heavy the hard copy is. I doubt I would have read it in printed format.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|\\"Prometheus\\" certainly looks great; its production design echoes \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" without being a slavish copy; it's shot well, and its locations and milieu are convincing.  However, like a pretty girl with no brains, good looks aren't enough to keep you happy for more than a few minutes.  It doesn't start well, with the movie being very confused about a solar system vs. a galaxy vs. planets.  (It doesn't help that later there is discussion of being \\"half a billion miles from Earth.\\"  Um, Pluto is further than that.)  Then you scratch your head more when you discover that this trillion-dollar mission is crewed by an assemblage of idiots and putzes who are briefed on the mission _only after they wake up from hypersleep_.  I'm not buying it.  I'm also not buying how the Engineers can have human DNA when biochemistry and genetics show that all animal life on Earth has common DNA elements, and human is 99% chimpanzee DNA.<br /><br />Stuff happens, some more convincing than others, and we reach the third act.  The last 45 minutes or so kicks into gear, and makes you suspend your disbelief.  Nooma Rapace channels some Sigourney Weaver in her own way.  I contend that it ends strong.<br /><br />On the plus side, Michael Fassbender steals the movie with a wonderful, restrained presence that he makes his own; he is not a retread of Ash or Bishop, but his own android personality.<br /><br />The shame is that there is a really good movie stuck in here, with some great concepts, and with some more work this could have been the best Alien movie since \\"Aliens.\\"<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br />Given that Bad Robot controls all movie and TV sci-fi in the US now, my conjecture is that there are two factions of Engineers, one of whom built the humans and one that wants to destroy them, and that they are future humans who returned to the past for some reason - hence the human DNA.  If you watch Fringe - another Bad Robot show - I contend that the Engineers are the Alien universe version of the Observers.e version of the Observers.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|These young actors are pretty good at laying the foundation for the other series (Kirk, Bones, Spock) with enough of a twist to enable this series to develop on its own in future movies and probably series.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|I clicked on this ap, but it has not downloaded to my Kindle Fire, How Come?  I do not understand. My kindle was off when I ordered this ap, along with 20 other free aps.

B008X9Z37A|2.0|Name: Belkin Classic Case<br />Case Type: Bookcover<br />How is the Kindle held in?: Elastic / pleather rings at the corners<br />Padding: Zero<br /><br />Notes: The Belkin Classic Case is really about as basic as you can get as far as a case goes. It covers your Kindle, and that's about it. The Kindle is held in by four corner straps - one half of the strap is made of elastic which gives the straps a little bit of give, making it a little easier to sneak your Kindle inside. When fully secured, the Kindle feels much more secure than some of the cases made by Verso, but not nearly as secure as the stress/friction clasps that the higher-end Belkin cases use. The padding is nearly non-existent. Like most cases, the inside is a faux-velvet material, glued on to a stiff cardboard-like backbone. The front of the case has a zero padding - it is fabric on cardboard. The case does not have any type of strap that keeps it closed. In general, this is a very basic case. It'd probably protect your Kindle while inside your purse or backpack, but not much else. A good buy if you just want something to cover your Kindle, otherwise avoid this case.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|For as far as it goes it is great.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to<br />see if it is for them.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie and feel it was very underrated in the box office! It's smart, hilarious, has amazing a Capella arrangements (I'm a choir girl!) and sock puppets! Somehow, you put that all together and it so works. Buy it and you will not be disappointed!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I had this book when I was little and now I can read it anytime to my little girl!  I love this book!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|About time that Castle and Beckett got together.  Its refreshing and yet doesn't significantly reduce from the humor of the series.  It is noticeable by now that everyone on the team has picked up a lot of Castle's traits when theorizing about the crime of the week.  Enjoyable series.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I've tried to read books by N.Sparks three times now, and I just get bored. I know I like his stories but only after they've been made into movies and the useless stuff is left out. Sorry, 5 stars for the plot but a 1 for the writing style. Very mundane.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Much more important than Words with Friends!  The bookmarking feature is fantastic and I enjoy being able to connect to my local events.
159514188X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought that the flow of the novel was very nice and the author kept the reader interested throughout the whole book. I would recommend this book for teenagers because it is surrounded by a lot of issues that high schoolers go through everyday. Even though the main idea of the book might not be relatable, the ideas surrounding her suicide can be. I would not recommend this book to people who don't like a more depressing read. Throughout the book there are many things that are brought up that could be depressing and or triggering. Throughout the book, Clay, learns more about Hannah and himself by listening to what she went through. I think this is a fantastic book. It really makes you think about yourself and your life and it makes you want to change for the better. When you listen to all the reasons of why she killed herself, you realize how such small things that you wouldn't think would get to a person, actually can drive them to suicide. It makes you want to become a better person and to make sure no one feels the way this girl did. It's sad, heartbreaking, but hopeful and emotional. It's not a book that you can skim through or have for a \\"quick-read\\" because as soon as you get into you you will want to analyze every word that is on the page. It's very deep but still very enjoyable. I really enjoyed this and I think many other people would too.
0743270754|5.0|I Ioved the movie, Lincoln,  and wanted to read the book upon which it was based. I was not disappointed. It is even better than the movie.
0865479410|2.0|I was intrigued enough to borrow this book from the library after I heard about it on the radio from a Slate.com reviewer.  I find books like Norman Vincent Peale's \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\" really depressing.  That book served to remind me of what was wrong with me and even made me feel like a bad Christian because I couldn't make the book work for me.  So, I was eager to read The Antidote....  I found the first part of this book interesting and calming but not really helpful once I encountered a real challenge in my life.  The thing that made me finally quit reading was when I saw that Mr. Burkeman had written on page 70, \\"We can feel the fear and do it anyway.\\"  I searched the page and then the index for any mention of Susan Jeffers.  There wasn't any.  This really burned me up because the one self-help book that has been tremendously helpful to me is called \\"Feel the Fear...and Do It Anyway,\\" which has been around for over 20 years, by Susan Jeffers.  To rip-off the title of a book in the same genre without so much as a nod to the author felt like plagiarism, or at the very least sloppy journalism, to me.  My recommendation is to try Susan Jeffers instead.  \\"Feel the Fear...\\" is a classic, but I also borrowed the \\"Embracing Uncertainty: Breakthrough Methods for Achieving Peace of Mind When Facing the Unknown\\" audio book from my library (it's out of print) and found it tremendously helpful to listen to during my commute.
B0049VZ222|4.0|I'm not a great fan of zombies, its just so far fetched.  The characters even in the first season have been dealing with the stresses of the changing world and their personalities are developing faster than in most other series.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Great talks on a variety of subjects that promote rethinking of beliefs. A real eye opener that prompt me to delve deeper into subjects I normally would not explore.
0345528581|2.0|I was really excited to get this book after reading the glowing reviews. The first part of the book is fairly interesting (gives the reasons behind how sugar, carbs, etc affect our health). I was really disappointed with how he formatted the workouts at the end of the book. He gives exercise to do on Day 1-4, but the number of sets/reps are somewhat hidden in the prior sections. Then you have to flip to the exercises to view how to do them. It would have been better to have the number of reps/sets next to the workout schedule -- even if you are repeating what Ladders, Supersets, etc really mean. As it is now, you constantly flip back and forth through the second half of the book.<br /><br />The title is a little deceiving since on Day 1 - you need a &#34;platform&#34; for the first exercise and then another one suggests two large speakers with a strong pole or crutch to do pull-up like exercises. Who has two large speakers laying around? This isnt the 1980s...conversely you can use a desk, but still seems like a better title might be &#34;You (and some stuff) are your own gym&#34;
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game where you can care for your own horse. Feed that majestic animal and groom it<br /> sometimes take it around the track and jump.
0316187216|5.0|Although I'm not much into westerns, if all of them were written like \\"Red Country\\", I'd be converted.  As with all of Abercrombie's novels, there is so much to love about this book.  It's extremely well-written and well thought out to the very last detail, the characters easy to relate to whether you love or hate them, the clever prose and dark humor keep the reading fun rather than gloomy and depressing, and as we all know, no one writes fight and action scenes as bloody good as Abercrombie.  Yes, sad to say, one of my all-time favorite characters finally bites the dust in this book, yet I trust that the author has plenty more fascinating characters up his sleeve yet to create for our future enjoyment.<br /><br />When I pick up another novel of Abercrombie's, I know that I'm in for a great time regardless of what the story is about. I have read all of his novels and I have yet to be disappointed, and \\"Red Country\\" is no exception.  So anxious for the next adventure to begin!

B005MMJ84K|5.0|Must. Read. Last. Book. The book was wonderful. Full of suspense and I liked the way it alternated from the then and now thing.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A page turner with well developed characters, sharp wit, and a great ending. Flynn knows how to hook you in right away, making her characters just familiar enough to make you feel you know them, then taking you on a wild ride of ingenuity. Highly recommended for a fun read!
0345522478|5.0|Atticus is a great character.  He is likeable and he feels real.  It seems you can't turn around anymore without bumping into a book about mythological creatures, however when they are done right it simply doesn't matter.  This book is done right and stands out.  It is not simply another cookie cutter mystical creature story.  Even if you don't like stories in that genre I would recommend this book.  It is a simple and highly enjoyable read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is amazing ....everything can be customized to you.... look, feel, dimness, music, buzzer, snooze time+ amount of snoozes aloud and Evan how you dismiss the alarm (shaking or math problems etc.)
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I like this case very much. It protects my Kindle well and is multi functional. I would recommend it anyone.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|so i was playin it for like 20 mins i got up to go do something and it crashed after i can back now its not coming back on and iys such a great game that i had to give it three stars but it doesnt work i am so fustrated
1439102813|5.0|This book did such a wonderful job of introducing me to what it like having Alzheimers from both the patient's point of view as well as the family's point of view.  My grandmother was diagnosed with the disease recently and I was very confused about what it meant.  Why can the patient remember some things and not others? Why doesn't the patient accept that you are her relative even after you tell her? What is going on in her mind? Who does she think she is? Why is she so miserable and wanting to sleep all of the time, when the Alzeheimer's facility is perfectly lovely? This fictional story just put the whole thing into great perspective and did it in a very interesting way with a great story.  I highly recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a parent, this book made me think about things that I have never imagined.  A powerful story of a young man, charged with murder, told from his father's thoughts .
1118109791|5.0|Yeah! I was soooo happy when my books arrived yesterday! I started studying from the GMAT for Dummies while I waited on their arrival. They came very quickly and in perfect condition! I look forward to a 700 score on the test!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I've been waiting for this game for like ever. downloaded it. next day it wouldn't even open. so I removed it from device. tried to reinstall it wouldn't work.I am so mad!!!!<br /><br />Update: called amazon, fixed it! Five stars
B004S5C91Q|2.0|Too hard to read and follow.  The characters are not unlikable...but I certainly had trouble getting to know them.  Really disappointing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game to play. they made it perfect for kindle fire. and if you like building or creating stuff this is a game for your.
B00021HBGS|5.0|The boys just love these and can't wait to take a bath at grandma's house. They stick well and the bag makes for easy clean up and another chance for responsibility teaching.
B008518MOW|5.0|Great movie! Plus with the added 3D features... Makes this movie come to life. Fun fun fun fun fun fun!
0470449764|5.0|Yeah! I was soooo happy when my books arrived yesterday! I started studying from the GMAT for Dummies while I waited on their arrival. They came very quickly and in perfect condition! I look forward to a 700 score on the test!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|easy for the kids to play. the graphics are excellent. it has cute animals and lts of cute stuff like houses ect.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app on my kindle all the time.  It is so useful for wasting time.  Very easy to use.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My two year old loves it she can play it all day long even though she crashes on the first train! Very good for entertaining. Would recommend game to everyone!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This film has a great cast and the locale is breathtaking.  The story line is a little thin in places, but I enjoyed watching it and am sharing with friends.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This was a gift to myself.  I like it very much.  I would recommend this to every country music fan.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I totally agree with my boyfriend when he says that this should be a prerequisite to any dating relationship. The book tells you so clearly how to make it work and last on the most basic and fundamental level. You just have to want to do what the book says. I loved it and will use its teachings for the rest of my life.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is really good. I recommend this book to every one.<br />So buy it its awesome guys buy it
B004T4LUPW|4.0|It is definitely a nice layout for viewing the calendar.  It looks pretty similar to the full site version.  Updating it isn't the easiest thing in the world.  If you need to update your calendar with several events, I'd recommend finding a computer.  Very good if you just need to look at your calendar.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is great Christmas movie and fun for the whole family. Watch it over and over again and it's still funny.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Works nicely on my Kindle Fire. The graphics are great. I've been waiting on a good horse game for my kindle. Cute way to kill some time.
B00000I07P|5.0|Gift...There is no going wrong with a Bon Jovi disc.  Everyone that hears it will agree with that.  I will buy it again I'm sure.
0470449756|5.0|Yeah! I was soooo happy when my books arrived yesterday! I started studying from the GMAT for Dummies while I waited on their arrival. They came very quickly and in perfect condition! I look forward to a 700 score on the test!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story has kept my attention for longer than I expected. Lots of variety and different things to do. Just wish it didn't cost so much to clear land.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I have a friend who loves Barbara Streisand so I saw this and<br />bought it for her for Christmas. She loves it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very easy to use and similar to the one I use on my kindle. Lets you pick up were you left of at home when unexpectedly left with free time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket Edition review: It's fun to play if you're away from a console or pc and have access to a tablet or smartphone. I am using it on Kindle Fire. It's in early development so it's way behind the 360 version and very very behind the pc version. There are no buckets, no maps, no wolfs, no red roses, no music, redstone isn't mineable, in place of a nether portal there is a reactor that creates a small room that randomly generates items and pigmen for a very short time then turns into a massive mess of an obsidion tower. Its a one time use then You have to mine out your reactor, get 4 more blocks of gold and find another place big enough that another tower wont destroy your builds. Next update is suppose to allow redstone mining. Hopefully they update it and the 360 version soon. It's still super fun and I enjoy the challenge of the limitations. Pocket edition &lt; 360 edition &lt; pc version. Still, great job Mojang. Notch has made me smile with this portable version of his masterpiece.
B00000JNNY|5.0|Again yes I love this disc.  Etta James is an all time legend.  She makes you forget the stress in your life for as long as you feel her music.
0375413405|4.0|Gave as a Christmas gift and was very well received. My son and I used to watch Julia all the time when he was really young.  He is now an excellent cook!
0306812835|5.0|My cousin the civil engineer sent it to me because we have begun a high school in Argentina that has as its orientation pre-engineering.  I was the principal and am not a math guy so it was invaluable for me to get a grasp of some basic principles of engineering. My cousin says he wishes he had that book when he was studying 55 years ago.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm about 75% through this book and just love it.  It's a real page turner while giving me much insight into what went on during WWI.  It chronicles several different interconnected people/families from the major countries involved (Russia, Germany, France, and the U.S.) and thus gives different view points on why the countries are all fighting and the toll it takes on each country during the process.  I'm in the middle of Russia's restructuring/revolution which is just fascinating. All the stories are interesting and I can't wait to find out what happens to everybody, although I know the outcome of WWI.  I have already purchased the sequal to this book, Winter of the World, and am looking forward to reading it - my Mom said it's better than this book (she is who recommended this one), which is hard to imagine!!<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars because I just love well written historical fiction.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|A well done remake that adhered to the spirit of the old one yet with legitimate changes that made it interesting and up to date. I enjoyed it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I think we have all wondered how our lives would have been different if we had made another choice along the way, or been able to undo some action we took that may have changed our lives. This book satisfied my fondness for science fiction with a story that was relevant to my life as well. As a young mother at the time of the Kennedy assassination I recall sitting in front of the television set for hours just numb that someone had killed our president, and in my state. Of course all the conspiracy theories that sprung up immediately always would boggle the mind. I really enjoyed this work of fiction that brought back so many memories.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really wouldn't see the need of this app on a gingerbread device. However, on my Velocity Micro Cruz T301with its older android OS, this is a handy app. So I can recommend it for that tablet. One also nice thing about it, it can be transferred to the SD card.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice, basic solitaire game. Minimal ads. Several options to play around with. Saves your game if you exit app.Good way to spend a few minutes.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The gameplay is great as expected and looks fantastic. However, there is a surprising lag/response delay issue that makes things less than perfect.<br /><br />galaxy iii
B000VHMF0A|5.0|If you are into Reggae, then this is a must have.  I have to admit i got this on an MP3 deal  for .99c so i couldn't be happier.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I enjoyed the old Dredd far more. This one would have been more enjoyable, with the updated effects and sets, had it not been for the writing.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I knew the music would be great, but, in this case so was the service! What more can I say!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|If you need a PDF reader, this seems to work as well as any other PDF reader, and is transferable to the SD card. I am using it on a Velocity Micro Cruz PS47. This tablet has the gingerbread operating system.
B008MM9630|5.0|Lots of fun and I really like the graphics. I've been looking for a game like this. I'm sure my kids will like it too.
0345803485|1.0|originally thought this was a romance novel. bought it for my wife, she enjoyed it at first, but later found herself skipping the graphic sex scenes to get back to the storyline.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Truly a great &#34;feel good&#34; book in the spirit of Mitch Albom's other work. A real treasure for people of all faiths.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|as a fan of the ALIEN franchise, I love the way this movie helps to connect the dots to understand how the encounters with the Aliens really began. And anything with Charlize is worth seeing. The alien humanoids in this were outstanding.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Constantly crashing and glitching I wouldn't use this app. If I didn't love my friends so much.... really though roll back the update
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  I can't wait to start the next book! The author really keeps you in anticipation throughout the book.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another great read from Demille.... witty, intriguing and classic Corey bravado.<br />Loved every minute of the book.<br /><br />I look forward to the next Corey journey.
B006TTC5QS|5.0|loved Despicable Me in the theater and rented it a couple of times when it came out on DVD.  I bought it on Blu-Ray because it was a better bargain than DVD- the Blu-Ray included more features (including 3 shorts featuring the minions- can't go wrong there) for just a little more than the DVD, not because I thought it would be significantly better in Blu-Ray. It's a cartoon, right? I was so pleased with the improved quality of the film I will purchase animated films in Blu-Ray always now. It really improved the viewing experience, and I loved the movie already.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|hands down AWESOME!!! I love this game, much better than original, warning it is a little different, but worth figuring it out. Thank You Imangi!!!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|my wife loved it, and I love it, so that's two thumbs up. the new batman is a very dark version of the classical, comical character, but the writing, acting, sets, effects, all were excellent.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The story should have been written by Richard Marchinko the founder of Seal Team 6. As for the actual rate it appears that it was coordinated by the Keystone Kops. How they ever took out the targets is beyond belief. Crashing a helicopter, explosives all over the place. It's simply amazing the targets didn't tunnel out as they had enough notice something was taking place. Fortunately theu took out the targets but to be considered to be an elite special force not likely. On a good day the British SAS might let them carry their boots.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|its a great game ive only been playing for a little bit but I love games you can customize on and where you can change your sex
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is really the best series I have ever seen in my life. I have never been such a fanatic of anything but I find myself wanting to buy Game of Thrones shirts and trinkets to have for when I begin the new season. I am seriously a huge nerd for Game of Thrones. 5 stars! 10 of 10! 100%<br />Go team Stark!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|cant download<br />it is not what I expected and wish I can download. I wish I can download the game please tell me about it
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have always enjoyed her books, she keeps you guessing until the very end.  The bone bed is a great addition to the Scarpetta series.  Can't wait for the next one, please keep them coming.
1452110581|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my boyfriend who owns a Russian Blue, and he loved it. The poems are so funny, and you can truly picture a cat writing them. Every poem is hilarious.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like this game you get to interact with a horse also if you really want one and your parents say NO....
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|I love multiplayer games on tablets, especially the one's that don't require constant activity or playtime to keep up with everyone else.  MOBA games give you a multi-player experience with some RPG components, but you can enjoy a game play session that only lasts 20-30 minutes.  Gameloft's entry into this genre is actually leading the way when it comes to the Kindle devices (so I think those reviewers who just complain that it's not 100% bulletproof yet need to back off a little bit IMHO).<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />* Graphics are solid and game responsiveness is much improved since launch.<br />* Properly implements the basic mechanics of a MOBA that you would expect to see (lanes, towers, jungle, etc.).<br />* IAP is available, but doesn't dominate the game play and strategy.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />* The community of players is still a little small which makes joining matches for PvP and Co-Op take a long time if you are playing during off-peak hours.<br />* The social and team features aren't completely finished yet.<br />* There are only 2 maps.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />* Their are some overpowered (OP) heroes that result in imbalanced play... if someone on the other team has those heroes and you don't (or if the person on your team is a noob using that hero) then you are pretty much guaranteed to lose.<br /><br />Overall this is a great game and brings an important genre to the Kindle tablets.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game will keep u busy for hours. it does me. I love it. when I'm sitting in a doc. office or just riding in a car or laying in bed I stay entertained with this game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game a lot. its fun playing. the only problem is that it takes a long time to load on my kindle fire and I don't like how long I have to wait for stuff. other than that I really like this game a lot. I enjoy playing it. :)
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I expected this book to be more than it turned out to be but I do realize that this book was primarily written by a novice author
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Can't get enough of the bat. Production value on these are great. You'd expect them to cut corners...can't say they have ever done that.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book and would recommend it.  I read alot and it kept me interested all the way through.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I just felt like the movie tried to cash in on the Inception hype.  I felt like everything about this movie was overrated.  You need to watch the movie with just the mindset that it is an action movie and you can't over-think the plot.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Good bookI  It was inspiring for an old runner trying to get back in the zone. The information and recipes on a healthy diet are tought provoking
B0053O89JM|1.0|I received it broken therefore I never got to watch it.  So I returned it and haven't felt like looking for another copy.
B003NX75B8|5.0|I'm a central office educator and reading non-fiction is my life, so I need to &#34;schedule&#34; time in to read literature and fiction. Our high school teachers and many of our students love John Green so I needed to give it a try. WG, WG is a great story and the point of view is very unique in that it alters from chapter to chapter. The character development is strong and this book will leave you cheering. I liked it so much that I've decided I'm going to read every John Green book...just finished Paper Towns...also very cool, but in a different way.
B007MDB548|4.0|If the kids are happy daddy's happy. I can't tell how much that means in terms of peace and peace of mind.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|...but ultimately this movie just couldn't live up to my expectations. I love Johnny Depp and he is utterly delicious in this as he is in everything; howevery, not even Johnny could save this movie. Too many plot holes and unanswered questions. Silly dialogue and a few unfortunate casting choices. I loved the tv show (in the early 90's?) and I thought the tension between Barnabas and Victoria is what really made the show work. Here, it took the back seat to too many other, less interesting story lines.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Not cheesey, just fabulous.  Great voice and the songs are done differently. bought it for &#34;All I Want For Christmas is You&#34; - great song. and he's cute.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Would be really great if the thing on the back that allows you to sit it up on a tilt while reading actually stayed in the groove and kept the whole thing from falling over.
B0076DELIG|2.0|Normally I love any Harry Bosch stories, but this one was very disappointing.  The book could have been cut in half and been better. The entire first half of the book was repetitious and pointless. The end of the book was more typical Bosch. I cannot recommend this to anyone.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Told from the perspective of a dog. I'm not even a dog owner and I really enjoyed this book. If you are one, you'll love it.
B0085RQLXK|2.0|Steven stated this was the album they always wanted to make...Really? Juvenile at best...and this from a bunch of geriatrics.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I couldn't see how one god could not defeat his adopted brother who is also a god. However, they had plenty of backup superheroes. Action was good and once again Iron Man was the best of group.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this story and all the characters.  I couldn't put the book down, and completed it over the course of one day.  I was mesmerized by Eva, Gideon, and the supporting characters.  I am so intrigued by their story.  I read the sequel immediately, and in less time.  I can't wait for more!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is easy reading but very compelling.....hard to put down  once you start! Looking forward to reading the next installment.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always make myself wait to read a Grisham Novel because I know it will be so good and go so fast and The Racketeer did not disappoint me.  Grisham wove a great tale of suspense and intrigue.  He kept me up at night reading and wanting to know more.  I loved this book until almost the last two pages because I thought it ended a bit abruptly.  Other readers did too, but is the real reason that you just don't want a Grisham Novel to end?  Highly recommended.
B005544V6A|4.0|Took a chance on this series and I was pleasantly surprised.  In fact watched the whole first season in 2 days.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|My son is into rap which I can't stand. This is the only cd that I don't tell him to turn off because it seems to have something for everybody. I can listen to this one and enjoy it.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|All this movies are real good and she is just hardcore. The vampire versus werewolf movies are so blend...ughm, Twilight....but these movie takes it to another level!
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|The setting for this sci-fi thriller was impossible to figure out.  Why would workers be commuting from Australia to Britain?  And through an underground tunnel system that takes 17 minutes for the trip?  The script writer might have visited Total Recall himself.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm so happy that the temple run 2 is finally out!! I'm downloading it and can't wait to play it.
034580404X|5.0|There was absolutely no damage to the box or the books!  I was very pleased!  Thank you so very much
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very fun game that becomes more challenging as you solve the puzzle.  It is a good space visualization exercise as well as brain teaser exercise.  I love it!
141659521X|5.0|I love the Mitch Rapp series. If you've never read the other books this is still a good page turner for you but I guarantee you will imediately get the others in the series to read right away. I only wish he could write the books as fast as we can read them.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The idea of one of the greatest presidents to actually be a vampire killer is a bit bizzare and out of the ordinary. But surprisingly I liked the action and theme to the movie. There were good special effects and had good action scenes, even if it all may be fiction of course :)
B007V65R54|3.0|Nate Silver's book is loaded with interesting subjects and thoughtful analysis, but often times felt like a textbook. More didactic than enlightening. He mentions the reason for this in his introduction, but I was overwhelmed by the detail. I would recommend this book only to those that love statistics and whose ideal day is getting lost in an excel spreadsheet.  Unfortunately, that isn't me.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it ,I can take it anywhere I want to go and read no need to take a book,it's weights a hole lot less than a book.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Very well made, durable, beefy, sharp, and easy to take apart and clean. Used this knife to clean a 300# hog and had no problem.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this book rocks! It was awesome and I have read it a million times! Very interesting. Loved it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|last time I install this app but it a wallpaper but NOW they have the game if u like it GIVE FIVE STARS!!!!!I mean it.:)
B0043RSK3K|4.0|Eye opening, if even 80% true! Makes a person think and reflect.<br />As usual, the devil is in the details. I would appreciate seeing comments<br />from recognized historians.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game in you liked temple run one then you will love this games It`s a lot harder then temple run one but not too hard at the same time so I rate this 5 stars
B005LAII9O|5.0|saw it in the theaters and enjyed it so when it got here i decided to watch the special features first & enjoyed myself. great movie
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Probably the best mobo I have ever owned. I love it and the FX-8350 I have in it make it the best comp in my neighborhood.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|As a person who was alive to hear Janice Joplin sing when SHE was alive, I can say that Brittany Howard comes closer to Janice's raw, aching and very authentic emotionality than any performer I've heard since. Alabama Shakes was a real surprise to this ol' gal. I listen to it as I chug around town in my car. I hope that Brittany hangs in there longer than Janice did. Seems like she will. Brittany and the band are treasures.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I like the app...except...it loads upside down if the Lock is not on.  Other than that, it is a good weather app.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Like in book 1, each time Ana begins to get comfortable something changes to turn the reader into a different direction.  Good read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Story moved at a good place. Great depth of character. But I thought there were holes, and an overall weak ending.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|This is a family classic and we really looked forward to seeing it. The quality was so bad we could no watch it.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great author.  Easy to read. Very good story. This is my first book reading in kindle app. I loved it.
B007X6SMD6|3.0|I ended up looking up most of the stuff on forums. It's nice that this exists, but another attempt at it would be greatly appreciated.<br />Also, I ended up having to download 6 different e-books before finding that none of them properly discussed modern .net or WCF options.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm serious, you do. I can honestly say I didn't even wan  to go to bed one night because of all the twists happening in this  book. So great!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Ended too soon.  Good epilog.  Puts some things in perspective.  You get more insight into Christian's character. Caused me to go back and read book 1.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Written in a different format which I found very interesting. Also being a child in the second world war found out things I did not know. For a more mature person I would think.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app and I love it if I where you I would get it. it might be expensive
B003O86FMW|5.0|You must read the entire series.  I couldn't put them down and read them all in just a few days.  Good for adults or children ages 10 and up.
B0076DELIG|5.0|While I started with his last book in the series, I can't wait to read more.  I will now start from the beginning.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Creativity abounds in this sweeping saga that spans the generations of humanity. Interesting characters, although they were not developed as fully as I would have liked.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Really helps out with my work.  Great product and easy (beyond easy) to use and even my 14 year old loves it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!  == / + ? &#34; ; : ) ( _ ! & $ @ 09876 4
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was definitely a great action packed book that kept all of the new characters involved as well as giving more of a spotlight on Annabeth.  The only real disappointment was to find that I would have to wait until the next book to reach the conclusion of this.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I have torate this kind of low since I expected newer material. Ellen seems to recycle jokes & stores from her show's monologes. If you don't watch her show, then this book will be a much more interesting read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read, fast pace, and a surprising ending. Loved this trilogy. The books are definitely dark, but a great fast pace read. Loved it!
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Jeremy Renner is no Matt Damon. There were some other questionable casting decisions too. For example, the Doctor on the run with Renner's character was awful! The Bourne formula is getting old. The pacing of this movie was way too slow, as well as having a predictable and boring plot. Gilroy better get Damon back or this franchise is in the toilet!
0547884591|5.0|I thought it was a good book with many different areas of learning and skill. The part about learning how to learn a new language faster and with the ability to speak it fluently I found helpfull, along with many of the tips for cooking. Tho the title for the book is incorrect in my opinion it's a great read if you have the ability to think and learn. If u don't probably not a book for you.

B0041D843M|5.0|I got a \\"suspicious of cancer\\" diagnosis after a routine physical.  This launched a somewhat life-changing deep dive into what I could do to reduce my risk of cancer (besides just cutting things out or taking drugs).  This book was great at covering the research showing how nutrition is related to our common western diseases (cancer, heart, diabetes) and how other cultures and diets have very low instances of the diseases we are experiencing.<br /><br />I now notice regular reports of how the western diet encourages diseases (Google \\"new york times harvard beef cancer\\").  Before, I was simply not paying attention (too much noise about fats, cholesterol, drugs, supplements, vitamins and other commercially marketable products).  This book helped me understand these reports and what I needed to do.<br /><br />What is nice is that it is pretty simple.  Eat a plant-based diet instead of an animal-based diet.  That's it.  It's not very exciting but I'm well motivated (due to my diagnosis) and it is not real hard once I made the mental shift.  I now notice how many restaurants and even fast-food places have vegetarian/vegan selections.  Coffee shops (and similar) have no problem making a hot chocolate with soy milk for example (it tastes fine, a bit sweeter than using normal milk).  Eating a plant based diet has not been hard (it helps to have a wonderful wife and kids too).<br /><br />I don't tell folks I'm vegetarian or vegan because there is also a lot of emotion (save the animals, etc.) associated with it.  I just say I need to eat this kind of diet due to a health concern.  Note, I've a bmi of 22, can run 5 miles, and my physical results were \\"perfect, perfect and perfect\\" from my doctor except for this suspicion of cancer - so I'm otherwise considered very healthy.<br /><br />And this leads to the unexpected part of my experience with eating a plant based diet.  While I've always been pretty healthy, I am over half a century old and have all the various mild aches and pains and varying daily energy levels associated with this age.  Well, they are gone. Yes, gone.  Not less.  Just gone.<br /><br />After about a week of eating \\"rabbit food\\" I noticed something different.  Some regular mild pain I always felt in my back if laying down on a hard surface (e.g., working out at the gym) I no longer felt.  Something I had for over ten years (it is something that runs in my family) was suddenly gone. I still periodically roll around on my back looking to feel the normal jab of pain.  Nothing.<br /><br />After about two weeks of a plant based diet I noticed that I had not had, nor thought about having coffee, coke or anything else caffeinated. My energy level had been rock solid for weeks.  I realized that I had none of the normal ups and downs throughout the day or even the week.  It has been on order of three months now and my energy level is completely consistent.  I would have sworn that the body had to have normal energy ups and downs as this has been true all my life and everyone else complains about it.  Now the energy is just always there, kind of like having a cell phone I never have to charge.<br /><br />Other \\"normal\\" aches and pains seemed to have disappeared.  I use to feel stiff in the morning.  No more.  I would work for hours at my desk and then feel stiff when I got up.  Nope. If I pay real close attention there is a little stiffness but it disappears almost immediately when I start moving. It is as if I'm always warmed up and loose.  It is as if I'm in my 30s not my 50s.<br /><br />I had been running five miles.  Some days were hard, others were ok.  Now they are all practically easy (I'm only a bit faster).  I ran seven miles the other day and felt tempted to extend it to nine, but I decided not to.  My knees were a bit tender for a few days, but I had no problem running seven (legs were fine, breathing was fine).  I've no doubt I can run nine, I just have to make sure the rest of my body is ready for that kind of distance.  The plant based diet is like a constant carbo load which makes me always prepared to run long distances.<br /><br />Getting diagnosed \\"suspicious of cancer\\" has been a gift.  I've no idea yet if eating a plant based diet has made any difference on my \\"suspicious cells\\" (next check up is in a few months) but it has made a huge difference in my life.  This book gave me the research to understand why I'll eat plant-based from now on. My own direct continuing experience clearly confirms that it has an immediate and beneficial effect even beyond reducing the risk of disease.ance.

1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander's intricate journey into the next world and back is just exactly what the title says: proof that there is a heaven, an afterlife that the spirit goes to when it leaves the body. I loved hearing his honest account of how he used to dismiss the stories of his patients who had interaction with this other world. The hardest thing for anyone to do is to change their belief systems, and all of Dr. Alexander's beliefs were changed by his direct, intensely emotional experiences during the time when his body was in a coma. A study of cognitive processing showed that when a person is faced with information that does not fit into one's belief system, the brain does not take it in. Literally, the person does \\"not hear\\" what doesn't fit with what they think is true. Dr. Alexander beautifully shows his transformation from one who did not hear about the magic of the spiritual world to one who journeyed through it and was changed forever.  We get to spirit not by the logical left brain, but through the right brain's direct emotional experience. The most touching part was finding the true identity of the beautiful woman who was his guide. Read this book and find out who she was!<br />By Barbara Stone, author of Invisible Roots: How Healing Past Life Trauma Can Liberate Your Present and Transforming Fear into Gold: How Facing What Frightens You the Most Can Heal and Light Up Your Heart.

B00447G29S|5.0|I purchased the Polar Express 3D version in 2010 - Knowing that in the future we would be getting a 3D TV in the future.  Well, fast forward to December 2012 and we purchased a 55\\" LG 3D TV and all I can say it WOW!!!  The 3D effects are amazing.  I felt like I was transported back into the Movie Theater in 2004.  The effects at home were just as good as they were in the Cinema.  I've seen other reviews where others have given negative reviews for the 3D effects of the movie.  I can't duplicate their experience but I can tell you that I have Sony 3D player, an LG TV with adjustable 3D settings to enhance the \\"Wow\\" factor, and a 2 + year old 3D disk and it all works perfectly.  There is plenty of reviews of the movie itself and I won't bore you with another.  Suffice it to say it is a very good movie and has been added to my annual Christmas replay list.

B008RYN44U|1.0|I have always loved this band. I have all their cd's. But I have to say I hate this cd. They have left behind what they do so well, ska and reggae. There is only one track that even sounds like No Doubt. The rest sounds like Gwen's solo garbage. Way too much pop. As the Beatles said,\\"Get Back To Where You Once Belong \\"
B00000I3JO|5.0|Had heard of the Blue Nile previously but had never listened to their music. Had put them alongside prefab sprout, everything but the girl etc. as another eighties band whose music was too identifiable with that era to hold up to listening today. Bought this out of curiosity after seeing paul buchanan on a recent program. From first listen I have loved this album. It appears timeless. Unquestionably, a classic.
B004K4IZ54|1.0|As soon as the movie starts a disclaimer appears on the screen saying most of the movie in 2D. There were some 3D scenes but not worth the extra cost. Love the movie and thought the 3d version would be mind blowing but it was not.

B002FGU45S|2.0|Somewhere after the first Terra Fi was made, Teva lost their common sense design in making this sandal.  While the footbed is very comfortable, someone somewhere at Teva decided to increase the length of the straps on these sandals by at least one quarter, thus making the straps too long if you have average volume ankles - or worse if you have skinny angles - which makes the straps stick out all over if you snug them tight, while leaving little Velcro to adhere to itself.  I swear these were redesigned with giant-footed individuals in mind, who have high-volume feet in the arch area with huge ankles.  I'd love to have kept these sandals if they had shorter straps with velcro further along the straps to keep them snug, and so the two straps around the ankle didn't end up hitting each other, but no dice!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This is a good book as a quick read.  The story benefits from  its subject, domestic abuse, but it is pretty simplistic. It will make an ok movie but the character development is spotty.  An average read but moves quickly.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|A refreshing blend of funk and alt rock.  I first heard this band during the opening sequence of Borderlands 2 so I bought the album hoping that the rest of the tracks were as good as the one I had heard.<br /><br />I wasn't to be disappointed and neither will you, so grab a copy today.

However, I only gave it 4/5 stars because some of the discs did freeze at times.  I didn't have to have any of my discs replaced like some reviewers did, but sometimes I'd have to press menu buttons, power off my DVD player, or eject & reinsert the disc to get some of the discs to play.

0385535147|2.0|I don't know where to begin. I usually love Grisham's work and I tried to love this too...I really did.<br /><br />It started off well enough but went downhill quickly after the first third of the book. I couldn't get past the notion that this bumpkin of a lawyer, who was stupid enough to unwittingly end up in prison for laundering money from an unseen client became a criminal mastermind of epic proportions during his tenure in the joint, even with the heip of his career criminal accomplice. Turns out he's a staunch environmentalist to boot...who knew?<br /><br />I also could not believe how lazy it seems Grisham has become in creating characters. One of the things I enjoyed most about reading his novels is the interesting and memorable people who populate his books. There's nothing memorable, likable or relatable about anyone in the book...pity.<br /><br />Finally, it's pretty obvious that little research went into this book regarding how the Bureau and the federal prison system operate. I'm keeping the review brief because the book doesn't even deserve much more thought. I'm glad I borrowed it at the library.
B004UXUX7S|3.0|Matt King (George Clooney) is a real estate agent who wants to fix his relationship with his two daughters after his wife ends up in a coma.<br /><br />I hear 'Hawaii', and I think of nothing but beautiful scenery. This movie showed me the not so beautiful parts of the Island, which made it more... I guess genuine is the word I want to use. That was a good thing. What was going on with Matt's great, great great grandmother's inheritance was interesting. Family means nothing to some people when money is involved, that's for sure. And, of course, George Clooney's performance was good. But teenagers disrespecting adults - there was too much of that. There was also too much profanity. I don't think the F-bomb is ever necessary, but if it's going to be used in a sentence, it could at least make sense.
1408833387|3.0|Am I just jaded because of my injury and the fact I haven't been able to run for months? And even before that, because I couldn't run like I used to run pre-Fuji and pre-permanent degenerative injury? Or did Scott Jurek's novel lack something? Or am I just jealous of the fact he has such a well-distributed book backed by a big time publisher? Am I jealous of Scott's success even? Possibly a bit of all of that, but I'm certain also that there's something more at play.<br /><br />I've read other great running auto/biography's and have been inspired, enthralled, obsessed, impassioned, and unable to put them down. I read Dean Karnazes' three books and remained riveted. I couldn't put Lisa Tamati's \\"Running Hot' down until I'd finished it. Christopher McDougall's \\"Born to Run\\"? It was like discovering a new religion. I finished Scott Jurek's \\"Eat & Run,\\" and while having thoroughly enjoyed the journey, I just felt deflated.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Scott's is an autobiography with a lot of bang for its buck. He's won 7 Western States Ultra Marathon races in a row! This guy is a running legend and an absolute ultra marathon superstar. And he's also as humble as they come. This guy can run! What he can't do is write. Which is why he enlisted Steve Friedmen to co-write this novel. What is lost, unfortunately, in this partnership, is the passion and love, the obsession even, for the sport. Steve, \\"Eat & Run\\" declares to all, is not a runner. It does this in the acknowledgements section as well as on every page of the book. I'm not a qualified reviewer, so I'll just outline here what I liked and what I didn't like.<br /><br />I liked the race stories, about Scott pushing on despite broken and sprained limbs, in spite of horrendous heat and god awful stomach distress. I loved Scott's account of his actual racing, chasing down those ahead, keeping in front at all costs, taking on all challenges head on with nothing short of mad determination. I couldn't get enough of this. I even enjoyed the story throughout of Scott getting into his Vegan diet, trying new things, experimenting with foods, even experimenting with a raw food only diet! In fact Scott's account of his slow transformation to Vegan eating and living and making it work for distance running is what makes this book readable and worth a look by not only runners but those looking at changing their eating habits. Scott even had me considering Vegan if only momentarily! Julia would never allow it!<br /><br />What didn't work for me was the blatant over production that Steve Friedmen quite obviously brought to this novel. If I had read the catch phrase, \\"sometimes you just do things\\" one more time, I think I'd have felt the need to cry. I got the message after the first chapter. I didn't need it hammered into me every chapter after that. And unfortunately, with over-production came a loss of innocence and exploration and wide-eyed wonder that can come with ultra running that Dean Krazenas in \\"Ultramarathon Man\\", and Christopher McDougall in \\"Born to Run\\" both captured so perfectly and managed to inspire cult followings. For Scott, unfortunately, in \\"Eat & Run\\" at least, it all just seems to have come so easily. Nothing was hard about running, and unfortunately Scott's mum's illness even comes across as watered down, despite the trauma and sadness I'm certain it must have brought Scott.<br /><br />Scott's book \\"Eat & Run\\" is a good read. I enjoyed it as I have all the running autobiographies I've read. And my respect for Scott as a runner has gone up immensely. A true and worthy legend of the sport! But just as his comeback race in 2010 lacked suspense, intrigue, wonder, suffering, and excitement, so too did Scott's book. Still worth a look, but don't get too excited!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00AF7E5UY Running Against Time]].

B005H29GSI|4.0|I got this game because my kids really like angry birds. They have played other board game versions of this, but not this particular one before. So I got them this and they were super excited. They opened the game right away. We read all the directions. Some of the directions were a little difficult to understand, like how the pieces were supposed to stand up. Other than that though, we caught on and understood how to play. There are 4 missions to the game: Level 1, 2, 3, and 4 - which is a freeplay mission. The levels 1-3 require you to build the structure just how the card is laid out, requiring you to actually look at the pieces, using your brain to follow directions on the card. Even my 6 year old was able to follow the cards and build them the way the card states.<br /><br />The one downfall of it though was that he would often get frustrated because the pieces would fall over before he could have the player shoot the birds at the structure. I recommend building this at a table or a really hard surface because floor play is impossible. The pieces will just fall over. It also takes a bit for each player to set up the structure. So kids might get bored waiting around. In the game, the youngest child takes a card and gives it to the person next to him, going clockwise. That person builds what is on the card. Then the player whose turn it is has to shoot his birds at the structure to knock it down. If he knocks it down, he gets how many points are on the card. Also, you can't just use any bird. You have to use the bird the way it is listed on the card. I found that shooting the birds required some practice. It is not as easy as it looks. For my 6 year old, he got frustrated pretty easily with the game.<br /><br />Despite some of my complaints, the game is really fun. Whoever gets up to 1000 first wins and you can choose any way to do that. Each level is harder and worth more points, so you can pick a really easy level or choose a harder one or a mix of those.  Either way, the game teaches kids to follow directions. Plus, who doesn't like angry birds? My kids love the online game and they love these games too.er way, the game teaches kids to follow directions. Plus, who doesn't like angry birds?

Details in the book were so good that you could really imagine everything being described. I really liked that the author took these books in a different direction than most of these types of books.  Such an interesting read!  I hated for the series to end and although some people seem unhappy with the end, I think it ended perfectly.  I finished Forever feeling satisfied.  Looking forward to reading more from this author.

B0046MVVOW|5.0|What can I say, I love Ke$ha!  My old copy of Animal was ruined, and I didn't own Cannibal.  Ordered it and now I have a soundtrack for when I drive!  Blah, blah, she has no musical whatever.  It's fun and silly.  If you want serious music, purchase Beethoven (who I love as well).
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|Bad picture! We have a HDTV and we are use to a great picture this was verry poor.<br />Please refund our money.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Seemed interesting but I didn't get to finish it, my wireless crashed. Fixing the wireless was more important than the movie

1476712042|4.0|This book is not going to be for everyone. Travis, the hunky, tattooed guy of this story, is quite possessive and violent. Not to mention, some what of a man-slut. He does have some scenes where you wonder what the hell Abby is thinking when she forgives him. I read up on some other reviewers perspective of this and what I haven't seen mentioned anywhere is that Abby is not the innocent, sweet, blinded by love protagonist like in most young romance novels. She has a dark past, even though she is trying to escape it, that involves everything from illegal gambling to knowing members of the mob. They both have bad flaws that they are trying to overcome. Neither one of them is really good for each other and that is why their friendship starts out as such a disaster.   I personally enjoyed this book. Yes, it has some questionable scenes, but then there are chapters like the one that take place on Thanksgiving. I have to give kudos to Jamie McQuire, because those chapters, to me, where heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. I love books that make me feel strong emotions, that's why we read books right? And this book was not stingy with the emotions. There was everything from love, to being down right pissed off, to laughing. I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, but I personally really liked it.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have always loved temple run but, this takes it to a whole new level. A lot of people say that the first temple run is awesome but, there are a lot who say it's boring well, this well shut the haters up.  It makes you feel just like your in the game you well be sacred, happy and well not want to put it down. It is about 100+ harder then the first game so, if you don't have the first game you should not get this one it would be confusing and you would not enjoy it at all unless you are a gaming master and/or catch on to things quickly. I highly recommended this for temple run lovers and gaming masters.

0062119044|5.0|I'd read this book years ago, and just wanted to add it to my personal library. An ending you'll never forget!
B000GIW43M|5.0|Being half Chinese myself, I find myself doubting Amy Tan's authenticity, but one cannot doubt that her novels are very good. They're really compelling, and draw you in once you start them. In this one, the four mothers and the four daughters of the San Francisco \\"joy luck club\\", started when the four mothers came together to play mah jong, invest in stocks, and eat dim sum. \\"Nearly forty years later, one of the members has died, and her daughter has come to take her place, only to learn of her mother's lifelong wish- and the tragic way in which it has come true.\\" Then, the stories of everyone else in this club are told, both mother and daughter, in (I think) four different parts, with three or four sections within each part.<br /><br />It's hard to pinpoint what makes The Joy Luck Club so compelling. I don't think it's really accurate in its portrayal of Chinese immigrants; only some are like the characters in this book. But the plot itself is so gripping, the stories so... not fun, but perhaps necessary to read. I found myself pulled into the stories of mothers and their daughters, pasts and presents and futures.<br /><br />A lot of the older women have had horrific experiences back in China, and finally, these stories start to come out, after so many years. And the daughters have their own tales to tell, of growing up in America, of hearing wisdom from their mother and ignoring it, or perhaps taking it too much to heart.<br /><br />I read The Kitchen God's Wife a couple years ago, and though I don't remember much about the plot, I remember reading it on a sunny summer afternoon and really liking it. I think The Joy Luck Club was just as good, though again, I may not agree with its interpretation. But just as a story, it's amazing. And the Chinese words are actually accurate, which I can't say the same for other books (or perhaps they just use Cantonese instead of Mandarin. I only speak Mandarin).<br /><br />Who was my favorite character? Hmm...I think all of themwere equally interesting, though I particularly liked Tan's portrayal of the married couple who add everything up, account for every single cent and who owes whom what. I don't think that's how marriage should work, and predictably, their marriage does unravel. There's also (as with many of the chapters) an interesting anecdote about childhood superstitions that actually end up coming true.<br /><br />\\"Amy Tan writes about what is lost and what is saved.\\" She does. She writes about things that fail to get passed down, and things that do. And the stories. I loved The Joy Luck Club, and would recommend it. But don't believe that all Chinese immigrants are like the characters here. That's a dangerous misconception to fall into, so don't do it. Just enjoy this novel.<br /><br />My blog is located at novareviews.blogspot.com. (see my profile).

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|My husband and I love Marvel, and this was the only one we didn't see in the theater.  Really like the Stark tie-in, but can Captain America be any more of a goody-two-shoes?

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read a review that said this book was very &#34;technical&#34; and that almost put me off.  There was a brief part that seemed like it was going to over explain the &#34;math&#34; the main character does to stay alive, but it did make sense.  I think the main character is done great.  He's funny and clever.  You'll like this book too!
0765325950|3.0|20 years ago I started reading this series and it was great. We all know how RJ could weave prose to the point you were immersed in the story. It was slow when RJ became ill and the series got agonizingly slow during books 6-7-8. That has been documented countless times. I still like to read the first 4 books.<br /><br />*My first negative though of the book came about when looking at the way the paragraphs were structured on the pages. RJ books were a bit more flowery and the paragraphs were more like how people actually spoke. AMOL is like a technical manual leaving it sterile and cold in that regard.<br />*The writing seemed hurried and felt like leaving home when in a mad rush to get out of the house to drive somewhere. You know you left something behind so all feels a bit amiss.<br />*I was reading the other night and realized the chapter I was reading \\"The Final Battle\\" was painfully long - 200 pages!! 200 pages is 1/4 of RJ's earlier books. That one chapter throws a wrench into the whole mess. I grew overly bored with the \\"Rand versus Moridin/Dark One\\" battle at the bore. I had to put the book down and get up and walk around more than once to clear my head and gain some desire to read further. I had never done this with any of the previous installments; even the 6-7-8 slow and tedious books. Those scenes were part of the 200 page chapter 38; little wonder as some parts of this chapter fell apart making me wonder what the hell was going on.<br />*How and why did Sharans pop onto the scene when they are but one sentence mentionables in 13 books prior? They were major antagonists in this book and we learned little of them.<br />*How/when did the Aiel - one of the larger factions of the tale -  get turned and why do we only learn about them as an after thought?<br />*Bela was in the opening scenes of TEOTW and was killed off? Mandarb and Pips lived through way more than she did. Whatever happened to Pips?<br />*Egwene had more sense than to burn herself out as she did and Siuan - did she die and how? - mentioned to her that she was probably the best thing that could have happened to the Aes Sedai. The scene regarding Aviendha and Graendal was absurd at best. A lightening bolt, the ground exploding and taking her legs out to leave her on a ledge bleeding to death? Why didn't she die?<br />*The slap to my face moment was in a Perrin scene and he recalled they had left Emond's Field just 2 years prior. 23 year to write 14 books? The whole thing could have been done in 7 after being reduced to what this last book did - basically finished it off.<br /><br />All in all I was wholly unimpressed with this. I had to read it to see how it was wrapped up but the science textbook format left me high and dry. It's not worth a second read to me. I think Winter's Heart was a better book than the finale and it, too, was painful to read.<br /><br />I wonder how much money TOR and Harriet milked out of this and how much Sanderson got for his part in reducing this to Harry Potter. I am not knowledgeable of Sanderson's other works; if they are anything like this I will gladly pass.<br />GRRM has wiped me out with his ASOIAF series which took a worse dive than this.<br /><br />Time to hit the Paksenarrion prequels and sequels.<br /><br />3 stars because it wrapped it up and I was generous.e did and Siuan - did she die and how? - mentioned to her that she was probably the best thing that could have happened to the Aes Sedai.

B00005JJX8|5.0|In the Hitchcock tradition of lush backgrounds, devious clues that can lead the viewer to unexpected conclusions. Easy to get distracted by the beauty of the scenery and, yes, the characters ... but that's part of the movie's charm. One has to look past the trappings to get at the mystery underneath.

B001LF347E|5.0|If you are an avid fan of sci-fi fantasy stories and films...if you love the special effects that go hand in hand with the making of these films and stories...if you love great stories and plots that keep you at the edge of your seat...THIS IS FOR YOU! It certainly is one of my favorite genres in films and series. I absolutely love the series MERLIN...and the first season introduces you to the marvels of magic, the special effects, the glamour of a royal dynasty and the various characters. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is my favorite period drama, ranking right up there with Jane Eyre (BBC Masterpiece edition) and Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth edition).  I am fascinated by the characters, and especially their evolution as the show has progressed.  Good and evil, wealth and struggle, war and partying.  It's all there, with scintillating costumes and scenery, and layered characters who have flaws that resemble mine and yours.  I could go on, but now I want to watch it again!

B006MW3VGA|5.0|I had a discussion with my wife over whether DA is good art or just good entertainment. She said the first, I said the latter. It definitely has soap opera elements and not a lot of character development--at least not of the subtle kind, but still there is something there more than just good entertainment.
1423140605|5.0|My daughter absolutely loved this book.  She said it is full of action and adventure, while bringing forth new mythological characters.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I got into it from the beginning and could not put it down.  The very adult dialog of the teens threw me off at first but I realized that their circumstances caused them to face adult issues very early.  Hazel and Gus were the main characters and although you knew the eventual outcome, the journey to that outcome kept them and the reader going.  The  character of the european author was more poorly developed and written, but did not detract from the story.  I recommended this to my husband who agreed with this review except to add that the boy who lost his sight was his favorite character.<br /><br />My confusion and disagreement is with Amazon's genre characterization of this book as a Young Adult book.  We are two very adult readers who did not find this a youth oriented book, except for the age of the characters.
B007T99ENE|2.0|Unsympathetic characters, unlikely occurences and the twist was more of a gentle meander. I hate when novelists write about novelists-they really should forget the self-reflexivity and stick to writing about &#34;other people&#34;!

B009D7CP2M|5.0|We Need to Talk about Kevin by Lionel Shriver had my attention right from the start. Just the description of the book on the back cover was intriguing, and I could not wait to start it. When I learned that the entire book is written in letters, I was a little disappointed, because I enjoy seeing the different perspectives of the characters in a book. However, the more I read, the more I enjoyed strictly seeing things from Eva's, the main character's, point of view.<br /><br />Shriver's writing, or Eva's letters, is written from such a raw, vulnerable perspective that it is impossible to not be immediately intrigued. In the first couple of letters, Eva tells us of her life today, yet does not tell the story of what happened with her son. She refers to it as an \\"incident\\" and simply went on about her everyday life and how the \\"incident\\" had affected her. Because of the simple retelling of what she did that day, the beginning of the book was slow. However, my curiosity of reading about the \\"incident\\" helped me get through it. Finally, she lets us in on what happened and the secrets that she holds of the shooting.<br /><br />This book was an eye opening read. When shootings like the one described in the book happen, the family of the shooter are usually forgotten. This book helped me see their side of the story, and realize the pain they must go through...because they lost a child as well. Especially in these days of mourning because of the Sandy Hook shooting, my thoughts and prayers went out to the shooter's family while reading this book. I highly recommend this book; it was an intriguing and exciting read.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love history and love learning about wars. While this book is fiction, it also has real historical people and events that interact with the fictional characters. It follows about 5 different families all from different countries whose fate interwine throughout the book. This book it a bit lengthly but I was glued to it from beginning to end.Do not get discouraged because one chapter follows one character/ family and then the next jumps to a different character/ family, the storylines all connect! Love,family, war, drama, politics, it has everything. First book I have read by him, bravo Ken Folloett, bravo!<br /><br />ps- This is my first review ever, of anything. Thats how much I loved this book!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great for anybody.  Jeff Kinney does an amazing job of taking his childhood memories and twisting them around.  Of course he's<br />great!  Hes done it seven times!  This has been my favorite series of all time.  Keep it up, Kinney

B000N3T0DW|5.0|IMHO, this is the best film Almodovar has made yet.  It has all his typical quirks, beautiful colors, and a sense of being very truly Spanish.  However, the acting my Cruz in this piece is tour-de-force.  I find her so beautiful in this piece, despite the &#34;blue-collar&#34; character she plays.  Really five stars in my book.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Don't avoid the book if you didn't like the movie.  Excellent stories, characters, and plots.  Loved the nesting of the stories and the subtle links amongthe narrations.

B007VDN1PA|2.0|I'm finally getting around to scanning all my old negatives. I started with a few slides and they were fine. However, when I got to my negatives, the resolution was terrible, especially at high ISO's. I did a wedding a number of years ago and used ISO 800 film. When I scanned them with this, they looked like a bad sepia tone.<br /><br />Plus, keeping dust out was a constant struggle. I was constantly pulling out the negative film holder, taking it apart and blowing it out or using a brush. But because of static, it was a very, very hard to keep it clean. Almost every scan wound up with dust on the final scan.<br /><br />Also, the film holder allowed the negative to wiggle so your scan may be at a slight angle.<br /><br />Overall, if you have slides, you may like it (that's why it got a second star). But if you have negatives (especially high ISO) stay away.<br /><br />I'm returning mine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a wonderful book with twists and turns that I never expected. The love sky and holder shared was unbelievable. Their characters were so beautifully developed.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|It's simple. Read this book. You will not be disappointed! Serving in the military requires honor, courage, and commitment. Adam Brown truly lived by these core values and was Fearless.
B005LAIISU|5.0|Item arrived well packaged, on time and as described in the item description. Good quality and can easily recommend to others.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I will be honest.  I read this book to see what all the buzz was about.  I was really surprised by how good the writing was and how much I enjoyed it.  The writing was much simpler than what I usually read, but the author makes it work well.  I am genuinely looking forward to the next two books.
0897500482|5.0|great book, low price and this guy was possibly the greatest martial artist of all times, i would defiantly recommend this to anyone trying to go into any MMA
B007SGM084|5.0|These books took me to another world. A wonderfully seductive world. I hated to stop because I had to go back to reality :( everyone should read these!
B00008DDXL|5.0|Let me make something clear about the Harry Potter DVDs. Warner Bros put them into moratorium, so now they have become a collector's item. My DVD collection is centered around the 2-Disc Versions of the films. I had gotten this one from my cousins, except in extremely poor condition for my birthday. So I wanted a new one. Since the other one was widescreen, I didn't mind full screen and the price I got this one for was a bargain. I am ridiculously pleased that it came sealed and in fantastic condition. My 2-Disc Collection is almost complete now that i have this one. It's one of the more expensive Harry Potter DVDs and one of the rarest ones, so I am very happy with this purchase. Plus it came within 4 days which is just awesome.

0736092269|5.0|This book is chock full of interesting and useful information. The illustrations are fantastic. This is a good book for anyone looking to get in shape because it helps you understand how the musculature of the human body really works, and especially how you can make it work for you. In addition there are plenty of safety tips to avoid injury. It's worth checking out.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot  wait for future episodes! I wish there were more series like this one on television. The very best!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Not as great as Fall of Giants, but it was still good reading.. I tend to be disappointed with sequels in general....maybe I anticipate too much??

B004CAWSKE|5.0|I didn't know the Dutch could do rock this well.  Shortbread cookies, sure, but hard rock?  Very nice album that I discovered through a random Pandora selection.  Highly recommended.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|The headline should say it all.  I don't think one has to necessarily be &#34;in search of meaning&#34; to appreciate the brilliance of this book.  If you are, however, this book is a must!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I read a lot of fantasy books. I love this book it has great character development, great detail, and a plot that had depth but was nice in that you didn't get lost in it. I think this book series has great potential and could end up ranking with my favorite authors. Morgan rice keep it up cannot wait for book two!
B007SGM084|5.0|Great love story, through and through. More than just sex. It's about these two people coming together. It's about them changing one another. Great read I would recommend to anyone, as long as you can handle the kinky stuff.

B000SGSU58|5.0|This is an older book of Michael Connelly and I had forgotten how intense his books were. It was a pleasure being reunited with a younger Harry Bosch once again.  I love all of Michael Connelly's books but he seems to have mellowed over the years. Looking forward to the next adventure.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's a wonderful series that I can't seem to get enough of. I love that it's a glimpse back in time that follows both a wealthy family and their servants. Let the drama continue.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I loved the game! Hope that u will too! Have a great time and hang lose without a worry in the world!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked it because it was useful  and helpful a lot. I also looked up a word and I found it
B005HSL626|5.0|We already love playing the fruit slicing game on Wii Sports Resort.  This app is not exactly like the Wii game because of course the Wii game is real sword swinging action.  But we can't take the Wii everywhere and once you get the taste for slashing up fruit, well, this app lets you slash & slice up fruit pretty much any time.  Mindlessly simple fun but really a great way to burn off frustration.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Love the movie. Was in good shape when it got to me and arrived ahead of schedule! Can't beat the price.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I like Pink's music, so I really enjoyed the CD. I like some songs more than others, but this is based on personal preference, not musical subtleties.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really really like this game, its fun and the graphics are very nice, you should get this game. like, now!
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I loved this book!!it was awesome! But not the best DoaWK book I have read! But it was still good!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Book is is boring not like Stephen King at all and I am a big fan of his. I cannot recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't  stop reading it I got grounded numerous times for taking my book out of the house it was great
B008J34466|5.0|I did not get a chance to go to a Pink concert this year, so I thought that buying the CD would be a good second best. I like about 50% of the songs, which is a good percentage for me. I enjoy Pink's music, so I like it overall.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is SPARTA!!! Just kidding! This is probably one of THE best free games I've ever played. It's much better than the original because it adds a ton of new features, like the mine cart rides and the levels you can earn. I'm not gonna spoil it all though. Especially because I'm not that good
B008OOYALE|5.0|It is awesome they give you free gold in the start of the game also they gave me 120 gold so I highly recommend this game to any one
1603420398|5.0|This book is not for the beginner (unless you're a gifted beginner).  But for someone already familiar w/ crochet stitches, who has done granny squares or worked with motifs before... someone interested in trying new ideas, putting colour into projects in new ways, or taking your motif projects to a higher level: this book is for you.  I've been crocheting for over thirty-five years, and there are motifs and designs here I have never seen before.  The instructions are both clearly written and shown in chart form, and the shapes include creative squares.. but also circles, hexagons, triangles, stars, hearts, ovals, half-circles, diamonds... And you may expand on your stitches as well: basic single, double and treble crochet... but also picot, puff, popcorn, post, roll and bullion stitches are used.  And if you've never used the 'sliding loop' (magic circle) to start your motifs before: it's also taught in this book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to challenge themselves to get out of their comfort zone and try something different.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Best game so far.  Great story line and wonderful puzzles that keep you going from start to finish.  Finding levels very much fun for great affects on each turn of events.  Roll out more great games G5.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I'm sure I'm not going to be able to make my review the bomb like some other people have with their great descriptions and all. But I wanted to tell you what I thought about the movie as someone who grew up sometimes watching the cartoon when it was popular on HBO in the 90's.<br /><br />First off...if you have any doubts if this movie will do the cartoon any justice or not it does. In spades. I recall watching the cartoons of the past but eventually getting bored with them. But this movie was pretty exciting from the get go. It had me glued and waiting for them to solve the mystery of the \\"scrolls\\" located inside of the boats.<br /><br />It's been a couple of months since I watched this movie on demand on my television so I don't really know the story anymore. But what I can tell you is that if you like movies with plenty of action and mystery then you will most likely find much to enjoy about the new Adventures of Tintin movie.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
B00110K62U|5.0|Les Miserables is beyond description as a musical but the dream cast takes it to the highest keel. Colm Wilkomson is The ideal Valjean. I watched this tape many times and enjoy it more and more. The finale with the Valjeans from other countries is breathtaking. I cannot praise this performance enough.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|this book I had trouble putting down, the story is what keeps you going , you always want to know what is going on next , it is a very interesting story,,,,, I can't wait for the next book that is out on May 7th, I would sujusted that when you put out a book and there is three books to it you should have them all ready as I am very disapointed that I can't read the last book until the 7th of may, but I would give the other two  5 star  I loved them both....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book. I feel as if Ana is my friend telling me the story in person as it happens.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If this is as authentic as it seems to be....and subsequent events have shown that to be true...this is a must read.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|I enjoyed this anniversary concert but it lacked the emotion and warmth of the 10th anniversary concert.  It was well done but the performance did not &#34;move&#34; me as did the 10th anniversary concert.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|It got old reading all of the specifics.  Could have had more human interaction or other personalities added to the mix.<br />.
B00B4W4UAY|2.0|Some decent Bluesy rock music but the singer became annoying after listening to him use his vibrato thru 90% of the songs, totally killed it for me.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, it kept me interested with a combination of action and an interesting story. Based on a real story of a set of brothers with quality acting.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book was excellent, the  plot intriguing , the characters well-defined. The theme is the triumph of good over evil, but the ending truly disappointed me.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|It's settlers (AKA a wonderful game).  End of discussion.  My only problem is that the hex pieces for the board don't quite fit flush in the frame, quite a few of them are warped so the board is always a little wobbly.  I think this is hard to avoid with the newer games and what I assume is a cheaper material used to print them on.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Be prepared to stay up and read all night! Another great story by Jo Nesbo. I have read three of his other books and each one is a good read!  Jo Nesbo is a wonderful storyteller. This one takes you into the underground world of the drug trade in Oslo. He manages to bring to life the intrigues of the drug trade and personalize it. Good story!
B0020BUWX2|4.0|From the very beginning I was engrossed in this book. I cannot wait to read the second book to see where this story goes.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I downloaded the game on my mom's tablet so she could play it. I'm not sure how she likes it but I tried playing it and I simply can't. It's not necessarily a fault of the game, it might just be because my mom's tablet is a p-o-s but the game is nearly unplayable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fascinating character study and many twists and turns to keep reader guessing as to what happened both physically and psychologically in an unraveling of a relationship. Kept my interest throughout the story.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is a disturbing book. It is also well researched and cross referenced which adds to the power of the book. This is one man's story yet it is the story of so many in North Korea, not only those in these camps which North Korea will not acknowledge but of North Korea itself and the dictatorship of the Kim Il Jong family dynasty. Man's inhumanity to his fellow man had me up at night thinking about all the atrocities in these camps. A must read for those who want to understand more of the dynamics of North Korea.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am not sure what I did before I had the kindle app. I have it on my android tablet as well as my phone and I love that I am able to sync the two of them so that no matter which one I am reading on it will come up to wherever I bookmarked it at last. LOVE IT!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I am enjoying this series very much so far. And I really enjoy watching the episodes on my Kindle. Can't wait for more Sherlock and Dr. Watson!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 its not bad. I like how the theme was set up and how there's more obstacles and how its more nicer as it was set up
B009MO57H6|3.0|I thought this movie would be a continuation of the series and have all the same types of action. This one seemed to not even have a story line that worked well. It is nothing like the rest of the series and makes me wonder what the next one will be like. They should have stuck with what they new instead of creating this type.
B00APKG70W|5.0|Having read this book many times, I'm hoping a new generation of readers will discover an intriguing mystery without a single vampire, serial killer or one set in some apocalyptic future.  Rebecca is dark and strange and almost impossible to put down, especially with the central character dead and the storyteller being a shadow.<br /><br />The book begins with a dream about a house named Manderley perched on a knoll above the sea. The dream is told by the book's narrator and we learn that she once lived at Manderley but can never return.<br /><br />The story really begins in a hotel in Monte Carlo in the 1930's where a young girl is the paid companion to a crass, social climbing older woman, Mrs. Van Topper.  The older woman will sink to almost any depth to appear well connected and prominent and plants herself in the hotel lobby daily in an attempt to ingratiate herself with someone she deems important.  She spots a man she recognizes as a wealthy,prominent Englishman, Maxim de Winter and forces him to have tea with her.<br /><br />The young girl, whose diary is open to the reader, is horrified by Mrs. Van Topper's obvious attempts to extract personal information from de Winter by giving him the impression that they have friends in common. Although de Winter is not fooled by Mrs. Van Topper, sensing the young girl's anguish, he is kind to her.<br /><br />The flu confines Mrs. Van Topper to her room, allowing the girl more time and she and de Winter begin to spend most afternoons together, something she records faithfully but does not share with Mrs. Van Topper.  The diary records the girl's fascination with the handsome, older man who is often brooding and distant.  She falls in love with the enigmatic and dashing de Winter, but realizes how unrealistic she is.  The narrator knows that de Winter recently \\"lost his wife,\\" Rebecca, but knows nothing beyond what Mrs. Van Topper has told her:  that de Winter's wife drowned near Manderley and he never speaks of it.<br /><br />Quite suddenly, Mrs. Van Topper decides to leave Monte Carlo and the girl is ordered to pack and prepare to leave.  In a panic, she feels she must seek out Mr. de Winter to say goodbye and when she does, he proposes to her in an awkward way and she accepts.  Mrs. Van Topper is angry and points out how unsuited the young girl is to become \\"mistress of Manderley.\\"<br /><br />When the girl arrives at Manderley after a rapturous honeymoon, she is awestruck and intimidated by the size of the house and has no idea how to assume her role as Mrs. de Winter.  Maxim is off and about the estate seeing to affairs he has neglected and, since the girl is afraid to make errors in social judgment, she leaves all decisions to others, most especially to the head housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who reinforces the girl's insecurities by continually pointing out the former Mrs. de Winter's beauty, social skills and legions of admirers and friends.  The reminders of Rebecca are everywhere; her personalized notecards still in her desk, closets filled with beautiful clothes, fur coats, monogrammed towels and robes with giant R's in script, and the girl becomes convinced that de Winter married her on a whim and remains hopelessly in love with the perfect Rebecca.  Rather than learning her role as lady of the house, the girl is terrified that her husband will come to his senses and realize what a mistake he has made and she will lose him.  Consequently, she is slow to pay attention to nuances in behavior and speech that would provide clues to what is happening around her.<br /><br />Manderley is famous for its annual costume ball, a tradition de Winter loathes but agrees to suffer through as it is regarded as the height of the social season.  The girl worries about how she will possibly live up to Rebecca's skills as a hostess and has no idea what costume to wear.  Mrs. Danvers cleverly suggests a costume to replicate one of the many family portraits of long deceased family members liningthe walls of Manderley, failing to disclose that her suggestion is for the girl to wear the exact costume worn by Rebecca at the previous ball.<br /><br />On the night of the ball, as a drum signals, she descends the grand staircase to be met with silence, expressions of disbelief and gasps of horror.  Maxim yells at her and orders her to go and change.  She is humiliated and defeated and refuses to go back downstairs.  Then she hears voices outside discussing her.  \\"Guess they had a row and she is refusing to come out.\\"  \\"No one has seen her.  Rebecca would have been here there and everywhere.\\"  Shaken, she suddenly realizes that as Mrs. de Winter, she has certain obligations and one is to overcome her fear and face the music.  She makes it through the ball in misery.<br /><br />The diary is the only information provided, so one never learns the girl's name, nor what she looks like, except for several remarks de Winter makes to her, saying that with a big ribbon in her hair, she would look like Alice in Wonderland  Wretched though she is, the girl's despairing self-absorption is shelved by a dramatic event.  A ship wrecks close to the shore and divers searching the wreck discover Rebecca's lost sailboat, an event which eventually turns the timid girl into a formidable force.<br /><br />To reveal more might detract from the reader's experience.  Written in another time, the lengths to which certain families went to preserve reputations and hide any unpleasantness may seem absurd.  The anxiety felt by the girl, afraid to fail but having no idea how to go about gaining skills she is certain she lacks may seem naive to modern women but, in the end, Rebecca is a book about how imagination clouds the ability to see, or even seek, the truth and how living a lie erodes the soul.  It is a story about how fear of the truth stops us from finding joy rather than misery and how what we imagine can be far different from reality.  The narrative reveals how behind facades there can be nothing more than a cardboard theater set which has been continually propped up by the flimsiest of supports and if one support post fails, the entire structure collapses.<br /><br />This psychological melodrama overlays a deeper message.
B000026258|5.0|I became a big fan of Steve Reich after hearing The Desert Music when it was initially released. It was only a matter of time before I came across 18 musicians and bought a copy of the ECM CD. The music stores back then sometimes would put this in the jazz section, they seemed to have difficulty coping with what section of the store it belonged in. I suppose minimalist makes the most sense, but it feels anything but minimal as the marimbas, pianos, xylophones and clarinets liquidly hammer away.<br /><br />I avoid the labels all together. In my opinion, this is the most influential composition since the end of World War Two. As others have noted, you will be quickly pulled in or quickly repulsed, there seems to be no middle ground with this particular work.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is both heart warming and heart wrenching.  I like books that both entertaining and educational, this one fulfills both requirements.  It's a great book, read it!
B000VTNLBU|5.0|Watch this movie, it will change the way you look at life. I still can't stop talking about it 1 year later!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I would give the users the option to change the clock appearance, like more skins: digital, classic, animal print, etc.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I loved this book. Take some facts & mix with fiction, throw in suspense and you have a great book to read. I loved at the end where the author told fact from fiction. It sure makes you think about your history. Has a Indiana Jones ring to it.
1451629184|5.0|I really liked the book. I couldn't put it down. I liked that the author told her readers about her every day life as a prisioner in Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard. It is really sad that she was kidnapped for 18 years. It makes you want to learn self-defense. I wish she had included more pictures of herself before she was kidnapped. I also wish she had put her kids' names in the book instead of their initals. Overall, it was a good book.
0425220931|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend.  I have not had time to read it yet but looking forward to it.  My friend was very inspiried by the book and is why I purchased it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a very handy app which I use all the time. What I like most, is configuring it to use multiple locations around my zip code, which gives me a better idea of temperatures and fiorecast for the area.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Silly fun. Easy to learn, easy to do. Even the kids can figure it out and play. And! The price was right!!!!
B005K2XM94|5.0|This item is a great case for my kindle, it fits nicely and keeps my kindle from getting scratches and dust.  The price is great for this type of product.  if your in the market for something to hold your kindle, this will do.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love Sparks and this one had a neat twist, liked the supsense..can't wait to see the movie..hope they don't mess it up too much
B000F8O35U|3.0|The quality of this DVD is poor. I think I may be spoiled to bluray, HE, 1080p......I will purchase again when it is finally digitally remastered.
