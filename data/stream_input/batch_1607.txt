B0088RQ4TI|5.0|The movie was surprisingly interesting. The various caveats made it attention grabbing throughout. I recommend watching it to a Sci-Fi, Action, Fantasy fan.
B000WYCF6Q|2.0|I tried to attach this thing everywhere on my bike and I just couldn't make myself happy with it.  I cannot see around myself, even with it on the end of my handlebar, my legs are in the way if I put it down low, it is just not very useful and tends to move if you don't tighten it well enough.  It is also a pain to adjust when you are riding.  I am much happier with my Third Eye Bar End Mirror, easy to adjust and easy to install, I can see everything, unlike with this one.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I can seem to put this game down. If you want a game that challenges you, entertaining, and with a soothing soundtrack...this game's for you.
1449417051|5.0|My sister has WAY too many cats. She will probably become an eccentric old lady, with 20 cats that she names after persian royalty. I once saw this lady, on TV,  who had a bunch of cats, and cut holes in her walls for them to run around. Her husband complained about it; rather unfairly in my opinion. If your wife has a cat, which you hate, then that is the price you pay for someone to wash your socks. If your wife has 20 cats, YOU have 20 cats as well. I guess that it is sexist to assume that women wash your socks; my old lady doesn't really do my laundry. I'm pretty domesticated really; like a good house-cat. Indoor cats are a little gross because they shed,  and their pea has parasites that will dig into your brain or something. I have a bunny right now; and it is also kind of gross, but atleast its poop looks like raisinettes.<br /><br />Anyway, I bought this calendar for my sister. I guess she liked it.... I don't know.
B0019O0W90|5.0|I love love love everything about this album. He makes me cry and wanna dance in matter of a few songs.
B005IQZB14|5.0|superb read. the best way to work on yourself is to accomplish the impossible. i, so enjoyed cheryl strayed's journey, truthful & inspiring.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My daughter received this as a gift, she absolutely loves it.  Detailed instructions are easy to follow for 6 year olds after little explaination.  She constructed it in about half an hour, and she and her little sister played with it all day.  After dismantle, it has been put together with imaginative construction, as well as following the instructions, over and over.  We also have the [[ASIN:B004478GGK LEGO Creator Log Cabin 5766]]and [[ASIN:B0060GDS7U LEGO Friends Stephanie's Pet Patrol 3935]].  All of these go together well.  The girls really get creative, and they love the little 'girls' that come with them.  Way better than some of the more image-centric toys out there.  I really believe that these are confidence and brain boosting!  Great for all ages, I love them too!
B0085776BG|5.0|very enjoyable movie. factual, my dad was one of those bomber crews that made it home because of the red tails, thanks for honoring these men.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|the second book is better than the first book, by far.  The first book was a lot of sex, and not much plot.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|reminds me of Mario brothers sorda.  I enjoy playing it in down time. my kids like it as well. love it... this is the first Ned game I have played and it works well on my kindle fire!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very racey. I was thrown into a world I knew nothing about. Very interesting! Absolutley loved it. Could not put it down once I started!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I found the characters very irritating but once you start reading you cant stop as you have to see how it ends
0307716988|4.0|Starting with the end where we learn that Michael Jackson wasn't going to write an autobiografie, reading is really appreciatable. He was told by two female frieds that every kwown person is doing it, it would be expected. It is easely written. For those who read it short time after it was released there were new and interesting things Michael's life was determined by. It isn't devided in chapters, Michael is telling us about his childhood, his family and the special relationship to his brother Jermaine, joy and sadness and his love for music and dancing. He mentions his best friends like Diana Ross or Liza Minelli or Jane Fonda and others he got in touch by the times and tells how he was influenced by and how thankful he was. In any way, you realise a kind of shyness, you feel the inner barrier MJ used to own, it is an initial view into Michael Jackson's life not only as  artist but also as an caring empathetic human being. Worth reading it is recommendable.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book on advice of others, and how good it was to read.  I thought is had too much sex talk and not enough plot.  The second book was better, and the third book the best of the trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Reccomended to me by my daughter I was not expecting what I got but, once I got into the story I was unable to put it down.  I cried at the first break up, I could not belive it,I was actually enjoying the books, I did surprise myself.  The most awsome books I have read in a long time.
034580404X|5.0|I love this series of books. I hope the author has more coming out! This is a read for when the kids are in bed or you have alone time. Don't leave it laying around for young eyes to see!
B00846REIS|5.0|This was an awesome book, almost as good as the 50 Shades Of Grey Series. I can not wait til the second book is available. I have already preordered the title.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great book, very captivating. Would highly recommend these books, I read one right after the other. It is about a futuristic time as in something that could potentially happen.
B007PF7MGS|4.0|Very practical book. Good explanation of how his theory works and then excellent recipes which are quick and easy to prepare and most importantly taste good. No matter how good something is supposed to be for you if it fails the taste test you just won't stick with it. The recipes included are not just good for you, you'll also enjoy them.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Bought this DVD for my 13 year old granddaughter at her request.  She and her friends absolutely love it.  They watch it over and over and over.  Very popular with this age group.
B004UID2LC|5.0|was very useful app!! downloaded some videos from you tube and this came in handy when we were in no wifi zone
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Missed season 1 when it first came out but saw season 2.  Have since seen season 1.  Excited season 3 will start on PBS in Jan 2013. If you like period mini series this one is based in the early 1900 starting just after the sinking on the Titanic going all the way thru the war.
B008BM9L72|4.0|i enjoyed the read, in fact found it quite addictive. It's not nor does it pretend to be a contender for novel of the year. It's an easy read with a sort of moral running through the story. Do not expect too much except a bit of fun escapism
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! so glad they finally made one for android market. wish you could edit your pins but that's the only issue I have
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We love, love, love this series.  You will be captivated by the characters, the costumes and the conventions of the period.  Truly enchanting and adicting.  Can hardly wait for Season 3.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the book and thought it was thought provoking. I have read the second one and have started on the third.
B0012FE4BS|4.0|Great digital purchase of an album I have on vinyl but haven't listened to in many, many years. What a great way to get back to some Texas blues/rock with the original Tejas Trio.
B005BY3XHC|4.0|The book was excellent. However, I found it very short. I bought it as a kindle version. A general note it was not an abridged version.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Most people are raving about this book, so as an avid reader I almost felt like I had to read it. I found mistakes in the book, so apparently the editor was so caught up in the sexual aspects of the book they forgot to realize some things weren't making sense. Also the booked became rushed and everything began happening too fast. By the time I was finished with book 3 I was sick of this whole trilogy. E.L. James isn't a good author. I don't plan to read anything else she writes. This just strikes me as a book for desperate women. Thumbs down!!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I love her books. This one did not let me down. I am waiting for the next one.<br />I really like the way she uses the history of the same characters in each book.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|The story is known to a number of people but reading it over allows one to experience it from a different perspective as we grow.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in 2 days!!! It has a great story line, but when your done reading it feels like your missing something.
B001FVV2X2|3.0|It is an Ok series, i did not expect much from season one as i read reviews on this show.  Cant say its gripping, original or somthing i would whole heartedly be able to reccoommmmedn to a freind.  it does warm up a bit after a few episodes, dont get too excited or turned off by it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how it turns the quiet in my room into relaxing background noise to help me fall asleep or just to use when I'm reading.  get it :)
B000GFLKF8|3.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was the \\"Inside Man\\" DVD starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster and directed by Spike Lee. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was billed on the DVD cover as \\"A heist thriller like you've never seen.\\" Well, there's a certain truth in that statement. The movie depicted a small, but very well-equipped group of men who invaded a bank and quickly took over and locked everybody in. There might nave been 40 or 50 employees and customers in the bank and they became instant hostages. Of course, the NYC police, with Denzel Washington in the lead role, responded quickly and moved a small army around the bank. Of course, there were  thousands of spectators and the area was crawling with news media people. Then the negotiations began. Of course, the gang wanted a whole list of things including an airplane to carry them away. Nothing seemed to work out and there was a threat to get this thing going or two dead hostages would be thrown out every hour. At this point the movie seemed like a somewhat more serious replay of \\"Dog Day Afternoon.\\"<br /><br />But wait! A secondary plot was slowly developing in negotiations between the bank president, the Mayor of NYC and Jody Foster. It seemed that the whole bank robbery thing wasn't a robbery at all. No money was taken. No one was killed. A few people were roughed up. That was it. It was the bank president's way of retrieving an incriminating document from his own safe deposit box, the only one that was touched. It seemed that the document indicated that the bank president had dealt with the defeated German government during the ending days of WWII in order to get the money to establish the bank in the first place.<br /><br />Well, the whole movie just seemed to fitter away into nothingness. It had a real promising beginning, tapered off in the middle and then just went into this surrealistic Hollywood plot in the end and turned into a real flop, in my opinion. It became very disappointing as the movie progressed and the movie itself seemed to become longer and longer. I guess you might say that it was a high action movie in which the brakes had been applied and it ground to a boring ending. Too bad. The acting was good. The cinema and production values were excellent.<br /><br />Gary Petersony disappointing as the movie progressed and the movie itself seemed to become longer and longer.

The cinema and production values were excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|We tried to watch the movie last week and I could not get it to play at all so I would like my money back or send me a new one.
B008602KQI|2.0|this dvd is desperate to be orginal and i think it just comes out being plain old stupid.  this is one of those movies you cant get through.... silence is better than this movie
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This is one of the few movies series that I would show to my kids.  Very clean and very well done, much like the first one.  Well worth watching.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great game to play.  Great relaxing music...soothing. Simple yet interesting. Would recommend to everyone :) Thanks for a game without all the hype!! LOVE!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great series couldn't put it down!! Wow had all three read in five days. The first book was slow getting started but half way through I was hooked. Very fun read.
B008BIZ06M|5.0|While this isn't their best work, this is their best album in quite some time.  If you are a fan of the band, I don't think you'll regret buying this album.  Not sure I could have said that for the ir last 2 albums
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't read this book unless you are into pornography.  I found it disgusting.  Can't believe author could write about such a domineering character with no regard for reader's sensitivity.  I won't get the next two books of the trilogy.  I've had enough!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|so off the wall good ...<br />the  game of the game and getting<br />there has me on the edge ...<br />WOW
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book reminded me of a film with ed norton & Richard Geer & a simiilar concept, completed better.  Had the lead character stayed true to her \\"evil\\" self it would have been stronger. There were too many victims left in her wake, for just one not to come after her.  The concept of raising a child to spite someone is a project this girl could not see through to the end. It started strong but unravelled with her return.
0307730697|5.0|This was a fantastic book, recomended to my by my brother, i would recomend this book to everyone,  it was fantastic, loved it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app, i would recommend it to anyone that wants to grow in the Word. I love the plans and the way you can set reminders and then make notes after the day is completed.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The writing was great, the story was engaging from the very beginning.  The ending was a little disappointing,  but overall I would highly recomend this book
B000IEXVCC|5.0|Naomi is hot!  Laura is hot.  Story is ingenious.  A capella of \\"crying\\" in spanish a great touch.  David Lynch is one of a kind.  Have to see a it couple of times to understand.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Got this to replace a cd that i used to use to go to sleep with. I dont have a cd player any more so i was desparate. This app works great and i love that i can personalize my experience.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not much of a reader; however, I have read all 3 books and loved each one. I just hope that there will be more to come.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Great book could not put it down got my heart racing a few times.Loved all three books. Almost done reading the prequeal.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I could kick myself for succumbing to the hype around these books, and have to seriously question the intellect of people raving about it.  The book is poorly written, it has a weak premise for a storyline, and is sensationalized simply because the author has added descriptions of sexual intercourse, which too are so repetitive and mundane in their predictability.  This is an absolute do not bother book.  I'm sure people will continue to buy it, but their disappointment in the dumbed-down plot and ability of the author to actually write creatively and with maturity will be sure to disappoint. Fifty shades of bleh....
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Great beginning to an awesome trilogy. Was my husband's first time seeing it and he really enjoyed it. Must see.
B0018RFLN0|5.0|I had no problems streaming this video. The quality of the movie was great and I enjoyed watching this movie. I would use Amazon instant video again.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Excellent read. The third book in the Outlander series keeps you wanting more. I would highly recommend. Great story. Cannot say enough about the Outlander books
B002PJN59M|5.0|I had the privilege to see this movie when it first came out in the theatres, although I was just a teen. I was aware it was more than just your typical 70s films. It was moral poetry and costume designing was very realistic and still today, I mean...not just wonderful acting, costume design is very authentic in appearance. This film, Excalibur is one of my favorite having to do with Knights, if not my actual favorite. In regards to picture quality, it's an excellent copy.<br /><br />Arthur: This excellent knight, who fought with fairness and grace, was meant to win. ... whose power was meant to unite all men... not to serve the vanity of a single man.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Wheat Belly: amazing medical detail; got a little bogged in the middle but made it to the end and it gave me lots to think about, already found wheat and nut free cereal.  Hard when your partner is also got an egg and nut allergy to make most of the receipes listed. Also have autistic kid - about to give up wheat after reading this and hopefully will see siginifant weight loss and improved health.
B008602KQI|4.0|Often, the movie adaptation of a book leaves you disappointed. That was not the case with The Hunger Games. The way they presented the story was absolutely fantastic and I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the book.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This app has done everything I wanted it to do. Syncs with my email, easy to add dates, and reoccuring dates are entered like a breeze. Great product!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Liking book a lot.  Keeps your interest especially when your a parent.  I kept thinking \\"could have been me\\".  High recommendation.  Expect lively discussion at book club.
B008I34YYY|5.0|This movie is beyond ridicules, the story is WAY over the top, most of the actors are terrible, and i have no idea why i loved every minute of it. Don't miss out, check out this awesome B movie now.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Finished Steve Jobs and immediately started it reading again. Thought I would be reading a corporate biography and instead it was a moving account of the era, the person, the products and the company. If you want to understand why Apple happened and how Steve Jobs, in all his contradictions and complexity, became the force of nature behind Apple, this is a book well worth reading.
B007SGM084|5.0|I avoided reading this book for a long time....but I finally caved and bought it.  I'm glad I did.  Yes, it has X-rated sex, but it also has some very funny parts. I especially enjoy reading the e-mails between Ana and Christian. It's a good story. To tell you the truth, I think every woman fantasizes about meeting a \\"Christian Grey\\", but if you can't, buy the book!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Similar to the first three.  Perhaps he has a plan, but I have a feeling that this series could easily have been condensed into 3 or possibly 4 books.  But I guess more books = more money.  I've read the first books in quick succession.  But, I think I need a bit of a break - will probably come back to it once I've heard that the final book has been written.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If you are looking for a way to kill time this is a good way to do it. Fun and entertaining exercise for your brain.
B000TERDHA|4.0|LCD Soundystem is like an electronic reincarnation of the Talking Heads. Great grooves, great act.  So sorry they're no longer making music!
B007CI81IQ|4.0|Uncovering interesting facts based on concrete data and information, inspiring, however, book is written in loose structure, not direct to conclusion in some cases.
B008JAFXOQ|2.0|I found the first hour of the movie good but then it just seemed to drag on. There was alot of parts in the movie that just did not seem to fit in.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is seriously the best game ever. its so addictive and its so simple. connect dots? sure. connect dots,  fill up space,  and do it in as little moves possible? AWESOME. and don't fey me started on the sound effects. Hahahah just get the game. you'll thank me later kindle users.  peace.
B004MWI2M0|5.0|This set, based on a scene from a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, is fun to build, has great play features, and is good value for the money.<br /><br />The build begins with putting together the four detailed minifigs. Next, you build the base of the mill, which is full of nice little details. Small pieces are used to give the walls a texture (a common feature in recent Lego sets); there are also stickers which are printed with rock overlays. Brown flat pieces are angled on the roof plates to give the impression of a ramshackle building. One side of the mill is a bell tower, which has a zip line -- a minifig can grab the handle of one end of a rope, and the other end is tied to a bell weight, which can drop, pulling the minifig upwards. The final part of the build is the mill-wheel itself. This is slightly tedious and has to be done precisely; the instruction book has a scale diagram that may help children do it properly. The end result is great, though -- the mill wheel sits on an indentation on the base, and there's a level that lets you pop it up so it rolls away freely. The wheel also spins, but you can balance swordfighting minifigs on top of it as long as you're careful to place them so they keep the wheel in equilibrium.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone who is buying multiple Pirates of the Caribbean sets, or appreciates clever Lego design.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|good actors good script interesting concept  easily down loaded I have a wireless connect to the tv so I can watch on the bigger screen preytty much a win win.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I have to have a constant noise to go to sleep with.  I slept with this on all night over the weekend and it helped.  My husband wasn't too happy with it but I had it on very low.  There are several sounds and variations to choose from.  I recommend it to anyone wanting to relax or have a sound to sleep to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down! I read this in one day and I would recommend this book to anyone of appropriate age of course. Opened my eyes to things I had no idea about, and my husband enjoyed the benefits of me reading this book!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The special features were very informative and interesting.  I watched the movie again after seeing the special features and was aware of so much more, really enhanced my appreciation of the movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so glad that there is finally an app for kindle! if you love pinterest, you'll love this app! better than droids app as well.
B008BM9L72|2.0|Not worth the read. Considerable repetition and poor grammar contribute to poor read. Felt like a cheap version of Mills and Boon.
0345803507|5.0|I was on vacation in Charleston SC with my best friend and she was telling me about the Trilogy of Fifty Shades Books (3), while out shopping I found the frist two Frifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker, but couldn't find Fifty Shades Freed so I went on Amazon and there it was ordered it and it was delivered fast.  Thanks for such an AWESOME transaction.
B008602KQI|2.0|I've read all three books and was looking forward to the movie I purchased.  I'm aware it's hard to make a movie from such an outstanding book such as the Hunger Games series.  With that being said, I was VERY disappointed in the movie.  It was a VERY poor example of what might have been done with that book.  It covered such a few actual chapters of the Hunger Games story line and much of the information was incorrect (e.g.  Madge gave Katniss the mockingjay pin NOT Prim).  The actors were poorly chosen from the mental description from the book (e.g. Woody Harrelson as Haymich.  PLEASE!!!  How insulting).  I'll not watch nor purchase any other of the series books movies if they are made.  The books were AWESOME!!!  I compare the accuracy to the movie made of Clan of the Cave Bear.  It was ALSO a poor example of a GREAT book by Jean Auel!!!!  I've not talked to even one person who really liked the movie compared to the book and they are also not willing to purchase another butchered movie!!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|This trilogy has been reviewed a million times already but frankly it's an entertaining read if you don't expect the book was written by a literary Giant.  Yes she repeats herself multiple times ( \\"Fair point well made Miss Steele\\"...ugh) but on the whole the characters were well developed, sympathetic and for those of us with some familial abuse in their past, perhaps a bit too close for comfort.<br />It a good trilogy for a rainy weekend.  Yes the intimacy gets a bit redundant but its fun; enjoy it.  You need to buy all three because it's really one book divided poorly into three.
B00632HWOG|4.0|A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am a mother of four and work part time as an RN. I spend a little time on Pinterest after the children are in bed on the nights I'm not scheduled to work. I tend to focus on the recipes and crafts. There is something for EVERYONE on Pinterest. My friend recently described this site as a fantasy land - a time sucker...I understand how this could be true for some. One could spend hours pinning travels on wish lists, or repinning every sexy pic of Tatum Channing on the web... I have been able to stay away from all that so far. There are several recipes that I've tested, and will add to our house menus. This is true for several of the crafts I've done with the younger kids. My experience with Pinterest has been a positive one!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|You can say that Flow is boring, but I say it is awesome. Flow is not for fun. It's just testing your mental mind, on how fast you can decipher the image. I think that it is very intruging, and very educated for slow people who doesn't grasp things in a minute. It's great for children too. Testing their speed ability.<br /><br />I hope ya'll will download this educated app after you read this.<br /><br />Love,  Anonymous Reviewer
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really enjoy it on my down time. hard to complete most task because of the acorns..they arexreally hard to earn, never the less you enjoy it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free.
B008BM9L72|1.0|This was a must read for book club and I could not read this rubbish.  This is the most badly written bit of tripe I have been given to read and I am at a loss to understand it's popularity or the income generated for the author (cough). I only gave it one star to proceed - I can't give it none.  Absolute tripe!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am so happy I did not chose to purchase all three books. I find this book rather troubling and sad.I wont bother to read the other two as it is not the type of emotional and pschycological fix I need. It is degrading, abusive and emotionally immature..
B003SWNRU2|5.0|This album is great!I cosidered this album will become a new classic! It's time to enjoy the new  accepts´s era.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Overall pretty enjoyable. Although I don't want to pay real money to play a free app, it was enjoyable to play.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Unlike facebook,  this app works perfectly on my kindle fire and doesn't repeat segments over and over or freeze up.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I honestly wish that I had thought about this myself!!!  I'm forever taking pics or making notes in my phone about things that interest me, or that I want to try.  My notes either get lost or I just forget about them.  The convenience of locating everything that has interested me all in one place is just awesome.  Definitely helps keep my organized when shopping.<br /><br />But the best is sharing!  I have found the best ideas while perusing other pins with similar interests as mine.  Another great feature is pinning on separate boards to keep things organized.  By the way, it's very easy to use too!
B008602KQI|4.0|I expected a bit more based on the hype of this movie. However, I really liked it and look forward to the next sequel.
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I tried to download! Movie was oo big for Kindle Fire. Didn't get to watch. Very disappointed. Paid for nothing.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|really like this game. haveing no problems with it on my kindle fire. not to hard to do the puzzles but not easy either.
B003V5ED7W|5.0|A great older movie that is very funny and perfect for a family movie night! I would watch it more than once.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest but this app only lets me use it at certain times of the night. I cannot for the life of me get it to work during the day.
030758836X|1.0|I'm not sure what I just spent the last 24 hours reading. One could argue that it must've been a good book since I was unable to put it down, but it's quite the opposite. I kept reading it, hoping the story would get better. That the characters would develop in a more thoughtful and cohesive way. All I can say is this book left me with the same feeling as a horror movie that ends with the main character waking up from a horrible dream. That the whole movie wasn't real. The back and forth of the two characters just started to annoy me a third into the book. I can say, though, that the author did a great job in creating a \\"psycho bitch\\" character, because boy, did I want to punch Amy by the end of the book.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I think Steven Erikson has done a great thing writing the books the way he has. I am on his second book in the series now, and they are extremely difficult to START. He throws you into a river and expects you to swim like a fish, which I think is very unrealistic for most casual readers. Once you get past the fast start, his books are extremely difficult to put down. He has done something I think is very cool by the way he engineered magic in his world. There are the different types but how people access their magic is very cool. Also, he puts a character into this book which has almost unlimited power, but he writes him very well. It's an easy trap for authors to just make their characters all powerful with no rules, and much harder to limit their powers, but he pulls it off excellently in this novel. I couldn't be happier to be reading the 2nd book in the series since I got past the hard start again! You will feel so good putting down his books, the only problem will be wanting to read the rest of the series immediately!
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoy this book. Much better than 50 Shades although the characters and storyline were very similar.  Can't wait for book 2 to come out!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This a suspenseful, compelling story of human endurance & resilience. Particularly poignant tale of kinship & family relationships defined by love & devotion rather than lineage.
B0085776BG|4.0|Red Tails was a fun movie. I rated it 4 stars; not from an Oscar standpoint, but from the standpoint of how enjoyable the movie was for me. The action sequences were breathtaking, and the sounds effects / musical score made me feel like I was in the middle of the battles. All in all, it is most definitely worth renting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's a great calculator it helps with my homework and insted of looking and looking for my dads calculator I can just open my ipad and open this calculator
B008602KQI|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie so much that I actually took a couple hours off of work to see it when it first opened (which I have NEVER done before).  For the most part, I was disappointed in the movie itself.  I suppose if I hadn't read the book, I would have a different opinion, but nevertheless I was disappointed.  I ordered the DVD, however, because it helps pass the time when flying.  I don't much care for Woody Harrelson and after having read the books, he did not fit my idea of what Haymitch should have looked like or acted like.  Rue's death scene and Katniss' reaction was a little underplayed in the movie.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I think it's more fun to watch you lose these games or win at the last minute! A nice twist to a classic time waster!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The first Shades of Grey book is one that I couldn't put down. It's funny, sexy, serious, thought provoking, shocking and scandalous all in one. I have downloaded book 2 and 3 onto my Kindle and can't wait to get into the second book!

B008602KQI|4.0|Definately liked that they didn't use bunch of tern crazed strs but sad that so much from the book was change and/or left out.
B0083GR6Y6|2.0|Watched this through Amazon's movie rental feature from my ps3 and the quality was absolutely terrible. The movie was also terrible too. The only reason it gets 2 stars is Liam Neeson has an accent and voice like Morgan Freeman. it doesn't matter what kind of movie they're in, they always make their roles enjoyable.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was never a fan of twilight etc but I did enjoy watching this movie with my wife. I don't think this is just a teenage book/movie as it deals with some really big society issues, I would recommend this movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book a lot.  It kept me interested and was thought provoking.  I would definitely recommend the book and read others by Gillian Flynn.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|One of the best that Nicholas Sparks has written....kept you wondering..left you breathless, once I started it was hard to put down...Nicolas Sparks has done it again with his talent for writing
B001RMYWG8|5.0|As a criminal justice & law student with many friends in law enforcement, and some of them with the NYPD, I found this movie amazing. It was pretty realistic, and kept with what really happened in real life pretty well. However, Frank Serpico never got handed his gold detective shield while lying in the bed at the hospital after he got shot. He actually just went into a police precinct and picked it up from a surly desk officer. Besides that, it was a great movie, and it's one of the movies I own that I'll definitely be watching more than once.
B00846REIS|3.0|I thought it was a little too quick moving with the advances, coming off of reading the 50 shades series, but I am going to finish this series, just to see how she wraps this up!  Easy reading too.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i looved this app! it gives you a whole update of your batery! it id perfect !!! you muust have it! im sure you eont be disapointed
B0070Y46UY|5.0|When I read 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' or 'South of the Border, West of the Sun' or 'The Kite Runner;' I thought I would not find another book of the same quality that gave me the same magnitude of emotions. I was obviously wrong because Life of Pi truly excelled in all aspects. Definitely a book worth reading, not exactly a master piece, not exactly a work of fiction or of religious purposes...just something of its own that makes up for a whole new world and a great adventure.
B008602KQI|5.0|I had watched the movie at the theater and I am very pleased to own it now.  I love that I can watch it on my kindle fire also.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great read, good story line, real page turner . Lots of action and romance .  Love story with lots of drama.

B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was a really nice surprise. I thought it would be boring but the writer's honesty is refreshing and keeps you drawn in. She is not trying to make you like her, which is obvious by telling things about herself that are not good or likeable, however, you can't help but respect her and support her on her journey.
B00138D27Q|5.0|This album is a classic for its time. Lou Reed was a revolutionary artist from the Velvet Underground and this became one of the critically acclaimed albums for the glam rock age. With Bowie and Eno involved and some great musicians it is worth owning.
B008EQIK90|2.0|Comedy was predictable and sad that every other word is the f bomb.  The best part of this movie was to see JD in his cameo role.
B000TO0TB2|5.0|These are completely different stories that you might expect. I loved it and I am a big fan of Paul Auster's work.
0547564651|5.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00HMD4XLU An Executive Summary of Paul Tough's 'How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character']]<br /><br />The main argument: When it comes to a child's future success, the prevailing view recently has been that it depends, first and foremost, on mental skills like verbal ability, mathematical ability, and the ability to detect patterns-all of the skills, in short, that lead to a hefty IQ. However, recent evidence from a host of academic fields--from psychology, to economics, to education, to neuroscience-has revealed that there is in fact another ingredient that contributes to success even more so than a high IQ and impressive cognitive skills. This factor includes the non-cognitive qualities of perseverance, conscientiousness, optimism, curiosity and self-discipline-all of which can be included under the general category of `character'. In his new book How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character writer Paul Tough explores the science behind these findings, and also tracks several alternative schools, education programs and outreach projects that have tried to implement the lessons-as well as the successes and challenges that they have experienced.<br /><br />To begin with, Tough establishes how studies have now shown that while IQ and scores on standardized tests are certainly highly correlated with academic and future success, that non-cognitive characteristics actually predict success better than cognitive excellence. For instance, the psychologist Angela Duckworth has found that students' scores on self-discipline tests predict their GPA's better than their IQ scores. Likewise, it has been shown that the related characteristic of conscientiousness is even more predictive of a student's eventual success in college, and in their future earnings, than their scores on cognitive tests. Over and above this, it has also been found that both self-discipline and conscientiousness are highly correlated with all manner of positive outcomes, including in areas such as one's likelihood of abusing drugs and alcohol; getting in trouble with the law; maintaining healthy social relationships--including getting and staying married etc. And the good news character traits do not end here. Indeed, similar results have been found regarding the personality traits of perseverance (or grit), curiosity and optimism et al.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it has not been as clear just how we can cultivate these character traits in young people. Nevertheless, several promising avenues have been identified. To begin with, it has been shown that exposure to highly stressful and traumatic events in childhood can severely hamper the growth of character. However, it has also been shown that strong parental nurturance and attentiveness in response to these traumatic events can overcome the effect of the experiences themselves. In addition, the evidence is that the attentive and nurturing approach is effective even in the absence of traumatic events, as it is highly correlated with strong character development throughout the lifespan.<br /><br />While nurturance is certainly the most important factor early on, Tough argues that the cultivation of character during later childhood and adolescence requires somewhat of a different approach. Indeed, while the field is quite a bit more speculative here, it would appear that what is needed at this stage is for a young person to have the opportunity to take risks (some of which will no doubt result in failure), and to learn how to manage their failures in a constructive way. Success has been achieved using this approach in such programs as Elizabeth Spiegel's chess program at Intermediate School 318 in Brooklyn (while it remains a challenge at schools that cater to the wealthy, such as the Riverdale Country School in New York--on account of the fact that wealthy parents are increasingly shielding their children from failure).<br /><br />Beyond this, we find that results have also been achieved among some young people simply by steeping them in a culture of character, and by informing them of how certain character traits can lead them to greater success, and allowing their own ambition to take over from there. Indeed, this type of approach is practiced both at the KIPP family of schools, and in the OneGoal education program in Chicago. While the approach itself may not be a silver bullet, early indications are that it can indeed have a very positive effect.<br /><br />Tough's writing style is very readable, honest and unpretentious, and he does an excellent job of supporting the scientific evidence that he introduces with interesting and powerful anecdotes (indeed, many of these are enough to bring you to tears). This is a strong argument in favor of paying closer to attention to cultivating character in young people, both in our personal lives and in our public policy.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is amazing.  It has totally changed my life.  It has taught me how to not take myself too seriously and to not take on other people's \\"stuff\\" and not to read into what is happening and just accept what is for what it is.  I recommend this to everyone and I am going to buy it for everyone on my Christmas list this year! Love this!
B00846REIS|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Cant wait for the next 2 books to come out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its AMAZING! I reccomend it to everyone I know!! As good of a story as 50 Shades of grey!! Couldnt put this book down!
B0037NB6QE|4.0|I actually started reading this book 2 years ago at a bed and breakfast where my husband and I were staying for our anniversary. I didn't get to finish it, so I decided to buy it so I could see how it ended. I enjoyed reading it and am now reading another book in that series, \\"Twenty Wishes.\\" If you enjoy a good \\"yarn,\\" I would recommend this one.
0143113100|5.0|I keep buying this book over and over again because I keep giving away my copies to friends.<br /><br />Doidge strikes the perfect balance between technical detail and accessibility. In other words, you don't need to be a neuro-scientist to understand what he's talking about, but it's also not over-simplified.<br /><br />Apart from some of the directly applicable things I learned from this book, I'd say the best thing this book offers is a sense of hope and optimism.<br /><br />We all have things about ourselves we think would be impossible to change - limits we'd like to overcome but perhaps have come to accept are unchangeable.<br /><br />With story after story of people rewiring their brains - for example, a man who regains complete mobility, even climbing mountains after a stroke completely destroys his motor cortex - you can't help feeling that remarkable changes are possible.<br /><br />Cannot recommend this book enough.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love love love! have NO complaints! by far, my favorite and most used app! love everything about it. yay =)
B006BAEQB2|3.0|This was interesting historically, but all of the killing and nepotism were quite unsettling.  I know that these things really happened and I am sorry for that but was there never any sustained happiness for these people amidst all of the infighting?  I do want to read the next book  in the series and hopefully, less sadness and grief will appear.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is my favorite app.  I can sit for hours and enjoy all that it has to offer.  I love it!!!
B0044WSF5M|5.0|Best movie ever made about the era of the early 60s. Spawned a hundred spin-offs and rip-offs but none even close to the original. It's worth watching the movie for just the sound track and Wolfman Jack.
B00004XQ83|5.0|watched the movie a hundred times...love the music, but this item was a gift for a friend.. she was very excited!!
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|Super awesome! You know when you listen to album and you have to skip to the good songs? Well this album has only good songs. Shocking, I know.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|It is a fantasy  game.  But I got it and it removed my old one. I was mad. I wish I did not do it.
145210655X|5.0|I bought this for my son-in-law who will soon be a daddy.  We are both Star Wars fans, and the book was a fun way to share some parental humor.  It's a really cute book, and you can't go wrong with making Darth Vader ridiculous.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|The layering of genuine talent over production-end genius makes this a great listen through to the last track.  It is interesting to me that although there are times when the lyrics can be interpreted so many different ways, the songs also have a firm meaning all of their own.  Worth the $5 I paid.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This is the sort of well written book that's hard to find amongst the populist drivel that passes for writing. An excellent read with deep wells of enjoyment hidden under the seemingly shallow depths. If you're looking for glamour, excitment, a superhero or alien or two, then don't read this book. It examines the extraordinary nature of our seemingly ordinary lives and it's a wonderful book.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors and once again I'm not disappointed.  Harry Bosch, a hard boiled L.A. cop is trouble again and once again manages to get him self out of it.This time he thinks maybe it's time<br />to retire. or is it?
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had a true Love/hate relationship for this book and the characters in it.  As I started the book, I couldn't imagine why it has been on the best seller list for these past weeks.  But as I read and was caught up in the tale woven by Gillian Flynn, I certainly understood it's popularity.  You have a roller coaster feeling for Nick and Amy - anger, disgust, compassion, frustration and then fear that switches back from one to the other.  After the first fourth of the book, when I settled in to the style of writing, I found it hard to put \\"Gone Girl\\" down.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This alchemy game is as ridiculous as Pokemon and I mean that in a good way, but bad for Pokemon. Just that combining 2 elements will become of something that may surprise you. Its so random and some are funny! I laughed when I got alcoholic. As if that's an element? I guess according to this game it is.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a nice example of a well-designed app that works within the limitations of phones. Magnificent design and a fun game of thinking.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I am not the typical reader of this kind of book.  So much so, that I have refused to look at them.  This was a very well written book with practical examples, easy to connect to, powerful and enjoyable.  Recommend it to anyone who feels ready to work on themselves or get a different perspective.
B00887490Y|4.0|Fun twists and turns, good suspense and action and nary a horror or supernatural element at all to goo up the works - what's not to like about this more than adequate B-movie ride?  Jessica Biel, all washed out and working classy, does a strong job fully clothed (sad to say) but the story supports her well.  There are at least two major detours that lead you where you don't expect.  B movie thrills and something that forces you to think as you watch.  Don't like thinking at the movies?  Go see Avengers again.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I get that you need to buy helpers but why cant we buy them with the coins we earn instead?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely rivoting read.<br />Got all three books - just loved them all.<br />I wish there were more in the series<br />Well worth reading
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a suspenseful and scary story about a woman who is gone mentally and physically. She has a personality disorder that inflicts pain on everyone she meets from childhood thru present time.
B004LWZW6U|1.0|JUST AWFUL!  It's a grade Z movie, the 3D content is only marginal. and even the pretty girls can't save this one.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Awesome story, very moving! I loved the characters! I couldn't put the book down. I read the second book as well.
B008602KQI|5.0|Set in a future North America ruled by a central government, this is the story of a teenage girl's participation in a contest between representatives of the country's districts.  It is a deadly contest; all participants, except one, must die.  After a few days of training in survival skills and weapons use, the contestants, two from each district, are set down in a special habitat, to face each other and with few food items.  The acting is excellent and the story is riveting.  A must see!
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is one of those albums you can listen to without feeling the urge to skip a song! Highly recommend!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the best movie!  You will never be sorry you ordered this DVD.  Go ahead and buy two, because you are going to wear one of them out!
B005OSUKSA|5.0|Buy it! You will become hooked. David Garrett's new album Legacy really showcases his amazing virtuostic talent. The Beethoven and Corelli pieces are my favorites. After you hear David play classic music you will never want to buy any product but HIS. I play this over and over and never tire of it. My fifth album purchase of David's and he never disappoints. P.S. His concerts are pure musical bliss. Thanks David!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This is a fantastic series.  I love mysteries and this great.  I've been watching \\"PLL\\" from the beginning.  If you like mysteries; this is the show for you.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Longmire books are one of those that you can't put down. You can't wait to get back to Absaroka County!
B001J29H9I|5.0|I collect great cover songs and this entire album is wonderful. The Black Keys do an amazing job balancing the Delta Blues sound of Junior Kimbrough with their updated versions of these songs.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|History buffs will have a new view of Richard III.  Many readers take their clues from Shakespeare: Richard was a villian who murdered the two little princes in the Tower. Gregory presents Richard from the viewpoint of his faithful wife; and, the familiar events have a different flavor. The story is innovative and fascinating.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Functionally it works great - I've had no problems with it at all.<br />As far as game-play, it's simple and distracting fun.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|CalenGoo is wonderful!!!  I had been searching for a calendar program that I could use OFFline, but also have ONline availability.  It seems like when I'm in a physician's office trying to schedule a future appointment, there is never wi-fi available.  All of the other calendar programs I had found had mixed reviews and only worked with wi-fi access.  I also wanted to be able to synchronize the calendar from my computer.  CalenGoo gives you the best of both worlds!!  I have ready access to my complete calendar without wi-fi, as well as from any computer with internet service...even my Kindle Fire, which is what I carry to all appointments.  It helps me to pass my time while I'm there, plus helps keep track of all appointments so I don't have to call back and reschedule.  It's been a huge time saver and I LOVE this calendar program!!!  The calendar has different views so you can see a day, a week, or even a month at a time.  It's easy to use and works well.  I would highly recommend it!!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|The junk food industry is a multi billion dollar industry thus the truth about the dangers of consuming manufactured food has to be hidden. The author does a great job of using logic to arrive at his conclusions. I am convinced his theories are correct.
B005COO1X6|3.0|The book started out really great. Had a great flow and intense feeling. As I read further I became more excited to read the ending. Then, finally the ending chapter came and it was done. Just done. It didn't elaborate on the what happened to the characters. It didn't go into depth about what happened after the incident. Nothing.. just done. Until then I thought it was a great book. I was very dissapointed. Overall, an easy & quick read worth it for that. I paid for what I got in the end.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very well done game. Never played the first, so can't compare, but this game stands on its own as a relaxing brain teaser.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|Michael Douglas does one of the best jobs in his career playing the wealthy-but-jaded investment banker, Nicolas Van Orton, a man who tells his secretary, \\"You don't know about society, so you don't have the pleasure of avoiding it.\\" Divorced and living alone in his magnificent San Francisco mansion, Nicolas is enduring yet another birthday (his 48th, the same age his father was when he committed suicide) when he receives an unexpected visit from his younger brother, Conrad (a gleefully-going-for-broke Sean Penn), the black sheep of the family with a history of drug use. Conrad looks good, though, and he comes bearing an unusual birthday gift: a game.<br /><br />What follows is a chaotic, uncertain series of events that could be anything: social terrorism, a massive con, financial sabotage, or the world's most elaborate mind game. Run by a company called Consumer Recreation Services (or CRS), the game ends up infecting every aspect of Nicolas's life, from chance encounters with homeless men to the guy who reads the evening news. Nicolas's mind and life fray ever further as he struggles to figure out just what is going on. He is given an 800 number at the start of the game and told, \\"Do not call asking for the object of the game. Figuring that out is the object of the game.\\"<br /><br />Others have argued about plotholes in the script -- the game is unbelievably complex in both its planning and execution, and it relies on events adhering to a finely-tuned sense of timing and place -- but these concerns are dealt with deftly by the dialogue if you're paying attention. Ultimately, the point of the film -- what it takes to re-engage with life (let's just say it costs someone an exorbitant amount of money and someone else an exorbitant amount of pain) -- is so beautifully managed by Fincher's meticulous directing that whatever questions you might have about the reality of it all take a backseat to the intricate and masterful psychology of the whole thing. Maybe the point is that -- like the Bible says -- it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter heaven, even if heaven is just another word for whatever joy there is to find in life, be it family, friends, or love.<br /><br />Enjoy the ride, then watch it and enjoy it again. Each viewing, for me, reveals even more attention to detail and continues to be -- as it was when I first saw it -- a rewarding experience. Even still, as one character says, \\"I wish I could go back and do it again for the first time.\\" I can't do that with this film, but the message of the movie is that even when life feels like it has been lived to the end, maybe -- no matter how outrageous the cost -- there is a way to go back and start it over again.<br /><br />Film Buff Factoid: Pay close attention to the end of the film for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo by Spike Jonze.is that -- like the Bible says -- it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter heaven, even if heaven is just another word for whatever joy there is to find in life, be it family, friends, or love.<br /><br />Enjoy the ride, then watch it and enjoy it again.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|The Characters are very interesting and well defined.  The second book has an intriguing story line.  You don't want to put it down.  I liked how much more in depth you learn about each character.  It's always fun to read about wealth and how it's used.  Fact or fiction, a lot of it rings true and is very relatable.
B005I4JG80|5.0|As a new mother I am hungry for any advice to make my world run more smoothly. This book is a mixure of practical advice and personal anecdotes making it a how-to book that feels more like a conversation with a friend. I was constantly entertained as I followed Druckerman along her journey raising children in France. She details her experiences unlocking the secrets french parents use for sleeping, manners,and eating just to name a few. Her realizations about the differences in american and french parenting are well researched and explained in a way that is easily applied. While it doesn't promise to solve all your parenting dilemas, it does give hope that you may have the tools to raise a well behaved and happy child. I wish I had read it sooner.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love love.  I think it is better than facebook!  Very helpful.  I spend way to much time on it than I should.
B008XG1X18|4.0|love finally being able to repine things on my Kindle fire and not just browse the Pinterest site.  the app crashes often.  really annoying.  when it works it is great but it doesn't always work.  I keep providing app feedback in the hopes they will recognize the problem and post an update.  so it is better than the mobile site but I still cannot recommend this app otherwise.<br /><br />*update*  they have since modified the app and it has a lot of quick access features like holing down a finger on the pin and swiping to rejoin, like, or share.  I love Pinterest and am glad to see the app working with the Kindle Fire now. ;)
1402270275|5.0|I. Loved. This book.<br /><br />Dark, and gritty, with a scrumptious blend of steampunk, vampires, sex, and danger, this book captured me from the very first paragraph and wouldn't let me go until I'd finished it.  I actually ended up staying up all night reading it, even knowing I had to get up early the next morning, because I couldn't stand the thought of putting it down.<br /><br />That doesn't happen often with me.<br /><br />Blade was delicious, with his barely-leashed violence and animalistic intensity when it came to Honoria, and he easily ranks as one of my new favorite heroes in romance.<br /><br />Honoria, too, was a surprisingly enjoyable character, with just enough stubbornness and pride to keep things interesting, but well balanced with quite a bit of intelligence and passion.<br /><br />The gloriously dark world-building, the steampunk elements blended beautifully with the paranormal, the luscious romance and the incredible chemistry all added up to a must read for any fan of gothic romance with a steampunk twist.<br /><br />5/5 Stars<br /><br />{This book provided, free of charge, by the publisher, in exchange for an honest review. Full review available on The Romanceaholic}
1439127700|4.0|This book offers a lot of insight, and the material is interesting, as well as it is probably new to many who may not have studied much presidential history.<br /><br />The only other opportunity one might take to obtain this material would be to read biographies on each of the former presidents....that is a bunch of reading!<br /><br />It is an interesting book, well written and easy to read.  Anyone with even the least bit of interest in American history or political science will enjoy reading it and benefit from it.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Classic Crouch style, perfect pacing and edge of your seat reading.  IF you liked Run you'll love it.  If you didn't like Run... well I don't know what to do with you!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is just as wonderful if not more so than The Pillars of the Earth.  The characters make me feel like I know them personally, and the historical aspect is fascinating.  I am just over halfway through the book and am already sad about finishing it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to try this app. I passed by it several times. A new version came out and after reading so many good reviews I decided to try the new one. After playing some of the new version (and loving it) I went back and purchased this one also.  I really like both Quell games.  So glad I tried it. Thanks for a fun..relaxing game.  :-)
B0068LYEHA|5.0|This book is brutally honest, hysterically funny, and socially and politically relevant. I love this book and will have my daughters read it when they come of age.
B00846REIS|1.0|There are too many similarities between this book and Fifty Shades of Grey to be a coincidence.  It feels like a cheap imitation.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Beautiful game, no permissions, can't get any better than this. Should win an award for being so amazing. Best game ever. Even better than angry birds
B0031R5K68|3.0|I was excited to get my hands on this book, having read Dan Brown's previous best sellers. Disappointed that the book did not live upto my expectations. The plot is the same as in The Davinci Code and some of the characters felt like lifted from the book and put in a different location even if you leave out Mr Langdon. It is a timepass when you dont have anything to do but not a compelling reading. It becomes a bit boring if the plots are repeated particularly after a massive success with a similar storyline not long ago.
B0012ELLB0|5.0|Just wonderful Dead.<br />A must have for any Deadhead, or anybody that would like to sample some dead without getting into their super-long concert albums.<br />'Box of Rain', 'Ripple', and 'Friend of the Devil' are all Dead standards.

B0068AWO00|4.0|I was a fan of the original 1985 Fright Night with Roddy McDowall. Before watching this version, I had my family watch the original (It's just a thing I have my kids do). I was worried they'd make fun of the oldness (for lack of a better word), but they quite enjoyed it.<br /><br />So now on to this new release. Though it kept to a similar basic format, it was a departure from the original. Matter-of-fact, the only thing in common was the plot - Vampire moves in next door and no one believes the boy next door. My family was looking for some of the characteristics that made the old version what it was; in particular, the goofiness of the friend - Evil Ed. He was nowhere to be found. However, in the new version Ed is just as unique and acceptably played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Go Mc Lovin!).<br /><br />After you get beyond the differences, you come to realize that this new version of Fright Night is so well done that you no longer care. My son-in-law can be very critical of movies. You know the type... \\"That's 80 minutes of my life I'll never get back\\", and yet even he admitted it was a \\"darn\\" good movie. Rent it, buy it... you won't be disappointed.
B001DF68MA|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3DRIUDTNEEPQS]]Fraudulent Listing.  I have included this video so you can see its real size.  I bought this item because I love bicycling and I wanted to be able to take my 1 year old and my 2 year old with me.  Item claims to be able to seat a 4 year old up to 40 lbs.  My daughter is 2 and weighs 24lbs and my son is 1 and weigh 20 lbs.  Watch the video of them to determine if this item is good for you    ** Edit **    Several people have made comments saying there is some way to adjust this thing.  This was several years ago I shot this video and I do not recall any way to adjust it for longer legs, etc.  The point I was trying to make is that the ad states a child of a certain size can fit in there, and clearly my children did not.      If I was in fact incorrect and there was an adjustment that I did not see, show me a video of your child fitting in their safely and I will gladly retract my video.  But when I purchase something that says my children fit into it safely and as far I I can tell they do not fit in it safely, I believe the ad is fraudulent
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is amazing, and so relaxing. I have never played anything like it before, but I really enjoyed it.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|THE MOVIE WAS ENTERTAINING, HOWEVER CLASH OF THE TITANS HAD A BETTER STORY.BETWEEN THE TWO SHOWS THERE IS A BIG GAP.
B008EQIEWS|2.0|We love Liam, but as much as the family wanted to enjoy this movie, it was just lacking... something (we all agreed). Because it is Part II to Clash of the Titans, most of you will eventually watch it out of dedication. If for nothing else your OCD will get the better of you as if it were unfinished business. All I can say is, don't say I didn't warn you. Personally I'd wait until it is released on cable.
1439102430|4.0|Smart, often funny and always thought provoking this installment of the Temperance Brennan series doesn't disappoint.<br />Tempe is back in Canada and is working the case.  Three infant bodies are found hidden in a prostitutes apartment but the mother is nowhere to be found.  Tempe's on again/off again (currently off) Andrew Ryan is lead detective on the case.  This case takes them across Canada and into the Northwest Territories reuniting Tempe with an old fling RCMP sergeant Ollie Hasty.  Gold and diamonds, drugs and prostitution.  Motives abound.  But the dead speak to Tempe and the Mounties always get their man.<br />While this often reads like a travel brochure the story is intriguing and I always learn something new.  This is a fantastic series and Bones Are Forever is a wonderful addition that I will re-read again and again and still pull something new.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good book for the most part, a lot repetative descriptive phrazes.  Extreme story line, I wish it would have been a little more realistic.

B0072NWJRK|3.0|From our blog! Check us out at [...]<br /><br />With WWII around the corner and a looming Japanese occupation as its backdrop, author Paul French breathes life into the long forgotten true story of an unprecedented and officially unsolved murder of a wealthy British girl who died brutally at the hands of a butcher in 1937 Peking, China.<br /><br />I wanted to love this novel, I really did and part of me felt I was on the precipice of adoration, but I never fell. Love never came, only a minor fondness with a splash of disappointment. Not for lack of interest, in fact, the story was (at times) riveting, gruesome, sad, interesting and thrilling, but more often than not, it became tangled in a muddled retelling of Peking's colonial history.<br /><br />The author (French) paved an awkward path to the grand finale by weaving Peking's last days of colonialism as the Japanese and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-sheck neared invasion, with character back story and the quest to find a brutally murdered teen girls killer. My concentration broke with the constant intertwining of regional history while trying to keep up with the names of dictators, police chiefs, communist sympathizers, American ex-pats, murder suspects and English diplomats. It's not like I am a dummy, I just found the patterns and information scattered about distracting.<br /><br />Towards the end, all of a sudden the story  takes on a new life and I instantly became riveted. The focus of the story was placed solely on the murder and a fathers plight to find justice for his daughter (something that should have started about 100 hundred pages earlier). I started to appreciate where the path was leading only to find myself being pushed hastily toward the books finish. Revelations were thrown at me rather quickly and by the time I realized my ah-ha moment, French dragged me away kicking and screaming. Once more I felt short-changed.<br /><br />Look, I see what the author was going for. He wanted to capture what Erik Larson did flawlessly with The Devil in the White City, but fell short. Don't get me wrong, I finished it in a day and liked the murder investigation, it felt like reading a 48 Hours Mystery (thanks Lindsey for that analogy. It was perfect), but if it wasn't for this blog and the way the book kicked into high gear toward the last 75 pages, I would have given up and put it down about half way through.<br /><br />In no way am I discouraging anyone from reading it because it is well written and chock-full of deception, murder, corruption and Asiatic history, but I feel a warning is necessary for those who get bored easily with historical non-fiction. See for yourself and let me know what you think.son did flawlessly with The Devil in the White City, but fell short.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|If a book captures my daughter's attention and she can't stop talking about it - I'll give it a try as well.<br />However, previous bestsellers such as the Twilight serious and even the last couple of Harry Potter books have been more than disappointing for me.<br />The Hunger Games was intriguing and interesting to read. Placed in a unusual setting but not completely futuristic either. Best of all - it is written really well. I loved it!

B003RV43X4|4.0|I liked this version of \\"Clash of the Titans\\".  I saw the original 1980 version in the theatre when it came out and liked it as well.  I saw this one in the theatre and on DVD.  I like ancient history/mythology type movies in general and I have to say I enjoyed this version.  I know a lot of reviews criticize it for not following the actual myth of Perseus, but that didn't bother me really, and I didn't watch it for that.  For me, when I watch movies like \\"Clash\\", a lot of it depends on what I'm watching for.  For instance, lets take the Trojan war ... if I'm feeling romantic, and \\"sappy\\", then I'd watch the 1956 Rosanna Podesta version of \\"Helen of Troy\\" ... if I want historical reference and clarity of story, then I'd watch USA's 2004 version of \\"Helen of Troy\\", but if I'm watching for the glory of Hollywood and gorgeous sets and costumes and beautiful people, then I'd watch \\"Troy\\" with Brad Pitt. In this case, I wanted to see great monsters (because I like those type of movies as well, like Jurassic Park 1, 2 and 3) and what they did with Medusa ... and I think they did a great job.  I wasn't watching for story content or for clarity on which god was which.  And Sam Worthington made a very attractive Perseus.

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|A Wanted Man picks up where Worth Dying For left off.  A bruised and battered Reacher is standing at the roadside, trying to hitch a ride from Nebraska to Virginia.  A car stops for him - two men and a woman, who claim to be on a work trip.  However it quickly becomes evident that they are lying about at least part of their story.  When the car is detained at not one, but two police roadblocks, Reacher realises that he may have stumbled into another crime.<br /><br />The first part of this book develops slowly but maintains your interest as the plotline emerges.  However as things come together, rather than building in momentum, it all slackens off quite abruptly.  There are a couple of twists which have been well signposted in advance and a couple of developments which are so unlikely that they just become ridiculous.  To be honest, I got bored.  The pace does eventually pick up again however and the ending is dead exciting and full of Child's signature violence.<br /><br />I wouldn't classify this as the worst Reacher book I've read, but I did feel it was one the of the weaker in the series.<br /><br />Plus, I had a little inner sigh when I read this on page 2: \\"Reacher was a big man, six feet five inches tall, heavily built\\".  Take THAT Mr Cruise!
B005LAIH54|3.0|This one I didn't feel was as good as \\"Clash of the Titans\\".  I liked the monsters and the mythological creatures, but I felt with this one, they were trying to explain the myth, the why's and wherefore's, Perseus' son, the demise of the gods and so forth.  I actually liked Sam Worthington better in the first one.  On a more superficial level, I thought Sam Worthington looked better and more like a \\"Perseus\\" kind of character with the buzz cut, rather than having all that hair flying around, but again that is purely on a superficial level.  But as I said I liked the monsters, and I thought the actress that played Andromeda was pretty and did a good job.  I remember her from the Kira Knightly \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - and she is wonderful in that.  If you want to get this for mythological accuracy and things of that sort, don't bother, I didn't get the impression that this really even connected to the first one, but if you want to see cool mythological creatures, Sam Worthington wielding a sword and a \\"smart alec\\" pegasus ... then this isn't a bad choice.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I have watched this several times! Every time I pick up a new detail. It follows US air borne soldiers from their entrance into the service, thru their training & into combat. It shows the brutal effects of combat on the soldiers. The special effects are breathtaking & awesome! It tells a story in something like a diary form. It is a GREAT movie! Highly recommend. Warning though, some of the scenes are very graphic.
B00718Y3CA|5.0|A wholesome Christian movie showing some very realistic stresses individuals and families often confront without much support or self-awareness. It encourages one to become emotionally mature in the Christian faith and to be supportive of others who have not matured from a born in selfishness to a mature caring supportive human who gets pleasure out of helping others.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Martin is consistent.  This third volume continues with the Game of Thrones.  He adds new characters and new aspects to the story, but the primary characters stay in tact. It is engaging and certainly held my attention.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Well first I have to say all of the Harry Potter films are wonderful.  Having said that, probably my least favorite of them would be \\"Deathly Hallows Part 1\\", with my most favorites being 1. \\"Deathly Hallows part 2\\", 2. \\"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\\", 3. \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" and then \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" and \\"Sorcerers Stone\\".  They definitely saved the best for last.  In my opinion, they out did themselves on \\"Deathly Hallows Part 2\\" ... in every way.  The older actors are pretty much all the best of the UK actors.  The children are all grown up and are comparable actors and actresses in their own right.  Radcliffe, Watson and Grint were wonderful and have grown into very talented actors and actresses.  I really can't think of anything else to say about it other than it was fantastic.  I saw it in the theatre and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I own the DVD and I still feel the same way watching the DVD. I did kind of feel that my summer was somewhat incomplete because there was no \\"Harry Potter\\" film coming out this summer.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have watched this a couple of times. It tells the story of the pacific war in fantastic detail. The special effects are awesome! It is at times very graphic, & you may not want a young person to watch it. This is one of my favorite war movies. It is fantastic, great!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Depending on where you are in your life, viz a viz love relationships and overall in your karma, this movie can be one of three things to you:  Transformative, because if you're open and willing to surrender, it can extinguish every fear about \\"agape\\" love you may have ever harbored;  second, it can be an uplifting story  with a subtle but all-encompassing subtext: all the characters in this story....love.  They  weave a backdrop tapestry of normalcy, when an easy pace, loving husbands and wives, loving parents were all  motivated by a selfless desire to help this man and this woman find a fulfilling and harmonious happiness by remaining steadfastly true to their selves and their lives' paths.  Or, remembering that the path from cynicism to idealism can be quite short, you view it simply as this grossly overdone, unrealistic love story.  Pshaw!  What's next?  But, as a story, the characters are complex, multi-faceted,  the conflicts pragmatic and  real though subtle,  and many loves are portrayed:  for a child, for a parent, for a man, for a woman, for a friend.  The story's  eternal value: integrity and triumph of the human spirit's ability to strive, to seek, to find, and once love has been found, not to yield.  Seen twice, thrice with reasonable intervals, it can plant a seed which roots in your humanity.  It is simply a very great movie.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After a great start the third book of the trilogy kinda fizzled! The 3rd book was a bit of a let down.

B00846REIS|3.0|OK book, very similar to Shades of Grey.  Almost too close!  Interesting to read, but predictable in to many ways.  In some cases I wondered if they took the Shades of Grey book and just followed the storyline changing small parts and names.  Not my favorite, but interesting hot fudge sundaes scenes.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very cool game! I like the graphics and how challenging it is to play. It's a great way to unwind and have fun!

B007SGM084|5.0|I had reservations about reading this series due to all the hooplas from the media.  But once I started reading the first few chapters, I couldn't stop reading.  I was consumed with Fifty Shades and wanted to know more about his character flaws.  Even though I must admit, some of the details about his lifestyle were a bit repititious, the author could have scale back a bit to explore more about his character and his relationships with Ana as well as the rest of his close circle.    Overall, it's a very intriguing series, I was surprised as to how much I enjoyed reading about Christian Grey and all his madness!

037583494X|5.0|This is my all time favorite Dr. Seuss book. When I was a child I had the cassette tape and the narrator read the book faster and faster and faster. I spent hours listening and reading along. I am now a grandmother and wanted my granddaughter to have the book and audio. I was excited to find that David Hyde Pierce was narrating the book as I always liked him as the character Niles on Frasier. The cd is great as it has the option of playing a bell when it is time to turn the page, or he will just read the book straight through. He does not however; read the book fast at all. That was a little dissappointing, but overall I love the book and the cd and so does my graddaughter. The first day she got it we read it seven times.[[ASIN:037583494X Fox in Socks Book & CD (Dr. Seuss: Beginner Books)]]
0345803485|1.0|Wow. This is porn on paper. If you are into that, you will probably like it, but outside the sex there is not much of a story. This isn't worth the read. After 50 pages, I skimmed the rest so I could write an acurately written BAD review. 'Course, if you like erotic writing, have at it. It's a trashy book. No class what-so-ever. I don't reccomend to anyone.

I don't think this work ever saw an editor and I found \\"my Fifty Shades\\" a  really creepy character.  Don't bother.  If you're looking for a hot read find anything by D. H. Lawrence instead.

B004U8VUUC|5.0|Ryan Gossling did an amazing job in this role. It's psychologically creepy and he plays the part well. Some of his most intense scenes are those without words. He looks and acts scary; a total sociopath as this character.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|The newest release from that trio up north is probably their best since \\"Snakes and Arrows\\". And yes, I know, \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" was their last studio release. My point is everything they make is great. Rush has such a unique sound that also appeals to a broad range of fans. I have been a fan since their release of 2112 and I have every album they have made except for a couple of their live releases. If you don't have this one yet, Rush out and get it.

B0078N2T8I|3.0|From the previews, I kind of expected a good doom and gloom movie, not a psychological thriller. In a large way, it demeans the prepper culture as \\"crazy,\\" instead of responsibly looking out for your own. Acting and script were fine. Decent movie, just not what I expected or wanted to see. I wish I had my money back. My loss.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy kept me well engrossed in the books.  It's definitely a great read!  Once you pick up Book 1, you're definitely ready to get to the next.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|All 3 books were a sad disappointment.  Only in the very last book at the very end did it start to have a glimmer of interest.  I should have stopped as soon as I started, but had to read them to give an opinion.  I have read them and can only advise \\"read something else\\".

B008602KQI|3.0|I was eager to view this movie because of the massive advertising, It had to be good, didn't it?<br />  The story of a world with 12 districts and it's custom is to once a year hold a game in which 23 of the 24 teens (who were chosen by lotto, one boy and one girl from each district) kill each other.Last one alive wins! Now if your stomach has not turned already be sure to tune in and be sure to see it all in living color.  :(<br />  The acting is good and the story is different. Donald Sutherland is great,of course! I will say that I would be willing to see a sequel.
1476712042|4.0|Who doesn't adore a story where the bad boy is tamed by the good girl?  The distinction between this Beautiful Disaster and other tales of this ilk, is that these two characters are not just two polar opposites looking for balance, but in reality, two people that are closer balanced to their own personal middle then you would think.  Travis and Abby's back story is what brings depth to Jamie McGuire's Beautiful Disaster, and I would say you have to feel genuine sympathy for both characters. I do love the literal strength Travis built off his troubled past and Abby's quick wit learned from her secretive upbringing.  Now, I have  read some reviews complaining of the abusive, destructive and ...dare I say, \\"disastrous\\" nature of the main couples relationship and I might be in the minority here, but Abby is the one that frustrated me most through out this book. I feel the point that comes across loud and clear is that there is someone out there for everyone. When one who is filled with emotion and passion, they need to be with someone who can handle that level of intensity in their lives.  And O' the irony of love:  One women's admirer is another women's stalker.  It's all in how it is perceived ladies!  Love, it humbles all in its wake and can make strong men weep and sensible girls rash.<br /><br />The technical:  McGuire's writing is consistent and the story has a nice flow to it.  At one point I was even surprised where this love story was taking me.  Of course my one complain would have to be all of the potty-mouths.  Way too much for me!  I understand it may be commonplace now-a-days, but still let's not be commonplace people, let's be better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades Freed is the perfect ending (or hopefully not) to a story of a tortured soul and the woman who is brave enough to love him unconditionally.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought this book was pretty good, but not as good as the first book in the series.  As this second book went along, I felt it was getting very repetitive to the point of almost annoying as I was reading.  However, I thought the end was very good, and left the story on an exciting note.  So, overall, if you read the first book, I would think that you would still be entertained by the second.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is a book I couldn't put down. The imagery and realism had me living vicariously through the various characters.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Really love this game! I'm stuck on the pursuit of getting the rare dragons. I haven't had any glitches or any problems yet and I've been playing for a few months.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I don't know what all the belly aching concerning this book is all about.  No, it is not as good as the first couple of titles from this series.  I still found it to be entertaining.  Sure, we could use less characters, but those plot lines are relevant, even if not needed.  I am eagerly awaiting the next release, and recommend any who have enjoyed the previous titles in this series to not skip this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book!! Couldn't put it down. Read all three books in four days! Answered all of your questions from book one! Definitely would recommend!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I enjoyed it but it did not really give the debth I expected. I wanted it to be better. I expected more about the background of the major characters. Still, it did give a deeper sence of \\"what Happened\\".
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like several Bible apps, but this is the one I go to the most often.  It is simple, elegant, and it just plain works. Don't hesitate to add this app to your library.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker was my favorite book of the series. It was a fabulous trilogy though! I read it on my Kindle Fire and couldn't put it down.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love it when a book does not withhold anything to fit some standard or category. Bared to You and Fifty Shades are a class of their own. It shows you how it is to desire someone so much it hurts. Bared to You makes you remember how it is to physically want a person so bad that you can't help but emphatize with Eva Trammell. And Gideon Cross, there are lots of Gideon Cross in our midst. With Cross, Sylvia Day showed how the most beautiful man you've ever seen could be the most flawed, too. But it only makes him more human, like the rest of us.
B00846REIS|1.0|I really enjoyed reading  50 Shades of Grey....many  reviews here recommended Bared to You was even better. I absolutely disagree. I read about 80% of the book, and finally just read the last page to end the torture....first of all, Bared to you is way too similar to FSG to be a coincidence..right down to the similar names Ana and Eva...come on..Sylvia NOT FAIR stealing FSG's storyline... Bared to You is not a  good read...to each his own...<br /> At least FSG has a story detailing their lives. Save your money, get the book from the library if you must read it.
B002A5WQ8W|2.0|I steered clear from this album for a long time because I was afraid it would sound like white dudes playing jazz.  I was wrong.  It sounds like OLD white dudes playing jazz.  The only worthwhile song is \\"Take Five\\" and it's likely due to the fact that it's the one tune not composed by Brubeck.  Simple, over-polished Snoresville.  Music as toothless as the denture-wearing men performing it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It's an awesome game.  My daughter loves it and to be honest, I like to play it too and take away my daughters tablet from her. LOL.<br />I think it's a good game that every kid should have and also parents.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read Beautiful Disaster in less than 48 hours. I could have finished it less than a day but I was carefully saving the pages. Jamie McGuire was able to realize a very strong character in Travis. We all have seen him in our schools - the one guy who's so cool, so strong and so beautiful once he falls in love. Abby is also wonderful. Indeed, there is more to Abby than meets the eye. And Travis saw it. I can't wait for Walking Disaster, which is Travis' version of their story. I am also very excited with the movie version.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Lot's of heartbreak, finding and then losing new found friends/teammates tears at your heart. The biggest lost of all........ go read the book. The author does a super job at keeping your heart pumping!
B004J64QSI|5.0|I have watched this DVD at least 50 times-absolutely incredible-love Alfie Boe-what a voice!!! The entire production is awe inspiring.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is an excellent AP....the various sounds can be easily changed or adjusted to suit your mood or to encourage a mood.  One peaceful sound or several can be blended to change the affect.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed shows you don't have to drive the most expensive car or be the richest man in town to live the best love story. Everybody has his own love story, that's worth telling. At first, it seems Will and Layken will have no problem with being together but as the story goes, their jobs and family obligations become difficult factors. I love it that the book also shows many dimensions as it deals with moral and ethical issues. And the best thing is that the story is told with slamming as a backdrop. In Slammed, Colleen Hoover is definitely a poet writing in prose.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. The turn in events just blew me away that I had to keep reading to find out what happened to who, where and why. Loved this book.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Difficult to follow a plot that was continually interrupted. Skimmed most as a result but smart way to end to get people to buy the next book.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy, a guy who's been kicked out of more schools than he can count, discovers one day that his deadbeat, runaway father is actually Poseidon, God of the sea. But discovering this means danger for Percy, and he quickly finds himself fleeing for his life, his mom's and his best friend's. He winds up at camp Half-blood, a summer camp meant for different kids like Percy. There he finds a real home, makes new friends, and trains for an even more dangerous and deadly adventure.<br />Percy's unique voice and story make his journey so much more engaging. I love how creative the characters of the Gods and Goddesses were while still keeping to their true natures. It's obvious Rick Riordan had fun writing the books, and it really shows with how great \\"The Lightening Thief\\" is, and the rest of the series, for that matter. It doesn't feel like I'm reading a bunch of facts about Greek deities, but a true hero's journey. I could read Percy's tale over and over again.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|I love this album! Her voice is so filled with emotion it really makes the lyrics pop. The added electronic beats also give the ears an ever changing atmosphere of sound.
B00498VS9G|5.0|I loved hating half of the cast.  The Big Brother setting was very interesting and made for very believable conflict among the survivors beyond the usual zombie fare.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|I just discovered Jonathan Tropper, and have read four of his books in the last month.  My biggest problem is that soon I am going to run out of his books to read, and I don't think he can write them quick enough to make me happy.  His writing is so natural, and hilarious and heartbreaking all at the same time.  If you are a person that loves to cry and loves to laugh, you are going to love this book!  And everything else this man has written.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss Everdeeen has grown up in a post-apocalyptic world where she has taken care of her mom and sister since her father's death by hunting outside the Seam. While hunting outside her district means death if caught, it's the least of Katniss's worries as the 74th annual Hunger Games are about to take place. The Hunger Games are a reminder to never rebel against the Capital, and to honor it twenty four people, one boy and one girl from each district, must participate in an arena that leaves only one person left standing. In this fight to the death action adventure, filled with humor, teen emotions, and surprises, you won't put the book down. Be advised, it's a fight to the death, meaning people are killing each other, so yeah, there is some violence. But it's nothing over the top or worse than any video game these days. The plot is impeccable, and the violence isn't just thrown in there for shock value. Suzanne Collins tells a captivating story from the eyes of one of my all-time favorite characters. I recommend the whole series for young adults and old adults as well.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|GRRM continues the saga with careful steps. Reader of previous books will find the rhythm familiar but the dance is continued by other dancers you would expect. Some of the twisted details are not surprising but make you wish they reveal relevant in the end. Looking forward to the final book.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This movie is a true family classic.  All of our kids from age 4 to age 15 love it.  They don't make them like this anymore.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I read ALOT!! Have read some of his shorts before and have enjoyed them. But not like this!! This one grabs you from the get go and is paced very well. Extremely creative story, twists and turns, action, emotion, surprises.<br />Do yourself a favor take one late afternoon or evening and read this book. You will read more of his work after this - I know I will!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is on my favorite list of books. No, it's not the most in depth, intellectual book; it's just real. What makes a book great is the characters, and you fall in love with these people, and they feel real, they feel like they are your friends. I would give this book more stars here if I could.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Great movie. I'm a fan of military movies and this one was a good one. Hope to see more in the future.
B00171EO0I|5.0|Love love love this movie.  Wish I had someone that loved and cared for me that much that was willing to make such a difficult time a little easier with so much creativity!
B004EARTN8|2.0|An American contractor working in Iraq wakes up bound and gagged and in a pine box - buried alive.  He has a cell phone a lighter, a pencil, a very small flask of alcohol, his anxiety pills, a knife, a flashlight and 2 glow lights (the kind you bend).  His captors are demanding he make a video or pay a ransom of $5 million.<br /><br />The people he is able to make contact with - via the phone - are useless jerks and it's annoying.  The filming is ENTIRELY all in the pine box - you never see anyone else worrying about him or trying desperately to race against the clock to find/save this guy.  Nobody seems to care about him - and guess what - it's kind of hard for you to care about him too.  He's just a guy in a movie.<br /><br />More than halfway thru the movie an asp? travels down his pant leg and finally exits thru a crack in the pine box.  Had it happened earlier in the movie you might have accepted it, but up until that point he'd done a LOT of moving around and would've noticed it shortly after waking up, or noticed it going into his pants in the first place - so it was really stupid how they put that in there.<br /><br />And while he's dying in the box, the company he was working for when he was abducted, phones and records the conversation for legal purposes telling him he was terminated for cause the day before and his family will thereby not be entitled to insurance benefits from his demise.<br /><br />Overall, the film lacks suspense through most of it even though you understand he's in a dire situation. I walked away feeling this was a complete waste of time and on top of that it made me cranky.  I would NOT recommend this movie.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Liked the book. A little bit too much drama in it for me but what do you suspect when it is set in a College environment..... Overall I still really liked this book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is the first FAOTD that isn't total garbage filled with data mining and exorbitant permissions. Definitely worth the money if you miss out the FAOTD.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game, its fun and extremely addictive. so recommending to anyone that has a kindle. the only downside os the fact we can't get a mystic map only buy request. other than that its perfect. thanks.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Decent movie dont really understand what all the hype was about though, pretty sick mind that came up with a bunch of kids killing each other.
0865478570|1.0|I was almost enjoying this book (only almost, because the subject is interesting, but the author will never use a word to describe something when five or six will do) until I read that \\"the signaling system of traffic lights is incapable of producing more than 'slow down,' 'stop,' 'get ready,' and 'go'. (The green-and-orange 'get ready' combination is used in the U.K., as a courtesy to drivers of ancient sports cars with gearshift sticks.)\\".<br /><br />This is a catastrophic sequence of factual errors and cultural crassness that undermines everything else in the book I had read so far. If the author can get this much wrong about something so simple (and easy to verify), what else in the book is, quite simply, invented? In a book that is, in many ways, about \\"truth\\" and how it can cross cultural boundaries (or not), that's quite an important question.<br /><br />Firstly, a traffic-light signaling system can do much more than that (and in many countries, does). Three differently-colored lights with--at a minimum--three states (on, off, regular flashing...) can communicate many more than four things (leaving aside the fact that the light can be combined with a symbol such as a direction-indicator). Anyone writing about the difference between languages and codes (which, in essence, is what's happening here) should really know enough about the math behind codes not to embarrass themselves like this. But that's just ignorance; what follows is worse.<br /><br />The UK's traffic light system has red (stop), red-and-amber (stop unless it is unsafe to do so) and green (go). Since relatively few of its drivers use \\"ancient sports cars\\", there is no need for the authorities who control such things to be specifically courteous to them. Of course, if you inhabit an imaginary world where all Brits speak like Terry-Thomas and drive open-topped Frazer Nash Le Mans Replicas (and where actual facts are irrelevant in a non-fiction book), this is unimportant.<br /><br />I was, despite the sometimes labored prose, engaged with the subject. Something as seemingly minor as this factual sloppiness and cultural insensitivity, however, makes me not trust anything I have read and it removes any incentive to continue reading. The book may have a great conclusion but I'll never know, due to the author breaching the all-important trust with the reader.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I bought this on a whim. I wanted to fulfill my epic fantasy craving. This book did the trick. It is well written, fun, and exciting.I can't wait for the next one!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is a surprisingly well written book that focuses on the discovery of an ancient Roman treatise on the meaning of life that was recovered in the 15th century by a \\"humanist\\" researcher who, at times, will strike you as an almost Indiana Jones like adventurer.  Exhaustively researched, it sheds new light on the  daily life of educated Roman citizens in that twilight era when their was growing doubt about the ancient gods before the emergence of Christianity; when men existed without deities.  Destined to be one of my favorites.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Out of all the Bible apps, this is the best one! I like how you can pick different translations. I Love the Bible plans, great for Devotionals.
B0012FB2MW|5.0|Real music played on real instruments by real people, pre disco rod the mod, whats like not to like? Boozy bluesy greatness.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|From a readers standpoint this was an excellent read. Well written and kept my attention. I am so glad I purchased this. It was written by one Seals memories and I gained so much from reading this. I could care less about if he should or shouldn't have written this but I'm so glad he did and after reading it I fully understand and agree with why he did. I didn't think I could have any more respect for our men and women in the armed forces but after reading this book I couldn't even begin to explain the emotions it gave me. At one point I totally cried because it truely pulled me as a reader in so much I felt the emotions of some of the things in this book myself. And I truely thank the author of this book for allowing me to truely understand what sacrifices have been made for my freedom.
B000Y0Q6FO|5.0|I loved this episode!  It was so much fun.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys more the lighthearted side of Stargate.  It definitely has 're-watchability'. :)
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was very well done and the character portrayal was spot on.  As with any movie from a book, there are things left out.  Overall I would highly recommend watching the moviebut be open minded if you are a big fan of the books.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|This is a good example of a Kindle single: this book is weird and takes off from a weird premise. I don't think the premise could sustain a full-length book, but it made a pretty memorable single.<br /><br />I liked it.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Harold is an average guy, living in an average house and married to an average wife. He has a spontaneous moment and decides to write to an old friend who is dying at the other end of the country. He sets out in his boat shoes to walk to post the letter and ends up not stopping. This is a light and witty story that I am half way through and enjoying every moment of it. I can't wait until I finish to see what happens to Harold, Queenie and Harold's wife.
030746363X|4.0|I ready through the book and tried what I can. What strikes me with this book is that it tries to cater to everyone's goals. That's a good thing if you're a savvy reader and can match sections of the book with your specific goals. If you need a roadmap - or even a bulleted list that will point you in the right direction. Tim's a data junkie, and he wants to share the data he's collected (and the reasons behind his collection) with you. The problem? He pursued longevity, strength, size, weight loss, sexual function, and shoe size all overlapping. He give smart folks what they need to distill what they need, and I like that - a lot. He also tells you a lot about how to monitor your own body, removing the possibility if a \\"one size fits all\\" solution. I think he could differentiate his approaches for different goals a little better for the average man.
B0088X7YMS|2.0|Really?  CGI nudity?  Is this really necessary?  It wasn't even nudity done well!  I'd kind of hoped that they would drop this aspect when they went CG, but I think they actually invented ways to put it in.  Bad language, too.  Really wasn't needed.  The animation wasn't great.  CG always has problems with eye expressions and this was really bad.  Mouths didn't move realistically with the words.  The overall plot was okay, but I think a live action movie minus the nudity would have served this version much better.  Boo!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome my cousin told me to get it and i thought iy doesnt even look fun then i downloaded it and heck to the yeah this game is awesome get this game GET THIS GAME
6304458223|5.0|What a heart warming story that was well scripted.  It has wonderful human interest as well as our effort to preserve natures wonders.
B001VLXQSU|5.0|I loved this video. Lots of action. Even though I am not a huge face of Gere or Willis, the video was great. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|I like this app for when your one the go. I'm a musician and if I have a brain tart, I'll hum a few bars or if I have my guitar I'll just play and record and it's done! Then my other buddys can check it out and build onto it or nay or yea for it. Plus you can pretty it up. Not bad.
B00899E5B4|5.0|If You Like Joe Walsh, Get This. Been a fan of his solo work for a long time and would say this is a very good album
B003B02O0U|5.0|This was a very good book. I had seen the movie many times and the book was very close to the movie. Thanks for an awesome story.
B005544VHE|5.0|I didn't know about Suits until Season 2 started. I wanted to know what happened to start this whole show and so I ordered Season 1. I have been immersed in this show. I can't wait to see the next new show. It's great!
B007M45PMU|5.0|One night I caught the last of Jay Leno and saw this band perform \\"Hi Ho\\". Normally I start changing the channel, but what I heard sounded catchy, interesting and fresh. Next day, I came on amazon to hear all the samples off their album and liked all of the songs I heard, so I bought the album. Next day I did a search for the group and found they were playing in Santa Barbara, CA. I bought 2 tickets for $15 each for October 5th on a Friday. You can't beat that!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this trilogy! I'm sorry it was over. It was  entertaining from cover to cover.<br />The ending left me wanting for more
B0083GR6Y6|4.0|The Grey was a good one time watch, and entertained my girlfriend and I for the evening. But it's not something I'd want to own for further viewing. The story itself is simple, and is essentially one big chase. It did look very beautiful though, being shot in British Columbia or the surrounding area.
0345803485|3.0|I am not overly picky about language, grammatical repetition or extreme fantasy, so I found the book to be quite enjoyable. I let myself go wherever the writer took me, even when the writer wanted me to believe that a young, unbelievably gorgeous, fit, sexualy adept billionaire found a girl like Anastasia Steele to be the best thing that's happened to him since boston creme donuts. I don't get it, but I did think the story was interesting, even though it was extremely unrealistic (isn't that why we read?). I liked that Christian was controlling and possessive (although I can't fathom why), even though in reality I would find that to be very stifling, and I didn't mind the sex although I did feel it was a bit detached and repetitive (considering they have it all the time it does get dull after a while).<br /><br />The following are a couple things I questioned:<br /> - Why are Ana and Christian so incredibly horny for each other all the time over the stupidest things?<br /> - Where did Ana acquire this amazing ability to come at will? I feel like Christian could just breathe on her and she would come, it's ridiculous, and yet I wish I had that ability.<br /> - What did Ana do before they got together? her college life seems to be nonexistent.<br /> - What happened to Ana's iguana?  (just kidding, I made that one up)<br /><br />Those were the most bothersome.  I get the inner goddess/subconscious conversations because while I don't call them that, I have a lot of dumb inner conversations with myself so it's not that unrealistic.  I do think the author took the concept a little too far though and by the end I was thinking to myself \\"the inner goddess is doing the samba? Really?\\" because mine doesn't to anything, but I was too interested in the story to care so I just skipped over those parts.  I could even deal with all the oh mys, down theres, flushes, gasps, murmurs and the like because I just don't care how the author writes her book as long as it stays interesting,and I do think it was interesting.<br /><br />I will say that I get why there are a ton of bad reviews, because I am still fairly young and new to this type of genre so I have no point of reference to compare it to (and nothing seems so bad until it's compared to something better). I also read this trilogy for free so I don't feel like anything was wasted.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Haven't finished reading yet, but so far is a great book, like the first three of the series. Definitely a must read.
0061992860|5.0|This is a great survival guide and appropriately sized for an emergency kit, car kit, or bug-out bag.  It may not be the depth of information needed for your specific environment, but it does a damn good job of covering basic skills needed in nearly any climate.  I've learned quite a bit from casual reading.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome game, I think I'm hooked! I enjoy playing this game and no ad's, doesn't get much better than that.
B007PBKG5G|4.0|This is a good album of original material.  The lead singer has a unique gift and style. Each song grows on me each time I listen.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|this book as with the first 2 was riveting love love them hope there is another series about to hit the shelves!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I did not care for fist book, but at end of the fist book I had to know what would happen next. I order the other two book and enjoyed very much.
1451627289|3.0|I am a S King fan; read them all.  Too much verbiage; it would be easy to cut 150-200 pgs. w/o ruining the plot.  King has such a great imagination but this book fell short IMHO.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Owen and Maurer bring us a brilliantly executed account of a spectacular mission. The book is written with a firm, authoritative hand, leaving the reader no doubt that this is exactly what happened. The authors have a great story to tell and they tell it well, not larding it up with the usual minutia found in special ops tell-alls. The brouhaha over OPSEC is clearly overblown and beside the point: This is a first-class read and more than worth the price. I suspect most of the angst is the result of envy, nothing more. Bravo, Take a bow Owen--you're a hero and a pretty damn good writer. Thanks.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Very easy to read, moves well from start to finish, hard to put down. Thought this would be a 'teenage' book/series, But after reading the series I have realy enjoyed it at 70 years. This book continues the action and real humanity of the previous volume. I highly recommend completion of the trilogy by reading  'Mockingjay'.  Suzanne Collins take a bow. [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]][[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]][[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]
B008FDOS66|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd's new release Last of A Dyin' Breed proves the Skynyrd still rocks,they are known for songs that convey the feelings of the working class hero , that holds true and then some on this release , lifes twisted, nothing comes easy,and something to live for, hit the mark and say things we all feel or have felt about being where we are in the times that we  now endure.With a sound reminiscent of classic Skynyrd with a modern vibe, this album rocks .<br />  I hope people will give it a good listen  and get past the \\"it aint the real Skynyrd \\" mentality,The Classic line up was great and we all love and miss them,but things change and I think Ronny Van Zant would be proud, after all they had a Good Teacher
B0015DROBO|5.0|The book was so well written and fun that I wish I hadn't seen the movies. I rediscovered the way Blomkvist solved the mystery and was fascinated again. I think that readers who have not seen the movies will enjoy trying to figure out who the villain is. Lisbeth Salander is a fascinating character, Blomkvist less so, but he has the (very American) appeal of the underdog.<br /><br />[Readers who have seen the American version (with the superb Daniel Craig) will enjoy the Swedish version, which is better.]
B0011MZOEI|4.0|This movie was very entertaining, fast plot great action scenes and I am a Bruce Willis fan. It was well worth $3 and you're getting a real deal with this movie. Have fun--
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After the first two, this one took me a while to get into it. I even put it aside for a while and didn't think I'd finish it, but when I got back into it, it got better. Glad I finished. Now I am sad it's over!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It has resonated with me over the years. I was excited to be able to see it on Amazon.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Seriously, if the twin eye candy of Mike Ross and Harvey Specter isn't enough, (or the triple eye candy of Jessica, Rachel, and Donna) there are \\"inside\\" jokes (what is that can opener for anyway?), awesome movie references, pop culture references, interesting, likeable, and flawed characters, and fun cases to be settled in creative ways every week.  I'm loving every second of every episode (and if you like Firefly, Castle, The Big Bang Theory, any Law and Order, Boston Legal, ER (the first few season before it started taking itself so seriously), you will like/love this one too), don't miss it!
B0051E9JNE|5.0|HIGHLANDER is better than you remember it. At least it was for me. A very stylized, complete kind of artwork, it takes enough detours from the melodrama to remain interesting indeed. If you saw it a long time ago and have that vague felling it was good, but keep laughing at yourself for thinking to seeing it again, I suggest you fire it up. I believe you won't regret it. Also, I don't think the franchise that is spawned every lived up to the initial movie, which is very clearly meant to stand alone (it forecasts a better human future, that ain't happened). CCS
B006VJMZXY|5.0|I have a penchant for historical novels and P. Gregory is the hands down the best in her field. No matter what she writes, I would buy it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. I love the story and the main characters are interesting and feel real. The magic in the world is \\"unique\\" and creative. Recomend it to everyone.
1881273873|5.0|Great read!  I really learned a lot from this book.  Especially about , not just my own husband ,and the way he thinks, but men in general!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest and can get lost in it for hours, when it cooperates. It will continually force close on me when I use it on my kindle fire :(
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Fun game for the brief time that I played it, but it gets a little annoying to start over each time you die.  I didn't get very far so maybe that's why.  The power-ups were interesting.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I had just finished reading We've Got to Talk About Kevin when I downloaded Defending Jacob.  I didn't realize what it was about, as a friend recommended it.  It kept my attention, but frustrated me.  I'm a mother of a dysfunctional son, and knew he had problems from early childhood.  I never assumed the best about his bad behavior, and immediately wanted to find out the cause.  But different strokes, and all that.  Basically, I felt I was reading about 2 dysfunctional parents, in denial for problems they should have been equipped to address.  A stay at home mom and former teacher who wasn't in tune to her son's school and friendship behavior?  PLEASE!  I should have given this book 3 stars instead of 4.  What was I thinking?
B006LSZECO|2.0|The author does a great job in describing the characters in the beginning but unfortunately the back and forth (chapters) were annoying. There was a great twist to the story... Which I definitely didn't see coming but the ending just left me confused. I'm not sure that I would recommend this book
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this on my Fire every day.  Big pictures, easy to work.  I love it.  I honestly couldn't ask for it to be any better.  I enjoy the app on my Fire more than the site on my computer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|On the day I purchased my Kindle, the helpful clerk offered to download some things for me before we left the store. Based on the stature of the book(s) on the bestseller lists, this was my first choice. I wish I had not purchased it and I wish I could just give it back. This is probably the worst book I have ever read was at the top of the bestsellers list. The premise of the story is inane, insipid, and highly unlikely. The characters, a sexy, beautiful billionare (with a B) who prefers bondage, and a clumsy, naive virgin are insufferable. The dialogue had to be writen by the author's 13 year old neice and her friends during a sleep-over.The THIRD time she described an orgasm as \\"coming apart\\", I had to say \\"STOP\\". And that is what you should do, dear reader, stop considering the purchase of this book.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I love this game except for the slider puzzles. I don't really like these type of puzzles. I wish you could skip these after you have attempted them.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This game crashes usually right in the middle of a puzzle.  Finally became so frustrated  I uninstalled. Now uninstalled it says open.....ahhhhh
B007SGM084|5.0|Love these books. I downloaded them for my kindle on my iPad.. Love love love them!! I couldn't put the books down once I started reading.
014241493X|3.0|I'm going to be honest here and say that I didn't really like Paper Towns much for most of the story. I didn't hate it or anything, but I didn't especially like it either. I hated Margo, I hated that Quentin was so obsessed with her, and I hated that Margo hated that Margo hated the future and started to make Quentin question the entirety of his life. As you can see, pretty much all my problems revolved around Margo :P<br /><br />But then we get to the road trip. I can't even count how many times I laughed out loud during that long car ride. It was just so freaking fantastic. The side characters are what really added to it. I mean, I lonely road trip is all fine and dandy, but Quentin had some seriously awesome friends who were pretty much made to go on a road trip. I already know I'll reread the chapters containing the road trip multiple times for years to come.<br /><br />For those of you who've read Paper Towns I just wanted to talk about the whole idea of paper towns for a minute. Now, I know it mentions them about a gajillion times in the book but I'm referring to Margo's version: that the whole world is made of paper and made of people who live in the future and how that's a terrible thing. I feel like I've gotten weirdly offended by this. I have no idea why I feel so strongly about it, but maybe it's partly that I can identify with Quentin's enjoyment of boredom. I like sameness and planning and knowing what's going to happen. In fact, I not only like it, but I kind of rely on it. So in a way, it felt like Margo was telling me that my idea of life was the wrong one. And yes, I realize I just referred to a fictional character talking to me.<br /><br />And now I think I'm done being \\"deep\\" :P<br /><br />The Nutshell: So, I wasn't a fan of Margo, but I did, in fact, like the rest of the characters. Paper Towns is one of those books you read because it's fun, it makes you think, and the side characters are all freaking fantastic. And there's a road. And it's an awesome one.<br /><br />Hitwesome one.<br /><br />Hit
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great app! Play around with the different sounds until you find the ones which you make you feel calm and relaxed, set the timer and off to dreamland you go!
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun game. makes you want to try and do better each time. and the special powers you can buy really help.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|Do you seriously believe I can write a meaningful review of a masterpiece written more than fifty years ago? And fifty years after a dainty Audrey Hepburn drove us crazy playing Holly Golightly's role in the same movie? No. But it has still been a fascinating reading. A book that, as it conjures up shots from the film, still has a great power and magic of it's own that lightly carries the reader along, and aloft, with the life and mind of Miss Golightly.<br /><br />Quotes:  \\"I don't want to own anything until I know I've found the place where me and things belong together.\\"<br /><br />\\"I love New York, even though it isn't mine, the way something has to be, a tree or a street or a house, something, anyway, that belongs to me because I belong to it.\\"
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I got this app and lets me no what's happening at all times it is way better than my old battery app that I had.
B002KDSBGA|5.0|Because the movie was filmed in black and white, it makes it seem more dated than it is.  Nonetheless the plot and the theme still haunt our present lives.
0307279189|5.0|this book is great for all runners...and even for those who don't....interesting and delightful. I encourage everyone to read it. We truly were born to run
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I always enjoy Blake's work....this book was engrossing, kept me guessing all the way through. Don't want to give away the end, but I was happy.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was really looking forward to this movie and enjoyed it but I felt it could hav been better.  I am hoping the second one is much better.  I loved Stanley Tucci!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I enjoyed the first movie and I guess for that reason felt the sequels are never as good.  This started out with a lot of action, and I was concerned that there would be no story line.  It needed time to develop for me, but the story line was very good, the action proved to be very engaging and I ended up enjoying it more than I thought.  In fact it was as good as or better than the first one.  I am glad I gave it a chance.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy and clear to use. Loads faster than the webpage does on my Kindle. If you use Pinterest, there's no reason not to get this app.
B00136RY6I|5.0|this is great one to get if you love Pearl Jam from all of their albums but don't have the $$ to buy all of them.  This has 2 disks worth of their greatest hits :)
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I always heard Steve Gibson talk about Evernote on the Twit Network and finally installed it.  I like it! Great features the I use often and it synchronizes my notes between my devices.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Best way to use eBay that I've ever encountered! I love it, very easy to use and gives me everything I need  at a glance.works great ony Android phone. I highly teens it Don.
B00866H7SS|4.0|I enjoyed reading it and getting sucked right into the Crossfire world as it seemed. I found it getting a tiny bit OTT towards the end, but thats where the author wanted to take the story so thats cool I guess. I hate that i read this before the next book came out, the waiting is killing me, but it should be worth it. I can find it hard to get into some books and don't finish books if i can't get hooked within the first few chapters, this one got me and i struggled to put it down. Good read, bring on the next book, or 3!
B0088XXCZ6|3.0|I am not that impressed with this -- I love Fiona Apple.  I still listen to her 1st 2 albums constantly.  This one was just meh.  I didn't get really into any of the songs. Not bad, just background music.
B007HJ8RTI|5.0|I never thought I would read a book like this, but I just finished the 2nd novel last night and I loved it.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this case for the money.<br />I would be hard pressed to find a nicer cased at this same price.<br /><br />Pros: USB 3, Not gaudy, Good airflow, Filters (though it could use a couple more)<br />Plenty of drive bays, plenty of room for larger motherboards and cards, bottom mounted PS,<br />Unobtrusive LEDs for power and HD activity (some may not like how small they are).<br /><br />Negatives (I'm really nit picking to get these):<br /><br />The only real negative I can think of is that there are no screw holes nor hold downs<br />on the right side of the external drive bays for short bay devices like control panels<br />(I plan to drill two screw holes to help hold in a drive controller in the lowest external bay).<br /><br />The mounts for the 2.5\\" drive has two of the the mounting screws located under the MB<br />not a huge issue since I but put the SSD drives in the the regular (3.5\\") drive bays.<br />(Or you could just hold it in with only two screws since SSD drives are so lightweight).<br /><br />I would have preferred to not have a curve in the front bezel (I love Straight lines)<br /><br />Over all it is a great value and I and quite happy with my purchase.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|The first half of the book has gruesome details but it has served as preparation for the second half. The writer has given much incisive thoughts to ponder. It's a gem.
B008602KQI|5.0|The story followed the books pretty well and I really thought the acting was super. Good story hope there os a sequel
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I am a Harry Bosch fan so I easily followed the short plots but a newer reader would likely be left disappointed.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|A great book from one of the best fantasy writers publishing today. I Highly recommended this book for any fantasy fan!
B0049MPHZI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this epic series. The universe created is richly detailed and original. Revelation Space is expertly woven together with interesting characters and a believable vision of the future. Highly recommended!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so much fun and contains so many interesting ideas and recipes.  I have tried quite a few tasty recipes already.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book !!!! It made me laugh, cry, and think about my love for my husband. I definately recommend that if you haven't read this book, then you need to and order the trilogy because u won't stop reading until you've read all 3 books.
0439023521|5.0|I liked it when it first started, but as soon as the games begun i was HOOKED. In a matter of days i finished it, So electrifying, and also emotonal. I was so sad when Rue died :(. I thought the ending was a little bit anti-climatic, i was expecting a full on fight with the last career tribute, other then that this was an incredible book!
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|First off, let it be known I am a hardcore horror movie nerd. I love b movies, and low budget flicks. I wasn't too sure what to think of a mainstream zombie tv show, but I was surprised! The zombies are pretty much an afterthought and the real meat and potatoes of the show are the characters.  Very well done, a great show, even if you are a horror movie junkie like me, you'll still dig this<br />.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have really enjoyed Martin's work so far (I enjoyed the show as well) and like most can't put the book down! I have to admit I have even spent a Friday night or two reading instead of going out! For the sake of argument though, I dont know if really like how each chapter jumps to a new character. At times I forget exactly what happened last time. Also I don't know think I like how I got half the characters in Book 4 and the other half  Book 5... In the end I can't think of a better way to provide the same experience, so Martin def made a great decision- I'm just sharing my thoughts...
B008TRUDAS|3.0|I bought Slammed because my sister read both it and the second book, twice. And is waiting for the third.  I thought it was okay nothing more.  Never cared deeply for either main character.  I will be thinking about reading the second. Maybe when I can get it from the library's digital download because I really don't think I want to buy it.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This movie was OKAY at best.....But it just didn't cut it for me, not like the book did...First of all i don't think the acting was that good, none of them convinced me with their roles, sounded a bit cheesy to be honest,. Secondly, they have taken/modifed alot of things out of the book. Why is the girl that got taken and mutilated completely missing? How is Katnis infinitly hydrated in the film? When it's evident and realistic that she was craving for water everyday. Katnis and Rue weren't convincing me at all in the movie..They got like, what? 1 minute screen time max? When Rue died in the book my heart nearly sank, but when she dies in this movie it's not convincing or emotional because it seemed like they only just met each other. I don't remember them even talking about each others personal life or the birds. Overall this was a letdown.
B0088WK27S|5.0|Very inspirational--amazing man and his wife is great too.  The true story is very amazing and proves what just one man can do.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Having read the first of the trilogy years ago when it came out for a children's literature class I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Having just finished Catching Fire I have to say it was definitely slower, as far as action, than the first book, but it was still an easy read keeping me engaged and ready for more. If you liked not only the action but the full plot of The Hunger Games you will surely like Catching Fire. I would recommend this book strongly to those who are intrigued with the characters and how their journeys will play out.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this movie. I think its good to watch. In my opinion its a must see. I can not wait for the second and third part to come out.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Initially had some trouble getting into the book, but once I get past that it was very good.  Made me really think about my own running in terms of enjoyment, style, etc.
B0090X4J9G|5.0|This series gets under your skin and you just can't stop watching. I highly recommend if you like suspense. My best friend and I get together once a month to watch 4 episodes at one time, thanks to Amazon.com.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|It is very much like Stephen King writtings, very intriguing and misterious, supernatural.  I liked it and would read more of Crouch if his other stories are like it.
0823004325|5.0|The book has great detail on expressions as well as summaries.  One can dive into the minutiae or simply go to the reference.  IT has already helped with drawing from my imagination and I can see using this reference when I want to change an expression.  For me, it is a must have for my drawings and sketching.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The rhythm of the story is really slow, to the point that it gets boring. There are too many erotic scenes which also makes the reading boring because it makes the story slower. These scenes are not hot anymore, you just want to skip them to move forward. The story is really predictable, you are able to guess what is going to happen almost in every turn of the story. It's not a great book, but all in all I will read the last one to get the whole picture.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is not that great but its good. it is also one of my favorites.<br />the games should cost less
B006OOHYIC|4.0|No timer or push to keep playing. Great for that last bit of play before bed. Very calming music too.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's not the best novel, although it's catchy. You would want to keep on reading to find out more about the story. It's not the best written book, the author repeats the common expressions she uses over and over.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is a type of movie showing the viewers how to take a stand for what's the right thing to do no matter how hard things may be.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the book and love the movie.  I love the fact that they don't overwhelm the story with load music, making it more stark by the lack of music. If you like movies you should get this.
030758836X|3.0|This was a riveting story that I listened to via audible.com. There was a male and female voice for each of the main characters. A very nice touch. Both my husband and I could not stop listening as we were so interested in the development of the story. We both listened to the book in record time. However, because of the language in the book I would NOT recommend the book to anyone even though the story was excellent. I gave it a 3 rating only because of the language. Otherwise, this book is a 5 Star.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very addicting and fun. Normally I turn off music in games but I enjoy the relaxing sounds. I enjoy the gentle colors too
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A gripping movie, well constructed, skillfully executed with convincing special effects. A lot of graphic violence, but that was central to the story.  I would recommend this movie for adults, but it's definitely not for children.  This Blu-Ray disk is a keeper which we shall watch again.  We will anxiously await the next installment as the story continues.
B0058YPG1G|1.0|If you haven't become addicted to the Braking Bad series, this season will do it. See the evolution of Walter White's persona go from \\"Harry Potter to Scarface\\".
B008ULRY78|4.0|I believe the this was a good action picture with a nice story line with a little twist to it, but for the most part it would have been better if it was in just english.  I was a little lost cause when I read Im not as focused.  I watch facial expression while Im watching a good film such as this
B006AZZPCM|4.0|All available sizes and works fast. Maybe people have slow phones? Also, i used airpush detector and it noticed nothing. Google sending reviewers? LOL
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|This is a very good movie, but it's not the same as the original foreign production. The movie only comes in the Gothic art box with 3 discs which is okay for some of us, but I prefer not to have the DVD, or the Digital copy as I think it's redundant to include the DVD, because it's not cost effective and a lot of stores are not selling this movie,  Sony is loosing a lot of sales. The worst mistake they made is including a Digital copy that looks like an illegitimate copy of the DVD that has \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" in what appears to be hand written on it. I myself thought that I had a Pirated disc, until I looked at it very closely, then placed it in my Studio Grade Samsung player and pulled up the information that tells me the disc has 5.1 DOLBY Digital sound and closed captioning which you can not include when you make a copy of a movie. I even went to the extent to call Sony Pictures and asked them why they made a disc like this, and was told that it was a marketing ploy to make the disc look more Gothic. Like it or not, don't get confused and think you have a Pirated copy of this movie even though the art work on the other two discs is terrible in my opinion. I think they will eventually make a one disc Blu Ray in a normal case. If they do, for the sake of saving money,and taking up a lot of extra space I will buy the single disc and give this one to someone in the family that likes bulky containers and does'nt have this movie yet. Don't let SONY's mistakes keep you from purchasing this movie, and if you're technically savvy you'll really enjoy this movie. Bonjour!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Contains most of the functionality that the website version does. It did take a little playing with to figure out how to access my boards and pins but every app has a learning curve to it.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I didn't have the opportunity to read American Literature in HS and to be honest,I doubt I would have enjoyed this one as much back then.  I feel when you reach a certain age,you understand more about life and,of course,there's nobody telling you to read it NOW!  This is a well written love story and is about how tangled up love can become when you are denied to follow your heart.  It's a sad tale but I enjoyed every minute of reading it.  If you haven't read any of the Classics,I suggest you read this one,makes you want to read other classic books!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Definitely a great read...second a third books are amazing as well! Must read, especially if you loved the movie! Would reccomend for anyone over the age of 13 due to some violence.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|George Clooney looking like a normal, handsome middle-aged man with kids.  I loved the everyday feel to the movie.  This wasn't Hollywood, this is real life stuff. The challenges and choices that most of us can relate to. Shailene Woodley, playing one of Clooney's kids was wonderful.  Shailene should have had a Oscar nom at least for her portrayal of rebellious teenager with a lot of heart and sass. Amara Miller, the youngest daughter, had a few very cute scenes that will make most smile and chuckle out loud.
030758836X|5.0|I couldn't put this down (technically) once I got into it. Related to the characters and loved the style of writing. The back and forth between each psyche and the twists kept me enthralled. Reading his point of view and then her diary entries was thrilling, and once you get past the half way point you are blown away. The ending left me disturbed. Loved it.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I found Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker very immature.  If I were a 15 year old I probably would have been glued to these books for the sexual content.  I am certainly no 'prude', however, more story and less sex would have been a much more enjoyable read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The best app games I have played. Does not take to long to move forward with your dragons. A really good Sims.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've never been disappointed in a Nicholas Spark novel. Safe Haven lived up to my expectations. I appreciated the suspense-more in this novel than his others.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was a well written captivating book! I started reading and was unable to put it down as I couldn't wait to see what happens! Loved the characters and had a great visual of each one due to wonderful writing!
0525953728|5.0|I suspect a lot of the low reviews are from readers that never read the book.<br />First...the only traiter is the employee at Fox news that gave up the SEAL's real name for profit.<br />All the material contained in the book was derived from unclassified publications and sources.<br />Mark Owens hired a former Special Operations attorney to review the manunscript and made sure it contained<br />no forbidden topics.<br />If anyone is leaking sensitive information to our national security it is the WH and the Pentagon.<br />Who's working with hollywood on a movie about the take down of OBL?<br /><br />Real active SEALS made a movie called \\"Act of Valor.\\" Did they get paid?<br /><br />The book is a \\"can't put down\\" easy read. A little like Clancy but NON-FICTION.<br />I was sitting, sweating too as he describes not only the elimination of the biggest target enemy the U.S. was after but other ops that required SEAL teams to do what they were taught to do.<br />He doesn't dis other branches of the service and he doesn't put down our president. They, SEAL Team 6 do make sport of Biden.<br /><br />For over five years a CIA special agent tracked people associated with OBL and (no spoiler) when they brought him in on the helo, she (the agent) broke down in tears and couldn't stop crying.<br />It is a real \\"boots on the ground\\" story and am going to read it one more time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am glad that I can now look at Pinterest on my Kindle.  I am in love with it.  It is so neat to pin things and there are such great ideas of things to do and make.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|An adictive trilogy!!! I cant stop until i finish, dont expect culture or learn anything is just a Love story whith a spicy touch
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I admire the courage that was needed to write this book. I am impressed by Jaycee's ability to not allow the actions of others to dictate who she is as a person.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a very Good book. This book had my interest from the beginning and held it until the very surprising ending!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I actually bought this book after I had written my manuscript and I still found it to be very helpful. It is a really good guide for someone who has not published a book on Kindle previously, particularly in reference to the order that things should appear in the front of the book. I would definitely recommend it to any \\"newbie\\" considering publishing on Kindle.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|While well written, this book was terminally boring. I give it 2 stars for being very descriptive. Some people are into that. I myself found it tedious and repetitive. Really, you do not need to tell me 20 times that your parents were ill-suited for each other. I GET IT. The only way I could even nominally believe the narrator was not a robot was to conclude that he was raised in isolation and simply didn't understand things like emotions and feelings. This book could have (and should have!) easily been about 200 pages shorter. I think this must just be one of those taste specific books - 2/12 in our book club liked it very much. The rest of us were not on board. I've never read any of his other books and this one certainly doesn't make a very good case for doing so.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This third installment in the Outlander series does not disappoint.  Ms. Gabaldon had a few more surprises up her sleeve for this one.  I LOVE her writing style - sex between Claire and Jamie is poetic, real, and so very passionate.  Thank you Ms. Gabaldon for giving us all a fictional character about whom we fantasize just a little, when we find our own lives a tad mundane.
B000TERG6S|5.0|Love this CD - I'm a guitar fan and his playing is just marvelous. This was my first introduction to Jesse Cook - I will purchase more.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|The absolutely best documentary/movie about Bob Marley ever. I had the pleasure of seeing it in the Angelika Theater in Dallas, TX. Now I own a copy of it. Don't miss out on yours!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So far I have found it to be an excellent way to access the Bible during worship and look at multiple translations. Sometimes different translations will open a slightly view of what I can apply to my life.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|I bought the Toy Story for my 5 year old grandson.  He is enticed by it and asks for me to play when he comes over.  It is bargain with no mess.
0525478817|4.0|I am definitely going to be in the minority by saying this, but I am not in love with this book like everyone else.  I wouldn't normally read a \\"cancer\\" book, but it got such good reviews I thought I would give it a try.  It was also my first John Green novel.  Oh John Green.  How can you make me simultaneously enjoy your book and yet be so irritated with it? My main problem was with the characters.  Hazel and Augustus are characters who are supposed to be teens but in no way act or talk like teens or even like most adults.  The hyper aware, Proust sprouting, manic-ness of Gus and Hazel's thoughts grated on me a bit.  It was like if Rory Gilmore from the Gilmore Girls and Dawson from Dawson's Creek got cancer and then had metaphorical discussions about it all the time.  It was just too much for me sometimes. And really, Gus' whole cigarette stiche were he put cigarettes in his mouth but does not smoke them because he \\"puts the killing thing in front of him but does not allow it to kill him\\" as a metaphor just about sent me over the top.  What is THAT?<br /><br />But for all my railings against his characters, I did find the book very well written and thought provoking.  It is a heart wrenching and realistic look at cancer.  And the ending.  Oh the ending well definitely get you.  I feel like it is a book that will stay with you for a long time after reading it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a fun read!  Plot twists and fascinating characters make for a great reading experience.  Perfect for a sunny beach or a rainy afternoon.[[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]]
0525423273|5.0|I don't generally read contemporary teen novels, especially contemporary teen romance novels. Mostly because I'm 31 and not 17 and they can be so...'teenager-y\\".  But this book blew my expectations out of the water.  It was so much fun!  It was witty and light and managed to stay within the realm of believability.  It wasn't all star crossed lovers or major misunderstands or angsty or awkward (yay!).  The thing I really liked is that both of the main characters are flawed, but not damaged.  Anna doesn't completely lose herself to be with St. Clair and voices her opinion more than once (although sometimes without getting the whole story!).  And St. Clair won't dump his girlfriend even though it is pretty obvious he has feelings for Anna.  To be fair, he doesn't come across as quite the cad that sentence makes him out to be.  Both Anna and St. Clair are afraid to admit their true feelings and afraid to hurt others.  They are friends, but stuck in that murky gray area.  I think a lot of people can relate to that situation.  Anna is an extremely fun narrator and there were times I truly laughed out loud.  A great read...even for 31 year olds!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|With the help from OUT Magazine, I looked at the cover picture of the Golden Boys in Perks of Being a Wallflower and I told myself try to get a book to read what it is saying. I got hooked up reading the whole book in one sitting and oh boy...I got so sentimental with the characters in the book and started to understand what I had gone the pains while I was a teenager in residental school. I want to applaud Stephen Chdosky for the masterpiece in writing a novel (more likely in writing in diary proses). I recommend anyone to try it and you will enjoy it afterwards.<br />Thanks.<br /><br />Kevin
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book and so did the other 6 people I knew who read it. I would and have re-read this book and will continue to. Those who hate or dislike the book i only have one thing to say....DONT LISTEN TO THEM! Read the book and decide for yourself. I cant wait for the movie!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I bought  this app to support a developer who has real talent. You run a calibration routine for accurate power statistics, and it tells you everything you will need to know concerning power management.
B0060D11OU|5.0|I bought this movie for my 3 year-old daughter. She has now watched it at least 20 times and can sign a lot of the songs. It is as much fun for her today as it was for me when I was a child.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|fun story esp nice having it on my google nexus phone,  always there ready to read in a down time moment, no books to carry around.  the story is exciting as i heard it would be.  recommend reading,
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've never really loved ear buds, but that is just about all you can find in stores these days. I had a pair of vertical headphones years ago that I loved. I was on a mission to find another pair. I came across these and ordered them immediately. I tried them out as soon as I received them in the mail, and let me say, these have amazing sound quality! I can't believe I used ear buds for years, only to realize I wasn't getting the best sound from them. I love that these stay in my ears while running, and they stay on my head! I hope they never stop making this style, because I can't see myself ever going back to ear buds!!
B008M34INW|4.0|I went into it with low expectations, but it turned out to be a reasonably engaging movie.  Its starts a bit predictable, and the situations require a bit of suspended disbelief.  In the end, its a bit of a heart warming story.  Definitely worth watching.
1401233791|4.0|I've never read Bane's back story (almost a pun right there) before, but thought I'd give it a try after seeing The Dark Knight Rises. I've grown up with Batman: The Animated Series and read a few Batman comics, mostly from Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale and Alan Moore's \\"The Killing Joke,\\" so I know who oracle is and I know a bit about Batman's story and Bane's story. Knightfall really fleshes it out and paints Bane as a true antithesis of Batman where originally I always thought the Joker filled those shoes. I don't want to spoil anything but I will say it's well worth the read, especially at 17 bucks or so, and better if you have a deeper knowledge of Batman's history. I knew there was more than one robin and I knew one of them was killed, but I didn't know who Jean Paul was going into the story. If you can ride it out you'll pick up bits and pieces alluding to the other robins and Jean Paul's history. It's not going to break you if you don't know every detail about Batman.<br /><br />I will say the book kind of slows down in the middle and it gets pretty unrealistic/cheesy at certain points, and there's definitely some questionable writing, but the action's great, Bane's story is especially cool, and like I said, it's well worth your money. If there's a comic book store nearby I'd suggest getting it from there; you'll spend a bit more but comic stores need all the help they can get.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This story is so well written and compelling, the subject matter could be any journey.  Because I have lived near the PCT most of my life I especially appreciated the content.  The stories about the hike were both amusing and disturbing, imagine your feet hurting for weeks on end,  but the stories concerning the author's life before the hike were so heartfelt and so personal, they are what the made this book 5 stars for me.
B007SGM084|1.0|poorly written, characters are boring idiots I am kicking myself for paying for these 3 books<br />If I had known this previous to purchasing I would not have wasted my hard earned money.
B008Y76PA0|4.0|Brings back memories playing that old playstation video game. Best part is when darkness falls and the sirens go off.
B003RNXIBK|5.0|\\"love the way you lie\\" sums up relationships-ending with the way we want our men to<br />Feel justnot actually behave. \\"so bad\\" is tough and fun to listen to. By the way this review is written by an old woman, lol!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm so glad to have this app.  I love Pintetrest!!!!!  I have gotten so many great tips, recipes, etc from this site.  Having it on my kindle fire makes it that much better.
B008IZ6G7K|5.0|Dexter never disappoints!  Season 6 picks up perfectly where season 5 left off.  Dexter has his \\"work\\" cut out for him with this new brand of serial killer on the loose.  The premise of Dexter exploring his faith, mixed perfectly with the Travis/Gellar cat & mouse game like a cocktail of adrenaline you won't want to miss.  If you haven't seen Dexter, or haven't yet seen season 6, do yourself a favor and watch it now, it's killer!
B005OMOKN2|5.0|Not much to say about a battery--it works well, holds a charge well, lasts pretty long.  Its small size makes it easy to carry an extra...
B000002GLV|5.0|I had this John Mayall album on vinyl back in the day.  I was browsing music on Amazon one day and saw the CD for a very good price.  I decided to buy it since all I had was an old cassette of it, had to get rid of the vinyl several years ago.  Very good music for a 3 piece group.  My 14 year old son even likes it!
B008EL4YX6|3.0|The game was ok.  It wasn't amazing but it was mildly entertaining.  I expected something more like a mirrors game where you reflect light just right to get to the goal, but it was a bouncing ball and more about timing.  So ok but not what I expected.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This games has been really fun to play with. Alot of hand & eye coordination & just all around enjoyable to play it.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|After reading the entire Fifty Shades Trilogy, I must say the last was the best. Firstly, the writing style was slightly different, interestingly different. Secondly, there was even more story-line content than the other two and thirdly this one really left the reader disappointed that the story was over and really wanting the next chapter of Ana and Christian's family life with their children,however many.
B004GYY714|5.0|This TuneIn application is awesome and a neat one too. It's fun and let's you hear stations from around the world.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Love it! Refreshing, fun, and singable! I heart 1D! We all love to listen to this cd. My 1year old, 7 year old, my hubby, and me!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is fun, it looks great, and is surprisingly addicting. Has many levels so it can last a while and even when you beat them all you can still go back to get them in the fewest amount of moves.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so glad to have this! makes it so much easier now! only problem I have is I would like to edit my pins and boards.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quality app, simple and enjoyable. Has just the right mix of playability and depth while still being easy to set aside and come back to later.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I find this game to be challenging and relaxing at the same time. Super addictive too. Great music and artwork too
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great App. easy to get addicted to. fun to play for kids and adults<br />Also very easy to figure out from the start. If your looking for a game to play while in a waiting room or something similar this is for you
B007LB2B3K|5.0|Superior album,  would recommend this album to all my friends. Looking forward to a new album from them, keep it up
B001O54NL2|5.0|Great sound quality and remastering.  Not one bad song on this CD.  Be sure to get this multi Grammy award winning album.  It will bring back a lot of memories if you were around during it's original release.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I don't normally read books of this magnitude but something about the synopsis pulled me in.  It didn't stop there.  I couldn't put the book down.  Eric Blehm draws you in with his recounting of Adam and his road to the SEALS.  I cried, I laughed and I smiled.  Adam was an amazingly strong man who overcame so many obstacles and struggles. I recommend this read to everyone.<br /><br />Well done!!<br /><br />My thoughts and prayers are always with the service men/women and their families.  Thank you for doing what you do to protect us all.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it doesn't work on my kindle fire and it slows down every other app I have... ducks save your time not worth it sense the update
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle is prime example of how to do television( and television couples) right.<br /><br />It manages to strike the perfect balance between light hearted fun and drama. Not to mention it treats its viewers with intelligence (and appreciation).<br /><br />Castle and Beckett in particular are quite possibly the best television couple ever, imo. They are the main reason I tune in every week-just to see how their story unfolds. I love each of them individually, but together they are as Lainie's alter ego said in \\"The Blue Butterfly\\"- a modern \\"walking fairy tale\\" sans the corniness. They have tenderness, passion, sweetness, a touching friendship, a profound love, witty banter, humor, and chemistry to spare. Love, love, love them (did I say love?), and I couldn't have imagined 2 more perfect actors to play them than Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic.<br /><br />The supporting cast is an added bonus. I enjoy all of their interactions with Castle/Beckett as well as each other. I especially look forward to seeing martha and Alexis interact with Beckett given the new paradigm post \\"Always\\".<br /><br />I'm not just a fan of this show's characters, couples, stories, and cast, but also of its production value. Everything from the directing, to the set design, writing etc. and amazing original music by Robert Duncan (i.e. \\"I Just Want You\\" from Always) is crafted with painstaking detail and executed exceptionally well.<br /><br />Speaking as a former X files fan, I wasn't surprised to learn Castle's creative team consisted of many former XF crew. Including Rob Bowman who lends his exquisite visual style and directorial \\"sixth sense\\" to help mold the characters and story.<br /><br />A special thanks to Andrew Marlowe, whom I think deserves more credit, for telling Castle and Beckett's tale so beautifully. I appreciate his willingness to make their romance a focal point of the show, and to treat it with such care without being afraid to explore all the facets of it onscreen.<br /><br/>That's especially true of Season 4. I thought it was great. I've loved something about every season, but I really enjoyed getting to delve deeper into Castle and Beckett's respective heads as well as their feelings for each other.<br /><br />I had several favorite episodes;<br /><br />Cops and Robbers<br />Cuffed<br />Headhunters<br />Always (I lost count of how many times I watched this one-amazing finale)<br /><br />In closing all I can say is I've loved every season of this show thus far, so bring on season 5!
B0014EU5XI|5.0|This is a great representation of all the styles they play and rocks the house. If you don't have their music this is a perfect set to have.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am trying very hard to get through this book.  Normally, I get a book and finish in a couple of days.  I have to force myself to read a couple of pages every other day or so.  I knew what the subject matter was before I purchased, and I am in my sixties, so am old enough to not be enthralled with just the sex stuff.  I would like more of a story line and a better writing technique.  I have been told book 2 and book 3 are better but I will think twice before investing any more money on this author.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This one is my favorite. The story is excellent, and fast paced. You'll be ready for the next one as soon as you read the last word.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|good for getting reasoning brain cells firing after a crazy day.  hints keep you from going crazy on really difficult ones
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Great, fun interesting read. Very entertaining, found myself laughing out loud. I would recommend the audio version as I understand it is even better.<br />Enjoy, laugh, love!!!
B0045MPPJK|4.0|I first saw the video for \\"I Fink U Freeky\\" and it was grotesquely mesmerizing. Google it. This was my introduction to Die Antwoord. I spent the next weeks watching all the videos, which are visually striking, and the Zef world created/reported is an intriguing comment/insight into a different South Africa. Then I realized I enjoyed the music. Whether or not they are a bit rough edged for me, I dig. Both albums are on my iPod and I listen to them constantly at the gym or while running. Check them out. Probably not for everyone, but I Fink Dey R Freeky and like them a lot.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Started first book and now I am on the second of the Trilogy and its great! Definately recommend for women and men...
B005LAIHPE|5.0|The main actor in this DVD is the same guy who played John Carter (which I think is the best movie out this summer). Once again he did a great job playing his part and made this movie fun to watch and believable (as much as a sci-fi can be). The aliens were something we haven't seen before, the machines they were in were creative, the story was believable as it was presented and fun to watch. I bought because I can watch it over and over again without getting tired of the story or the laughter.
B0055S348W|4.0|This app was a bit tedious for me to setup as I continuously encountered issues with finding just the right printer and settings to use to get it to work.  For some reason, my Canon printer would not properly work as it should with this, but a little tweaking with the settings in my computer, and all is now great!  Can use this app to print directly from phone including emails, files, etc. and it sure makes tasks a lot smoother when I don't have the time to transfer the file from my phone to the computer to print at the precise moment that I need a hard copy.<br /><br />I won't say that the time lapse from selecting print to the actual print job coming out is anything to boast about, but it's not too bad considering that it's wireless and ever-so-convenient!<br /><br />I use this app quite often, and find it to be a definite asset.  Well worth the download, especially during it's \\"day\\" as the Amazon App of the Day!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|hats games that you need to buy money to play. id pay about five bucks for complete game. but you'll never get a dime this way.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this Stephen King novel and I am not usually a fan.  This one, however, only requires a small suspension of credibility.  Can't wait to see how it ends, in fact, I think I will get back to it now.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My kids enjoyed the movie Rio and loves this game. You get to release the birds from cages instead of dealing with pigs. Music is very upbeat. It seems a little noisier than the regular Angry Birds, but all sounds are happy and won't bug me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is for everyone woman out there. It can steam up your sex life or help u have one. Can't put it down once I pick it up
B008MEM24S|5.0|My kids are 8 and 5, and they both love this game. They take turn playing and watching the other one play. Each level takes only a minute or so, so they don't mind waiting. I love that they can play together. I also love that this game encourages their logical thinking. I highly recommend it.
B005NPB7K4|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Chris Isaak.  Ever since I saw the Dancin' video on MTVs 120 Minutes.  It took me two years to track down a copy of the album.  And I owned the first three album before Wicked Game burst onto the scene.  I love every single piece of music I've ever heard him produce.  This album is a natural for him, as it was for Brian Setzer.  Isaak's sound is a straight line evolution of Sun Records golden age.  He stays true to the original material and adds his own unique seasoning with his voice.<br /><br />This isn't about the music, it is about product packaging and fairness.<br /><br />When this album was originally released the were two version.  The \\"deluxe\\" version was only a few dollars more for 11 more songs, so it seemed worth it.  However, upon giving a listen, I noticed the short time of the first CD, then the same on the second.  The combined time could have easily fit onto one disc.  If that wasn't bad enough, now there is another version being issued by Rhino (according to Allmusic.com) that will not only combine all songs onto one CD, but will add another three tracks.<br /><br />I'm not fanatical about collecting the music I love, but putting out a improved edition of an album around a year after the initial release is just a slap in the face to the dedicated fans.  Similar scenarios occured with Imelda May's Mayhem and the reissue of The Cult's Love album.  The first added some great tracks and the second was realesed as a deluxe version of the original release with additional tracks and remixes only to have months later an even more sweeping inclusive omnibus edition.<br /><br />I'm all for reworking and old release, but to do a major addition to a recent release is just disrespectful to fans and a rip off.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well i am finished with the set of Fifty, sure wish there was a #4.Have never read a book of such nature, but you just have to keep reading cant put it down.In talking to my many friends they felt the same.Bet there was alot of happy husbands.HA
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think the book was great. Not as crazy as I thought it was going to be due to all the hype concerning the racy parts but I loved it. Cant wait to read the next two and I would definitely recommend! <3

B004J4WKTW|1.0|This book was not what I expected. The beginning was set up to promote a grand event that did not happen. It was slow and repetitive. I was disappointed.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I thought that this was a very cute version of this wonderful fairy tale that parents & children can both enjoy. Nothing violent or raunchy...just a cute story with of course, a happy ending! = )
B007SYWFRM|5.0|ice age is very fun and fun to create my dogs love watching the animals. everyone will enjoy young and old
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good time passer when some one is bored or for younger kids. but kinda. slow for older people that might try it
1586487981|5.0|This book has been an eye opener to how and why the world's poor are in the position that they are in, how they can be helped and the challenge in getting them the help they require. The book gives examples of poor familes from a dozen countries around the world, why they are starving, why they cant succeed economically, and why many times government decisions are the cause of their poverty. It was a simple quick read that you will not be able to put down.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Love this band live and the cd is great.  Almost a touch of Janis Joplin in her voice and she is amazing.  Buy it.
0307279189|5.0|If you like to run and like to read, you will love this book. I couldnt put it down! What a great story of the ultra-running community.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Anyone who believes that FREEDOM IS NOT FREE should read this. This book is extremely down to earth. The true life story of Adam Brown. Even though I'm retired USN, I did shed tears.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Love these actors! This is my favorite producer.. I will follow these until the end of time..! This movie was just absolutely funny..!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a very good book touching on long term relationships, past fantasies, unfulfilled dreams, loss and growing old. Highly recommend.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I suggest everyone reads this, after 10 days my belly was flat! I never knew that wheat was so bad for you!!!  I always thought whole wheat was the best thing for you, boy was I wrong!  I stopped eating wheat, no hunger pangs, no cravings and I felt fabulous.  I went on vacation and ate wheat and am bloated!  Going back on no wheat!  I had 2 hard-boiled eggs for breakfast and am not hungry for lunch yet!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was full of surprises, very well written and what a surprising ending!This was the first book I have read by this author but will definitely read another!
B007SGM084|2.0|I went by every one else saying how great this book series is so I bought it on the assumption that it would be worth reading.  Too graphic for my taste!  Not at all what I expected.  To be fair, I went ahead and read all three books but my initial opinion remained the same - not for me!  And definitely not for teens!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Bought the book and read it in two days which I've never done before with any other book.  I started reading it at 9pm each night and put it down reluctantly at 2am.  It was that good!  I've read all of Marcinko's books and many other spec ops books.  This one was captivating and eye opening.  I have so much respect for these guys and would like to say thank you to all who serve this great country!  Great book and great job Mr. Owen!!!!!  Oh, and all these negative reviews seem to be from Obama lovers who get all butt hurt when anyone shares a negative opinion of the man.  I don't care one way or the other, the book was a really good read, period.
0307730697|5.0|Not since Lone Survivor have I been so moved. This book is a top 5 (and i've read alot ofmbooks) and one of the most inspiring books I've ever read. It reminded me that the human spirit is alive and well and we can overcome anything when we rely on God. Adam reminded me to put my trust in Jesus, tell my wife how much I love her more often, hug and have fun with my kids more, and never ever give in or quit.<br /><br />God bless your family Adam Brown, I shall shake your hand in Heaven one day. Amen.<br /><br />P.S read this book!
B008602KQI|5.0|First off, I haven't read the books, so all I knew about \\"The Hunger Games\\" was from movie reviews. Therefore the movie was quite different from what I was expecting. I expected far more action and violence, more of \\"teen film\\", and was not prepared for the \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" love story. After the first viewing I would have rated the movie a 3 simply because it wasn't what I expected. However, some movies just grab a hold of you and insinuate themselves into your thoughts. I had the same experience with \\"Dune\\". So I watched the movie again the next night. This time I was enthralled. I can't comment on how well the movie captures the book, but once I understood what was going on it all fell together. Great acting, great directing, actually a rather interesting story and marvelous computer graphics. As with \\"Dune\\", having a basic understanding of where the movie was headed made all the difference. Obviously a sequel will be coming and I look forward to it with great anticipation. I may even buy the book. I might add, just so you know where I'm coming from that I'm 62 years old. Happy Hunger Games!
B003QTSMXE|3.0|If you want to enjoy a nice evening with your kids while they learn how we will one day destroy the Earth, and how we will all turn into boneless fat pigs living in space while robots take care of us...Then this movie is for you. The premise of Wall-E is a little off the mark, but should serve its purpose in an entertain aspect for children. This film is full of humor and plot points typical of other Pixar films. The animation is top notch as always, but I would like to see a Pixar film that displays human characters as realistic as possible and not as rounded cartoons. Overall, not much to say about the film, good or bad, but it will remain worth watching for many families.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love all of fifty shades, definetly recomend the story behind the sexy content, the story is very romantic.

B004S5C91Q|4.0|Written from a 5 year old's perspective and not know anything about the book it took a while for me to get into Room. A beautifully written story that keeps you intrigued as the layers start to peel away revealing a very tragic situation. Unlike any book I've ever read. Definately worth the read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love all of fifty shades, definetly recomend the story behind the sexy content, the story is very romantic.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read a lot and have read my fair share of bad books through the years.  This was the worst book I have ever read.  If your taste is for erotica you would still be better off surfing the net for porn.  At least you don't have to pay for that!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|This is a great album by one of my favorite bands!!! Buy it! Every song on the album is worth having in your collection.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this site. and love that there is now this app for my kindle!  I find things I didn't even know I was looking for. lots of great ideas for parties kids room and for decorating.  also lots of tips for everything.

B005LAIIRQ|4.0|Iam a Liam fan and I love all his films, this one is not that good.  The service of the delivery was however again excellent.  The condition of the tape excellent. I love this Amazon service.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I bought this backpack for school this year as I ride my back to classes every day and live at a downtown campus. This backpack has proven to be great not just for school, but for everything I do. I can fit my laptop, books, workout clothes, and basically my whole room in this backpack and take it with me wherever I want to go. This thing rarely leaves my back. Seriously.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Hunger Games and Catching Fire were very engaging and after reading both I could not wait to read Mockingjay.  That being said, I would not put Mockingjay on the same level as the first two books.  I felt that it was slow to start and had trouble keeping my interest halfway through.  Once it began to pick up, I felt that it was rushed and ended abruptly.  I know this is not a heartwarming story that is told throughout these three books, however, I still feel the ending could have left the reader with a little more detail and hope.  Out of the three, it was my least favorite book.
030746363X|1.0|Being a huge fitness fanatic and a fan of Tim Ferris' blog, I expected a lot out of the book. Since reading this, I have lost all faith in Tim Ferris as a person and would not trust much of his advice from his books or his blog. This book is a complete joke, and a bad, dangerous one at that. Ferris criticizes the medical world and advises MANY dangerous, body-altering solutions to gaining muscle and losing weight. Tim received a degree in East Asian Studies from Princeton, and this book SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY SOMEONE WITH A DEGREE IN EAST ASIAN STUDIES. I mean, seriously. This book uses scientific fact sparingly at best, and is rather a guide to being Tim Ferris, rebel of the system. Read the book for yourself, but I would discourage almost all of the experiments proposed in this book. Tim Ferris is an investor and a con artist and, quite frankly, has NO business as a fitness consultant.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie. A must see for people that like adventure. Looking forward to part 2. Keep you in suspence. Gotta see
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Excellent sequel to the original Quell, puzzles are just as good and mind tingling. I would highly recommend this puzzler
B008602KQI|5.0|this is about the blue ray version<br />The movie was very good it stuck pretty much to the book.<br />The blue ray was also  very good the colors were bright when they are at capital and to show the hardship in the districts they mute the colors, the extras were worth the price
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Am I missing something? I don't see \\"Working Man\\" or \\"Fallen\\" on this album.<br />Check out their \\"It's Time Remixes\\" tracks. They sound pretty good.<br /><br />This album is great! I really like all of their music, it's new and different than a lot of other stuff. Plus they have a bit of variety within this album. I could listen to this one album all day long.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Can I suggest there's a certain correlation between prog rock giants, Yes and with Big Big Train in the fact that each album of the former got better and better, especially from Fragile to Close to the Edge, from Tales From Topographic Oceans to Relayer onto Going For The One during those heady, special days when prog ruled. Thirty-five years or so later and another UK prog band is following along the same path in the sense it has been recognised that each album gets better and better. This isn't a band that rests on its laurels, and so it is in 2012 they have released English Electric (Part One) to a very favourable and appreciative audience who have looked forward to this album with eager anticipation. No mean feat given expectections were high from a very demanding and knowledgeable bunch of progheads. And the beauty of their music reaches out not only to those who live and breath prog but also to mainstream ears looking for good, well structured songs who maybe wish to have their rock album collection enriched further.<br /><br />If you haven't heard Big Big Train's music then you're in for a treat. The best way to describe their music is to maybe think about some of Genesis's earlier works recognised for their gentle arrangements creating moods of a romantic if not a better England with Victorian or Edwardian towns and rural villages over pastorale landscapes. Big Big Train have gone one step further and built a railway system over it. I even suspect they're Isambard Kingdom Brunel's long lost love child, but they do have their own style and sound as their previous catalogue demonstrates culminating in this new release of theirs. English Electric (Part One) starts off with feats of daring do with 'The First Rebreather,' a tale in itself of heroic diving deeds, and Big Big Train tell it well with musical flair and  a treat at the end of the long song with a collection of keyboards dueling it out between organ and synth/moog both. They're not as folksy as say Mostly Autumn lean towards sometimes, but they can head in that direction as with the next track, 'Uncle Jack' - a melody thanks to the introduction of banjo and upright bass mixed with the standard addition of keyboards, drum, guitar and vocals that stick like teflon in your mind, and one that will become a firm favourite due to the uplifting melody. But as in most prog rock there is a certain pervading tinge of melancholy about it; that sense of not so much days gone by but rather days passed by, much like in the works of Shakespeare and even Tolkien with England's pleasant greenery:<br /><br />\\"I sit beside the fire and think<br />of people long ago<br />and people who will see a world<br />that I shall never know\\"<br /> - JRR TOLKIEN (Lord Of The Rings)<br /><br />Something Genesis, and previous members of that band such as Anthony Phillips (The Geese and the Ghost, 1977) and Steve Hackett (Please Don't Touch!, 1978)have dwelled upon defined by their musical impressions. It has to some extent, with a touch of the Golden Industrial Age albeit followiing through to post World War II, become one of Big Big Train's signature references to their music.<br /><br />I've observed recent comments from fans of Big Big Train who have claimed their favouries from this album and I have to say I've changed my mind a few times from 'Winchester From St Giles' Hill' to 'Hedgerow' to 'A Boy In Darkness.' To be honest, there isn't a redundant song on here. David Longdon's vocals are spot on again, and I have looked forward to hearing him sing since the release of 'The Underfall Yard' and my favourite album (although it's recognised as an EP - that's EP in EPic in my books) 'Far Skies Deep Time.' Greg Spawton (guitars, keyboards, bass), prolific drummer, Nick D'Virgilio, Dave Gregory, guitar, mellotron, and Andy Poole on bass and keyboards once again show their musical ability with their own distinctive styles and methods that make up the Big Big Train sound we've come to love. What is exciting for a lot of us is how fresh they sound and what they bring to the prog table every time.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is up there as the definitive prog rock album of 2012 and you won't be disappointed by any of the tracks on offer here. Each one is worthy of many replays to suit what ever mood or interlude you're after. Shades of the 70's but this band is making its own history in the 21st century. An amazing album by Big Big Train, and as someone who gets to hear and play a lot of prog for my radio show, highly recommended.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Awesome game, I was pleasantly surprised when I played it and was really enjoying myself. I can't wait till they release more levels or a sequel.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a story of a man.  He seems a most average and quiet, unassuming man, living in a sort of \\"quiet desperation\\".  Having just retired, even the structure of his job and the daily routine is gone.  He receives a letter from a former co-worker, a woman who was kind to him.  She writes to tell him good bye, as she is dying of cancer.  His short note of reply and trip to the post box begins the story of his unplanned and out of the ordinary sojourn.  As he by passes the first post box and then the second, etc. he begins his story of transformation and exploration of his inner and outer landscape.<br /><br />Rachel Joyce captures the inner life in an almost mystical way.  She uses the story to describe a profound inner journey through the depths of this man's life story, his soul.  It is an engaging story that is interesting in it's unpredictable story line of outward events.  And it is rich in it's exploration of the human transformational inner process of one's life journey.  I loved reading this book and came to know Harold Fry, as if I had met him.  I would love to read more from this author.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Enjoyed this greatly!  Stephen King always makes me think and wonder - what would do in the same situation?  Dark and thought provoking.  Great read!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Pretty much same formula but I still enjoyed the book , the short story was a little over the top that what I expected
B0041KKYGU|1.0|1.  This is one of those movies where you think, wonder, perhaps hope that all of the negative review are wrong... because there are well know actors in this film.  But this film proves again and again that famous actors + lousy writing = lousy movie.<br />2.  Please save yourself some time and money, pass on this complete dud.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was an wonderfully entertaining movie which ran very true to Suzanne Collin's book.  Suspenseful and dramatic. What stands out is Amazon's 2-fer deal where they combined the DVD with their Instant Video services.  They made the movie available online on the day of release (weekend) as they would not be able to ship the DVD until Monday.  At first I was expecting just a single view version, but it is available whenever I want to watch online. The DVD could always be gifted. Glad Amazon thought of this great idea and hope to see it offered on other movies in the future!
B006O7XOOW|4.0|You will need a phillips screw driver to put this together.  Not hard, unless you have to hunt for the screw driver!  There are 6 screws needed to complete assembly.<br /><br />I have just turned one year old twin grandsons.  They have really enjoyed playing with this.  Their 5 year old brother can't resist playing with it when he passes by.  The only downside to this is that the balls disappear.  They have several toys with balls, most of which can be used with this.  Some of the adult males who saw this felt the paths the balls take are too much the same, but this wasn't designed for them!  The babies seem to like it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I found this book was very intriguing, and I would highly reccomend reading it along with the rest of the series.
0345803485|1.0|What bothered me most about this book was how often certain phrases are repeated.  Enough already.....yes, we get it that Ana liked the way his pants hang from his hips, and that when she touches him his breath hitched, and the inner goddess junk...........ENOUGH ALREADY.  I wish I hadn't wasted a few hours of my life reading this story that seems to be written by a teenager.  Why would a publishing company publish such bad grammar ?
0307592731|4.0|I would say I liked this book, did not love it.  I wish she would have explored some of her emotions more, the things I really wondered about she seemed to glaze over (and other things she seemed to obsess over).  I didn't care for her use of the \\"F\\" word, personally I think the word \\"sex\\" would have worked just fine.  Also I thought the last 1/3 of the book was very short and the end very abrupt compared to earlier parts that felt drawn out.<br /><br />I wish I would have read this book in the winter as I think all the nature and talk of hiking would have been a nice break during the long winters here.<br /><br />Overall I would say it's worth the read.
B005ZUR724|1.0|So, whenever I'm going to get a game, I check the permissions. Why in the hell does he need to disable keyguard? Or monitor my SMS messages? Or anything about my Wifi networks? I suggest being very, very careful with this game.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun game that is relaxing due to the measured pace and calming music. Got it free, but worth the 99 cents necessary.
B000QI2ZWW|3.0|I never understood why the sound on this movie was so low. I have had to watch it several times to really enjoy it. Great soundtrack though.
B008Y67LEK|5.0|The Bell Jar was a pleasure to read. It is deeply personal as it described the (fairly rapid) rise of mental disease and the sink into depression. The prose was lovely to read, and the word choice is quite appropriate. I can identify with many parts of Esther's thoughts and life. The novel itself is so engrossing and, above all, real. I did not doubt any of the things that happened. I did not find myself thinking, \\"Wait... That's kind of unlikely\\" once. The circumstances and situations were entirely believable. Overall, a work of art.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I got this specifically so that I could soothe a baby sitting in the backseat with clips of elmo from youtube. It never worked and I am bummed.
B007JLCO34|5.0|Little Women is certainly a classic that I shall enjoy now reading to my great granddaughter.  The book contains so many of life's lessons to share with our loved ones and these lessons do not change with the ongoing years.  I will enjoy sharing this book many times with my grandchildren.<br />I can still remember so many of the adventures of this family from the first time I read it at the age of 10 years.[[ASIN:1613823444 Little Women]]<br />Mary Bridgewater
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Brilliant music pieces! And a great puzzle game! I had the first Quell game and it was great! But it only had 2 music playing. This time, it has much more! Very Amusing game!
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|The soundtrack is great. However, the compact disc case did not contain written information about song title. performer, composer, play time, etc.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was a good ending, to the series. Let's hope she keeps writing, can't wait for the movie to come out.
0812993292|4.0|I wanted to read this book because I am a walker.  I've been a committed pedestrian my whole life and walk everywhere I can, but also for pleasure.  For at least one hour each day I turn off the noise of life and just walk, present in the moment, taking in the sights.  I've walked at all hours of the day and night.  I once walked home in Seattle at 4am through a cloud of fog that made everything gorgeous, mysterious, and quiet.  Walking at night in New Mexico the world is full of stars - if you start at twilight you get to watch the light shift towards dark and in New Mexico light is like nowhere else.  Here in Berkeley it's all about the gardens.  In my part of Berkeley the whole neighborhood is like an overgrown English cottage garden - just barely tended, always beautiful.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006TF6WAM The Unlikely Pilgrimage Of Harold Fry]] shares something else in common with me.  I've always wanted to walk somewhere outrageous and far away - just to say I did it.  When I lived in New Mexico I wanted to walk from Albuquerque to Los Alamos to take part in the yearly spiritual cleansing of the town, but I never did.  Life isn't over yet, though - some day I'll do that or something similar and who knows what will happen along the way?<br /><br />These things are the beauty of Harold Fry and his journey - the celebration of the quixotic journey, of putting one foot in front of the other and all the unexpected things that happen along the way.  It's about being determined and about the lessons learned on any journey - both expected and unexpected.  It's about having the courage to change and to try to do something - even something impossible.  Quite charming and a great read.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|This album is full of goods songs that you expect from Owl City, catchy tunes and great lyrics. This album is better produced and has a more polished feel to it. Older fans may not like it but it will appeal to a wider range of listeners.
0765322889|5.0|\\"Gardens of the Moon\\" was an engrossing read. Erikson created an internally consistent and complex world that kept my attention throughout the book. More importantly, his characters were believable in their conflicts (inner as well as external) and reactions to world events.<br /><br />Admittedly, Erikson didn't make this introduction to his world particularly easy. Indeed, it wasn't really an introduction at all but instead an immersion. I am still conflicted about this approach but, by the end, I thought that the work I put in to understanding Erikson's world was worthwhile. I didn't find it as immediately engrossing as the Wheel of Time books or Modesitt's Recluce Saga but that's partially because Erikson doesn't simply give the reader one character or group of characters to follow and identify with throughout the novel. This made the experience a little less personal for me but was still enjoyable.<br /><br />I may have some qualms about Erikson's style and presentation but, whatever my reservations, I found the book difficult to put down and I was always making time to read a few pages here or there.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very fun game!  It is a puzzle solver.  12 year olds really love it!<br />Recommend to everyone.  This one is a keeper!
B0090EIILU|5.0|This film had a real nugget of gold wrapped in it about democracy these days. The humor was fantastic as well, great acting.
0439023513|3.0|**********spoilers*********<br /><br />If you've just finished the first two books in this series and loved them, it would be a good idea to dramatically lower your expectations for the third installment. You'll be a lot happier reader in the end.<br /><br />I read the entire trilogy within a two-week period and was absolutely enthralled with The Hunger Games and even more so, Catching Fire.<br /><br />After reading the first two novels carefully, as I would fine adult literature, I found myself zipping through Mockingjay as though I were reading the book version of the recent \\"Transformers\\" movies. If not for the need to discover how Suzanne Collins would ultimately bring Katniss and Peeta together, I might not have finished it.<br /><br />And yet, I found the story troubling, even several days after finishing it. I read the ending and epilogue multiple times, trying to figure out why I found it sound depressing and unsatisfying, despite the surface \\"happy ending.\\" Obviously, when a reader is still pondering a book several days after finishing it, the story succeeds on some level. But on another level, Mockingjay fails when it drops the theme of hope that had seemed to build throughout the series. The perfunctory epilogue did nothing to help. Both Katniss and Peeta appear to be just going through the motions of living - even though the author has given them everything to live for. If Collins intended otherwise, she failed with a great many readers.<br /><br />That leads to what I believe is the greatest flaw of the finale: Readers are \\"told\\" what happens, rather than shown. Thus, many readers will find that they just can't buy into the ending. Here's an example: In the last chapter, Katniss tells us, \\"Peeta and I grow back together.\\" Why did they have to \\"grow back together\\"? Wasn't it the love between the two that motivated much of what Katniss did? Didn't they already come together during the \\"Stay with me ... always\\" exchange in the Capital? If Collins thought that they needed to go through a process to reunite, then why not spend a few paragraphs showing how it happened?<br /><br />And then there's this contradiction: Back home in District 12, Katniss feels relief when she learns that Gale is no longer around, but after the return of Peeta, whom she was willing to die for, she goes into the forest and imagines Gale coming back. What? After all that, I'm supposed to believe she's so shallow she still wants both? Maybe the trilogy really was aimed at a teen audience after all.<br /><br />Many reviewers contend that those of us who disliked the ending were looking for a fairytale. That's not the case with this reader. Rather, I was looking for a final novel with the vivid imagery of the first two books and the continued growth of the two protagonists. Instead, Mockingjay was a hurried wrap-up that abandoned not only the hope but The Hunger Games' wonderfully real and well-rounded characters to a depressing end that seemed unworthy of their earlier determination and grit.<br /><br />It's still a good summer read. But closer inspection leaves it wanting.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|When Still Alice was recommended to me, I had not heard of it but the topic seemed very relevant in this time when Alzheimers is so prevalent.  What an amazing story.  Although it is a work of fiction, it is very solidly based on research.  By writing the story in the voice of Alice, the author introduces her readers to the mind of a brilliant woman facing early-onset dementia.  The story unfolds as her mind changes, her career takes a plunge and her family copes with the new and ever changing situation.  It will open your mind to details of this disease, its causes, its treatments and its effects, yet it reads easily and with great insight.
0307592731|3.0|The book was very interesting. I did enjoy it. However I do think some of the personal script could have been left out ie sex. I would have likes to read more about the scenery & wild things  she encountered.
1401322786|5.0|\\" The Time Keeper\\" by Mitch Albom. Release date: Sept. 4, Hyperion Publishing<br />\\"Where did the time go?\\" \\"Time flies.\\" \\"I ran out of time.\\" \\"It's like time stood still.\\" They're just a few examples of the time-related phrases that we all use, words that imply is something that we can't control.<br />But, what if you could, would you want what comes with the responsibility?<br />Time - whether it's too or too little - and how it's handled by fallible humans is the subject of best-selling author Mitch Albom's latest , \\"The Time Keeper.\\" Just as with his other hits - \\"Tuesdays with Morrie,\\" \\"Have a Little Faith,\\" \\"One More Day\\" and \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven,\\" his novel is a thought provoker, urging readers to find the depth in his simple, yet imaginative writings. He has once again taken a simple theme and created an inspirational tale that lingers in the mind long after the last page is read.<br /><br />Time is first noticed 600,000 years by Dor, an ordinary man with an extraordinary need to count, measure and bring order to his days. He is the first man on earth to count hours, literally becoming Father Time. Rather than embracing time as a gift from God, Dor challenges Him when his wife dies.<br />Dor is banished to a cave when voices rise up from a pool as they ask, plead and demand more time. Centuries have passed, and Dor doesn't have the spiritual strength to take much more. God agrees to free him if he can help two people, a teenage girl named Sarah and an elderly man, Victor, embrace the true meaning of time. Armed with a magical hourglass, Dor travels through time into today's society, one dominated and dictated by time.<br /><br />He finds the lonely, heartbroken girl ready to kill herself. Victor is counting on his money to help him cheat death and live forever. One wants to cut her time short, while the other selfishly considers cryogenics so he can have another lifetime in the future. Dor's mission is to help them understand that time is a precious gift, one not to be squandered or manipulated. Instead, it should be embraced and lived fully. Can he save them in time?<br /><br />Albom's story is a reminder that we, as earthy beings, are not keepers of our time, but we are its celebrants. As such, it's up to each of us to decide how to spend whatever time we've been given. and not waste the precious gift. Actions today have consequences tomorrow.  \\"The Time Keeper\\" inspires readers to take personal stock, take time to make time and appreciate the precious gift - before it's too late.
B008602KQI|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie, and the Blu-Ray works perfectly! I haven't been through all the features yet, but I think there could have been more. For example I have yet to encounter any deleted scenes. That is the 1st thing I look for, unless I am overlooking it, if I am... I'll figure it out, if not... That is something that I wish was there. But all in all, I am very pleased!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am probably not the right person to ask about this book. I hated the ending because I do like people to be accountable for their actions. Maybe I missed something in this book but I don't think so.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Loved the music and all of the stage performers. This is a very<br />up-beat show, good ending. The singing was fantastic.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Something new coming out from Owl City, a new sound almost, but still just as good as ever. Can't stop listening!

B00354YA4A|5.0|Wonderful read. Great plot, character description, character development. I enjoyed it very much. The ending really leaves you thinking ...
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I haven't had time to finish this novel yet, so I can't speak for how it ends, but I'm well over half-way and love it! This is an excellent novel and if you think that the description of the story sounds interesting then don't hesitate to download the sample and try it out. I give it 4 stars because of its length. There are many places where it gets a little too wordy, taking up time and space.
B00846REIS|5.0|A perfect follow up series if you're a Fifty Shades fan.  I loved this book and I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel.  It has a \\"Fifty\\" feel, but I didn't feel like I was reading the same thing over.  The writing styles are different enough they completely different.  The characters are also very different in my opinion, so I don't necessarily agree with the reviews that say it's the same.  I feel it's defintely worth your time!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I saw this in the theatres and bought it when it came out on DVD and had to rent it so I could show some people at work.  They all loved it of course.

You will love Travis, enough said, just buy it :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It wasn't what I thought it was going to be about, but overall it was a pretty good book
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|After hearing so many people rave about this series, I felt I had to give it a try.  While the premise was good, I felt the execution was lacking.  There were so many dismal holes in the plot, I felt that it was a disservice to the young adult market that they were targeting.  The author didn't give the young adults any credit for intellectual reasoning.  I have read many young adult books that were handled much better.

B000FC130E|3.0|Up front I am going to state that this book just did not resonate with me. With that said I appreciated the author's ability to write humor, British at that, in a manner which made me laugh. On the other hand after reading 10 chapters I could not find enough to like about the relationships between any characters. The protagonist, Richard, and his perception of events was the source of humor. There was potential in Door to show something that would illicit sympathy had she shown more warmth towards Richard. The Marquis de Carabas also showed potential. Ultimately there was not enough of anything to warm this Adventures in Sewer World which might compel me to continue reading. The book content is populated with surprisingly familiar objects. Mr. Coup and Mt Vandemar have made appearances in many stories. The vulgar oddities everywhere will take some getting used to. I have not written it off. I am shelving this one until some point in the future if I am ever able to set aside the negatives so I can enjoy whatever is left. Of course your mileage may vary.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|Fortuna's wheel has spun most decidedly in favor of Mr. Toole's visionary work.<br /><br />With the style and substance of Voltaire, Chaucer, Cervantes and Fitzgerald we are taken on a journey through the Crescent City.  Mr. Toole's protagonist, Ignacious Reilly, is nothing short of Don Quixote tilting at wrought iron windmills.<br /><br />Mr. Toole captures early 60's New Orleans to its core.  From the architecture of the City and the Quarter; to the residents/tourists/characters that inhabit the city; and most importantly to the novel, the regional dialectic that makes each social group unique.<br /><br />Enjoy the book.  It is a most satisfying read.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Great album!  Saw this band on the show \\"TREME\\" and had to buy their CD.  If you like to hear real musicians, this is for you.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I love this game, but when you are flying around the game lags most of the time, this causes me to miss coins frequently. other than its a fantastic app.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|I really enjoy dramatic sounding music, especially music that gives you goosebumps.  Remember when the times you've gone to the movie theater, or were up late and checking out movie trailers online, and you saw a really cool trailer for which half of the coolness was the music?  Well this is that music!<br /><br />This music was made for exactly that purpose and the composers Thomas J. Bergersen and Nick Phoenix created a production music company called \\"Two Steps from Hell!\\"  You will definitely recognize or find familiar some of the scores used in trailers for big blockbusters over the past few years, such as the Harry Potter films, the X-Men films, and the Pirates of the Caribbean, just to mention a few.<br /><br />I'm happy that they decided to put a lot of their music in a few released albums for others to enjoy.  Also check out their other work for the albums \\"ArchAngel\\" (available on Amazon.com today) and \\"Halloween\\" (which comes out on Amazon.com on near the end of September).<br /><br />You might find a gem that you really loved and can now get it for your own collection!
B004E2XAFW|5.0|I think this is the best CD's I've listened to all year, what a discovery! I had never heard of Within Temptation before until hearing the song Faster on KNAC.com. I bought the CD and wow, crazy good - every single song is radio worthy. I don't know if their past CD's are more goth, haven't checked them out yet, but The Unforgiving isn't, it has more of a progressive metal sound which appeals to me as a hardcore fan of Dream Theater and Sharon den Adel's voice reminds me a little of the great Ann Wilson of Heart and sometimes Alanis Morissette. Well, gotta go now, gonna check out their other CD's!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have to admit that prior to this app coming out, I hated using Pinterest on my Kindle Fire.  Now that this is available, I stay on there more than I really should.  Love it!!!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this to boost the output from my Ipod high enough to listen to tunes on the motorcycle. It is a perfect size, had great battery life and a more than adequate output. Highly recommended. I was so impressed I bought a second one for a backup.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found the book extremely exciting and well written. It has a great story line and is an easy read.
B0041D843M|5.0|Superb book.  I found it extremely informative.  If you're interested in nutrition and the health implications of your food choices, you should gain a lot from this book.  The book isn't a \\"how to\\" book on modifying your food choices but rather a comprehensive study of the cause and effects, based on thorough study, of diet and major health implications. Thanks to the author for a job well done with this book!
B008BM9L72|2.0|Didn't really enjoy the first half of this book, so didn't finish it. Not really my thing.Didn't read the others in the Trilogy, just deleted them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the greatest series since Up Stairs Down Stairs. Can't wait to see Season 3. See which characters come back
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a fantastic way to play a challenging game but chill at the same time. My new favorite go to game when I really need to unwind.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Amazing App! So much easier and simple to use instead of going to the normal browser. No more \\"loosing\\" your pins, and so easy to select the right board to pin your item too! Five stars. Absolutely amazing and perfect for anyone who LOVES Pinterest!
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Halestorm has managed to make ground-shaking and teenage-sorrow music come together in a way that I believe no other band ever could. You could be both boisterous and calm, and Lzzy Hale's voice is absolutely perfect.
B008602KQI|5.0|I did not read the book before seeing the movie and viewing it has prompted me to buy all three books which I am beginning to read now. The first one kept me glued to the screen and left me hangling at the end hungry for more. I can't wait for the next movie to be released. I have recommended this movie to everyone I know and tell everyone I meet about it, I'm excited!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|my daughter and I have been looking for a good puzzle game so we downloaded the Quell Reflect tor free. We loved it so much that I just had to pay the .99 cents for the original!!!  I'm not a bit fan of spending money on something that will eventually be q free game of the day, but in this case I just couldn't wait lol. Thanks for all the hard work u guys have put in to make a game that my daughter and I can share. Lots of love and gratitude, ....... CherryC
B008602KQI|4.0|Only a very few movies are as good as the book.  This one isn't.  It is, however, a decent adaptation of the book and was enjoyable to watch.  I really think Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent actress and have thought so since seeing \\"Winter's Bone\\", so I was glad she was cast. Woody Harrelson is my hero:) Some of the other casting choices, well....not so good. This isn't like the HP series where every single character was perfectly cast. I still love the movie though, and I've seen it twice already since I've purchased it (five times total!)  I love the reaping scene so much!  I can't help but shout out \\"Primrose Everdeen\\" in Effie's voice when that part comes -- every time I see it.  It scares the bejesus out of the dog, so I have to pick him up and volunteer as tribute.  I think he hates this movie.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|This is the Sophomore effort from the Zac Brown Band.  Normally groups struggle with their second album for various reasons, but with ZBB, this certainly doesn't happen.  This album builds on ZBB's initial entry into the music world in every way, which was seemingly impossible as good as the first album (The Foundation) was.  Music lovers of an genre will love this album.  In my opinion, it ranks up there with \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\" (Beatles) and \\"Pet Sounds\\" (Beach Boys) as one of the greatest albums of all time.  It contains 5 number one country hits.  You won't find better musical diversity or virtuosity anywhere in modern music.  Yes.  It's that good.  Buy it.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loves playing your game.  She played it for quite some time.  She is not here at gram's every day now that school is in session.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are good time wasters. My entire family enjoys playing which is especially good when sitting at the doctor or hospital
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is really fun but if you want a really addictive game just download rage of bahamut and use the referral code owg65865 at the end of the tutorial.  Don't forget this special code because it gives you an awesome bonus.  My in game name is  thewyattriot87.  Feel free to send me a message and I will answer any questions that you may have.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|With author Suzanne Collins assisting in the screenwriting process, it's no surprise that the essence of the book is kept well intact. While avid fans of the book might argue for the inclusion of certain details or against the modification of some characters, the movie captures both the message and the mood of the book. The bleak rendering of District 12 is particularly effective, as is the excess of the Capitol. The vast majority of the casting is successful, particularly with Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. (The stunning depth and range of her performance far outweigh any qualms critics may have regarding her less-than-emaciated physique.) Donald Sutherland portrays President Snow as calm, calculated, and thoroughly venemous, and Woody Harrelson imbues Haymitch with both cynicism and vulnerability. Elizabeth Banks' Effie is appropriately clueless, and Willow Shields creates a fragile Prim that is easily believable as the beloved younger sibling for whom Katniss would give her life.<br /><br />The frantic point-of-view camera shots let the viewer experience the whole ordeal as Katniss does, first-hand and chaotic. The explicit depiction of her injuries, along with those of Peeta and the other tributes assures that the brutality of the games is never minimized. To the same end, the killings themselves are given proper weight by being graphic without being gruesome. The transition from Rue's death to the rioting in District 13 is poignant and compelling; it is only later in the book that this is implied as a catalyst, but to see it in \\"real time\\" allows the viewer to feel the outrage as it escalates and also to anticipate the impending rebellion. Another useful modification is the creation of the control room for the games; in the book, we are only provided with Katniss's speculations as to the game-makers' methods, but the cold and clinical setting shown in the movie emphasizes the disturbing disconnect between the manufactured arena and the very real horrors ocurringwithin it.<br /><br />Finally, the final scene where President Snow pivots away from the control room screen showing the triumphant homecoming of the victors and marches up the stairs reminds the viewer that the dangers are far from over for Katniss and Peeta, and indeed, for the entire nation of Panem.<br /><br />The DVD bonus features are well worth watching, particularly the segment where Donald Sutherland explains how he sees President Snow and his essential role in the film. It's also interesting to see how many of the stunts are done by the main actors themselves.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved these books. I was a little bit hesitatant at first because I had heard such mixed things about them but at the end of the day I fell in love with the characters, and the books themselves. It is definately graphic and wouldnt recommend it for anyone who cannot look past those parts and see the whole story line not just the sex scenes. I couldn't put any of them down!!!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|This thing is made out of decent plastic, and is generally put together pretty well. The UV pen is a really cool feature, and I've been writing secret messages on everything I can find.<br /><br />But here's the kicker. I was looking at the 11th Doctor's screwdriver, and lamenting at how this one doesn't do that cool springy pop-open move that Matt Smith's does. You know the thing.<br /><br />But it turns out, if you have good wrist control, this screwdriver has a secret feature. Hold it by the base near the textured part, flick your wrist juuuust right (use your whole arm and know that the nub WILL probably come loose), and your screwdriver extends just like it does in the show. Figuring out how to do this made the purchase COMPLETELY worth it, you have no idea.
B0031R5K72|5.0|A great book. Warms the heart and makes you cry. Loved the innovative perspective of looking at the war through the eyes of a little girl who wanted to read. Touches your heart in the end especially. One of the best fiction I have read in a couple years.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I must admit, I was skeptic about this band and their future when I heard \\"We Are Young,\\" but when we heard their concert at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Vegas (from our balcony), I was very impressed.  It's a great cd and would get five stars if they could keep their lyrics centered around something other than religion and the mockery thereof.  I find that part very disappointing.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|I started watching this show a few months ago because there was nothing on TV. I laugh the entire 22 minutes. I watched the entire series from season 1-7 in a week. This is a great show.
B005USZML4|5.0|Fun, easy read. Another good Grisham story. Have read the other two Theodore Boone stories and I enjoyed those as well.
B000002KB8|2.0|Songs out of order.  Songs stop in the middle of the CD sometimes.  This has just got to be a counterfeit item because the original has all the songs in order.  Sorry Charlie We only pick the finest tuna.
034580404X|5.0|WOW<br /> So sad that this story is over.  This was a wonderful story that everyone should read. Hope there will be more stories of Christian and Ana.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I would actually say about a 3 or 4 for the rating.  Overall the book kept my interest, but at times there was too much repetition of lines used and also \\"events\\".  I found myself skimming through parts.  It was interesting to see how the characters changed throughout the book;this kept my interest more than the sex parts.  Ana and Christian seemed to see the others perspective and try to understand why each behaved or acted the way they did.  I enjoyed the ending of Fifty Shades Freed so I was happy that I read all 3 books.  Sounds like there may be a 4th!
B001ADQXAM|5.0|I love scores by John Williams.  No doubt he is the best composer of all time.  I can't help listening to any of the soundtracks, including this one, done by him and imagining that I'm in the middle of the action.  Two thumbs up.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I was hooked after just a few pages.  Some very interesting characters.  A few twists and turns.  Holds your interest to the very end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|From the beginning of the book, I could not put it down.  I got so caught up in the plot that I wanted to keep reading to find out what was happening next.  Was totally unprepared for the ending, was quite a shock to what I was expecting.  Had to get the third book \\"Mockingjay\\" immediately!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|so convenient to tap your notification bar and automatically see the percentage of your battery life. its also great to know how much time you can spend on certain apps. oh,  and you can change the Color of the battery :)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a great game if you only need a distraction for a few minutes at a time.  Although you might be able to play longer during one turn, the problem will probably be that you want to play again and again.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is a great app for students. I myself a student find it easy to keep track of notes and homework with it and it is very convenient that evermore has the ability to share your notes with several devices.
B004M5HUXE|3.0|Some of the \\"intellectual\\" social commentary was boring, the broad English dialect was hard to figure out, but otherwise it was very good.
B0083VFEMW|5.0|They just keep making amazing albums. I mean a real full album experience, not two ok songs and a lot of filler, the whole thing functions together. Just awesome:)
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was great. It did veer off from the book a little though. Some missing parts are ok, but some of the things they changed will throw off the next two books(movies). But still a great movie and cant wait for catching fire to come out.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is just a feel good kind of story you know you're going to love from the start.  While the book can get a bit tedious during some of the mental meanderings, the sort is so wonderful you find yourself just reading past them to get to the sorts without much thought.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Along with Kasey Chambers, Ian Hunter has created some of the best rock and roll records of the past 10 years (not bad for a guy in his 70s!!)  He seems to get better with age!  All songs are wonderful and deserve repeated listening.  This album rocks harder than the last 2 and is all the better for it!!  I especially like Comfortable (Flyin' Scottsman), When I'm President, What For, Wild Bunch and Life.  He rocks with the best of them!  Is this guy in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame yet??  I sure hope so - he is one of a handful of legendary rock artists.  Thanks Ian and keep 'em comin'!  Here is a track by track rating with 10 being fabulous.<br /><br />1. Comfortable (Flyin' Scottsman) - 9<br />2. Fatally Flawed - 8<br />3. When I'm President - 9<br />4. What For - 9<br />5. Black Tears - 7<br />6. Saint - 9<br />7. Just The Way You Look Tonight - 9<br />8. Wild Bunch - 9<br />9. Ta Shunka Witco (Crazy Horse) - 8<br />10. I Don't Know What You Want  - 9<br />11. Life - 9<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B005USZML4|4.0|Another page turner by John Grisham. I would recommend \\"Theodore Boone: The Abduction\\" as well as the other Theodore Boone books by John Grisham even though there is some repetition.
B007MJSQSK|2.0|The movie was OK but the quality was subpar.  The movie kept stopping though-out the show making it almost unwatchable.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It is very relaxing with its untimed puzzles and soothing music combination. The graphics are gorgeous; subdued, yet detailed. I love it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I just enjoy this App along with  Bakery storey, Zoo story 2  and city story. With this app I have been able to design my own restaurant. It teaches which meals to prepare that will make you the most money so you can add more goodies to the design of your restaurant. Its a really cute  App.  I hope there are even more like this in the future. I probably spend way to much time playing with it,  but I cant help it. I definatly recomend this app. If you like virtual reality games this one is pretty cool.  You get to see all of your progress you have made. Its fun there are some people that have been at this for like ayear and a half. Its fun to see their progress that they have made. You can also make friends with this App.  And this App is  free. It doesnt get sny better than that.  So download the app and come and visit me.  the name of my restaurant is Lionesse.
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|I have a very good backgammon game on my iphone.  I thought I'd enjoy having one on my kindle fire because I use it so often, but the game offered for the kindle fire is nowhere near as good as the one on my iphone.  Too bad.  I play often and perhaps this would be ok for someone who was just learning, though.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Disreguarding the shady parts, this book is interestingly written and a very entertaing book to read.  I look forward to more about ana @ christian.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book could have been written in one third the pages.  I actually got bored with reading the same thing over and over.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|This movie is very well done, a true \\"artistic\\" endeavor and mostly clean. The acting is incredible. A must see!
B0044DEAUA|1.0|This bluetooth unit is a big dissapointment. The unit shuts off when it sits in the car during the day when heat gets to it. Clarity isn't great on both ends. Total waste of my money.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is a fun puzzle game that I am enjoying a great deal, but I need more words to describe how much.
B005J6LKVI|4.0|The movie was well written,well filmed and directed. The acting was good. The story line was different than i expected. It was a sad thing for these people to experience the hatred back then.
0152164154|4.0|If this review was just about the book itself it would have gotten all five stars! The book changed the way i looked at the world when i read it as a kid in english, and as i learned french i knew i had to have a copy in the original language!<br />i ordered it and it arrived surprisingly fast!<br />but sadly the cover was damaged and scraped up...<br />If you have never read the book before: BUY IT! READ IT! LOVE IT!<br />but if you have read it and simply want a collection piece then its a 'maybe'
B002T9H2L0|3.0|NOT ACCURATE OF THE ACTUAL EVENTS OF THE WAR. IT WAS SOMEBODYS FANTASY OF WHAT HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE  SEEN. THE GERMAN THAT PLAYED THE JEW HUNTER, WAS A DASTARDLY VILLAN.
B008KKTQKM|5.0|I stumbled across Porcupine Tree and am glad I did. I saw a review where they were said to be Pink Floyd fans so that earned a try for me, so far I've bought 3 of their cd's, all are excellent.
B0087SLR2W|3.0|This movie was not a fun to watch as the first one. Cuda was alot more beliveable in the first movie. He did not fit the role of them second movie. I was disapointed with the acting of the rest of the cast also.
B003UESJHE|5.0|The acting was very well done andd The truth of the story was pretty accurate. I enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter very much. I really did not like her in the harry potter series, but i did in this one.
0307472841|2.0|I've enjoyed the crime fiction of Jo Nesbo, Karen Fossum and Stieg Larssen. Henning Mankell is another popular Swedish crime writer and I chose the stand alone THE MAN FROM BEIJING as my first book by the author to read. I wanted to check out a book that wasn't part of a series and the idea of a murder that had roots in events centuries ago was quite interesting. However, after reading about 40% of the book, I decided not to continue.<br /><br />The book summary says:<br /><br />January 2006. In the Swedish hamlet of Hesj&ouml;vallen, nineteen people have been massacred. The only clue is a red ribbon found at the scene.<br /><br />Judge Birgitta Roslin has particular reason to be shocked: Her grandparents, the Andr&eacute;ns, are among the victims, and Birgitta soon learns that an Andr&eacute;n family in Nevada has also been murdered. She then discovers the nineteenth-century diary of an Andr&eacute;n ancestor--a gang master on the American transcontinental railway--that describes brutal treatment of Chinese slave workers. The police insist that only a lunatic could have committed the Hesj&ouml;vallen murders, but Birgitta is determined to uncover what she now suspects is a more complicated truth.<br /><br />The investigation leads to the highest echelons of power in present-day Beijing, and to Zimbabwe and Mozambique. But the narrative also takes us back 150 years into the depths of the slave trade between China and the United States.<br /><br />The first part of the novel occurred in 2006 with Judge Roslin investigating the mass homicide. The second part is one large telling of San, a Chinese immigrant who travels to the US, then back to China, and faces heartbreak that will last long after he is dead. While both sections of the book were interesting, the reviews I read promised nothing more. In fact they said that what is revealed in the opening of the book, such as who the villain is, is about all there is to the novel.<br /><br />The good news is that most reviewers said his other books are much better, so I guess I will try one of those.are much better, so I guess I will try one of those.
B0060ZJ74O|3.0|I dont understand why Brad Pitt got a academy award nomination for this thing, but it was a alright movie any way. it was historic and accurate as far as i know.  The brief moments of excitement were few and far between though.  I dont see the need for the daughter role in this movie. To me it was just filler space. The ball player doing the strip dance was choking for air during his speech, he was not very belivable. The dance was good but not the acting.
B008602KQI|5.0|I did not have high expectations for this movie, and was very pleasantly surprised to find a truly unique story, excellent actors, and a lot of fun and excitement.  This is a genre that was truly unexpected and I recommend it for all who appreciate a new kind of story, a good plot, and fun actors who are great to look at.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the entire trilogy within a week, which speaks to the exciting plot. This really works in the novels and has the reader gasping for more. For the negative aspects of the novel, firstly there is little character development (in both the novel and the trilogy). The characters are a bit two-dimensional. The book has such and interesting plot and premise, and there could be so much done with the characters in this story. However, almost all attempts fall a bit flat. Secondly, the writing is quite amateurish. I can tell the author was trying for complex writing, but at times it was laughable-- reminiscent of Yoda-speak. I still liked it, and would recommend it as a quick read, especially if you aren't looking for anything too complex. I wish I could rate it 3.5 stars.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really enjoy playing Where's My Perry along with my 4 year old son.  It teaches my son how to think through problems, a skill he will need for the rest of his life.
B008M34INW|2.0|Dont waist your time watching this Gibson movie, its no more than a crummy messcan 'Carter'. Crappy as hell, I am hoping for a refund- this movie sucked.
B007Q476KU|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie with our two boys, ages 10 and 13. We all felt it was a great movie. We would recommend it to anyone.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|You have to love the core beliefs of Harry and his humanity.  Once again Connelly  is able to pull off a surprise ending
B0043M4TYY|2.0|The  Lonely Planet and the Rough Guide series have been the gold standard of travel guides for me. I have purchased many guides over the past 20 years.  The Lonely Planet  Indonesia guide was the first one I bought  on the Kindle. Unfortunately, it is not optimized for the Kindle. The table of contents is not working, so you have to navigate by search. The  maps  render poorly, zooming is cumbersome.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am using the Holy Bible app on my Kindle Fire and it is an excellent app.  It works very well and is fast.  It is the best Bible reading plan app I have ever used.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a wonderful love story,Not all Smutty as I was informed when I bought it.<br />Two young People very much in Love!!!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I first walked into the theater, but as the story took hold, I was struck by the very real possibility of what we could be facing in just a short time here in our own country. We are faced with such destruction of the fabric of our freedoms, and this movie is a good snapshot of what it is to live under the conditions of tyrrany. It is a Godless and hopless society, and the only religion is a basic \\"worship\\" of the leadership, whose word is law, from whom life and death decisions are dropped like a used kleenex. The elitists have their usual opulence and surplus, and wave it in the face of those who produced it but cannot enjoy for themselves. The only hope portrayed there is revolution - to get out of the fenced, guarded territories and take back the land FOR THE PEOPLE. I can't help but make comparisons and draw parallels to our own world. I have watched this movie several times, and I am still struck by the same issues when I see it. The mindless masses following the leaders, the aloofness with which the tributes are disregarded - as they face certain death for \\"public\\" amusement...it is all part of the divide that exists when the 'high' are TOO HIGH and the low are hardly more than slaves, whose very existence can be snuffed at the whim of a higher level entity. A job is not what YOU might want to do, but what the STATE tells you IT NEEDS. Every person's economy is directly linked to those around them, and having enough food to live on is illegal since that would mean somehow getting something MORE than what the STATE allowed.I can't just say \\"this is only a movie\\", because it is all not fairy tales and imaginary monsters. Once you get it, you can never forget it, and everything you see going on around you is not the same anymore. Well done movie, very real storyline, and one can't help but wonder what the future really holds.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I like to know that i am being protected when i am using my tablet. Security is my first choice, that is why i chose Avast. Thank you.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie, that I saw first in the movie theater is a great movie. New ideas in the drama, a lot of adventures and new ideas in the handling of the actors and actresses. There is always a lot of intrigue and difficult tasks, but the problem solving comes quiet natural, despite that the movie handles quiet some science fiction.<br />I am happy that there will be some more Hunger Games 2 and most probably more sequences. It a great story.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a great game. Im so happy us android lovers can now have it on our devises.  Thank you
B0088X7YMS|2.0|I'm sorry, but I can't identify with or appreciate animated humans.  After the first three movies by this name I never expected this DVD to be animation.<br /><br />I found it impossible to identify with the characters as people.  This created<br />a lack of empathy for any of their situations.  Real actors allow you to be able to identify with the character and the dangers and emotions they face.  Animation is extremely shallow in that respect.<br /><br />Along with that, the body armor made the soldiers look somewhat like the bugs they were trying to kill.  The horror, of their injury or death by bug inflicted violence as shown in the first three films, was absent.  I like to watch a movie to get into the plot and the actions and emotions of the characters.  This type of presentation does not lend easily to identification with that depth of viewing.<br /><br />As the film progressed I easily understood the plot and events as they unfolded, but at a mildly amused level.  The attempt at nudity  appeared at about the level of a Barbie doll and it was overdone at that.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first of this series the most, as it developed the real relationships of a human element.  This last work traveled far from human reality.<br /><br />I realize movies are made this way because their is a market for this type of work.  I however, would like to see the big word \\"ANIMATION\\" via CG Technology, written across the front of the DVD box.  Then I would not make the mistake of  buying this type of production ever again.
B007C9N4H8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie soooo much more than filling out this review.  20 words?  How is \\"Fun Movie\\" not an adequate review?  I think I'll go and watch the movie again to put a smile back on my face.  Thanks Amazon.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|This movie lived up to the hype and was a great adaptation from the book!  I loved every minute!  The emotion was raw and the violence was realistic without being to much.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great read, wasn't ready for the turn of events but definitely kept me interested till the end with a very surprising ending as well...
B004XISI4A|5.0|Much anticipated sequel to the first four books. I could not put it down. Great read and great depth of characters. Can't wait for the next one!

B0009P5YXO|2.0|I was surprised by the flimsiness of this product.  It's solidly constructed from genuine cheap plastic parts (excluding the necessary metal for the battery pack)  After opening the package the slide button immediately popped off.  This is supposed to come loose to allow access to the screw that opens the battery case.  However it is always loose and ready to pop off.  Lifting my thumb off the button is often enough to pull it loose.<br /><br />The 'two distinct sounds' are barely discernible from each other even in a completely silent room.  Press button once for sound one and again for a minutely different sound.<br /><br />The little UV light works perfectly.<br /><br />My sonic arrived with one working pen nib (the ink pen) and one dry pen nib (the UV pen) I can only assume this toy has been sitting in a warm place for a very long time because the UV pen nib was sealed in factory shrink wrap but was still bone dry when it arrived.<br />The suggested 'fix' for this is either add water to the nib. (we all know how well that works) or buy a new one. (oh, I see)<br /><br />The batteries are easily installed but you will need a very small screwdriver to do so.  (an actual screwdriver) Which is kind of funny when you think about it.<br /><br />This toy is cute, it's fun to have, but I wouldn't purchase this for anyone under the age of 13.  It's simply too delicate to survive any serious 'play'.  It's a little overpriced for a novelty pen even if it is in the shape of a sonic.

0061726834|3.0|Using a friend's account<br /><br />*Spolier-free review*<br />by Moslimah<br /><br />In a dystopian world, love is a disease. Scientists have finally found a way to eradicate love, and the government demands that all its citizens receive the cure upon turning eighteen. With the cure, a person is able to live a life without pain; one that is safe, measured, predictable and happy. Lena Haloway has been looking forward to being cured but as she approaches her eighteenth birthday the unthinkable happens. She falls in love.<br /><br />I was not blown away by this book but neither was I completely disappointed. The idea of love being a disease that needs to be eradicated is intriguing and worked well in this book. I think the reason I found it so compelling is that, at some times it mirrored Islam's view on premarital relationships. Of course, Islam does not seek to eradicate love, however, it prohibits mingling with the opposite sex, other than what is needed for married and unmarried people. So the rules in DELIRIUM of no touching, kissing or excessive talking is the same for Muslims. However, despite the appeal, I have some issues with this book.<br /><br />I truly believe that DELIRIUM (400+ pages) could have been two thirds the size it was and not have taken away from the story. I agree with many other readers that the author's writing is wonderful and at times, almost poetic. However, it was overly descriptive for my taste and could have been cut down significantly. Also, I could say that there were exactly three moments where the book became exciting for about ten pages and then went back to trudging along.<br /><br />Another issue is that Lena seems to make decisions out of nowhere. In certain parts of the book, she is so determined that the government's rules are right and good, which is why I was confused when, the next second, she does the exact opposite to what she believed in. it didn't seem believable to me.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that the author made lying okay, if it was for love. Lena quickly fell into the habit of lying. Lying is never okay and putting this idea in the book may comfort teenagers into thinking that they can lie because they're in love.<br /><br />When Lena does the unthinkable, and falls in `love' with Alex, I was not so thrilled about how absolutely crazy he made her. There is a big difference between love and infatuation and to me, Lena seemed infatuated rather than in love. True love is not meant to make you addicted or make you lose your sanity. Rather, it is meant to be something that is wholesome and beautiful. On the same topic, I found that the dialogue, especially that between Alex and Lena fell flat and was even clich&eacute;d and roll-your-eyes worthy.<br /><br />I will still be reading PANDEMONIUM, book two in the trilogy, in hope that there will be more action less roll-your-eye moments.hor made lying okay, if it was for love.

0439023513|2.0|***Warning--major spoilers ahead...<br /><br />Upon finishing Mockingjay, I concluded two things: 1) this trilogy is a tragedy, and 2) Suzanne Collins believes executing a character arc is as simple as executing the character.  Here's why:<br /><br />Finnick: Shortly after his wedding, Finnick--one of the few characters who is actually somewhat developed throughout the story--is eaten by lizard monsters on a mission that was ultimately completely and utterly futile.  His sacrifice (if it can be called that) meant very little, if anything, to the story.<br /><br />Prim: The entire plot of the trilogy centered on the attempt to keep her alive, and she is killed in a random bombing at the end, as Katniss watches from a few feet away.  The entire plot of the story hinged on saving Prim from the evils of the age, and that battle is lost in a very grim way.  Katniss did not need her heart ripped out in this way to make the decision she made at the end.  This was an extra knife in the gut from an author who enjoyed bitter ends for key characters.<br /><br />Peeta: Though a large portion of the first book sets up Peeta and Katniss for a deep relationship, that relationship is largely ignored throughout the entire second and third books in favor of a shallow coexistence.  Peeta instead becomes a sort of zombie trying to kill Katniss, and never quite recovers; this leeches from Peeta his most valuable quality, which was his commitment to keeping Katniss alive.  Sure, he saves her at the end with his miraculous appearance at Katniss' attempted suicide, but without others' prior interventions, he would have already killed her on multiple occasions.  It seems as though nothing between his capture at the end of the second book and his appearance at the assassination at the end was either necessary or supportive of the plot.  He's tossed in at the end for a happily-ever-after that is anything but happy.  He deserved more and better--from the author as well as Katniss.<br /><br />Gale: This is perhaps the most tragic of treatments.  Gale's death would have preserved his character, but instead, Collins assassinates his character rather than taking his life.  In the last few pages, I was waiting and wondering how Katniss' first and oldest friend would make his return and begin the impossible task of making up for his role in Prim's death.  Instead, the reader is robbed of any closure beyond their insufficient parting at the Capitol.  The person who had vowed to protect Prim and had been there for Katniss--usually behind the scenes for the length of the trilogy--had failed in the most ironic of fashions and finally gave up on the Everdeens in the end.  He'd taken some job in another district, and the reader is left to assume that he and Katniss' relationship had died with Prim.  This isn't characteristic of Gale as we'd come to know him.  Had he died nobly at the end, perhaps to once again protect Prim, that would have stayed much truer to his character.  In my opinion, Collins certainly did not complete his character arc successfully, and traded plot for shock.<br /><br />Katniss: In the third book, it becomes more obvious with every page that Katniss' story is a full-on tragedy.  The reader loses a great deal of sympathy for her as she stops caring about those around her, and in her pusuit of killing Snow, she begins to kill civilians in the capitol.  3/4 of the way through Mockingjay, I found myself wondering why I was supposed to be rooting for Katniss anymore.  Her character degrades into little more than a tool of the revolution, without any kind of motivation beyond vengeance.  The entire push toward the capitol is a totally futile errand that accomplishes nothing but death; all those Katniss loves are either killed or broken along the way.  In the final pages, the reader is left with a smoldering ruin of a cast and story, with only a glimpse of future hope for something better.  Unfortunately, I didn't grow to care much for the namelessfaces of Panem's future; I cared for the characters of these three books.<br /><br />Make no mistake--I enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy, and Mockingjay was an engrossing read that kept my attention.  I didn't expect hugs and rainbows at the end, but in any form of literature, the reader can only hope that the characters' existence had a good purpose and a satisfying end in the fictional world in which so much time has been spent.  Viewed as a larger story, I don't think Collins told a satisfying tale.  Whether or not that was her intention, I'm not sure, but as a reader, I felt her treatment (or perhaps more accurately, her disposal) of many of these characters was ultimately disappointing.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like that each game has so many tiles, but I wish that at the end, if I can't win a game, it would tell me I've lost (instead of shuffling the remaining tiles so that there is no losing). I bet that lots of players like this, but I'd rather have the option to start over and actually win a game. Other than that, great fun with LOTS of games! Great way to spend a few free minutes each day.

I think Violator, Music for the Masses, and the underrated Broken Frame are Depeche Mode's best work. But again i would recommend any of thier albums

I bought the DVD because someone told me it was a \\"must-own\\" type of show. Perhaps my expectations were too great, but The Hunger Games failed to deliver in my opinion. I'll read the book. I know it deserves the hype.
0143115014|5.0|ah, Turin...you dog.  Sanchez....now you get the differences in how people interpret scents/fragrances.<br /><br />Specifically, I think Polo Blue is more 3 star than 1 that Turin gives it; and YSL L'homme is definitely a 4 star instead of the 2 that Turin also rated.<br /><br />However, this is essential to anyone who collects or likes to use fragrances regularly.  Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book due to rave reviews, like I bought the whole Harry Potter series, and the Twilight, New Moon, and Breaking Dawn books.  Those are keepers.  I was disappointed in the content of Fifty Shades, too repetitive, childlike, some of my \\"mature\\" friends loved the sexy content, but if you have or had a healthy, satisfying sex life, you don't need this book. If you like the 50 cent romance books, go for it.  If you like a good, satisfying read that tickles your intellect, forget it.
B0086QS7N2|1.0|The vocals are the weakest link in this chain of overproduced mush.  It's so polished it just slides in one ear and out the other.  Not one song stands out; not one memorable riff, hook or chorus.  Geddy Lee sounds tired and worn out with nothing interesting to sing about.<br /><br />On the plus side, I do like getting the digital booklet with the MP3 download.  I think that should be standard with all MP3 album purchases.
0451228375|3.0|I just finished \\"World Without End\\" and boy does my head hurt. It was definitely a struggle the last 300-400 pages. I think I quickly began to hate it in a way. That was why it got three stars. It's neutral, I don't know if I hated it or liked it. Three is neautral, it's Switzerland.<br /><br />The book started good enough and I was excited to read it, choosing this time mostly because I found out that the book was going to be shown as a tv series in October. Well, I'd better read this, just as I did for \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" then watching the show. Both were very good, the book a little more so than the book, now I'm praying the new show is so much better than the book.<br /><br />Though the story started out well enough, it soon dragged me down with many boring points that stalled the plot and got no where. I had to put it aside a few times to read something else, and that rarely happens with me. I got sick of all the repetitive scenes with the numerous characters, all their stupid inner thoughts and useless conversations with others.<br /><br />I also couldn't help but think that \\"World Without End\\" was too similar to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". It was same old characters reincarnated two hundred years later with new names. There was the poorer young man with little hope of succeeding in the world, loving the beautiful young woman above his status (Jack and Aliena then Merthin and Caris). William Hamleigh and Ralph Fitzgerald are quite similar, both being cruel, heartless men that become great lords of the land. Waleran Bigod and Godwyn are cruel priests that also rise to greatness on the backs of the less fortunate. Regan Hamleigh and Petranilla are the evil women that will stop at nothing to see their sons succeed. Then there is the plot itself, the town of Kingsbridge and some of the people in it are tied to a secret involving the royal family. Don't think I'll give this book another glance again. I'll probably be satisfied with the show when it comes out next month. Thank goodness the first book does not need this one to continue anything important.

B004OEIL54|3.0|The SCREAM Blu-Ray is an overall solid HD upconvert of the original DVD: all the special features are transplanted, as well as original commentary. However, as upconverts go, it's pretty sweet, but the tradeoff is that the clarity of the transfer really accentuates the image problems (NONE of which have anything to do with the transfer itself).<br /><br />For starters, the film is finally presented in its original anamorphic aspect ratio, but this comes with a price. Considering that the film was shot on practical locations instead of sets, anamorphic may not have been the best format choice: the close quarters of real buildings really emphasize the \\"squeeze\\" effect at the edges of the frame in kitchens or narrow hallways. Original DP Mark Irwin was allegedly fired because of severe focus problems in dailies and I tend to believe it: there are glaring focus problems in the last 2 reels, and the wide-angle shots (10-12mm) have the depth of field of a medium (50mm) lens. I was surprised at how just HOW diverse the focus was throughout most of the shots and wondered why they didn't reshoot entire sequences because of it.<br /><br />The film's age also tends to show in the color representation. Cheap film stocks of the 90s used by indie filmmakers and Dimension films were prone to displaying dirt damage and luminance source with the same crispness as the picture so this can be a tad intrusive compared to single-generation master transfers of today, but at least they feel natural rather than a sign of poor maintenance. The color, however, is well-represented: it's not flat, faded, or washed, just a tad uninteresting.<br /><br />There IS a bit of pixellation in the blacks and darks, but fortunately they blend well with the natural film grain of the image, so it's very hard to tell which is which. And YES, I was looking for this deliberately. Some have complained of haloing towards the later part of the film but it didn't seem to bother me all that much considering that this is an HD transfer of a 16-year-old movie and not a full-blown JAWS/GODFATHER restoration.<br /><br />The soundtrack has already been listed in greater detail by others, but I agree: the sound is surprisingly stellar, even overbearing at times with how much detail is in the foley track.<br /><br />All in all, the Blu-Ray is a nice package for fans of the film or those nostalgic for the theatrical experience of 1996. For a film that hasn't undergone any restoration work, it's still in pretty good condition. It's not worth a $20 tag, but for $10-12 it's a welcome addition to the library.<br /><br />I paid $10 for it and don't regret it at all.is is an HD transfer of a 16-year-old movie and not a full-blown JAWS/GODFATHER restoration.<br /><br />The soundtrack has already been listed in greater detail by others, but I agree: the sound is surprisingly stellar, even overbearing at times with how much detail is in the foley track.<br /><br />All in all, the Blu-Ray is a nice package for fans of the film or those nostalgic for the theatrical experience of 1996.

1607886197|3.0|Nicholas Sparks is a chick-lit Hercules.<br />  Half-man, half-God, he was sent from Mount Olympus to make us mere mortal women weep with grief, happiness, love, and loss. Only through the power of Zeus could a male uncover the wants and desires of women everywhere to produce such tearjerker books like Dear John and The Notebook. Divine grace is the only explanation for the almost $700 million dollars his books-turned-movies have made worldwide.<br />  You think that by now Sparks would run out of ideas, but don't worry, love never gets old. In his newest novel, Safe Haven, Sparks finds a way to somehow keep the readers interested 16 books (and similar storylines) later.<br />  Mysterious newcomer Katie stars as the book's heroine. Her sudden arrival into the small town of Southport, North Carolina, sets the gossip mill turning. She doesn't try to make friends, she keeps to herself and she doesn't offer any details of her past life. As she begins to grow close with the caring widower Alex, the opportunity of a bright future presents itself--one free of fear, pain, and darkness. Although she wants her future to be with Alex, her past may come back to haunt her, bringing danger to her safe haven, Southport.<br />  During my long commute to work twice a day, I needed something to keep me interested during the drive. While I was scrolling through the audiobooks on iTunes, the author's name caught my eye.  So I listened, my expectations sagging lower than Justin Bieber's pants. I felt somewhat out of place listening to a chick-lit beach book in my car, but as the story developed, I found myself listening to it in more places than just my front seat. I'd put in my headphones and go for a jog; I'd open up my computer at night to listen and relax before I fell asleep. Despite my wishes of only using Safe Haven as a radio-replacement, I wanted more. I was actually interested.<br />  Rebecca Lowman narrates the audiobook. Her soothing tone and many accents help distinguish the characters, making it always easy to know who is talking to whom. I've listened to a couple of audiobooks before, but Lowman's character development trumped the rest that I have listened to.<br />Sparks' most recent novel is slightly different than his previous ones. Sure, the theme of love is ever-present, but it does not rule the storyline. I was more enthralled by Katie's past than whether or not she was getting asked out on a date. But although this book kept me interested, it was very easy to predict. I saw the twist at the end coming from the third chapter. Its simple plot lines and familiar characters allowed me to not have to intensely follow along with Lowman's reading. If I needed to make a short phone call in the car, I could just tune back in after I was done without feeling lost or confused.<br />  Safe Haven certainly would not be classified in the Literature category next to Austen or Dante, but it did serve its purpose: to pass time.

B006TF6WAM|4.0|What attracts me to books like The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is what I like to think of as their inherent quietness. Devoid of grand adventures and `epic-ness', these books tell stories of essentially the ordinary man and woman of the world. Harold and Maureen could be any old couple with a past. The issues they grapple with - loneliness, alienation from one another, coming to grips with their past actions - are recurring themes in all our lives.<br /><br />One fine day Harold Fry, a 65 year old retired salesman gets a letter from a co-worker he has not been in touch with in the last 20 years. On his way to post his reply, a fateful encounter plants in his mind the idea of delivering the letter himself, spurring his 500 miles journey across England from Kingsbridge to Berwick-upon-Tweed.<br /><br />The bulk of the book deals with Harold's journey, both literal and metaphorical. He re-visits memories he thought he'd long forgotten. He meets an entire cast of characters whose stories bring home to him the universality of the human experience. As Harold puts one foot in front of the other to reach Berwick-upon-Tweed, he begins to find an acceptance of his past - the one which was inflicted on him by his parents and the one which he thinks he inflicted on his son. Meanwhile, Harold's unlikely journey forces Maureen to step out of the world she's cocooned herself in, forcing her to see her husband in a new light.<br /><br />The prose is beautiful with some gorgeous descriptions of the English countryside. However, I did find some of Harold's encounters manufactured and a little out of the realm of the believable. A few of the `entourage' scenes seemed unnecessarily drawn-out - I wanted to tell Rachel Joyce that yes we understand that Harold is the quintessential English gentleman and that there is no need to belabor the point.<br /><br />While I enjoyed Harold's and Maureen's story I could not make myself love it the way I loved Major Pettigrew's Last Stand and The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society, two other books in the same vein. Perhaps this is because while hopeful, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry lacks the ebullience of the other two. (Though honesty compels me to add that this of course cannot be an indictment of the story itself - more than likely Miss Joyce intended it to be so). In any case if you don't mind quiet contemplative fares where the story is more character driven than plot driven you'll enjoy this one.

Some levels can get pretty challenging and when you find a solution you are thinking, \\"Why did I think of that earlier?\\" But that is part of the fun!<br /><br />If you like challenging and fun mind games then I highly suggest picking this up.

You do have to do a little thinking ahead to do well in this game, but I love its originality and how much fun it is to play and progress.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I'm still reading this but it's a wonderful novel about the wonder of novels, adolescence, history, fear, sexuality, and the scary things that never go away.  I love it!
B0061S0A64|5.0|It doesn't take long to get in there and have music that you've created playing on your mobile device. It is simple and intuitive and the more you use the app the better you get at producing the type of music you want to. I had to go through some trial and error before I felt like I got exactly what I was trying to create.<br /><br />If you are the creative type who enjoys making things like music then I highly suggest picking this app up. It is a lot of fun and you'll love creating music with it.
B001AOKA3W|5.0|Good sci-fi scary movie are hard to come by, this is one of them. This movie has a good take on the cam view of shooting a movie with a good mix of current day things that scare us including modern Godzilla type monsters and an apocolyptic disaster theme.  Set the bar for other movie makers to copy.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game, along with the original Quell, are both very addictive. The graphics are simple, but yet beautiful. The game itself is fun and challenging.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!!! Master mystery writer!! I love all the twists and turns.. not sure I wa too crazy about the ending.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great game that will challenge and entertain you for a long time. You are given clues as to which boxes to fill in and you end up making some nice shapes or letters or something. It doesn't take long to figure out how to play it and I found it a lot of fun to play. I might argue that the $5 was a little steep but it does give you a lot of puzzles to play with. It only took me a couple of hours to beat so I hope they provide more levels in the future.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book extended the story line of the first two books.  It was exciting with lots of good twist and turns. In addition I learned a lot about the social and legal system of another country.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|It is a hidden object game. Easy to play, moves pretty quickly, and I really like the graphics. Not much to it really, but it is free and well worth the time I spent downloading and playing around on it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|My opinion....I've read better...It's not as good as I expected... It's boring, I can't go pass a couple of pages at a time.  I'm going to finish it because I paid for it....
B00634GHJA|5.0|I find attaching it to my computer via USB cable to be faster, but this app does do exactly what it says so I'm not going to knock stars just because there are other ways to skin a cat. This isn't for me, but I can see its uses. It is easy to use once you get used to it, I did find there was a bit of a learning curve there but it wasn't too steep. I'm not going to keep it as I more prefer USB and dropbox, but if those two aren't an option for you then this should be considered.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|I read this book because I was interested, but it really left a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Matt Bissonnette, aka Mark Owen, makes many claims that he's 'setting the record straight' and that others have taken too much credit for this mission, but his point narrow and naive, consisting of second-guessing the entire chain of command as though he has a better grasp on the geo-political ramifications of invading a sovereign country and essentially assassinating terrorists than policy makers do. (I'm all for this by the way but it is hubris to think that you know enough to make these decisions from street-level.) The feeling that this gave me is the same that you get when a child is telling you that 'they know' already.<br /><br />The book itself is pretty straight-forward and a very simple read, brushing through a number of deployments but without any real detail. The best description of the writing would probably be 'mediocre', reading something like a big-print novel with descriptions of 'what' happened but without any depth or descriptive detail. It reminded me quite a bit of a 'Lassie' novel with that same kind of generalization and descriptiveness.<br /><br />I think that the challenges that others have with the author are right on the mark. The author, who I greatly admire for his service as a SEAL, has broken trust with everything that he fought for. His team and commanders should have received more respect.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|This is an easy one to figure out how to play. Just one button!! I wish more games were like this. You manipulate the direction of a ball by tapping the screen and shooting the ball in different directions. It is easy to learn, fun, and challenging. Surprised it is so large since the graphics are pretty simple, but since it gives you the engine to make your own levels that might have something to do with it. Pretty fun and worth the dollar they are asking for!
B0011XBLUS|5.0|An early Clint Eastwood that is clever, entertaining, funny, at times violent and also dreary, as the Civil War is going on.  What more could you want in a movie?  If you are a Clint Eastwood fan this is a must-see movie.  Lee Van Cleef (sp?) has the best eyes for a bad guy.  He is gripping.  The movie is worth watching just for his performance.  And the ugly little guy is just hopeless.  Guess who the good guy is?  If you have to see one Western, this might be it...although \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" runs close.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I didn't expect much when picking up this game. But it is a game of golf with stickmen and a host of physics. This actually gets challenging, often times more challenging than real golf (without the need to rent a cart). I rarely support games that are more than a dollar, but this is one of those exceptions. Well programmed, a lot of fun, challenging, and the gameplay doesn't get old quickly. There are a ton of challenging courses to go through. I haven't had this much challenging fun since I first picked up Angry Birds.
B00633W614|4.0|Excellent read but one you must keep up with since there are so many moving characters.  The ending was disappointing.
B004LZF2LW|5.0|This is great for people keeping an eye on different world times. For me, I'm a news junkie and often like to follow press conferences taking place in different time zones. So whether it happens on the west coat, east coast, or even Europe I can set my alarm for the right time and be ready for watching the news when it is still live. Very useful!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have a Samsung Galaxy S II that runs on ICS. This app will not work for me. When I click on a book it closes the application.
0307236722|5.0|The information and formulas are very good and will help even the most experienced baker/cook to perfect techniques and overall appreciation for homemade.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This app is very addictive and fun! the levels are challenging without being impossibly complicated. Love playing it! I made sure my husband has it too do we can compare notes. :-)
B008C20TDG|5.0|Well actually 'do' do what I did just not how I did it! Should you buy this book if you want a straight forward way to understand why you continually over eat, make bad food choices and how to change those behaviors? Yes. Should you buy the eBook at 9pm and stay up until 2am reading it cover to cover? Probably not given the impact that is going to have on the various hormones (cortisol, leptin, etc.) that are already out of whack in your body.<br /><br />Everything in this book is simple, straight forward and makes sense. It is not about being 'paleo', it is about learning which foods make you healthy and which foods don't.<br /><br />I have spent the last 2 years trying to CrossFit (exercise) away 42 years of poor eating habits. It ain't working. I'm stronger, slightly less fat and probably a bit fitter than I was 2 years ago. However, I'm still 40lbs over weight, I've plateaued on my fitness and my sleep is still 7 hours of tossing and turning. But armed with the knowledge in this book I now know why I can't exercise and still eat junk, I know why I crave frakenfood and I know how to start fixing it.<br /><br />Thank you Melissa and Dallas.
B004PLWGVG|5.0|Can't stop listening; such an amazing voice on her. Deffinetly worth buying - you won't regret this purchase I promise.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you are a reader you will enjoy The Hunger Games triology, after you read all three books you can really relate to the movie. I hope that the author produces some more books in this category. Be aware that once you start to read you will be so immersed in the story that it is hard to stop. This story about a time in the future when society has regressed back to semi roman times with human sacirifices to satisfy a power mad government.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|Love, love this book.  Perhaps God put it in front of me at the correct time!  Her writing style is like talking to your best friend.  I can so relate to the things she is experiencing.  Will definitely read more of her work!
B000SEGEKI|5.0|I first picked up this book 11 years ago.  As a software developer, I still reference ideas from it. DRY and YAGNI are obscure phrases for solid concepts that we must deal with.<br /><br />--Wes
B001NAT07A|5.0|I has a good message that you may think you are ordinary; but in some way we are all extrodinary!! Sometimes you have to take a deep breath and get out of your comfort zone to know what you can accomplish.<br />And...very entertaining and lots of action.
B007SGM084|2.0|There are some steamy sex scenes in these books, which is what drives their popularity.  Overall, though, I found the writing style to be limited.  The main character does a lot of swooning and repetitive thinking that I found to be very tedious.  The writing actually reminded me of the Twilight series.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is the best game I ever played!!!!! if they made a another game like this a would played it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent and fast pace novel with historical facts. I wonder what happened to Lev and Olga at the end. Did I missed? You will love it.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|My husband and i are huge dexter fans. this season does not let you down. it has all of the elements we love about the show.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app makes it SO much easier to pin to my boards!! Great app! &amp; best of all its FREE:)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its like the original super Mario! I am addicted! if you are a child of the eighties you will love this. but kids like it too... my little cousin is the one who showed it to me!
B000001DQI|5.0|Sit down and hold tight when you listen to this AMAZING re-master. You will be blown out of your seat.<br />Grabs you like the Mobile Fidelity version of Dark Side after the screams in the first minute of Breathe...<br /><br />Side 3, my ATF, comes to life more than ever. Sweet Painted Lady will hook you in and you MUST listen<br />to the rest. Dailey and Dirty Little Girl are both incredible. The guitars on All The Girls...are awesome.<br /><br />We all know sides 1 and 4 are classic.<br /><br />GREAT JOB on this re-master. Ear candy to the max....fer sher!
B0086700CM|4.0|My 9 year old niece plays the game and she loves it!!!!  Has great graphics and makes your stomach flip flop going up and down over and around.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game. was looking for an interesting game for my husband. he likes the games that make you think,  he loves it. thanks.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Overall I liked the book.  However, it took me 30% of the way (I read it on the kindle and not sure what page) for something to actually happen that sparked my interest.  I didn't see what the hype was about until then.  I didn't love the way it ended but that's because it didn't wrap up into a neat little bow.  Some people may like that type of ending but I didn't find it satisfying.
B002WBZD02|5.0|Get Shorty is one of my personal favorites.  Great dialogue, cast and soundtrack!!  And it's fun to see Tony Soprano in a role other than a mob boss!
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Ok movie, worth your time if your bored with nothing else to do for an hour. The book is much better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Honestly I'm not too much of a reader, but after hearing so many people talk about this book. I thought I would give it a read. I couldn't put it down. I'm half way through the second book and will definitely be reading the 3rd :)Ladies it's a must read!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I was so surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.  I could not put it down and am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B002M87V0A|5.0|Have always loved this musical.  It is timeless for all ages to enjoy over and over.  Can't recall how many times we've watched it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Good, good, good. A great story. Just wish that they would let both books out at the same time I hate waiting till October to finish. But worth it.
0143034901|5.0|I finished this book from the halfway point in one night, that's how enthralled I was with it.  The writing is terrific...the story is great...the characters, including Barcelona, pop out of the book as if they're projected in front of you on the big screen. Excellent job, Carlos.
B001CP4VNE|4.0|I will keep it short and sweet. The Second installment of the Tim Burton Batman series, (which ironically was the last of the Tim Burton series) was a lot darker, more graphic in it's depiction of Batman/Bruce Wayne. The addition of The Penguin and Cat Woman also added a new, darker element to the Larger Than Life Scaling of Tim Burton's Gotham City.<br />The only thing a bit campy was Christopher Walken's Max Shrek...(trying not to say Donkey) character. I thought he was a bit contrived. All in all, the movie is worth having for any Batman fan. I would stay away from the Joel Schumacer series. Way too colorful and overdone. I would say this is an excellent movie and divergence from the normal Superhero movies. It may not match up to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, but it stands pretty strong on it's own two feet-or Wings.<br />I hope this helps. Batman Returns was worth the price and the time to watch over and over again.
B00846REIS|5.0|I'm a fan of the Fifty Shades of Grey series and am now a fan of Crossfire!  It's 50 Shades without the dominant/submissive story line!  Love, love, love it!!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|An amazing version of Sherlock Holmes.  Everyone should watch it.  The writing brilliance of Steven Moffat (Doctor Who, The Adventures of Tin Tin) is not to be missed.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Five stars from me for this book. The book is about his life, how he has built his business, what it takes to be a winner etc. etc. I highly recommend it everyone.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I loved this book even more than the first couldn't put it down, had to run out and buy the next one immediately. I would read them all again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" by Gillian Flynn is not a bad book.  However, it does not live up to its promise in my opinion.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn sets up what could be an interesting narrative structure - the alternating voices of Nick and Amy Dun.  A married couple, Amy, a \\"trust-fund kid\\" raised by her doting parents in New York, disappears on their fifth wedding anniversary.  Nick, an out-of-work writer forced to buy a bar in order to make ends meet, becomes the police's prime suspect. You know Nick is not a \\"straight shooter.\\" He has a pre-paid cell going off all through the early days of the investigation, which he ignores.  And she comes across as the perfectly \\"Amazing Amy.\\"<br /><br />Going further would be delving into spoiler land. So I'll stop.<br /><br />But the structure is not enough to hold you. Unfortunately, Flynn relies heavily on sterotypes to populate the novel.  Here are a few: A TV crime reporter who spouts off, convicting people on cable;  A high priced lawyer name Tanner Bolt, who specializes in getting high-profile clients off gets involved; The empathetic \\"real\\" reporter; The ugly, competent female who is  in Nick's corner from the get-go; A couple of oblivious, self-absorbed Boomer parents.<br /><br />And every stock character behaves exactly as you think they will. Even, unfortunately, the main characters. In fact, I found no character with any believable depth.<br /><br />Of course, this is a mystery thriller, and I give genre writers a bit of lee-way. In mysteries, I love cleaver plot-twists. However, I had the major \\"twists\\" figured out about fifty pages in...  [no spoilers, so I deleted the text here]. So even the suspense was pedestrian.<br /><br />Criticisms aside, though, Flynn is a very clear writer. Even though I had the twists figured out early on, and found the characters cartoonish, her narrative pulse led me on. And likely why the book has been a chart-topper for so long. Moreover, I really enjoy mystery/ suspense, and turn to it becauseI love watching people get their just deserts. However, when a sociopath meets a weak-willed narcissist...<br /><br />I'd say more, but no spoilers makes me stay my tongue.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Some books help you understand the world better. This is one of them.  It has influenced the way I plan my day.<br /><br />The Book was entertaining as well as informative.  My favorite book of the year.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I have tried other calendars, but this is the one that provides the highest level of organization. The ability to set the specific modes &amp; details enhances the<br />overall effectiveness of the calendar.
B000FC11A6|5.0|I'm loving every page of this novel. I only wish I had come across it when it first came out
B008602KQI|5.0|[[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]<br /><br />I've read all the Hunger Games books and was nervous about the movie version.  After seeing who was picked to play the male roles, I was very concerned they wouldn't match up with the characters in the book.  To my delight, the movie version stayed very true to the book and the 2 hr and 23 min movie seemed to pass in the blink of an eye.  Also a good sign that I'm immersed in the action. Excited to see the next film. Hope the wait is worth it.
B008BO61BE|5.0|For those of you interested in the remastered cd, there's ZERO doubt that the older CK version is much better.  I think anyone who compares the two would agree.  The new remaster, which I'm guessing is the same version as the recent remastering of the whole Priest catalog, has no warmth, screeches and misses all of the subtlety (I know strange word when talking about Priest) of the original. You can hear the difference right at the beginning of Riding on the Wind\\".  The drums on the older version have that richness we all love.  The newer remaster is scratchy and lacks punch... BUT... THE DVD IS AMAZING!  To see Priest in 1983 rocking in the California foothills will take you back to that place you were a long time ago.  I was 17 and saw them on that tour.  Halford's voice is stunning and the mix is great.  Back then I had a British Steel silk screen, all the previous albums and went out the day it was released to buy Screaming For Vengeance.  The second my friend Phil and I put it on the turntable we knew Priest had outdone themselves.  The live set on this release is worth it.  Buy this.... Be disappointed by the cd and find an early version but LOVE THE DVD!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|do not want to write a review, read the book and I did enjoy it. would like to read other books by this author.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|very interesting and factual, providing information on how the Iraq war effects wife's children and families of men fighting there.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I bought this case for my mother who recently got a kindle fire for her birthday. The outside of the case has a nice leather feel. What we really enjoy is the ability to prop the kindle in 2 different positions- one for typing, one for watching videos or comfortable playing a game.<br /><br />The price is right and the quality is GOOD. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, inexpensive case.
0307744434|3.0|Some really interesting elements to this book.  The possibility of magic holding everything together.  The repetitive descriptions of the surroundings got to be a little over the top.<br />John
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Did exactly what I thought it would, great book if detailed sex scenes is what you're after. Don't expect a literary classic but it is what it says it is. Couldn't put it down.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Tiles could be slightly larger.  Hard to sometimes see exactly where they are as far as if they are free on two sides.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I held off purchasing the trilogy based on reviews.  I'm glad I finally made the decision to start reading the trilogy.
B004J64QR4|5.0|Having been a fan of Les Miz for years, I knew the music would be exceptional. However, this stellar cast and revised orchestration bring new excitement and nuances to this beautiful musical. While I love the original Dream Cast singing of the roles, this cast is perfection! As a singer, I truly appreciate the unsurpassed vocals by the lead characters. Alfie, Ramin, Lea, and Norm are exceptional! Nick Jonas is the only sore spot for me- weak vocals compared to the trained singers. The epilogue and \\"Bring Him Home\\" always bring tears to my eyes! The Confrontation is by far the best I have ever heard-so rapid-paced and distinct characterization.. Alfie Boe has become my new favorite singer!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Not only does my 3 year old LOVE this movie but the whole family does! Great music, great story, and such a colorful work of art!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I loved this book! It was a good read, it has suspense and was unique. I've read all the Jillian Flynn novels and this was by far my favorite. It defiantly keeps you wanting to read the next page and then the next chapter! I recommend this for anyone who likes thrillers.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game. So addicting to play. Can't put it down!!! Both me and my kids can play and have fun together.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I found the beginning a bit slow and confusing.  Once I got into the story it was a real page turner.  It was frustrating to think that a crime like this could happen to anybody and go undetected.  Very entertaining.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I very much enjoyed this continuation of the story, and I loved how much the characters grew in this book!!!
B0010T0OCY|3.0|Like movies that give you food for thought!<br />Very well done, great cast, I had to watch twice to get most of it!<br />some violence .
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book. It keeps you coming back to find out what is  the next step. I totally recommend it. It's like reading a Dateline story.
0545091020|5.0|Suzanne has done it again,SPECTACULAR<br />I think this is a fantastic series created by Suzanne Collins<br />The book has overwhelming characters, that make for all the action you could ask for.<br />This first volume gives you the history of the games.<br />A Beauty
B0065GC0BA|5.0|With well-drawn characters, battling realistic conflicts, Me Before You captures the many issues surrounding the theme of life choices. Jojo Moyes presents the conflicts with a light and readable touch, compelling the reader to finish the book. I read this book many weeks ago and still find the dilemmas the characters faced in my thoughts. Highly recommended.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love this show. I won't go into any detail about episode specifics because personally I believe they are all great so all I can talk about is the product. The shipping was fast, the discs are clean and no scratches, the case has no damage. If you like season one then you owe it to yourself to pick up season 2 and grow your horde of zombies.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What could I add that the, I don't know, 2000 other reviewers have not already said?<br />Probably nothing new.<br />But here is my 2 cents.<br />I have read many, many suspense type books. And there is none that come to mind as being this twisted and surprising. A Perfect Crime by Peter Abrahams comes close (I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a new read).<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has got you completely convince of one thing, and then the next thing you know, you are turned on your head. That is a good suspense book, is it not?<br />This continues for the entire book and with almost every character. Fascinatingly enough, you end up considering each person as the \\"bad guy\\". Yes, even the simpering parents.<br /><br />The ending,as most others wrote, was surprising and a little shocking. But for me - completely believable and right in line.<br /><br />This was a \\"I can't put it down\\" type of book. Which in my opinion makes it a great read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great final book of the trilogy, I enjoyed all three books very much.  I enjoyed it on my tablet.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are super fun, but a few of them are really hard to play. Very good variety of games.
B0074JODP8|4.0|Disc number one of this release had a really strange flaw: depending on how I accessed the cuts, sometimes there would be no audio. It was like the audio file just didn't load correctly or something. At any rate, there was no problem in returning the DVD, but because it was from a private seller, I couldn't get an automatic replacement. I did get credited for purchase, but because to get it replaced, I would have had to order from the same dealer, I opted instead to buy directly from Bonamassa's site.<br />Great DVD, great performances though.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use my kindle more now to get on to pinterest then anything else. Its so easy anyone can do it. My kids even use it to look at the kids stuff.
B0012FFQLK|5.0|It's almost hard to believe how smooth and wonderful this album is. When I think of Dinosaur Jr. I think of this album. It's their mark on the music world, the energy they portray. It's lonely, sentimental, tortured, and still a bit hopeful.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|It is a great concept but pretty glitchy for me.  Not all of my files ended up where<br />I wanted them and found it a waste of time hunting them. Down
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Amazing ending to yet another great season... anxiously awaiting seasaon 7!  Though this series is tough to describe to non-viewers, it keeps getting better and better.
1400082773|5.0|The value of information in this book is very much underestimated. I want to comment on the part regarding Kenya. I could discover some things that even we Kenyan bred Luos never had a chance to experience and live through, yet Barack Obama (Junior) had a chance to experience this, hence he is even much closer to Luo Culture that one can imagine. The book covers the times of Arab Traders, British Colonialism, the immediate Post Independence Kenya and also combines those experiences with the USA experiences of Barack Obama before his tenure of presidency. Perhaps this book is more for the Luos to learn from and to be proud of their culture and achievements. We Luo children abroad should have the courage to travel back to our homeland as Barak Obama did and also experience the good Luo Heritage. This first trip to Kenya is what shaped Barack Obama's identity and subsequent success. The world looks at this story from the beginning or from the front pages and pay very little attention to the key part that start from the first trip to Kenya.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Wild was an inspirational book for me and it championed the strength of women in a challenging world. I found it difficult to put down and always looked forward to reading Cheryl's next wilderness/life adventure!
B008M34INW|5.0|We hadn't seen this movie advertised when it came out and didn't hold high expectations.  It was awesome!  Mel Gibson played a great role.  Makes me wonder if this is how Mexican jails really are.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I love Liam Neeson.  But this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Mechanical wolves!  They aren't fooling anybody.  No one would be afraid of the mechanical wolves!  The characters are one-dimensional.  Caricatures.  Horrible.  Liam Neeson is great but his character too is a caricature.  Waste of time from beginning to end.  Dreck.
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book, there isn't anything else I can say but in addition, this book improves the sex life of a marriage without of course the bondage stuff. I appreciate it because it is a book that captured a reader like myself into a world of reading books in a similiar genre, but what I have heard this book is a category on its own. An excellent book thus far, who cares about the writing skills of the writer that some complain about. I recommend that people find out for themselves about the book. I opted for the trilogy...no regrets!
B0086700CM|5.0|Warning! Don't start playing this! You will have trouble stopping. It is not a complicated game. It is simple enough in that you are a guy (or gal) running from a temple with 'demon monkeys' chasing you. You have to jump over holes, make quick turns, avoid fire and trees all while collecting coins by tilting your phone or other device. Simple enough but it is so addictive that every time you 'die', it is one quick click to begin the run again, try for a little more distance, gather a few more coins and run, run, run.<br /><br />The graphics are great and there are ways to make the game more interesting. Although the layout of the run changes every time you restart, there is the added benefit of coin magnets, score boosters, invisibility tokens and super charged run boosts. You have to 'buy' these with the coins that you earn.<br /><br />My kids, (ages 8 and 13) have both gone nuts trying to play this and I have trouble putting it down sometimes.<br /><br />It is just so darn hard to stop playing when that \\"run again\\" button is screaming at you.<br /><br />A fun game - but don't let the creatures get you!

B008602KQI|4.0|The movie's faithful to the book, even if it can't include every detail. The cast projects strength, guts, and emotion, and the conflicts and raw desire that shape the action become palpable. This film is a big hit with my tween granddaughters, but older folks too will find its depiction of hope, honor, and deception compelling.
055358894X|3.0|This book was recommended to me by my brother.  It's a solid fantasy novel with a well-structured plot.<br /><br />GOOD: The book is well-written and fast-paced.  There are many interesting twists and turns.  The author is good with descriptions and expository narration.  It takes intellect to understand a lot of the allegory and other literary devices the author uses throughout the book.<br /><br />BAD: The book seems to be a mile wide and an inch deep.  There are lots of characters, locations, institutions, etc. introduced throughout the book without in-depth background explanations. I never developed a strong attachment to any particular character, including the protagonist.  I found the ending a merely satisfactory conclusion to what was a pretty fun ride.<br /><br />Overall, I think this book is good entertainment for fantasy fans, but I did not have enough interest in the overall universe Lynch created to pick up the sequel.  There did not seem to be a logical avenue for him to continue the story; I will refrain from spoilers to expound on that point, but that was my opinion.<br /><br />If you are thinking about picking up this book, I would go with the bigtime fantasy authors (Tolkien, Martin, Zelazny, etc.) before reading this one.
B007TMON8M|2.0|downloaded to my fire just fine. I tried to open it and it locked up the system. was a little agitated but gave it a second chance. it worked fine after a restart for about five minutes then locked up again. it was free so no loss. future updates may fix this issue. had it not been for the obvious fake reviews, I most likely wouldn't have reviewed this.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|The basic story behind the trilogy - 'damaged guy meets innocent young thing, falls in love and overcomes the issues of his past' could have been devloped and written in a lot more depth. Obviously Christian has issues, searching into them in depth and discovering how he resolves them could have been fascinating. How does a guy in his mid/late 20s amass such a great fortune and the skills to be able to pilot helicopters etc etc in such a short space of time? How could a woman in her early 20s be so innocent? The repetitive eye rolling, lip biting and hair trigger physical responses had me rolling MY eyes! Like other reviewers that I've read I wish E L James had consulted a decent thesaurus instead of 'cutting and pasting' the heroine's actions. As for the raunchy side of the books - Mills and Boons have been 'treating' readers to fairly graphic 'love scenes' for years. A repetitive and tedious read, 50 Shades fills the time if you've nothing else to do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A book well written with lots of excitement.  Could not put the book down until finsihed. I was disappointed in the ending, didn't seem realistic.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|I was fascinated by the theme of this book and intrigued by readers' commentaries on Amazon. However, the negative remarks were so damning that I almost decided not to order but in the end I was curious to forge my own opinion. I am very glad I bought it and  join the ranks of the reviewers who gave positive evaluations. It is an excellent psychological thriller. Christine's bewilderment and anxiety were very effectively and chillingly conveyed. I found progression in an insiduous building of tension rather than the repetition and boredom that some readers mentioned.I enjoyed this unusual and scary story. You may not,  but you will not know before you read it.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|If you're looking for high-brow entertainment, try The King's Speech. But if you're looking for a laugh, give this a try. It's fun, it's funny and it doesn't play down to the audience. Not recommended for young kids.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day<br />A MUST READ.  INSPIRING!<br />This book is well written and well paced.<br /><br />READ THIS BOOK AND APPRECIATE YOUR FREEDOM AND THOSE WHO SECURE IT FOR YOU.<br /><br />First off, there's nothing in this book that could be considered \\"Classified\\" or \\"Top Secret.\\"  The media has shared enough information with us, though not of a personal nature, that I learned no more information than what I had already surmised.<br />I was privileged to grow up as an Army brat and my older brother served in Vietnam. I have always respected the men and women who serve Our Country, even more so since reading this book by Mark Owen.<br />To learn how amazingly well trained and meticulous our service men and women are in their jobs makes me question just how I, and the rest of us, can improve in our responsibilities to them and to the freedoms we enjoy because of their service.<br />I believe most Americans take our freedoms for granted, never having experienced their lack.<br />Without those who protect us, where would we be?
B006RUJST6|5.0|Totally loved this book and fell inlove with the characters. I laughed I cried I fell in love. It's an amazing book.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|Although not the best written novel in the world, after being left hanging at the end of book 1 of the Trilogy, I just HAD to buy this one to continue the story of Christian and Ana.  It's kind of like a kinky Mills and Boon book but for some reason I just couldn't put it down.  Highly unlikely in real life, but great escapism all the same.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that you can listen to different versions while you read. I enjoy reading the words of Jesus in red. I have needed encouragement to read the Bible and this helps a great deal. Thanks for coming up with this and making it free. I wish there was some way to use it without having to get online. It's hard to get connected to the internet at times living in the country. I feel that I have been blessed with this app.
B007TMON8M|5.0|This is a pretty good physics based game that lets you build 12 items and test your engineering skills.  The app works well on the Kindle Fire and the graphics are good also.  It is a challenging brain test and the results of playing the game can be interesting.  In order to test your design you can touch the menu page in the upper RH corner and you can see the leader board, the finger test, the level description or the blueprints function.  From the part of playing the game and finishing ½ of the projects, that game was pretty good and worked well.<br /><br />The app lets you zoom in and out and pan to view your design.  The app also has an undo button to remove a mistake.  After your design is done you can use your finger to apply stress and view the results.  Areas under high stress turn red while those not under high stress turn green.  You can stress your design or destroy it.  You even have the option of blowing up your design by double tapping the screen.  Touch the hammer and it turns into an \\"X\\" that lets you remove individual pieces of your construction.<br /><br />You can use a dummy and toss him around, blow him up and even toss him against your design to smash him.  There is even a slow motion viewing of your design and you can view how it is failing by seeing the stress in the structure in color.<br /><br />What I didn't like was four fake reviews to start off the morning at five stars.  That is a turn off to any app and it is not ethical.  The app also has full internet access and it uses it to:<br /><br />* Take you to a built in leader board<br />* Take you to the Amazon App Store or the Amazon Browser to buy more of the developer's games if you use the more games button.<br />* The game asks you if the developer can send you an email when he releases new games.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned the internet access is not necessary and should be removed.  I don't care for a leader board, emails or buying other items.  Removing the internet access removes the possibility to download other data that you may not want to share. It would make this a good app that is clean of all potential issues.<br /><br />I still gave the app 5 stars as it is very good but get rid of the fake reviews and the internet access.

B002TX06RI|5.0|I am new to this show, but have been watching since I discovered it. I think the various characters all have qualities that are fun to watch and this show is different than the usual fare of cop type shows. It's funny at times and altho the characters are not sure whether to trust each other, they have an interesting sort of friendship and will help each other when the going gets rough. Love the show.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I like Sci-Fi horror films and this one is a good one. It is based on a video game of the same name and it has really become a cult type of zombie film. A beautiful woman named Alice wakes up in a large mansion and doesn't know who she is or where she is. She is really an guard for the Umbrella Corporation which is the largest company in the USA. They are also a company deeply involved in military technology and viral weaponry.<br /><br />A deadly mutating virus has been released and the massive hidden facility below the ground is being shut down with all of the employees trapped inside. It is located under the mansion where Alice is. Alice is a guard who was living in the mansion which really is the entrance to the facility called the Hive. As she wanders about trying to recognize where she is at as a group of commandos break into the mansion.....<br /><br />This movie is just constant action and suspense. The commandos and Alice try to reenter the Hive to see what has happened only to find out that the mutating T-Virus has escaped and the Hive's employees are infected. In addition, several of the Hives experimental creatures have escaped. Alice and the commandos are now trapped in the hive with no way to escape and they are being attacked by the creatures and Hive's employees who are now zombies. This movie is filled with high tech special effects and it is an excellent horror story with zombies and monsters galore. If you like scary movies with a high tech theme then this is a good film for you. I enjoyed and I recommend it to you.

B00004RYFV|5.0|A tough Army Ranger is just getting home from his tour of duty.  He finds his wife at work and while he is dancing with her a man comes up and insults him and hits on his wife.  As they leave the bar where she works they are attacked by three men who includes the man from the bar.  Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) fights for his life, he is outnumbered three to one. His superior training and fighting skills helps him to win.  Unfortunately one of the men is killed and the weapon they were going to use on Poe is taken by the other two men.  Cameron is convinced by his attorney to plead guilty and serve 4 years in prison but he is convicted by the judge for 7 to 10 years for manslaughter.<br /><br />He is finally paroled for good behavior and he is scheduled to fly back to Alabama on the prison plane and that is where the movie title Con Air comes from.  It is carrying some of the most dangerous criminals in the USA to a new high security prison.  The plane is filled with the worst criminals, mass murders and even a serial killer.  The plane is taken over and Poe is caught up in a situation of being trapped between really being a free man and trying to get free or trying to protect some of those trapped on the plane.....<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie as I thought it entertaining and action filled.  This is one of Nicolas Cage's best films.  This movie features a good cast and it has a lively script that ranges from humorous to suspenseful.  The movie is a good one and I enjoyed it.  I recommend it to you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book over the course of 2 days! Couldn't put it down and every time I had to wanted to pick it back up as soon as possible. I highly recommend this read even if you have already seen the movie. There is so much more depth to the book, that makes it so much better than the movie.
0061692042|3.0|\\"Canada\\" is the first fiction by Richard Ford that I've had the opportunity to read. For years, I'd been meaning to read him but never got around to it. When this novel was published, though, I read the dust jacket blurb and was intrigued enough to order it. Three things in particular from the summary intrigued me: 1) the two-staged plot, 2) Remlinger, and 3) the border setting. I'm a big fan of Cormac McCarthy and was drawn to read this novel by what appeared to be similarities to the latter's work--especially the Border Trilogy. Maybe authors have nothing to do with the blurbs that appear on the dust jackets of their books, in which case they shouldn't be to blame for falling short of the expectations created by them. But the experience of reading this novel turned out to be an interesting yet a disappointing one.<br /><br />First, it was interesting because of the way the whole story was announced in the novel's opening sentence. Rather than lessening the suspense, however, this technique actually heightened it. I knew what was going to happen, but finding out how it happened, watching it unfold, was pretty engrossing.<br /><br />Second, it was interesting because of the setting. Fiction is not too often set in this region of the country. Plus, as I said, the borderlands between Montana and Canada seemed like a northern version of McCarthy's Mexican novels. This was clearly a very deeply researched (or imagined) novel. The landscape of Montana and Saskatchewan (the prairies, the dilapidated small towns) were minutely and carefully described. It was enjoyable to inhabit that setting for 400-plus pages.<br /><br />I found a few of the characters interesting. In Part 1, Dell's parents, the way they were mismatched and their conflicts leading up to the bank robbery were at times fascinating. Dell's sister, Berner, was deeply developed, too (even before Part 3, where she has a central role). In Part 2, my favorite character was Charley Quarters--a mysterious employeeof Remlinger's who dyes his hair, wears makeup and has a disturbing side that's never fully revealed.<br /><br />Finally, the writing could at times be interesting. Often, especially in Part 1, the rhythm of the sentences took on a regional sound, almost like a southern drawl (Dell's father was born in Alabama). Often the language could be very striking, evocative of the past and the northern plains.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, I found the novel kind of disappointing. The reasons for this are as follows:<br /><br />The writing overall didn't rise above the level of blandness. It was mainly declaratory and factual, being preoccupied mainly with Dell's observations.<br /><br />Parts of the novel were over-written, especially in Part I surrounding the bank robbery, as if some paragraphs and even some entire chapters could have been cut out.<br /><br />The character of Dell I found to be irritating. As some other reviewers have said, he is completely passive in all the occurrences of his story. Passivity is akin to weakness, and it seemed at times that he should have exercised some agency, like his sister did. I realize that this aspect of his character is related to some of the novel's themes, but it was still annoying to watch him float along like a leaf on the current of his life's events. In fact, it is the lack of a solid relationship between Dell's character and the incidents of this novel that I find most confusing. Henry James famously asked (in his essay, \\"The Art of Fiction\\"), \\"What is character but the determination of incident? What is incident but the illustration of character?\\" Thinking of Ford's novel with this question in mind, I can only wonder in frustration what the incidents say about Dell and vice versa? Dell initiated nothing; he only reacted when other people moved. This means that his character is passive, obviously, but passiveness is not usually a likable trait in a person. And since there is no connection between Dell's character and theseevents, it makes the events themselves seem arbitrary. They could have been completely different without loss to the novel.<br /><br />Additionally, the relationship between the 3 parts of the novel seem arbitrary to me. I can suspend my disbelief, up to a point, that these two otherwise normal people could rob a bank (again, this is part of the novel's theme); but the events of Part 2 have absolutely no connection to that. True, Remlinger and Dell share some characteristics, but these are not enough to justify the nearly random nature of the book's main incidents.<br /><br />On top of this, the third and last part, which functions as a coda or epilogue, seems equally arbitrary, unconnected to anything that has happened before. It seemed oddly or forcedly tacked on (although, again, the character of Berner was intriguing, and I did feel a need to find out what happened to Dell and his family after the events of Parts 1 and 2).<br /><br />Finally, I was annoyed by the writing in Part 3 more than by that of previous sections. There was one grating error (Dell calls Conrad's story, \\"THE Heart of Darkness,\\" when there is actually no \\"The\\" in the title), there were silly cultural references (e.g., Dell and his sister go to Applebee's for lunch), the author's cultural prejudices are barely hidden in his description of Berner's late life, and there's a pointless endorsement of Obama that I found laughable. Does Ford really think this will resonate to readers in 50 years?

B008GFI4V8|3.0|Even though they've been released several times in different versions and formats, the coming of \\"The Hobbit\\" has encouraged Warner Bros. to give fans a chance to get the extended editions of all three \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" films AGAIN in special Blu-ray 5-disc sets. There's no possible way that any stone is left unturned or single piece of behind-the-scenes footage is left unseen after these are delivered.<br /><br />Each film is over three and a half hours to over four hours long spread out across two discs.

B000VMFDW2|4.0|Outstanding account of the horrors of war faced by infantrymen.  Not a historical sweep with a tactician's view of the consequences of campaigns.  This a story written by a PFC in the trenches.  Sledge is able to articulate horrible conditions such as battlefield corpses and human waste issues in extreme heat on a rock island with no sanitation, and yet he does so in a manner that is informative without turning off the reader.  As in all good books, you keep turning the pages and when its over you wish there was more.  You wonder how his return to civilian life went, but he does not go into detail about that.  What you are left with is the image of thousands of deeply scarred individuals returning to a society unaware of their damage and of no agency prepared to help them re-integrate.  Highly recommend this book to any history buff.

Plus the fact that I can put on the timer and after words it will shut off without killing my battery.  And you can have multiple sounds going at the same time. Absolute wonderful app!!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is an excellent rendition of the first book in Suzanne Collin's Hunger Games trilogy.  I highly recommend that the viewer read the book first as detailed background information helps the understanding of the movie. A very well done film of difficult subject matter, not just a special effects scare you stand alone type of film.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really like how it is written. Very easy to read. Some of the authors analogies are so thought provoking that I want to write them down. I can feel what each family member is going through as I read it. I also like how he describes the legal process -- very informative for the person who was once a juror on a murder trial. To get it from the perspective of the D.A. Really interesting.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett has out done himself with Volume One.  His character development is rich and well researched.  As a student of history I find this work to be seamless.
B008BM9L72|5.0|love the book. how spicy just wish I had a man in my life so I could \\"jump his bones\\" after reading this book, only problem was that I came to the end and was really p....ed off. Thank goodness I bought the trilogy so am now happily reading the next one. If you have any sexy bones in your body you will love this.<br />I'm 68 and have fond memories of when I was in my late 30s and in my prime
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I thought this book was highly overrated and poorly written.  It was like reading a porn version of Danielle Steele.  Not recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a fast paced page turning novel.  It gets slightly gruesome sometimes, but it is necessary for the plot. I found it exciting and hard to put down and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the thriller genre.

B008IYR2BA|5.0|Never fails to disappoint! Love Dexter and can't wait til season7! This season gets deeper into other characters other than Dexter.  We finished the entire season in two weeks.  The ending leaves you on a cliffhanger!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Die App ist wirklich klasse! Ich kann sie nur empfehlen! Man PCs nicht nur fernsteuern sondern auch zum streamen aufs Tablet verwenden... So kann ich auch während dem Fußball livestream ohne was zu verpassen aufs klo gehen! :-) Auch sehr gut wenn meine wenig PC begabte Mutter wieder mal was auf ihren notebook verstellt... Dann kann ich das ganze  bequem von zu hause wieder zum laufen bringen ohne extra noch mal zu ihr hin zu fahren! Daumen hoch 5 sterne!

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|The [[ASIN:B0051UP5NQ OfficeSuite Professional 6]] app is a real 5-star gem. It has become my secret weapon for productivity on the Kindle Fire and more recently on the Kindle Fire HD.

I use Office 2007 on a Windows 7 PC and Office 2011 on a MacBook Pro, and have had no problems with creating or editing .doc and .docx files with this app. And those files have had no problems when transferred back to the PC or the Mac. Formatting has been good, with the minor adjustment here and there for screen width on the respected platform, but that's understandable and easy to correct.<br /><br />Have run into no compatibility issues with Excel spreadsheets, though mine tend to be more spartan and functional, and admittedly I don't make heavy use of macros. Those that I've opened, edited and saved in .xls or .xlsx formats have been fine when transferred back to the Mac or the PC.<br /><br />Have had no problem opening and viewing PowerPoint .ppt, .pptx, .pps, and .ppsx presentations created on the Mac or the PC, though use of this has been very light. But viewing Adobe PDF files has been excellent, and for me personally this is important as I have every manual for my photo and computer gear in that format. This way there's no scrambling (and swearing) while trying to find the manual for my Nikon DSLR, my computer wireless router, or even my coffee maker. These are available from most manufacturers, and it gives me a viewable reference library right here on my Kindle fire.<br /><br />This same manufacturer offers the [[ASIN:B008J05EL8 OfficeSuite Font Package]], a package that contains the Microsoft Windows font compatibility pack, though that's not available for the Kindle Fire HD series.

B008476HBM|3.0|If you are looking for an unabridged version of the book this is most certainly not it. Looks like someone has typed out the dialogue exchanges from the BBC series and filled in their own interpretation of the feelings at times.
B008602KQI|1.0|Didn't see this in the theatre......way too much hype.<br />I found it boring!  I would have been disappointed if I had paid $1.25 at redbox to view this.<br />Now I'm stuck with the DVD.

0545310601|4.0|Take a normal teenage girl with hormones raging, place her in enormously stressful and emotionally damaging situations and mix in a healthy dose of neurosis and you have an almost complete picture of Katniss Everdeen in the final book of this trilogy.<br /><br />This is a dark and at times disturbing end to the Hunger Games saga but begs to be read if only to find out how it all comes out (no spoilers here).  At times this book slows to a crawl as Katniss moans and whines about her lot in life and struggles with her symbolic role as the Mockingjay in the revolution of the districts against the Capitol.  Other times her incessant complaining simply wears the reader out and any sympathy and pathos the reader has developed for her is subtly replaced by a strong desire to smack the back of her head and yell, \\"snap out of it!\\"  If the author was going for the ultimate dysfunctional teenager, she knocked it out of the park.  And the wrong person dies at the end!<br /><br />However, Katniss perseveres through this macabre adventure and there are enough plot twists and surprises to prevent the reader from tossing the book out of the window before reaching the conclusion.  The worst of the three, The Mockingjay should be read in sequence since it is a more acceptable and appealing book than if read standalone.<br /><br />John E. Nevola - Author of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Nice durable design and the foldable cover/stand works as expected. The outside shell is made of similar material as the back of the kindle fire so it gets a lot of grease stains. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase!
0439023491|4.0|Well, after The Hunger Games, I was a little let down by this sequel.  Not that it was a bad book nor a disappointing read but the it didn't quite reach the bar set by the first book in the trilogy.  I would have rated it 3 1/2 stars if allowed to do so.<br /><br />The author solves the problem of the victors from district 12 (Katniss and Peeta) being pardoned from future participation in the Games by having President Snow declare an \\"all-star\\" Hunger Games.  All living victors from every district are required to participate in a reaping until 2 are chosen from each district.  That means some fairly old people are now forced into the life-or-death struggle after being promised a lifetime of wealth and immunity from future Games.<br /><br />This demonstrates the insidious nature of President Snow and the leaders in the Capitol.  Of course, he did this solely to assure that Katniss Everdeen, who tricked him into allowing dual winners in the previous Games and has become very popular in the districts, is discredited in this special Game.  And he uses every devious method and sneaky trick possible to first control her and then manipulate her including threats to kill her family.<br /><br />Katniss feels the pressure of conflicting objectives and the love triangle forming between her, Gale and Peeta.  As she struggles to stay alive in these Games, she realizes she will not be able to save both her and Peeta a second time and begins to come unglued at the likely but unacceptable outcomes.<br /><br />If you were hooked by the first book like I was, your curiosity will demand you read the next two books but be prepared to fight your way through some slow and repetitious segments as you struggle to get to the end.<br /><br />John E. Nevola - Author of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was awesome!!  Glad I got to watch it on my own BIG Screen at my house!!  Katniss is the best!
B001UHOWW4|1.0|I recently purchased the 50th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of this classic movie only to be sorely disappointed. The DVD enclosed was properly labeled but contained the terrible version of the movie. First it was in small screen version from the VHS with terrible  lighting alternating between dark and light.  This is unwatchable and sore disappointment for what is the version for collection and supposedly restored in high definition.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|At first glace it seem beyond simple and maybe a waste of time - then the little twists start to occur and you find yourself spend much more time than planned playing. a sure sign of a good game.
B000I9YXKG|5.0|Two for the Road is a charming film about a couple who've been married for several years who have begun to walk past each other without paying attention to each other.  On a road trip, they talk about the possibility of divorcing.  However, as they travel roads that they had traveled in their youth, fond memories are recalled about how much they had loved each other.  It is those memories of loving times past that eventually convince them to enliven their life together.  One of the best of several movies that have followed with this particular theme.  Also, one sees a much younger Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn.  Anna M. Seidler
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the books I love the movie. I hope they keep of up and have that realness to it again. Cuz it was great for what they did
B007J4T2G8|2.0|this is nothing but a book to excite someone with its description of kinky sex and the way some man would seduce some inexperienced young lady.  The book has no real plot no direction other then when do they get together for their next seamy time .  The executive that is the main role just makes money  being so smart that he is beyond human. I would not waste my time to read any of the sequels and  in retrospect would not read this either.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book, very well written.  I liked this book much better than Sharp Objects by the same author. The characters were intriguing and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I couldn't put this book down.

1476712042|3.0|3.5 Stars<br />I started this book in the middle of the night and stayed up until 5am reading it before I made myself to go to sleep and that first half that I read in those hours were freakin' addictive as hell. But somewhere in the middle it became to where I was able to put it down (not for long periods of time) but I didn't have this invisible magnetic pull to the book as I did to the first half. I thought I had read about messed up relationships, and overprotective psychotic boyfriends before but Beautiful Disaster is the definition of an unhealthy relationship and what not to date.<br /><br />This book has been floating around the blogosphere a lot so I'll keep the summarization short and simple. Abby meets Travis at an illegal fight ring, Travis is in my opinion a male whore who somehow finds Abby to be different then all the other girls he met. They become friends, even though to the outside world the way they behave you could have swore they are dating. Travis is overprotective, has anger issues (although never directed towards Abby) and the dude loves hard HARD! His obsession with Abby is a little on the unhealthy side in my opinion.<br /><br />At times I actually felt sorry for Travis because it was obvious he really did love Abby he just couldn't express it in a healthy fashion. Honestly Abby and Travis were both two damaged people who needed some serious relationship counseling.<br /><br />Being someone in her late 20's ( it was my bday the other day which has officially put me there ) anyways I could read this book and take it for what it is especially since I've had my share of experiences including a relationship similar to the one in this book at 19 but I would be a little concerned about a teenager reading this and getting the wrong impression about what love is and that it's okay for a guy to act certain ways because he loves you that's why he is being overprotective or controlling...not cool. And then the ending WTF was that? No! before they took that step some counseling and growing up some more as individuals would have been nice SPOILER ALERT!..... but marriage really!!! come on no... hell no! There should have been more books about them growing up as individuals and in their relationship before that step was taken. END OF SPOILER.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book for all the drama and craziness but not for the message it sends out as far as relationships go.that step some counseling and growing up some more as individuals would have been nice SPOILER ALERT!..... but marriage really!!! come on no... hell no! There should have been more books about them growing up as individuals and in their relationship before that step was taken. END OF SPOILER.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book for all the drama and craziness but not for the message it sends out as far as relationships go.
B008BM9L72|1.0|This is a very repetitive variation on the classical 'candlelight' type novels: unattainable, untameable, incredibly handsome and rich bachelor falls for uncertain - but unbeknowst to herself incredibly hot - girl. He simply cannot help himself and falls hopelessly for this girl, without any obvious reason. Although the book does add a creative twist by explaining superficial parts of the D/s or BDSM lifestyles, the characters drag themselves through bland, badly written sections from one steamy sex session to the next, which will bore even the most frustrated virgin no later than halfway through the first book.<br /><br />A minor point is the very apparent similarity to the Twilight novels: unattainable, dangerous man with major issues (there: vampire, here: D/s fanatic) falls passionately for insecure girl, they struggle to make it work, she wins him over to the light, end.

B005G8AFFG|4.0|This is a refreshing set.  Ana is certainly a great talent with great vocals and instrumentals.  I'm surprised that we can see her play locally for $7.  It's one of the few bargains left in the world. Unconditional is a very catchy song with her smooth vocals.  I've listened to this CD several times a week and it remains fresh.  If you like good music, give this a listen.

B003204MQS|3.0|This movie has a mediocre first 3/4 with no scares unless the noise wakes you up from sleep. All the action is in the last 10 minutes most of which is suspense with a 5 second ending that if you blink you miss (so not worth the rest of the movies slow clime to suspense). This movie IS worth watching for as part of a back story for the second movie which is SOOOOO much better.
B008602KQI|4.0|The movie was good but the book was much better.  It is hard to decide what sections are important to include but the movie was not as good as I had hoped it would be.

0765356147|5.0|Third in the Mistborn fantasy trilogy. It is the end of this age in this world. It's story does continue, years, if not centuries, later with [[ASIN:0765330423 The Alloy of Law (Mistborn, 4)]].<br /><br />My Take<br />Oh, brother! This was excellent!! Tension, drama, a wide range of characters and duplicity ranging from evil to good. Questions about one's own purpose. There is such depth to the characters, the actions, and interactions. Growth and understanding. Sanderson sets up individual conflicts for differing groups of characters. It explores culture and examines individual characters, tactics, actions--the selfish and the compassionate.<br /><br />Sanderson brings everything to a head. All that we have learned in the previous books and then he ties it up more thoroughly than you can imagine. Including the origin of several of the less-human species--yuck!<br /><br />Ick, we learn how an Inquisitor is made. Oh, god. It's both disgusting and depressing how Marsh vacillates between the man he wants to be and what he is forced to be. The truth of the mist attacks. How the Mistborn came into being. It's twists within spins within yet more twists. An alteration between horror or \\"oh my\\".<br /><br />Slowswift makes a good point about belief. That even if the Lord Ruler is dead, people still believe just as the skaa and others believe in the dead Survivor. Sazed's realization about his study of religions is mind blowing.<br /><br />Sanderson has created an awful and amazing world. One I kept trying to reconcile to our own.

To learn why the Lord Ruler set out these clues and created these caches.<br /><br />Somewhere in all this, there must be a way to save their people.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Empress Vin Venture is one of the Mistborn able to manipulate all the metals. The Heir of the Survivor. The Hero of Ages. Considered a saint in the Church of the Survivor. And considered the Mother by TenSoon. Now, her half-brother Reen is back.<br /><br />High Emperor, Lord Elend Venture has gone beyond being the simple son and heir of House Venture. He has become harder, more understanding of why the Lord Ruler acted as he did. He is now Emperor and a token member of the Church. General Demoux is a firm believer in the Survivor. Ham is a Thug and will handle security as well as train their army<br /><br />The City of Urteau<br />Spook has matured in his tin allomancy, but he's burning it too much, too often. Then the struggle during his arrest leaves him vulnerable. Durn leads the beggars in Urteau and is Spook's guide in the city.<br /><br />Quellion, the Citizen, is against the Mistborn but believes in the Survivor. He rules with a heavier and heavier hand in Urtreau, casting anyone of noble blood into the flames. A city Elend needs for its cache. Beldre is the Citizen's sister with whom Spook has fallen in love.<br /><br />Captain Goradel provides Sazed and Breeze with protection as they enter Urteau to join Spook. Their discovery sheds light on a catastrophe that happened years earlier. Breeze Ladarian is a Smoother; he manipulates the emotions of others.

B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is action packed and full of great scenes. Parts of the movie are hard to follow but it all works out in the end.
B007SGM084|5.0|this series is by all means one of my favorites! It doesnt have anything to do with the sensual parts of the story really but the sotry line is amazing! I love it when I am able to read a book and be able to visulaize everything in my head. Of course myliving in Washington State for a while and my love for the state in general most definitly helped. I would reccommend this series to everyone I know, i would most definitly read and reread again and again and I have! The story never gets old, even when I know what is going to happen, I still feel anxious for Christian and Ana! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
B008476HBM|5.0|How can one describe Pride and Prejudice in a few words? Impossible. This is one of the best novels in the English language, both for style and content. The various movies and TV editions, though excellent and immensely entertaining, do not do the novel justice. All I can say is \\"Read it.\\"
B006T5LGXA|5.0|Alice Cooper at his best! Great songs, seems like you are right at the concert in the front row! Love it!!!
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is a great game. Don't give it a bad review because it is \\"like\\" minecraft. [...]  Cant wait to meet you  My username is LIGHT
B006BAEQB2|4.0|As always, Philippa delivers a good story with a lot of history included.<br /><br />A good read.  I look forward to her next book.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Downton Abbey represents the best in television.  The setting and characters make this story irresistible and unique.  In this day of reality TV, Downton Abbey reminds us of what true entertainment is all about.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Very addictive reading. I'm generally a slow reader but read all three books in 5 days. And have now read them twice.
B008XBHBX2|5.0|Showed grandaughter movie for first time. She loved it! It was so nice to introduce her to the classics. I started about that age.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Elegant, intelligent and fun. Complexity arising out of simplicity itself. Relaxing, cerebral and hard to put down. Great Free App of the Day!
B002PJN59M|5.0|Excalibur has been one of my favorites ever since it came out. My friend and I skipped school many times to go watch it!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is amazing. It is even better than the famed and critically- acclaimed, award winning fruit ninja. This game just blew me away when i first played, now. I am completely in live with the game. I would give it a five out of five stars but ir lags in the kindle fire and i have no problem playing the game on my ipod
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I thought the whole trilogy was an excellent read.  The books are so well written that you actually feel like you are there.  Yes it is a risqué story line and very descriptive in places but I really enjoyed the whole story line.  My only disappoointment was to find that the author had not written anymore books, so I am left waiting for the next exciting read
B000YAFE0M|4.0|I love both Ryan Gosling and Anthony Hopkins, having them both in the same film was an added bonus.  The chemistry between them was astounding.
B0050ZPAPA|4.0|Hounded is an amazing modern approach to mythology and magic. It is possibly the first modern-world-based book I have enjoyed as much as fantasy. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes action stories, modern memes, and/or fantasy. This the ultimate clash of those. The voice is fantastic and fresh - and who could dislike reading a book with a cocky Irish druid as the protagonist?
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is great and easy to use. I was able to connect to the site and navigate easily from my phone.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|Great movie with a great and funny story line the a team never gets old. Nice action this movie has and obviously good characters
B007HJB6OG|5.0|This is an amazing series. I would recommend this for mature audiences only. This is a must see show that I thoroughly enjoy.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|well when I got it it was wonderful but it started to tun slow so I had to delete in case of virus. beware the virus!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I play on my Kindle Fire and have really enjoyed it.  Highly recommend.  Well worth the money. Can't wait for more levels.
B007SGM084|3.0|It was just ok and these are the reasons: (Good) The author was successful in creating a good mystery, although one guessed that the heroine was going to get involved with Grey right from the first chapter.  But all the other mysteries throughout the trilogy held my interest, kept me reading.  (Bad) The constant sex scenes got to be very boring.  A few would have been ok but constant????  And they were almost the same description. It got to the point when I would come to one, I just skipped it.  Yawwwn.  It was obvious thse scenes were written to hold a reader's fascination with sex.  So many people want to find out what all the hoopla is about and the waiting list is in the hundreds at the libraries! Eh!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|My kids and I love this movie. I will always give it 5 stars. We saw this movie in the theaters. We loved it instantly.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cable has been very handy when traveling, ease to use and give my Kindle a long charge. It arrived in a timely manor and was well packaged.
B008602KQI|4.0|I got this movie knowing that it was a beloved book for young people. But it's a great story for any age!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I received John Carter in the a couple of days, opened it and watched it. There were no scratches, it did not freeze or skip. It was perfect. I had seen this movie at the movie theatre and could not wait to get it and watch it. Thank you
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel is very well written with very real and quotable characters.  If it was not on my Kindle I would have had my highlighter out and sticky tabs because there is quite a lot of wisdom in a small package and much heart.  Bravo for a truly amazing book!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is very AWSOME and I LOVE IT!,but the dragon's on this game COST WAY TO MUCH!,so a much better thing to do is to BREED!,breeding is much better than having to ask your social neighbores for MORE and MORE GOLD each day!,since I've been BREEDING I got mostly half of the 100 and 500,800,900,400,200,300,600,or 700!,GOLD DRAGON'$!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl had many twists and turns.  While it was a little slow here and there, it kept me interested and constantly trying to figure out who the crazy one really was!
0307891372|5.0|I count on Prima and Brady for my gaming strategy books and this Prima publication is my (literally) constant companion while I am in Skyrim. While I do enjoy roaming and exploring this vast, incredibly diverse world it surely helps to have a guide from time to time. Prima details so much of this world and all those \\"need or want to know\\" aspects of the game that saves me a great deal of frustration at times. For anyone who desires to journey in Skyrim at leisure or to move through most or all of it in a cost-effective manner this guide is an absolute must.
B002LBYDMC|4.0|The acting is o.k. The fighting is o.k. Cung Le cameos and looks amazing doing what he does best (ninja sorcery). Channing Tatum was likable, even if not that convincing as a badass. I watched the whole thing and didn,t feel terrible about it.
B0040QDMBE|5.0|This book shows new point view of the capicalism and free trading<br /><br />The author may want to provide readers limitation or faults of capitalism.
B006QPVH6O|4.0|The movie was okay. A little scare. But the flow of the movie let you know when something will happen. It open the curiosity of know why the US did not give more funds to explore the moon. I wonder why they don't try it again. I mean, the technology has changed from the first landing to now, so why not make a trip? Oh well, hopefully it happens soon. But anyways, the movie was good.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Dark, humorous, and hard to put down. An intimate look into a different yet compelling life with a basic honesty and vulnerability that gets your complete attention from the very first page. So well written that you forget the author is a writer!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|As Bible apps go it seems to meet my needs.  I wish that the verse numbers would copy along with the verses.  I am glad there is an app with the NIV included.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I loved this book! It had all the creepy, freaky people to fill more than one novel. One evil person wasn't enough here! Lots of sickos to creep you out. The ending is one of the greatest twisted, unexpected endings I have ever read! My mom bought it after I told her about it and also loved it!<br />I would definitely tell anyone that likes scarey, thrilling, fast page turning books to get this right away!<br />I also LOVED \\"Gone Girl\\" by the same author-another fantastic read!
B007TMON8M|4.0|not a bad game, plays well on all my devices. i have an Autistic daughter, and i use apps like this to teach her ideas about &quot;cause n effect&quot; or construction. this has simple yet challenging gameplay, and is a pick up and play title. so no guess work.  itd be worth a buck IMO<br /><br />getting really tired of people claiming &quot;fake reviews&quot; or rating Amazon rather than the app.<br /><br />i get it, the tab is there, sure you CAN review the app. But, are you really qualified when you cant even function your device? when you cant stay objective about the application you are reviewing?<br /><br />do us all a favor and stop flooding the market with your worthless opinion based reviews.  people want to see an honest reflection on the application, not your (or my) angry rants about stuff which is unrelated.
0802473156|5.0|Excellent book.  Everyone should read and take this test before marriage and after and then again years later.  It will help you see who you really are and help you understand why you receive love the way you do.  It will help you understand what to do to make sure your mate feels the love that you really have for them. This book is not a book that you would like to have, it is a book that every relationship NEEDS!
B00785P2QC|3.0|So far I like this game because it doesn't make me haven neighbors.  at least it hasn't so far .  I hope I can continue to play without having to invite mire people
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is an awesome movie.  Well directed and all the actors did a wonderful job.  While not as good as the book, it still was a great movie!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy. Of course most people are probably reading it for the literotica aspect of it but it also has a great love story. Showing how couples deal with all types of past present and future problems.
B008602KQI|5.0|This was long awIted at my house!  I took my kids age 11 and 12 to the midnight premiere when this was released at the theater and was worried if it was age appropriate (the younger one had read it in school!).  While the overall premise is a bit disturbing, the movie is extremely well done and thought provoking.  It was a great launching pad for discussion after the film  (you can search the Internet for lots of talking points).  Yep, there's violence, but it's generally shot with a moving camera, so those scenes are fast and not so focused.  My oldest in particular was counting the days until the blu-ray release.<br /><br />How about age appropriate for a middle aged man and woman who usually fall asleep half way through the movie?  We both stayed awake TWICE!  This story is not just another regurgitated twist to a story already told.<br /><br />Will you like it?  Well, that remains to be seen, but the odds are ever in your favor.
B007TMON8M|5.0|This game is so much fun because you get to build a whole bunch of things.  I would recommend this game to any one who likes to build things.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is easy to read and understand. I have been wheat/gluten free for 2 weeks and have lost 7 lbs. The intense cravings I would have at night are gone. Absolutely amazing. The pain in my knees is all but gone. I am not diabetic or sensitive to gluten but the benefits to those experience weight and health problems are every bit as good.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I would definitely reccomend this book. The author did a good job luring the reader in. The more you read, the more you wanted to know how Cathy became to be OCD. At first, it was a little annoying how Cathy acted but once you got a little background to her character, you started to sympathize. When I finished reading the book, I missed it. I will say that the author could have spent a little more time with the ending. She could also possible write a book on the best friend character.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I'd been using TeamViewer on  my 7-pc network and then discovered it was avail. for Kindle Fire.  It's the best internet-intranet remote control app that's out there and I've tried several including PcAnyWhere, VNC/Enterprise, etc.  I strongly recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is very addictive. cant stop playing :) The conversations between characters are comical. The graphics are good. I have not had any issues with loading or.playing.
B008EQIEWS|1.0|To much hype for an overall not well put together movie!<br /><br />1 star if any! I'm glad I didn't see it at the movies
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|The hype for this movie worked.  I was excited to finally see the big movie.  Well I learned that they spend most of the movie on advertising.  With big actors in the movie with good writing, but movies showed all these lead to a boring and a surprising under eventful movie.  I been told that the book is better.[[ASIN:B008Z9YLV2 The Hunger Games]]
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is perfect in this role. A few spotty scenes where the clips are out of sequence aren't her fault, someone should have reviewed the final copy one more time. Otherwise, great work.
B0061S073A|5.0|Easy to use and AMAZING!  I recommend this for ALL parents! It protects your child from links and videos they don't need to see
B005IQZB14|4.0|The author writes well, and her adventure can be well appreciated by anyone who has hiked the PCT or the AT. I did not find her all that likable as a person, especially when she dismissed an abortion as easily as brushing her teeth. However, I certainly can commend her for getting her act together, however she did it. having done long distance hiking, in the company of my husband, I would never consider doing it alone, nor would I consider being so unprepared at the outset of a sojourn that long.  As I said, I found the book interesting, and a cautionary tale for anyone considering doing the same trip.<br />it is amazing to me that she doesn't consider that God was involved in the success of her life - journey and the gifts of a good family at the end of it all.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|I love this movie! An awesome mind-twister, it'll keep you on the edge of your seats! Recommended to anyone who likes a real brain-teaser.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really loved the characters, the storyline and the writing style of Bared to You.  I cannot wait for the next two books.  A definite page turner and very sexy :)
B008JGSM6G|3.0|some levels are next to impossible to complete but I'd rather have it too hard than too easy. you can keep trying the levels over but don't need to pass one to go on to the next one.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|I was seduced by the first four chapters (for free on Kindle) and bought the book.  Well, the author clearly put time and humor into the first four chapters, which I guess deserves kudos for marketing.  My suggestion is go ahead and download the beginning for free, and then go watch [[ASIN:B005721W9O Galaxy Quest]], a far better written and more enjoyable romp.
B004JY0KP8|4.0|Classy and comfortable, would be perfect if the hands were outlined in black.  The hands are a little hard to read.
B003WUYOQ6|2.0|I really read this eagerly.  The science was pretty good, but just repeated over and over again.  There also wasn't hardly any good advice on \\"what to do about it\\" part.
B004YKSXYW|5.0|I would recommend this book to children and adults alike.<br />Wonderfully written, as light as one could make a book about the history of the world. The author knows just when to change up the context to keep the reader interested. I would highly recommend this book. Loved it!
B008M86IXU|5.0|These guys are the roots to music with meaning.  Iam so glad to see them on stage live again. They did a good job im sure they rehearsed very hard to look and sound so good. Anyone who buyes this dvd will be glad they did. Great job CSN.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Very low key movie, but very uplifting. I really enjoyed it. It's based on a crazy idea that is transformed into a practical plan. Along the way, the characters lives are transformed.
B0086DBE62|5.0|I rented this to watch on a flight to Orlando. My friend is afraid of flying and this movie had us cracking up. Before we knew it it was time to land. Two thumbs up.
B007L6VQHW|4.0|I like the movie, but the writing isn't quite as sharp as I'd thought it could be.  I think the world has had enough of Shia LaBeouf by now, too, but if this somehow ends up being his last high-profile gig then at least he went out on a high note.  He would not have been among my first ten casting choices for this role, but I found his presence less annoying in \\"Lawless\\" than in most everything else I've seen him in.<br /><br />But this movie belongs to Tom Hardy, hands down.  Anyone familiar with Hardy's body of work knows that he can deliver the goods (\\"Bronson\\", anyone?).  He has such a dynamic and commanding presence about him that you can't take your eyes off him.  When he's not onscreen you can't wait for him to come back.  He was the best thing about \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\".  In fact, he was the ONLY good thing about \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\".  He'll get more profile for that film than for many of his others, and that's unfortunate too considering how weak that material was.<br /><br />Between \\"Bronson\\", \\"Lawless\\", and 2011's \\"Warrior\\" (and shame on you if you haven't watched all three of these), Hardy's place as one of his generation's best and most versatile screen actors is secured.<br /><br />The other thing about \\"Lawless\\" I didn't care for was how a few songs seemed to get shoe-horned into the story when simple, subtle background score would have sufficed.  It was distracting.  But Nick Cave wrote a few of those and he gets paid more than just his screenwriter's salary if his songs make it into the film and onto the soundtrack, so there you go.  I noticed the same pattern in \\"The Proposition\\", another film Cave wrote and contributed songs for.  Cave co-wrote the score for \\"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\\" and that music was quite good, so I'm not on an anti-Cave rant here.<br /><br />\\"Lawless\\" is bloody and violent too, so leave the kids in the other room.  But it's a superior genre piece and worth watching.<br /><br />And I have nothing against seeing a little female flesh now and again, but I thought Jessica Chastain's nude scene was gratuitous.  I certainly didn't DISlike it, but in my head I was screaming \\"Okay, apparently it is time for the obligatory ingenue nude scene.  Get it over with and let's move on.\\"e nothing against seeing a little female flesh now and again, but I thought Jessica Chastain's nude scene was gratuitous.

B008DVJMAW|4.0|I am very pleased with this album. It was a good idea to add the<br /> keyboard player. Their music gets better with each album..now I want to<br />see them live...Buy it,,
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great! Followed book as best as any I have watched.  Loved it. Went back and read the books again!  Great job. Looking forward to next movie.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I got it because it was the faotd and I have not stopped playing! I find myself shooting for 3 stars and the hints are there when I'm trapped! I love this game!! if you missed it as the faotd it is worth the buck to buy it!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Mr. Larsson keeps you entranced with this captivating Lisbeth Salander, very hard to put down once you get started, do read all 3 books to understand Lisbeth and her mentality. You will not regret it at all!!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read so many bad reviews on this book and i'm glad I read it for myself because it was amazing!
B0079TQHDO|4.0|Having read the book prior to \\"The Sins of the Father\\" I felt I had the advantage of at least knowing what the background was, whereas a new reader would of been lost.I feel some type of warning should of been sent to read the other book first.<br />  Giving it 4 Stars indicates that I enjoyed the read.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is very well done. I would definitely recommend it.  I didn't read the book, but now I intend to.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I adored this book, which is a love story on many levels, as well as suspenseful.  It usually takes me at least a month to read a book because it doesn't hold my interest, so I'll read a chapter or two and move on to other projects for a few days.  I read this book in two days - a real page-turner that I couldn't put down.  I had just completed another good book by Nicholas Sparks and will definitely read more.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked the book, enjoy the adventure and Katnees Peeta. I seemed to be living with them all that had to happen in the new game from the Games Hanger.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Wow! Great Product! Will be back for more!
1936608898|5.0|This book is both an excellent overview and detailed description of health as it relates to our diets. It gives detailed information about a protocol described as the \\"Whole 30\\", which is designed to change our attitudes about food, and in so doing begins the process of changing our health as well. A truly excellent work, and well worth reading.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The walking dead season 2 was an excellent sequel to season 1. The story telling is the biggest selling point of series and season 2 doesnt let down especially towards the end of the season 2. I cannot wait until season 3 begins.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My title is a line from the title song by Casting Crowns, for the movie. The movie is truly excellent. It depicts what could be a real group of men, going through their daily lives and their struggles. We see how each copes, or doesn't and the effects on families and others around them. The best movie yet date by this same group.
B0049VZ222|5.0|the walking dead is great show and season one was a great intro to the show. season. i am not a huge fan of any type of zombie type shows but the walking dead does such a good job of story telling i was immediately hooked and quickly ordered season 2.
B00846REIS|4.0|A sexy story that's a little more realistic than the plot of the 50 shades trilogy. Keeps you reading with roller coaster the ups and downs.
B005HEQKDU|1.0|Star Trek - Next Generation - Instant Video - The audio for this episode - Season 6 episode 26 is messed up.  It was not digitized properly.  The music throughout the episode is messed up - it wavers and is very annoying.  This needs to be re-done completely to get it right like the rest of the episodes.  Thanks - Dave
B005MW8CLK|5.0|Siamese Dream has songs that are better but Gish as a whole album is the best Smashing Pumpkins masterpiece. Just listen to Gish! It should be listened to from beginning to end. Alternating between driving hard forward, with terrific guitar playing, to moody intimacy, the album has an organic integration and sense of life. It's beautiful and rocking.<br /><br />The many guitar tones are interesting and express the artistry well. All the playing -- drumming, bass and especially the guitar jamming -- is terrific and in sync. Definitely one of the 100 best albums of all time. Just listen to it.<br /><br />The bonus DVD concert is rather bad, so do not buy this for the DVD. If you are looking for an early DVD concert, consider [[ASIN:B000077VR9 Smashing Pumpkins: Vieuphoria Live]] from 1994 or even the[[ASIN:B005MW8CUG Siamese Dream Deluxe Edition]] bonus DVD. But definitely listen to the masterpiece Gish!
B005HET9U6|1.0|Star Trek - Next Generation - Instant Video - This episode - Season 6 episode 17 is now unavailable.  Yet, it's Part II to episode 16. So it's integral!  It needs to be fixed - and made available.  Amazon advertised that ALL STAR TREK episodes were available through instant video FREE with Prime.  This one is not.  Please fix.  Thanks - Dave
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is great for beginners and mid-road lifters, simple straight to the point with no BS!  I have read many fitness books, none have ever put things this simple, easy to put into action and is also very captivating.  Found myself unable to stop reading it, will be reading it for the third time tomorrow just for fun!!<br /><br />Update 5 years later:<br />This is still one of the best fitness books out there!  I fell off the wagon a couple years ago, rereading this to get back in shape (5 years later).  Timeless good advice!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|this book is not only hot but tantalizing and very sexy. I cant get enough time to read it at once so i pick it up every free minute..
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books for this movie but for once actually enjoyed seeing the movie as much as I did reading the book. This is a good action packed movie and I felt it helped me understand what was going on having read the book first. I am looking forward to the sequels. I love movies where the gal is tough.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It was fun playing solitaire. Got stumped a few times.  Would like a little more animation.  Was great playing against my friends.
0817439390|5.0|This book has definitely met my expectations. There seems to be an on-slot of photography books available now. I was able to look at the substance of the book on line and know I would like it. So many of the 'new' books now are just reprints of books written in the 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s. It is refreshing to have a book that shows pictures you like and tells you what exposure setting were used. I like this book and find it very useful.
B003YTLKTE|4.0|Rented this after I heard my son playing and singing music from it.  Rented the Non hd version later so my son could watch.  I enjoyed the story and people, the relationship between two people that although became loving, never crosses the line but actually salvages their chances with their previous loves.  Moving music and plot, think I will buy the album!
B002APS61I|5.0|I think that this adaptation/movie of Pride & Prejudice is the best I have seen so far.  I truly love the movie and the actors chosen to play in it.  I just love it!
B005RUV0NY|5.0|I think I like this season better than season 1, the show moves a lot faster in this season. I'm excited for season three, and I'm sure they won't disappoint! Ive watched trailors for three it looks intense!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Awesome, gut-wrenching, inspirational.  I recommend viewing this video with the focus not on the horrifying idea of children being compelled to kill one another, but about one girl's dedication to her family, self-reliance and confidence in surviving at all costs.
B00122KV5O|5.0|Great Album, great sound, and a great price.  I'm very happy with my purchase and although it's missing a few songs that I would have personally included, it's worth the money!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|His books make u realize how special and lucky we actually are. I can't stop reading his books so I hope he keeps writing.
B0028INIWE|5.0|The Grateful Dead have written and produced so many songs that narrowing the songs to fit on a single \\"Best of\\" is nearly impossible, but I think they included some great compilations on this album.  I was also GRATEFUL (sorry, couldn't resist) for the price of the download - thank you Amazon!!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The Hunger Games was a very entertaining movie. I enjoyed it. However, given all the hype, I expected it to be better than it was. Definitely not a 5 star movie, but a fun watch.
B00260HH3K|1.0|To me, this is just a DISGRACE to the best Action Cartoon of ALL TIME! This is my favorite childhood cartoon and they had to make it look like a joke.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was just as good as the 1st in the trilogy I am reading the 3rd book now, I always get my books from Amazon and my wife does also
B006OCM0G0|5.0|please don't update like bakery story pleeeeeease I love this game and I don't want to be forced to delete!!
B001230JXC|5.0|The band Depeche Mode is one of the most ground breaking groups.  They have always looked outside of the box when it comes to composing music.  Never trying to stay in any type of norm.  This caused them to effect many types of music in a way a lot of people don't realize.  This particular album I find enjoyable, because it does not include any of the music that fell into the to 40 category, like People are People.  This album also seems to reflect the more dark side of the group.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|I have loved this book for a long time. Now I can carry it with me and read parts whenever I want.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|If you can get past the first book, the others are really good!<br />The phycological conflicts are really interesting. You can't take your eyes of to know what happens next!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I picked this book out randomly and I could not put it down. Very easy read and intense love story! Loved it!
B00843TZJ2|5.0|Keep in mind, I'm an old rock n roll guy. If you are a fan, buy it. I saw them in July and was blown away and I have see them many times. Yes, Stills voice isn't there but he is absolutely one of the best guitarist in history. He actually stole the show. These yahoo's who say they have lost it, don't know good rock n roll.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|While the \\"story line\\" is addictive, how many ways can you talk about sex? I purchased to see what all the talk was about. Honestly, I became bored with it. Just my opinion. Most of my friends were captivated.
0307951529|5.0|I'm not at all a person who comes from a family or group of friends that have a good business sense or even previous experiences with opening a business.  I had no idea what it took and I always thought I wouldn't be able to do it.  This book makes it all easier to understand and the stories are a great resource on how easy it really is.  I highly recommend it to get a sense of what others have done and how you can relate your passion to a potential business opportunity.  Ever since reading it I have been enthusiastic about my potential ventures and truly see how the \\"sky is the limit\\".  The author shares that people aren't necessarily having to do innovative things...just simple things that you know you're filling a niche in.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I like this game for the most part.I have issues with visiting friends..most of. thetime I get stuck.overall I enjoy this game.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great relaxing game! Great workout for your brain. The music seems to relax you and put you in a trance. Great UI and graphics. Highly recommend!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excellent book.  A great story that excites the imagination and full of adventure.  This is a rather long book and If you'r like me and dont fund you have much time to read, you will find that you make time for this book.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|The music is excellent.  I really enjoy listening to it.  It is one of the best cds that I have.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This is probably a very good app. I've heard good things about this app and Pinterest itself, but I am unable to sign up through the app or login, so I don't have much to judge. I hope someone else can access Pinterest through this app, and that's all I have to say. Goodbye, and goodluck with this app to anyone who buys it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator.  The program expans to the size of my fire screen and it makes it easy to use because the buttons are large.
0307592731|1.0|Thankfully I took this book out through my local library and avoided wasting my money. The book starts out ok, but it then devolves into plain horrible. I really cannot understand the hype around this book or it's author. Sometimes success just falls into the laps of people who in no way deserve it. And as far as authenticity goes anyone who knows a thing or two about serious backpacking and hiking will recognize that there is plenty in this book that is just pure fiction (out of shape heroin junkie w/no common sense walks into the wilderness with a pack strapped to her back that she can't even pick up on her own, 27+ pounds of it supposedly just water, no adequate supplies, and manages to hike hundreds of miles...yea right! seems like another \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" to me). The biggest scam is that the author market's the book as being about the PCT when in actuality it has little to do with hiking the PCT, and in fact she talks about cutting out hundreds of miles of the most scenic aspects of the trail to hitch hike. I could have forgiven this deception if the book was at least well written by someone with half a brain, but unfortunately even that expectation turned out to be too lofty. Pure disappointment and a huge waste of time. Half way through the book I was suffering from total boredom, the author goes on and on about the same sh*t, totally self absorbed, with no class to boot. Move on people, nothing entertaining or enlightening here. The book's best used as kindling!
B008MEM24S|4.0|The grandkids like it! We have \\"Where's My Water\\" which the older ones like better, but \\"Where's My Perry\\" is just as much fun and is easier for the four year old.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and addictive can't put it down. It helps pass the time and has different levels. Worth getting and adding to your games. Works good on Kindlefire as well.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|When I purchased the Teen Wolf dvds, I expected to receive a copy of the first season of Teen Wolf. What I actually received was so much more. A gag reel has been included. Multiple episode commentaries are included. A featurette highlighting the many shirtless scenes from the first season is included. Would purchase again.
B00448SE4S|5.0|I'm amazed at how many reviews panned this movie!  It's awesome in so many ways!  Is it Citizen Kane or Casablanca?  No, but it has humor, cool FX, and hot chicks!  The humor can be subtle but powerful.  For example, when Scott's high school girlfriend, a Chinese girl named Knives Chau, stops by to check out a band rehearsal Scott introduces her to the drummer, a girl named Kim.  Knives acts like she's never heard the name Kim before, which is very ironic since she's Asian.  I'm 46 years old and this movie has enough old references for people of my generation to appreciate.  First of all, the special FX are video game based, but they use 8 bit sound and graphics.  The story may not be for everyone, but it's entertaining IMHO and well worth the purchase.<br /><br />The vendor shipped right away and the package was wrapped in bubble wrapped and in excellent condition so a big thumbs up all the way around!
0061801313|5.0|Loved the books, cant wait to buy the next set. Wish they were a ittle longer. But they are great.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Only twice in my life have I failed to finish reading a book, the first being Forrest Gump, and the second being this elementary and nauseating excuse for literature called Fifty Shades of Grey.  I am not a prude, but neither am I a sheep to mindlessly bleat my group-think approval of a book that could well have been written by a first-year college student of English. They would have maybe earned a grade of C.  The sex described in the first 3/4 of this book is so mainstream as to be laughable, the story line is classic Harlequin, and the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Level can't possibly be above Grade 8! This book is a prime example of what group think does to otherwise intelligent people, when someone is afraid of appearing to be \\"not with it\\" so they proclaim to LOVE IT.  What a waste of my time!
B005KDWUFA|2.0|I do like their singing but the album is very short for listening. Just wish it was longer. Well what can you expect for 10 dollars? Kinda disappointed.
B005CWRB44|2.0|First I want to say that I submitted this review on Fenix's website but they wouldn't post it.<br /><br />Although the E15 R2 is compact, bright and well-made I was extremely disappointed to find that the E15 technically has no physical On/Off switch.<br /><br />The Fenix documentation on their website refers to the light as having a \\"Twisty mode switch\\" which I mistakenly took to mean that there was a switch built into the lens/LED module which allowed you to turn it through four distinct positions.  In reality you're really screwing/unscrewing the light module from the barrel of the flashlight.  Whether the light is on or off, there's a bronze ring of exposed threads around the light.  This allows debris to get into the threads making the light more difficult to turn on and off.  I agree with other reviews which state that Fenix's choice of wording on their web site is deceptive in regards to the switch.<br /><br />The documentation also mentions one-handed operation to turn the light on and off but I found it very difficult to do this with one hand since the amount of twisting required to turn the light on/off was more than I could accomplish with one `twist'.  Changing the brightness levels also required a rapid twisting action that I couldn't perform with one hand.  Once the light is on the threads are still exposed so if you want to make sure the light is truly waterproof to IPX-8 you will probably need to screw down the LED module completely which also really has to be done with two hands.  If you are not fond of twisting the Lens/LED module to turn the light on and off then beware of any Fenix light that references a form of the word `twist' in describing the on/off switch as They have other lights with this same \\"Twisty mode switch\\" configuration.  Fenix's choice of wording on their web site is deceptive.<br /><br />One other small item, occasionally, when carrying the unit in my pocket, I will remove the light to find it on due to movement twisting the light on which is also not good considering a CR123 battery is a little over $6.00.<br /><br />If the E15 had a switch on the end of the barrel or a 4-position switch built into the LED module this would be a great little light.  If nothing else there should be a flange on the LED module that extends over the threads whether the light is on or off.  I just expected a little more for a $30.00 keychain flashlight.  If I had it to do all over again I would sacrifice the small size, spend the extra money and get something with a switch.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|would highly recommend this app...love the easy use...works perfect and always handy. no frustrsting ads to deal with. download now and enjoy
B00634GHJA|4.0|It's a simple app that does its thing very well. And now w/ ICS it's really great with the OS's changes in file transfers. I'd just wish the recieving browser windows had more options, bit still a great app.
034580404X|5.0|I have really enjoyed the \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" trilogy. The books are both disturbing and addictive and are unlike anything else I have ever read. Can't wait for the movie!
B008DVJO8C|1.0|Crap. One word fully describing what Blood is. I had been a big fan on the band. Their first 2 albums were really good. It had tunes like Ashes, Beautiful Tragedy, The Last Cowboy and especially Iron Army; but the band that made that music is now gone - be very clear on that matter (and check out the band photo on the album back). Now we're left with what I call techno-nu metal B.S.. Some of these tunes barely count as songs; just her screaming for 4 minutes straight. Total f'ing B.S. in my book. No song creativity at all and appealing to one of the lowest forms of metal: nu-metal. Go get Testament's Dark Roots of the Earth, it just came out, that album kicks serious ass. R.I.P. In This Moment.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book!!!  Didn't want to put it down. Was also happy with the fact that I could buy the whole trilogy at once. I had heard great things about Christian Grey, and he lived up to my expectations!!!
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Long time Testament fan. This album kicks ass!! It is very possibly the best metal album of 2012, it's that good. Make sure you get the deluxe version with the 3 bonus cover tune tracks (Dragon Attack/Queen, Animal Magnetism/Scorpions and Powerslave/Iron Maiden). All 3 are outstanding cover tunes. Testament went above and beyond on these tunes in my book. They made them Testament tunes, really great stuff. The entire album is great. Native Blood and American Hate are stand outs, but I can literally listen to the whole album over and over; no leave outs on this album. See other reviews for song details; just buy the album. You're not a metal fan if you don't have this album.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|its a great game to fill time but don't plan on wanting to put it down. whatever you are waiting for will end up waiting!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Nice app but it will continue running in background to drain battery and doesn't let you re-sort the locations you track for weather.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great movie and the quality of the streaming was great! It showed up on my XBOX Amazon Instead Video really fast. No hassle at all.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|loads of fun! I wound up playing the entire game several times just to beat my previous scores. Great to pull out when you've got a few mins to waste... just don't be surprised if more time passes than you'd planned.
B004QL7K70|3.0|The concept for this movie is great, but the execution is terrible. The idea to go with the handheld el cheapo looking Blair Witch Project ripoff video style was dumb. It's a movie! Spring for some film stock so at least it could be watchable.<br /><br />The other problem is the script. There are virtually no laughs in it at all. The only scene that got me chuckling was when (many SPOILER ALERTS ahead) the drug dealer shows up and starts flamethrowing the neighborhood. That was so out of the blue and then when the cops show up it gets at least good from the aspect of watching disaster porn.<br /><br />The main problem with this movie, despite the fairly likable trio of high school kids who \\"run\\" the party, is not only does the dialogue between them seem written by a complete idiot who thinks teenagers talk that way now, but the outrageous stuff just seems so lame when you cut right to the core of the stunts. Get this: There are two live DJs playing the party and not a single memorable song. Was there no budget to spring for some decent electronic tunes and not this mush they came up with? Go have a listen to the soundtrack from Go to get an idea how how to blend cool house sounds with an off-the-wall plot.<br /><br />Kid jumps off roof. Been done before. Remember Almost Famous?<br />Car drives into pool. Seriously? Oh, we've never seen that in a movie before.<br />A midget? A lone midget shows up and proceeds to punch kids in the nuts. Sorry, Mini Me was funnier in the Austin Powers series.<br />Teenage girls go topless in the backyard pool...and that's it. They just splash around in the pool. It's like voyeur porn for 12-year-olds.<br />Don't even get me started on the clips of people dancing which basically consist of let's see some chick do a booty grind against some boy for two seconds. Ooh, cutting edge.<br />Oh, yeah, some old dude with an '80s 'stache shows up to party demonstrating his beer pong skills. Snooze and fest!<br /><br />You get the picture. Incredibly uncreative when you look back at the various party movies from Risky Business through Sixteen Candles to Dazed And Confused ....even such B level flicks as Can't Hardly Wait are better. Then the movie falls back into the typical Hollywood boy likes girl, girl likes boy, boy screws up, girl tells him to hit the road, boy wins her heart in the end. Really? This epic party wasn't enough. Had to fall back on the tried and true high school love story plot point?<br /><br />The best scenes are at the end where you get clips of Jimmy Kimmel or local LA news morning show anchors talking about what happened as if the party was \\"real.\\" Now those were actually funny.ibly uncreative when you look back at the various party movies from Risky Business through Sixteen Candles to Dazed And Confused ....even such B level flicks as Can't Hardly Wait are better.

B000001ZS3|3.0|I don't know much about French synthesizer music composer Jean-Michel Jarre, except that he's the estranged son of famed Hollywood movies soundtrack composer Maurice Jarre, and that his open-air concerts are always very popular and often attended by millions of spectators. Personally I must have listened his 2007 concept album \\"Teo and Tea\\" at least 6 or 7 times while playing video games, so no matter how much his music can be criticized the results are there. At the beginning of his career Jean-Michel Jarre also wrote lyrics for French singer/songwriter Christophe including his critically acclaimed album \\"Les Mots Bleus\\". Regarding this 6-tracks 40-minutes 1976 album \\"Oxygene\\", the overall sound is not very creative or inspired except the last track #6 who is really much better and made with more artistic sense. As far as I'm concerned if all the album was that good I would have given it 4 or 5 stars instead or a little 3, so apparently he know how to write great music. His music is seemingly quite uneven, he seem like the kind of guy who would write things he know are going to sell instead of writing really inspired things like Vangelis does. In any case his sound remember me of Wendy Carlos, her soundtrack for the Stanley Kubrick movie \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" for example. Overall personally I would say that choosing which of his albums to buy is much of a gamble, in any case buying a concert DVD instead along with that CD could could be a better idea.
B006OV7S1I|3.0|Creepy but ultimately hollow movie (plus many SPOILER ALERTS coming up so...read on at your own risk). The acting is first-rate and Elizabeth Olsen is a force to be reckoned with. The main problem is the flashing back and forth between the past and present gets annoying after awhile. Plus it relies way too much on cinematic tricks such as Martha Marcy May Marlene (MMMM) talking about something, say, in the present but as the camera pans it'll show her in the past as the scene continues. Clever, yes, but super annoying when it's overused.<br /><br />Lastly, the cult is never explained and I'm all for leaving things up in the air but what was the point of it all? Free sex for the guys in the cult. Plus what was up with the guys singing songs playing acoustic guitars? Let alone what is the need to show MMMM being raped not once but twice in this flick.<br /><br />The worst part is the fact MMMM calls her sister after two years of no contact and her sister never really questions what MMMM has been up to? Even after MMMM climbs into bed while her sister and her husband are doing the horizontal mambo and  the freakout over that ends with a thud.<br /><br />Even worse for some reason the DVD I got when you go to the extras nothing happens except a few scenes loop over and over. The whole thing is plain odd.
B00006LLOG|5.0|This 1972 album, produced by David Bowie, is the first real solo album made by Lou Reed after the split of his 60s band \\"The Velvet underground\\"; his other solo album was made mostly of leftover music from his \\"Velvet Underground\\" years. While not as prolific as Serge Gainsbourg and without his great voice, Lou Reed's \\"Transformer\\" is in my opinion among the best things peoples could possibly expect coming from a salad bar. It include well-known classics such as \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" and \\"Perfect Day\\", and every other songs are made with the same spirit in mind, so the record practically listen itself over and over again. The quality of the sound is also excellent considering it's an album recorded in the early 70s. This \\"deluxe\\" 30th Anniversary re-release include some extras such as two acoustic demo tracks and a radio spot produced to promote the album at the time; they describe Lou Reed as \\"the real thing in the midst of all the make-believe madness of mock depravity and pseudo-sexual anarchists\\", to use the exact words. There's also a very interesting booklet containing information and pictures regarding the story behind the album. The other side of it is a replica of the original vinyl's back featuring a picture of a drag-queen with a giant... hum... scrotch. In the booklet they explain that they \\"got this result by stuffing a banana in the drag queen's pants. Where did peoples think the album's title \\"Transformer\\" came from?\\". These days Lou Reed released a an album of pictures he took of New York City, and he's also apparently trying to learn how to play golf. Overall this album is essential in any respectacle pop-rock music collection, especially this 2002 BMG re-release.
B008602KQI|5.0|Wow.  I can't wait for the next movie!  And I love being able to watch the movie on my tv or ipad.
0440243688|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Lee Child's books, but read them because my boyfriend loves them.  I like to read them for a little escape and a quick read.  This one, however, was especially good and entertained me from the beginning to end.  It was exciting and had a good plot.  I am getting used to his character development (not complicated) and his sentence structure (short).  Brevity is not always a bad thing. I recommend this book with no reservation as a fun, entertaining, and absorbing read.  I read it in one day!
B0086DBE62|4.0|Since I am a fan of Julia Roberts, I was hoping that it was a decent movie. However, when it did not last very long at the theaters, I became a little skeptical. Thank goodness I was wrong, especially considering all of the recent fairy tale movies that have come out.

0525953728|4.0|It's a great read. The language is simple and straightforward. There's lots of action. It's a story well told, and I'm sure it will accomplish what the author says he wants to accomplish -- convince some future teenage boy to become a SEAL. (In the meantime, it will convince many a middle-aged man that he SHOULD have become a SEAL!) It's exciting to get a first-person account. Makes you feel like you're having a beer with the author, but at the same time reminds you of the history involved.<br /><br />My only disappointment in this book -- and it's small, and on me rather than the author -- is that the story is so deeply personal. It's like looking at the raid through night vision glasses: what's visible is what's directly ahead of you. It's not yet the whole story of the raid, just one participant's experience of it. Owen acknowledges the contributions of the CIA analysts, the planners and the politicians, but finding out what some of their experiences were and including them was never part of his mission in writing the book. This is not quite the book that makes you feel satisfied you know the whole story. I'm looking forward to Mark Bowden's take on the raid.<br /><br />In the meantime, though, this is a good book to settle back with, enjoy, and marvel at how well the raid turned out. And maybe raise a glass to Owen and his fellow SEALS.
B000P0J024|5.0|I'd been looking for this music for about 20 years!  I guess many of the songs were stuck in legal limbo.  Glad to see it is available.  Quality was great, music was even better.  Long Live the Traveling Wilburys!

B005SCSL56|5.0|I love this book. It's full of twists and turns. I can't believe that  Chris Colfer wrote it. you would never think of him as an author! It's amazing!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found this mystery to be the best plotted book I've read in quite some time.  I think the author did a masterful job and was very clever to keep the reader guessing what could possibly happen next.  I could not put the book down, and, though I have read it several weeks ago, I still think of Amy and Nick.  Flynn's descriptions brought all the characters to life, wherever the reading took place.  My mind's eye could seem them.  The character's lines were quite witty at times.  I have recommended this book for our book club reading and am now enjoying some of Flynn's other works.
