B003O86FMW|5.0|I  can't wait to read book 3!  I can't download it fast enough.  I love it when I get lost in a good book, and this is a great book!  Well done Suzanne Collins!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|This is definitely a great game, if you like games such as League of Legends, Heroes of Newarth, or Dota 1-2, this game is for you, AND its on the go :) .  The big problem (for my Kindle Fire HD at least) is the game is really buggy, slow, glitchy, and crashes about 80% of the time just on start up.  This can easily be one of my favorite apps on Kindle fire or from Gameloft in general.  But knowing that I can barely play it is definitely a let down.  4 stars for now, an EASY 5 if they can fix the connection/quality issues.
B0081X8AE6|5.0|This singer has not only an amazing voice, but his songs enter into your heart. They are so full of sorrow and hope , all at the same time. Can't listen often enough , looking forward to more.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's a Christmas classic that everyone should watch during the holidays.  In fact it should be mandatory.  It's a &#34;must have&#34; title if you haven't added it to your collection yet.
B0019IB0II|4.0|This book really helped me understand a lot about what stroke victims go through. It helped me to understand how different every stroke victim's recovery may be and it also gave me hope for my family member. I found it very insightful and interesting.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I seriously enjoyed this book because (1) I too love footnotes, and (2) it was SO funny!! I found myself giggling away on the train and other public places, thanks to this book. Recommend for a fun, lighthearted read.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I loved this book and read it in a 2 day period on vacation. I hadn't seen the movie yet. I thought it was a great beach read. I then watched the movie and was disappointed because the book was so much better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is great.  I could not put it d, read it in 2 days and I can't wait to start the next book in the series.  Great read for teens and adults.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't read a lot of Stephen King but I do like books about JFK. This was an interesting plot tying into history. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it. Don't be intimidated by the size of the book, it will go quickly. It is a really easy, fun read.
B000J10ERO|3.0|It is still a hell of a lot better than Superman III or IV. It's not perfect by any stretch, and it made Superman into kind of EMO metrosexual(not to mention the \\" Truth, Justice and all that stuff\\"(instead of the American way) quote by Perry White, but it still helped wash the Superman IV taste out of my mouth. The only redeeming quality of Superman III was the fight between Clark Kent and Superman. No, it's not even close to as good as Superman : The Movie or Superman II, but I will accept it as the end of a trilogy since it is meant as a loose sequel to Superman II.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|Metallica have always been a band that tries to mold to the music of the times without shedding what made them famous to begin with,which is why theyve survived so long. Metallica is just one example of this. When Bob Rock was hired to produce the bands self titled gem in 1991,a lot of people were puzzled with the result. And i was one of the few who listened to it and said...why???!!! This is actually a step up from their previous albums,if im legally allowed to state that. While i admire and love to death the preceeding four albums,this effort proved Metallica had the balls to experiment and still make a masterpiece. Clocking in at 63 minutes,Metallica produced such MTV favorites as Enter Sandman and The Unforgiven,while also belting out classics such as Nothing Else Matters and Sad But True. Thee tour to support Metallica lasted two years and gained the band a newer audience. I'm of the mindset that if you like a band,you should respect whatever direction that band tries to take,even if you dont like it. and Metallica proves it. This is 10 bucks well spent if you can spare it. Best enjoyed with your stereo cranked to high
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Lots of great music, this is a great follow up to preceding CD, like high school with more ego, like college on 'roids, its not noise, its music and it is very moving.
B000005RFQ|5.0|1983. A troubled time for both Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. On the Purple front,the band had already been broken up for almost 10 years. The members had gone their separate ways and formed successful solo acts. On the Sabbath front,frontmen Ozzy Osbourne and Ronnie James Dio had been given the boot. What better way to bring together the sounds of these bands than of course bring them together? Enlisting the vocal talents of Ian Gillan Black Sabbath bring an updated metal sound to their already impressive discography. Born Again may not have the production quality of earlier albums or even the musical prowess but it has it where it counts and god does it show it. Tracks like Disturbing The Priest and Zero The Hero unlock a door to a side of Sabbath previously unseen. Thundering bass lines,mind shredding guitar,and crushing drums are what shread your ears for 41 minutes. It has its downsides but as in most cases with Sabbath the good outweighs the bad. Bassist Geezer Butler would leave Sabbath for almost 10 years following this album and the following albums reflect this painfully. In my opinion,Sabbath doesnt rock this hard again until Headless Cross. If you're the type to go on faith,test yours and buy this album. Rock on metal lovers!!!!
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|Tries to mimick the Twilight series. Terrible plot, terrible acting, waste of time and money. Don't rent this, run away...far away.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|The entire album is great. I love how JT extends his songs! It'd be nice if he'd let someone other than Timbaland produce (or whatever he does on JT's cds) his music though...I'm so over his mixes/sounds.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|He's so good at weaving a good story.  Love the blending of historical fiction with non-fiction.  Can't wait to read the third in the trilogy!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time! I read it in two days (well at night after work before falling asleep.) Any business person, entrepreneur, dreamer, or the like MUST read this book!
B006M4F67A|4.0|I love almost all Mahjong games. I have them on my cell phone on my computer It's just hours and hours of fun
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just lost four hours of sleep and I love it. A great puzzle game and mystery. I have<br />to  quit and get some sleep I hate it.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Bought this for my son when he was born. The animal was a little small so it didnt quite keep the pacifier in place, but for the price it was great!
B003DES8I6|5.0|Great Action Movie! Very intense! The acting and plot are very well thought out! Norman Reedus shows why He's such a versatile Actor..
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|If you are a lover of le Carre's work from the days of George Smiley this is for you. his writing is unsurpassable and just a pleasure to read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We love this show!  The banter and smart plot makes it one of our favorites.  We highly recommend it and look forward to more episodes being added to Prime.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Sad and tragic story. A little gory in parts,but necessary. I liked the authenticity of the main character. You wonder what happens to children when they live through something like this. Although it was fiction, it felt real. Good ending, unlike Gone Girl!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Love this Hannibal. Made my stomach churn and turn on some very scenes of murder and mayhem, but the psychological fun comes in when Hannibal is just so good at how he handles the mind of so many that just a second away to discovering the truth. Thank you, I look forward to season 2!
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|THE REVIEWER THAT GAVE 2 STARS HIT IT ON THE HEAD MOSTLY. BUT I'VE BEEN A SABBATH FAN SINCE DAY ONE AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THEY (SABBATH) HAVE HAD MANY YEARS TO PERFECT THIER TALENTS THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF DRIVEL SINCE OZZY LEFT. THE 1ST MISTAKE WAS PUTTIN' RUBIN IN CHARGE, WHAT THE HELL DOES HE KNOW ABOUT HEAVY METAL? CHECK HIS RAP SHEET! SEEING HOW BOB EZRIN MADE DEEP PURPLE SOUND GREAT THIS TIME AROUND YOU WOULD THINK THEY COULD HAVE GOT HIM BUT NOOOOO!  IF OZZY BY HIMSELF CAN PUT OUT SUCH GREAT MUSIC HOW COME NONE OF IT FOUND IT'S WAY ON THIS PROJECT. IMHO THE SAB'S SHOULD JUST WRAP IT UP YOU JUST DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE AND YOU TOO OLD TO BOTHER.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Funny, entertaining, illuminating, and an engaging portrayal of the intricacies of judgement, perception, and social/psycological labeling.  All of this wrapped in a love story with a dance competition as the true test of transformation. Awesome.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I no longer have a record player for this album and was so glad to order it from Amazon. Getting this cd and bonus download on Amazon Cloud was really terrific! I hadn't used the Cloud before and I am thrilled.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I'm happy to have Josh Groban's new CD!  His style has changed somewhat since his early music, but I am still entertained by his distinct sound. Love it!
1781162646|5.0|JOYLAND<br /><br />Stephen King does it again for me -- and many, many others -- with his latest and one of his greatest, JOYLAND.  Part love story, part coming of age story, part ghost story, part mystery, and ALL Stephen King, this book has something for everyone.  I could not turn the pages quickly enough.<br /><br />Narrated by an aged Devin Jones, he recollects his 21st year of life, having his heart broken by being rejected by a girl he thought he loved, going to college, deciding to work the summer at a carnival located on the beach near the ocean, namely one JOYLAND.<br /><br />Devin meets and makes new friends, learns how to do virtually every job a carnival has to offer, and learns there was a murder there years ago in the Horror House.  Some say that the murdered girl still haunts the ride and many have claimed to even have seen her over the years.<br /><br />King writes his mystery novel as fluidly and smoothly as he does his horror. If you are looking for the writing we all loved in THE SHINING, THE STAND, or SALEM'S LOT, you won't find that in this book.  You WILL find the magnificent writing style of Mr. King, but this time his genre is mystery, love, the human touch of a young college kid, a good guy, trying to do the best he can.<br /><br />King also admits to doing his carnival homework, working in true carnival slang and jargon, making the book read all the more realistically.  Go back to the early 1970's to an era where the world is changing and life still offers up a boatload of mystery and unanswered questions.<br /><br />And this is some of the best that Stephen King has to offer --  I loved this book, read it in a mere few hours of time.  The suspense is thick, the story line thrilling, the characters fleshed-out and real.  You will fall in love -- like I did -- with Annie and Mike and Milo and Mrs. Shoplaw and Fortuna -- and all of the carnies, and Erin and Tom -- King makes you care about every single person he introduces you to, pulling you into their lives and the story at hand.  More than once King did one thing to me that he rarely does -- he brought me to tears on more than one occasion.  This book can also be considered a tear-jerker -- and that's OK!<br /><br />Should you read JOYLAND?  YES!!!!!  I found this book to be refreshing, mysterious, intelligent, captivating, stimulating, and downright FUN --  Mr. King -- you have done it again.  So, get inside the ferriswheel car, buckle up, pull the bar down tight, and hang on for the ride of your life!<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Pamu into their lives and the story at hand.  More than once King did one thing to me that he rarely does -- he brought me to tears on more than one occasion.  This book can also be considered a tear-jerker -- and that's OK!<br /><br />Should you read JOYLAND?  YES!!!!!

B001EBWIRW|5.0|Great movie.  I used to watch this all the time when I was young with my cousin. We would sing all the songs
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I hate her endings. But I love the books. I really like the storyline that fills the gaps between the sex
B008IJT0CE|5.0|A large selection of nature sounds and ambient music tracks to choose from.  I like being able to layer one track over another to get the feel you like such as waterfall plus birds and frogs to get a rainforest feel, or rain and crickets. You can adjust the volume of each track separately to get the effect you desire. The binaural beats also adds the finishing touch to make this a truly useful relaxation/meditation app. I would like some more forest sounds (Australian if possible) , campfire and rain on tent sounds but the current selection is great, especially for the rain and water sounds I prefer.
0385341008|5.0|After enjoying this historically-based novel, especially for the ways books and the love of reading influenced the lives of Shaffer's endearing characters, I bought copies as gifts for my elderly volunteers who share their own passion for reading with my first grade students. I hope these volunteers will be drawn into the story, as I was, and that they will be inspired to continue to promote reading as a life-long privilege and adventure.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is lots of fun,but it takes to long to earn investment points. Also upgrading buildings and trucks burn too much energy. It would be nice to store a building when trying to rearrange your city.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love Lindsey's mash up of electronic music with her violin. So unique! If you want to hear it before you buy, check out her video for &#34;Shadows&#34; on YouTube.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie inline with the book and the book is way better. The plot is much more straightforward and comprehensive than the movie. The movie was like unlinked series of events because the movie script did very poorly of explaining the actions of Katniss. Katniss in the book was a smart woman who knew how to hunt and fend for herself because of the time she spent with Gale. The movie Katniss appeared to wander aimlessly without reason for her survival of the Hunger Games.<br /><br />If you don't want to waste any time, just read this book instead of watching the movie.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|The game is fun and I really enjoyed it but say u need  a particular plant but it costs like 10 pearls and u have only2 then u have to  wait 6weeks until u get 10  pearls or buy a pack of pearls 4 2$ why pay why not for free?I mean is it really worth it?
0375812024|5.0|My 4 year old son enjoys me reading this book to him and I enjoy reading it to him. A lot going on in the book to keep it interesting. It's got a cute little story, too, although I don't understand how a bratwurst balloon crashing into a house is a good thing.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|If you want to know the truth about how to help our students, read this book.  It is thorough, filled with research, and tells the truth. Let's stop wasting money on policies that do not work.<br />This is a great book!
0439023521|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and was sure he would hate it. But it turns out we both loved it and continued on to read the rest of the series. This one is by far the best though. Highly recommend.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|At first I was skeptical with this novel... But the truth is that when I turned the pages, I could not simply stop! Addictive reading, to say the least!
0694003611|5.0|What's not to like? I have never met a kid that didn't like this book. I was read it as a kid and it was the first book that I bought my son. My now 4 year old son still loves it. He especially loves the old lady whispering \\"Hush\\". He pushes me over when I say the word \\"hush\\". I don't get it. But, leave it to a boy to turn reading Good Night Moon into a physical activity.
1932100660|5.0|This is a love-hate book.  It educates you on the effect diet has on your life.  After 2 years following this book's recommendations, at age 57 and a height of 6 ft., my cholesterol went fom 240 to 139, weight from 180 to 149, BP dropped by 70 points on the top number and 25 on the bottom, and I feel great.  The problem is that it provides a level of understanding that isolates you in most circles and makes one judgemental of the diet chioces of others.  So now I have been making conversions of others.  If enough people follow where the research in this book takes you, it could destroy a large segments of the economy in heathcare, agriculture, retail sales, and petrolium.  Be very afraid.
B000U6BT40|4.0|no cussing, no awful violence, no sex.  Wholesome, great for children who like sci fi.  I recommend this series to everyone.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Sometimes it's good when the underdog overachiever makes good.  This seems to be the case with this series, although in real life it wouldn't be that east to pull off.  That's why it's fun to watch.

B008JJM88Q|3.0|It is an all right game for short periods of time.  It is very different and God to switch to to get some rest from the more intense games.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game that I found is wonderful and is very realistic to the underwater/ocean theme .I love Disney and I enjoy watching Disney movies with Dad.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was a really wonderful read, parts made me cry and parts made me happy. I love to read so I'll be looking for more like this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game. Everyone that likes horses should get it. I totally recommend it to everyone. I love this game.
B004I744AS|5.0|I downloaded this dictionary thinking it would probably turn out being worth what I paid for it. I have been surprised to find how good it is. It as a lot of information for the words I look up. Very satisfied. I have told others how good it is.
B002ZG99TA|2.0|Much as I love Denzel Washington as an actor, he really jumped the shark in \\"Unstoppable\\".  He got outacted by Rosario Dawson (as a determined rail yard manager), Chris Pine (as a rookie engineer), and a runaway train.  The Denzel Washington here is essentially channeling the same roles that he played in movies like \\"The Book of Eli\\" and \\"Man on Fire\\" - calm, cool, aloof, taking the necessary actions only when he has to.  And in \\"Unstoppable\\", it comes off very dull, like you've seen it already and better, by him and some other good actors.  Dawson, Pine, and the train bail him out of this flick.<br /><br />The story, in and of itself, is compelling - a freight train is accidentally throttled to power in a rail yard and, without active air brakes to stop it, takes off down the line.  It's up to Pine, the rookie, and Washington, the old vet who found out not long before that day that the railroad was displacing him, to stop it before it reaches the city of Arklow, Pennsylvania (which, with over 700,000 people would be more populous than the state's real-life second city, Pittsburgh) and a sharp curve which sits near a Family Dollar and some fuel tanks that will undoubtably explode should the train run off the tracks and fall into them.  The execution, however, was lacking. The musical score constantly droned away while the action was taking place, not letting up a bit where it should've been much less ham-handed, and helicopters galore were giving chase at ridiculously low altitudes in order to get a good story.<br /><br />\\"Unstoppable\\" is not a movie on the order of some other notable train movies, like \\"The Cassandra Crossing\\" or \\"The Taking of Pelham One Two Three\\" (the Walter Matthau/Robert Shaw version).  Heck, it doesn't even have the camp value of the made-for-TV disaster drama \\"Atomic Train\\".  And it could've been much better than it was.  This is a good movie to while away the afternoon when there's nothing else to do, or for those who are hard-core into disaster films.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Thought this was a trilogy, no, he's going to drag it out through another generation and this time the conflict is with a S. American criminal.  Turning into a soap opera.  Waited for parts 2 and 3, not interested in part 4 and part 5 and part.....
0812993357|1.0|I enjoyed The September Issue and was hoping this book would be a continued exploration of Grace Coddington, a person I found creative, unpredictable, and thoroughly interesting. Unfortunately, her memoir paints her as the most vapid, shallow and uninteresting cliche to be found in the fashion industry. Nowhere are there insightful thoughts like in The September Issue (my favorite was her photographic advice to always keep your eyes open and not buried in a phone). Instead we're treated to such revelations about her true character (\\"I only hire beautiful assistants\\") and shallow narcissism, mostly about her clothes, hair and men. In one anecdote she recounts an attack on Anna Wintour by an animal activist. An interesting subject to explore, but all we get from Grace is a vague description of what went down (\\"Or whatever it is those anti-fur activists do...\\") It's a sentiment you'd expect from an out-of-touch, pampered and stupid Upper Eastside socialite, and - sadly - that's the picture Grace gives us in this book. A profound disappointment.
B001M4YFEA|3.0|The condition of this LP was near-mint (as advertised), but the LP label is pressed significantly off-center, on both sides, bleeding into the dead-wax lead-out grooves.  This means (esp. if you have a manual turntable) you must quickly pick up the needle when a side is over or it will skate over the paper label.  Buyer did not disclose this in his listing.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Used to be my favorite weather app. Update has made it nearly unusable.  Difficult to navigate, difficult to find desired imformation and awkward UI.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I liked this app. It guess almost everything I knew. Just one thing, though. If I'm thinking of something that is for children, and the Akinator says he knows what I'm thinking of and it's not, then he obviously doesn't know what I'm thinking of. That needs to be fixed.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|Don't expect realistic in this movie, but there is enough action to keep everyone interested.  There is a lot of shooting and fighting, but because it is so make believe, it did not bother our 9 year old son.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Yes!... Yes!... Yes!!!!  Let's start by saying that I was 80% sure that I would not like this show; I'm a LOT older than the characters; I'm a female who dislikes science fiction and video games; and I never found nerds particularly attractive. But thank god Costco had the DVDs for sale so cheaply I couldn't pass up Season One. (I won't discuss how I put the only copies of Seasons 2-4 back on the shelf because of the aforementioned uncertainty).  But thank god Amazon has them on sale, too, so that I can buy all six seasons and put them next to my other favorite show of all times, \\"Friends\\"!
1476733953|5.0|This is the first review I have done of any kind, but this story is worth a quick note. The book was so well written that my muscles are aching from all the climbs and descents from the Down Deep. Just started SHIFT...I need more!

B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|The Keith Jarrett trio's new CD with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Jack Dejohnette, though recorded four years ago, tells us their present enthusiasm and dexterity thoroughly. The trio made Japan tour in this May. They played standards in splendid ways and gave us all beautiful moments we needed from the trio like this CD. The Japanese promotor announced us, who took their every two years visiting to Japan for granted, it would become their last trio performance in Japan. The concerts, like this CD, was valuable for how it blended Jarrett's two formats, which were normally separate: fully improvised solo concerts and trio interpretations of standards. It seems Keith always feels Gary and Jack's sound as bodily sensation even when he plays alone at the solo concerts. Gary and Jack keeps sending their notes as Keith images at every time they are requested.<br /><br />First tune &#34;Solar,&#34; recorded for Walkin' by Miles, is a replay from the trio's Tribute album in '90. There they started with the atmosphere like Bill Evans Trio and moved into Keith's original &#34;Sun Prayer.&#34; Here they begins from Keith's original &#34;Deep Space&#34; and coalesce into &#34;Solar&#34; and unfolding the tune to the exhilarating states. The Trio continue this practice in &#34;Somewhere ~ Everywhere.&#34; They begins &#34;Somewhere&#34; as carefully as a prayer and eventually turned into a ritual called &#34;Everywhere,&#34; which became my favorite truck in this CD. In May tour, the trio pleased Japanese audiences with unexpected selections like &#34;Fever,&#34; &#34;St. Thomas,&#34; and &#34;It's A Raggy Waltz.&#34; In this CD Jarrett makes &#34;Tonight&#34; about ecstasy. &#34;I Thought About You&#34; is a song also picked up by Miles for his Someday My Prince Will Come session and Blackhawk's lives. In this meaning they return to where they start this CD. They might be thinking about Miles and days with him while interweaving thoughts from three lifetimes.
B002R27J1W|5.0|1) I particularly liked the way the way Hepburn,playing a blind woman,&#34;solved&#34; the case.That might seem contrived to some but,if viewers really think about it,they should realize that disabled people often do exactly that.The first evidence? She noticed that &#34;Scarsdale Sr.and Scarsdale Jr&#34; wore the same shoes!!! 2) Very much like the best Hitchcock for suspense,maybe even better than many of his films;3) Hepburn's acting was superb;so was Alan Arkin's;extremely ingenious plot;music complimented the narrative and dramatic highlights beautifully;Crenna was surprisingly good;I don't understand why Zimbalist,Jr.,was nominated for any awards because his role is so small.BUT,he was very well connected in Hollywood;4)This film far exceeded my expectations;5) I love watching films the Amazon way ( streaming) because you can go back if you missed s.t. 5 star movie
0143117009|5.0|Jared Diamond's works are getting into the limelight lately in Japan. Collapse is also translated into Japanese recently. We have developed by consuming the natural resources of the earth. Our economies heavily depend on extractive industries. Resultantly we are facing with severe problems of which will be sorted into twelve categories; destroying natural habitats, declining wild fisheries, diversity and population loss of wild species, soil damage, consuming up energy sources, shrinking drinkable fresh water, photosynthetic ceiling, introducing toxic chemicals, planting alien species, green house gases, growing human population, putting out wastes. Inspecting several examples in the past and modern societies, Diamond concludes decline of societies tend to follow swiftly on their peaks. Society's steep decline may begin only a decade or two after the society reaches its peak numbers, wealth, and power. As an empirical fact, more people and higher population growth rate mean more poverty, not more wealth.<br /><br />As we being the cause of these environmental problems, it is no one else but us who can choose or not choose to stop causing them and start solving them. There is no other island/other planet to which we can turn for help, or to which we can export our problem. By investigating the past societies, Diamond tries to find out how societies collapse and why. Although Diamond is rather optimistic, he is very cautious in relying on new technology to solve these problems. He says advances in technology just increase our ability to do things, which may be either for the better or for the worse. New technologies, whether or not they succeed in solving the problem that they were designed to solve, regularly create unanticipated new problem. All of our current problems are unintended negative consequences of our existing technology. In the first place, he says, technological solutions to environmental problems are routinely far more expensive than preventive measures to avoid creating the problem. It is as like as to avoid getting sick is cheaper and preferable than to try to cure illnesses after they have developed.<br /><br />Examining past societies, Diamond delineates four categories of failure; fail to anticipate a problem actually arrives, fail to perceive it, fail to try to solve it, fail to succeed. We fail to anticipate our problem when we had no prior experience or forgotten as it happened so long ago. We tend to judge things suitably to us with reasonings by false analogies. The problems would be literally imperceptible, by not being on the scene, by taking the form of a slow trend concealed by wide up-and-down fluctuations, by arising from clashes of interest between people. We are prone to consider things as it being someone else's problem(ISEP.) Globalization is not restricted to good things carried only from the First to the Third World. We are directly affected by the Third World as a consequence of the globalized modern world's interconnectedness. We can no longer get away with advancing our own self-interests, at the expense of the interests of others. In that sense we are no more allowed the privilege of being the last to starve. Values acquired early live inline with our lifestyles and never again reexamined. A crux of success or failure as a society is to know which one values to hold on to, and which ones to discard and replace with new values, when times change. We may have intrinsic ability to mend our ways and increase our chances for future success. We need to learn to live within our means while freeing from clashes between short-term and long-term motives, crowd psychology, psychological denial.<br /><br />To practice long-term thinking, to make bold, courageous, anticipatory decisions at a time when problems have become perceptible but before they have reached crisis proportions and willingness to reconsider core values are crucial factors for success. Under new changed circumstances, which of thetreasured values that formerly served a society well can continue to be maintained, or instead be jettisoned and replaced with different approaches? We need to reconsider this thoroughly. Can we retain how much of our traditional consumer values and First World living standard? Economics, the industry's corporate culture, and attitudes of society/government control our society tightly and make our problem solving difficult. Changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in business environmental practices. It's time to cease the cut-throat pricing war and to recognize the environmental costs of extracting natural resources as a legitimate necessary cost. Public has the ultimate responsibility for the behavior of even the biggest business empowering and hopeful. We just need the political will to apply solutions already available.<br /><br />Diamond's approach is very persuasive by his vast knowledge about the past societies together with reliable numerical figures. When he mentions about forests management in Tokugawa era I took off my hat without hesitation to his wide range of research. &#34;Satoyama,&#34; which is infiltrated into our past way of living, is getting attention in accordance with regaining diversities of wild lives in Japan. Introduced Dutch people's words &#34;You have to be able to get along with your enemy, because he may be the person operating the neighboring pump in your polder.&#34; reached to my heart. We can't be all drown in the polders together.treasured values that formerly served a society well can continue to be maintained, or instead be jettisoned and replaced with different approaches?

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|well worth the wait<br />most enjoyable continuation for Eva and Gideon, sooo can't wait for the next in the series!!
B004EJUMT2|5.0|I had never heard of Ghost until I watched That Metal Show and saw them recommend the band.  I checked out some of their music online and decided to order this CD.  It was better than I expected and is a great listen from beginning to end.<br /><br />Very cool band.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|This is a great follow up to their previous albums.  Strange Desire and The Flame make the album stand out!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Started reading this book and as other reviewers have said originally suggested it to others however by the time I finished I had to got back to those same people and say no way,  waste of time.
B00008O31H|5.0|Real music, they know how to go it!  I think that they are bringing back blues with a touch of modernism.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Wow! If I had paid almost 30$ for the hardback version, I would have thought I was being ripped off. Its bad enough that I paid for the Kindle Version. The characters in the first two books were well thought out and the story lines were there with the sexual situations as the bonus. However, the third book just smacked of a erotic short story, with no real believable story line. I will be hard pressed to pay for book #4
B0034G4P26|5.0|This was by far one of the funnier ones I have seen in a while. My kids (6 & 4) loved it too.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Loved Up!!  It's very entertaining film;  great storyline, upbeat and went too quickly for me!  Watch it!  You won't be disappointed!
1451675046|5.0|Thank You very much Richard! You are the best writer in the World, and I will recommend your books fore all humans who are interested in our fantastic nature.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I don't really play this one much. It doesn't require a internet connection to play, and that is handy if sitting in a car somewhere and needing to pass the time.
1781162646|5.0|Not a ghoulish ghastly story from Stephen King, if that's what you're looking for.  However, it is a very well told story with a main character recounting one of those summer jobs many of us have had at a point where some changes are occurring in his life.  As with most of Mr. King's books, this one had me turning the pages rather quickly and I ended up reading it in the course of a weekend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app for my kindle. It runs good and doesn't freeze up like some other apps!!!! I really enjoy being able to pin things that I like.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I'm tempted to rate three stars on this because it wasn't a very original story. It's derivative of so many stories I've read or heard or watched before, such as the movie Battle Royale, the book and films of Lord of the Flies, the well-known short story The Lottery (written by Shirley Jackson), the film Logan's Run, and many others.<br /><br />I'm giving it four stars because, though unoriginal, it's still an enjoyable movie. I liked it, in other words (though I didn't love it). Jennifer Lawrence is certainly capable of inhabiting this role, and it doesn't hurt that she is attractive. The special effects weren't over-the-top or annoying. The fashion was annoying, in my opinion, but I'm sure it's not easy for an author and production team to predict what trends would exist in an unlikely future. Woody Harrelson was, as usual, fun to watch. Other supporting cast members performed their roles well enough.<br /><br />I might watch the sequel, but I don't think I'll be going out of my way to see it. I'll probably wait until it hits Amazon Prime or Netflix or whatever service I'm able to afford.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|The only reason I anticipated this Movie was because of it's Main Star(I am not a Fan of Arnold,I used to be but just his movies then Politically He Became Soft.and He did something disgusting which despite my Distaste and disgust with The Kennedy Family,I found wrong what he did.Did he do good in his role in this Movie Yes,Did he make a Good Comeback I will leave to so-called Critics.)The Main Star is the ZR1 Corvette In Cyber Grey Metallic,With Dark Wheels(No Chrome)Sinister,Dark yet Beautiful.Although The Co-star Would be a Camaro ZL1 Anyone who has a Soul(Meaning that likes Cars)Knows the 'Vette stole the Show.I am disappointed that this is not available as a Dvd+Blu-Ray Combo(Hit and Run does,another Movie with a Vette(Grand Sport) in it,briefly but this movie is better.)and Disappointed that it did tank at the box office(perhaps due to scandal,it could have been worse,he could have been Ted Kennedy.)And was Beaten by Mediocre movies.The Action is NOT Missing in this movie,the Plot is interesting and Again the Star Is throughout the movie.While this seems \\"Blasphemy\\" to Film connoisseurs a actor being trumped by a Mechanical Souless(to Whom?)Object I find it one of the Best if Not the Best Corvette Movies so Far(This side of Corvette Summer and 1978's Stingray)And Perhaps one of the best Gearhead flicks(except the slight at the end regarding a ProImmigration Stance Which I firmly Disagree with,immigrate here Legally.) with action to pack and a Chase that you don't have to wait for until the end like Bullitt.(A Semi truck-DumpTruck with Sleeper Looks to me Chevy Bison,Since most Vehicles are GM Supplied or Could be the Similar but less Rare GMC General)The Actors are good in the movie,Knoxville is funny,Guzman is great and his funny face makes the movie easier.Forest Whitaker as usual his schtick(typecasted sadly)as the Law moves the movie along just fine.If your not a Corvette Guy,Camaro Guy or Chevy Fan or A Gearhead there was no point reading my review nor bothering to validate it or watch the flick.If your not into Action Movies then it's not for you,If what everything I describe describes you and what your passion is then Watch The Last Stand and The special features behind the making as well as the making of Famous scene which Is Intense and some deleted and Extended scenes(There is no audio commentary the Cars talk for themselves.)make it worth buying,see it first if you wish then decide if it's right for you.The Movie gets Five Stars not for any Tearjerking tissue using acting but for it's Sheer mayhem.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Anyone who loves minecraft will love this game! It's Definitely worth the  $6.99 (Because $7.00 is an outrageous amount of money). The only problem is that on my Kindle Fire, 6.1 and 7.1 updates didn't come until like a week after they did on Apple devices. But otherwise, this is a great game!
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|Franco was not the best choice for this part. The special effects are good, but really the story is flat and not that interesting.
B007HJ91HU|1.0|I admit that I liked the first Footloose.  While it had some of those over-the-top 80s elements, the acting was reasonable, and Kevin Bacon helped make it believable.  This version of Footloose features actors who are trying way too hard to act.  I ended up stopping the film 1/2 way through because I didn't want to waste any more time.
B004PYDBVM|4.0|This should be required reading for high schoolers. Good in depth perspectives of a world unknown to the industrialized nations. Occasionally gory or graphic but to the point. Good read!
B009K0P10K|3.0|Season 1 of Revenge was moderately interesting, but Season 2 grinds to a halt.  I just want something to happen in this season!
B0087X728K|5.0|Arctic Silver has been proven to lower CPU temperatures better compared with the original factory compound or other brand compounds.
B006O5Y75Y|5.0|I admit that I always got sucked into the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston even though I knew it was campy.  &#34;Damn dirty apes.&#34;<br /><br />This new movie is by far the best in a long line, and it really helps develop the background to the whole series.  I would watch it again.
037582913X|5.0|This was my favorite book as a kid. It always made me giggle; and I would even jump at the chance for story time with my little brother so I could read it to him. Definitely a classic.
B0046UGSNS|5.0|Great Insight to Family Dynamics, Funny... Just good drama/love movie if that s what you are looking for. I'm not exacly into that exact genre of movies but I definitely enjoyed this!
B004A8ZX28|5.0|What can I say I just love Liam Neeson. I first saw him in Taken and was impressed. I just had to get more of his movies.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|I bought this for my grandson, who turns 10 tomorrow. He loves it. I don't play video games very often (even though I have 3 systems and loads of games for him to play). I decided to give it a shot, and really liked it. You have to figure out what to do the hard way (there's no real directions or words/speech). I finally made it all the way through, but just one level took me hours! It says that every journey through is different, so I intend to start again soon.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|Oh my gosh I get into the Terminator movies and I never thought I would like this type of movie. My grandsons asked me to watch it with them.
B004HMQ7AE|5.0|This movie is the greatest of all time! Phoenix and Reese are phenomenal in there role as Johnny Cash and June Carter
B0015AARJI|5.0|Yes if you buy a game you want to have enough controllers and it is best to have wireless for better movement and flexibility.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Hate this is the last book really going to miss her but i can say she went out with a bang
B00005N5S5|5.0|I love this movie. My mind changed when I actually sat down and watched one of these movies with my family.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Among the best that TV has to offer.  Didn't watch it the first time around but after watching the first episode of the first series I was completely hooked. Had to buy the second season and could hardly wait for it to arrive.  After devouring that I am now waiting for the third season to arrive.  Already thinking about the beginning of season four in January 2014.
1250006341|5.0|This was very exciting to read about the trials and tribulations that the cast of characters were going through now in the filming besides during that period of time.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I play this game offen.  I let a friends son pick a game and UNO was the game.  I am the one that plays it daily.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I like this movie, it might not be a master piece, but it was great fun watching it. The end was quiet over done and so it became more like a fun then an action movie.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|So far this third season of The Walking Dead has been a disappointment to me.  It's not as strong in plot line and seems to meander aimlessly a bit, from one episode to the next.  In some senses it seems rushed insofar as what they're cramming into each episode for developments and certain characters that were key in the first two seasons, are killed off seemingly willy-nilly, which I don't care for.  Overall, I've not found the stories nearly as engaging.  Can't say I'm a fan of the samurai-sword carrying character, seems pretty useless through the first four/five episodes and frankly the character doesn't require great acting, which is good, because the actor doesn't blow me away.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent plot. Fast paced story. Dramatic turns all the way. Touching storyline. It Looks very realistic and possible in the future.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|There is no easy way to classify this disc. But one of the first things you may note is a slight change in Keifer's voice. Gone is some of the growl of his prime Cinderella days. Most fans know of the vocal issues Tom went through in the past few years but his voice is now quite strong and well used on this collection. The opener &#34;Solid Ground&#34; is a reminder of the past from the very first guitar lick but there are surprises to come like &#34;A Different Light&#34; which follows the opener, a very well crafted song. You can hear the time that was put into making this music.<br /><br />There is even a definite hint of Nashville in a few songs especially in the brilliant &#34;Ask Me Yesterday&#34; which should be a staple on country stations (but of course will not be due to the formulaic playlists they use). But the rocker is hardly gone as evidenced on tracks like &#34;Cold Day in Hell&#34; and &#34;Ain't That a Bitch&#34;.<br /><br />I bought this disc based on the recommendations of some previous reviewers, and they were right on target with their accolades. Just a nice mix of uptempo ballads and rockers. Keifer did himself proud with this one. One wonders what comes next for him?
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|A friend had been telling me to watch Suits for a couple months now and it did not disappoint. Smart, funny, and always interesting.  Suits is my new favorite show and I would recommend it to anyone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Another series that keeps one entertained.  The furnishings, clothing, and outside settings are so magnificent.  Can't wait until the next series is released on Amazon.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Very good. Can't wait for next one ending a shocker! The author is great and can't wait to read more of his works!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I have always liked PBS Masterpiece theatre.  This series is very much similar to those TV shows I watched a youth.
B004NELBPC|4.0|I like this app but I wish it had the ability to access their blogs.  I often have to use the full website through kindle in order to blog.  And often scripts crash on most pages.  Page loading is time consuming.  Not a good experience.<br /><br />________________________<br /><br />Update: Found that the app does have blogging capability.  This is great!  Just one thing I'd like to see changed is the font size of the article in the kindle is very small and doesn't seem to adjust with screen tapping.  Otherwise, I'm happy with the app.
B0030B621W|5.0|philosophically challenging and visually appealing the Director, the DP, and Rockwell have resuscitated a genre that has lost touch with its soul and is no longer breathing
B00CE004XM|5.0|Surprized to find that this  album is listed only under Joe Bonamassa.  Beth Hart sings her heart out on all the songs.  Good mix of blues.  If you love Beth Hart then this is a collectors' item for you.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love period pieces, and the costuming and props are awesome. Great performances by diverse characters, beautiful locations - very believable. Looking forward to the next season!
B0029ATTAQ|4.0|The video did a decent job of recreating the books image, however when I sat down to watch this with my wife who hasn't read the book I ended up pausing the movie every 10 min. to explain what was going on.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I'm a bit selective about what shows to watch, cause I don't watch a lot of tv, but this show is super good & focuses on the characters rather than legal cases etc, like a lot of the CSI/Bones style of shows where every episode has a predictable format.
B00AZKCU7G|1.0|The movie is great, but I paid extra money for the included digital copy.  The disc was there, but the paper slip with the key code was not (four stars of for that alone).<br /><br />I have tried for weeks to resolve this, but there is no one to contact and I guess I am stuck with the results as this had not come to my attention during the &#34;return period.&#34;
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson fans -- get this novella. It's an engaging story in Brandon's wonderful writing style that's unobtrusive and smooth. As with all his stories, I found this one delightfully creative.<br /><br />If you haven't read this author yet, this novella is a great place to start. It's fully stand-alone and gives you an idea of the kind of writer he is. His prose isn't poetry. Rather, it's like an excellent waiter whose job is to serve the meal tastefully and respectfully without annoying his customers.
B00B769XB8|1.0|this was not 3D verson. but charged for 3D. will shop stors (Walmart) now.<br />Have no return due to trash day.
B0061QD88S|5.0|We are dog lovers. It's just a great movie. I watched it as a child and my children watch it and it was my daughters favorite movie out of all the Disney classics. So it's been watch many times. So I purchased it for our first grandson. He already loves animals mostly dogs so I was sure he was going to at the least like it. He's just a year old so it's hard to say what his favorite movie is but it is as fun or funnier to watch him watch it than I even remembered it being.
030758836X|4.0|This was a great book. The story begins with a bang and is engaging most of the way through. Some parts lull, but the desire to find out what's up with the 'gone girl' is enough to make you want to keep reading. Recommended, for sure.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|I was so excited to receive this DVD. I watch it all the time. It is one of my favorites. Thanks Amazon.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|They just seem to putting out better music with each new release. This one is no different. Their harmonies are some of the best in the business.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is thrilling jump leaping and sprinting through trains running from the law this game is amazing ! If.your second guessing your self from buying this game - get it this game is nothing like temple rUn its unique and fun !
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was the best book so far. read it in one day. Can't wait until the next one comes out.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved it it was the greatest book I ever read and it is unlike the movie! I never noticed!
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling skies is an excellent family (although not for younger children) scifi experience.  I do recommend.  Lets face it sci fi fans, the mainstream rarely lets sci fi shows last a full season, much less 3.  So enjoy and support your sci-fi addiction!
B0084670FU|2.0|Slow Start, did not keep my interest.  I never got to the part with Brad Pitt.  It was just boring.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|I have read all of the books in the Sookie Stackhouse series and this was by far the worst!<br />What can I say? The ending was far-fetched, the characters absent and lacking emotion and some &#34;loose ends&#34; still hung at the end.<br />It may well have been a different book, Charlene Harris you should be ashamed.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Wonder Zoo is a awesome way to create a zoo and rescue your favorite animals and dinosaurs. Also every level you get to you unlock new decorations, tipes of animals.
B002NT3B52|4.0|I'm in the beginning of this one. So far, a little slow but I like the informative details. Good one.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Awesome read! One of those \\"can't, don't want to put down\\" books that left me with my heart racing!  Best romance I've read in a long time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book. Different an compelling. I couldn't put it down. Got the next series, The Shift&#34; and finished that one too and waiting for the next one out.

When I started read­ing the book two things became imme­di­ately clear - this was not going to be another heart wrench­ing novel and that this is going to be an ambi­tious story.<br /><br />This is a char­ac­ter dri­ven novel, the story takes place all over the world over decades, but it's the char­ac­ters that make you want to come back for the next story. One the reader gets through about half the book, the reader can put together the indi­vid­ual pieces which make the work a whole.<br /><br />What I enjoyed in the nar­ra­tive were the sub­tleties which Mr. Hos­seini weaves into his work. Read­ing the sto­ries care­fully, one could revisit the events from another point of view of another char­ac­ter, some­time many pages later.<br /><br />The book's pace slows down in the mid­dle and the sto­ry­telling gets a bit con­fus­ing if one doesn't pay close atten­tion. The sto­ries changes nar­ra­tive mode which I found to be a bit dis­tract­ing, for exam­ple the last two sec­tions are told in first per­son while the rest of the book is told by an omnipo­tent narrator.<br /><br />After fin­ish­ing the book I was impressed by Mr. Hos­seini lit­er­ary brav­ery.

B0025WX2YW|5.0|Highly addictive programming. Forces you to go back and study the historical basis for the program. As you do, you will find yourself branching out in the study of other characters.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is easy to use and customize. From the background colors to whether I want a special ring or song to wake me, it's got a lot to offer. Just used it for the first time today, and it works great on my GSIII. Going to download it now for my electronically challenged husband - it should be perfect for him too.
0425263908|3.0|I heard it was a funny live story...true...but<br />Very wordy...pushed my way through the book and didn't really enjoy it until almost the end.

B00701L5XS|4.0|Excellent app for all types of individuals.  Fire knots, sailing knots and many others. This is great for people who want to sit down and learn in the peace and quiet of their own home.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I recommend it... I thought it was good and defiantly worth watching it once. I saw it twice. Once here and in the theater.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A very good movie with great 3D effects. As with many movies you have to suspend belief (these are just movies after all!) but with this on it's easy to do.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|Overall I'm satisfied with this application. I'm a user of Wikipedia, and the app does everything you need it to do. For me it seems a little slow, but that could be related to my stupid internet connection. Sometimes I find it difficult to zero in on what I want or need to press on the screen. I've experienced the Wikipedia app for Windows 8, and I feel that it might be better than this Android version. I definitely feel the need to download and have this installed. I just think it's a handy little app for people with a tablet. So far I haven't had any problems, and I would recommend it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Best book and Percy Jackson books are not only knowledgeable, but they give you more images of Percy's world...Good read for kids.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I love this internet browser for many reasons. It's fast, smooth, and user friendly. I really appreciate the inclusion of the &#34;turbo&#34; function. I find this most helpful due to my poor internet speeds. I can definitely see improvements in page load times. Another simple feature included in this browser is the ability to have an exit button. Most apps don't have exit buttons, and lack the normal computing experience that I'm used to. Having an exit button really helps me out, and makes me feel more at home on a touch screen device. I've never had any problems with performance. I hope Opera continues to keep their browser fast and lightweight. I use their product on Windows as well. They put in good and meaningful features where it's needed, and keep the bloatware out. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to have another browser option on their Android device.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Okay, the first CD I ever bought was Les Misérables and it has been one of my favorites for over 25 years.  I was prepared to hate this movie.  Wolverine as Valjean?  Really?  Really.  If you don't care for Hugh Jackman (I didn't,)  you need to see this.  In the theater at the beginning of &#34;Bring him home&#34; my wife and I wispered in unison &#34;please don't f*** it up.&#34;  He didn't.  We wept.<br />  Sacha Baron Cohen, whom I generally despise, gave an outstanding performance as Thénardier.  If he never does anything else worthwhile (and if history is any judge, he won't,) he's done enough.  Helena Bonham Carter provided the perfect complement.  Amande Seyfried was a pleasant surprise as Cosette and Where has Samantha Barks (Éponine) been hiding?  I can't wait for her in leading roles.<br />  I did not enjoy Russel Crowe in the theater.  He seemed wooden.  Watching the DVD (the second time) I guess I was being a bit unfair.  Probably because everyone else was so outstanding.  I have to say I was still disappointed in Javert's suicide scene.  I expected more emotion and that one scene almost made me drop this review to 4 stars.  There was also a new song (when ValJean and Cosette were in the carriage to Paris - I didn't love it.  in 25 years I might.<br />  And for all of you theater geeks, did you notice Colm Wilkinson as the bishop?  Know why he was there?  He played ValJean in the London stage production and opened in NY.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|If you like Men in Black 1 and 2, then you will not be disappointed... Was very well done... Actually left me craving a #4! Its entertaining and fills in some blanks.  Its light hearted family fun... A bit of alien violence, as in all of them... But not &#34;spooky&#34;... Its entertaining for sure.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game. It's a very good way to spend time I just wish the had all the stuff from Xboxes minecraft but none the less it's still great you can mine hunt and build a fantastic house
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Cute movie for kids of all ages... Its a new twist on the old fables... With the tooth fairy, Jack Frost, and the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus... Not sure how this was dubbed an Easter movie...  It transends all holidays ;-) Cute movie!
B0058O84G0|5.0|I enjoyed this first trilogy as it described the years before, during and after WW 1 in Europe and USA with sensitivity and historical facts. It touched a number of families and millions, including some in my own family, who died due to the selfishness of those in power.<br />Now I look forward to the second trilogy that took place in my own lifetime.
B008220BLG|5.0|What a surprising twist! A unique and entertaining movie. Well done! This is such a refreshing take on a Zombie flick... A zombie movie with a happy ending!  There is nothing like it. Yes, its a zombie movie, yes its a love story, yes it has action and adventure, its a drama, its a comedy. Yes it has gore... But dare I say, its tastefully done... Thumbs up for parents and teens alike!  ...and the soundtrack, solid!

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|If you are a Les Mis fan... Then of course, you love this movie... If you are not a 'musical' fan... Of course, you will love this movie! There is something for everyone... Comedy, drama, action, adventure, struggle, and a love story! Thumbs up!

B000GJ0K50|4.0|Hellboy is a paranormal superhero film akin to Men In Black by way of some Saturday Morning Cartoons. During the prelude, the notorious Grigori Rasputin, redressed as a Nazi sorcerer - and made famous by the German pop band, Boney M (just kidding), is opening a portal between worlds in order to free some tentacled Elder gods on loan from H.P. Lovecraft (how this will help the Third Reich is uncertain). Fortunately, a squad of `Merakin soldiers and their cigar-chomping sergeant spoil the show, but not before a small CG devil-toddler escapes into our world and the squad's occult expert woos the tot with candy, names it Hellboy, and becomes Hellboy's surrogate father, raising him to fight crime with a Fish Man from the back of a mobile command center disguised as a garbage truck. Eventually, Rasputin returns, murders the occultist (played in his old age by John Hurt) and other things happen.<br /><br />That may sound ridiculous but it isn't (it's ZANY, he said, with mock jubilation), it's funny, oddly poignant at times, with one or two jump scares, and plenty of super strength-based action sequences. The film probably would have faired better (not that it did too shabby) if it hadn't been distributed on the heels of Men In Black II, a film following basically the same formula, with similar special effects, but an entirely different plot. The comparison wouldn't even be worth mentioning if not for Myers, the annoying protagonist played by Rupert Evans, but I'll get to him in a moment. First, some glad-handing!<br /><br />Jeffrey Tambor, playing Agent Manning, is the star of every scene he's in, so I'd like to give him special mention since he hardly gets top billing, but Ron Perlman is Hellboy the same way that an apple is an apple. He embodies the character, never seems uncomfortable with three pounds of makeup on his face, and carries himself like he's having one helluva good time.<br /><br />Okay, so, the skinny. Like in Men In Black, the protagonist in Hellboy is your basic point of view character, an everyday normal guy, in over his head. John Everyman (I mean \\"Myers\\"), is as flummoxed and flabbergasted as the audience would be in his shoes, but also kind, caring, brave (to sum, as the film does for us, pure of heart), and unabashedly boring. I'll spoil the sequel: the studio, the producers, whomever, realized that the audience was interested in Hellboy's antics, not his everyday normal partner (da-derp) and they leave Myers in the lurch, reassigned by Hellboy to some godforsaken snowcapped waste, jealous of Myer's relationship with his longtime, off/on flame (wink, nod, nudge to those that know the story), Liz Sherman (played by Selma Blair. Nothing too exceptional to add there). According to IMDB, Rupert Evans was unable to reprise the role, so the character was written out, but I like my version better.<br /><br />Aside from Myers, my only gripe is the occasionally weak wire work. The CGI can be rubbery, but since we're dealing with cosmetic-makeup monsters, animatronics, and occasionally rubber tentacles, rubbery CGI fits right in, but there are three moments in my recollections - Hellboy fleeing on a crumbling bridge, leaping over a truck to pursue Samael (a monster of little renown), and Samael tossing Hellboy across a crowded subway platform - where the wire work is less than convincing and Hellboy seems to float ON A WIRE.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the director, Guillermo del Toro, a fan of Men In Black, or the Marvel movies, I think this would fit nicely on your shelf next to the others. The sequel, The Golden Army, is loads better, so clear some extra space while you're at it.<br /><br />This particular release is the \\"Director's Cut\\", reinserting some great footage that had been  left on the floor due to time constraints, and while it does fill in some holes, I'll admit that it begins to chafe a bit around ninety minutes in, when Hellboy sulks and Myers (MYERS!!!) has a crisis of faith...in himself (oy!). The commentary track is worth a listen. You get to hear del Toro dish, gush, and ogle his own work, and he seems pleasingly tickled by all of the bits of his imagination that have been brought to life. There are other features too, so check'em out.<br /><br />And for those care, Hellboy does NOT pass the Bechdel Test.ommentary track is worth a listen.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I totally respect Sabbath, clearly...but much like the new Deep Purple, may not have checked this one out but it happened by accident.  I do like part of the Sabbath catalog, but did not follow all of it.  Same thing with Ozzy's catalog...as I admittedly got lost as far as hearing his last few efforts go.  Here's the thing though, as you know these three fellows haven't recorded together in many years and honestly...\\"13\\" doesn't miss a beat!  Every tune on this disc is good (which is the VERY most important factor here).  If the song writing isn't there, then nothing else matters...in my opinion.  Yes, it has been done before (and by these guys)...but it's very refreshing to hear something in 2013 that actually sounds like their very first disc, which this one does!  The only downfall for me are the high hats...which are way to crisp and almost sound sampled in, perhaps they are?  Other than that...it's Classic Sabbath...get it now!  For the record, I love, respect and value Dio just as much as Ozzy as a vocalist (if not more) in general, however, this IS what I've been waiting for for years!

B00BZOFUI2|4.0|Although I am not a \\"Deep Purple\\" nut...haha....this disc is great!  I like obvious parts of their catalog, but haven't payed a lot of attention to it for many years.  My buddy played me the new disc yesterday and I have to say it's solid as a rock!  I like all the tunes, especially track 6.  Steve sounds great (as usual), Ian's vocals are in perfect shape...whole crew sounds fantastic.  Point to be taken here...its always about good song writing, which this disc has plenty of!

It  displays an acceptable combination of childish curiosity and the ignorance of adult figures, plus the tragedy that can result.
B000C20VUK|4.0|Hellboy is a paranormal superhero film akin to Men In Black by way of some Saturday Morning Cartoons. During the prelude, the notorious Grigori Rasputin, redressed as a Nazi sorcerer - and made famous by the German pop band, Boney M (just kidding), is opening a portal between worlds in order to free some tentacled Elder gods on loan from H.P. Lovecraft (how this will help the Third Reich is uncertain). Fortunately, a squad of `Merakin soldiers and their cigar-chomping sergeant spoil the show, but not before a small CG devil-toddler escapes into our world and the squad's occult expert woos the tot with candy, names it Hellboy, and becomes Hellboy's surrogate father, raising him to fight crime with a Fish Man from the back of a mobile command center disguised as a garbage truck. Eventually, Rasputin returns, murders the occultist (played in his old age by John Hurt) and other things happen.<br /><br />That may sound ridiculous but it isn't (it's ZANY, he said, with mock jubilation), it's funny, oddly poignant at times, with one or two jump scares, and plenty of super strength-based action sequences. The film probably would have faired better (not that it did too shabby) if it hadn't been distributed on the heels of Men In Black II, a film following basically the same formula, with similar special effects, but an entirely different plot. The comparison wouldn't even be worth mentioning if not for Myers, the annoying protagonist played by Rupert Evans, but I'll get to him in a moment. First, some glad-handing!<br /><br />Jeffrey Tambor, playing Agent Manning, is the star of every scene he's in, so I'd like to give him special mention since he hardly gets top billing, but Ron Perlman is Hellboy the same way that an apple is an apple. He embodies the character, never seems uncomfortable with three pounds of makeup on his face, and carries himself like he's having one helluva good time.<br /><br />Okay, so, the skinny. Like in Men In Black, the protagonist in Hellboy is your basic point of view character, an everyday normal guy, in over his head. John Everyman (I mean \\"Myers\\"), is as flummoxed and flabbergasted as the audience would be in his shoes, but also kind, caring, brave (to sum, as the film does for us, pure of heart), and unabashedly boring. I'll spoil the sequel: the studio, the producers, whomever, realized that the audience was interested in Hellboy's antics, not his everyday normal partner (da-derp) and they leave Myers in the lurch, reassigned by Hellboy to some godforsaken snowcapped waste, jealous of Myer's relationship with his longtime, off/on flame (wink, nod, nudge to those that know the story), Liz Sherman (played by Selma Blair. Nothing too exceptional to add there). According to IMDB, Rupert Evans was unable to reprise the role, so the character was written out, but I like my version better.<br /><br />Aside from Myers, my only gripe is the occasionally weak wire work. The CGI can be rubbery, but since we're dealing with cosmetic-makeup monsters, animatronics, and occasionally rubber tentacles, rubbery CGI fits right in, but there are three moments in my recollections - Hellboy fleeing on a crumbling bridge, leaping over a truck to pursue Samael (a monster of little renown), and Samael tossing Hellboy across a crowded subway platform - where the wire work is less than convincing and Hellboy seems to float ON A WIRE.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the director, Guillermo del Toro, a fan of Men In Black, or the Marvel movies, I think this would fit nicely on your shelf next to the others. The sequel, The Golden Army, is loads better, so clear some extra space while you're at it.<br /><br />And for those care, Hellboy does NOT pass the Bechdel Test.
B00BVYNSLC|4.0|Not a science fiction fan but this series is the exception.  Clones, mystery, character development, danger  and occasional quirky humor make this series one of my favorites.

The commentary track is worth a listen. You get to hear del Toro dish, gush, and ogle his own work, and he seems pleasingly tickled by all of the bits of his imagination that have been brought to life. There are other features too, so check'em out.<br /><br />And for those care, Hellboy does NOT pass the Bechdel Test.ommentary track is worth a listen.

B008KEQMDC|3.0|This all star studded cast of a film does a good job of juggling the many stories but falls flat in humor and never really explores the pros and cons of having children. Overall, it's a fair story for those interested in the topic and chooses to focus on how wonderful yet scary it is to have children.<br /><br />The most impressive element to this picture is the impressive cast: Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Brooklyn Decker, Elizabeth Banks, Matthew Morrison, Dennis Quaid,  Anna Kendrick, Joe Manganiello and Chris Rock.<br /><br />Said cast is handled well as the stories link and overlap in ways that were done far better than expected but it's the humor which unfortunately falls on its face in this picture. If the humor had been laughable I'd have given this a higher grade.<br /><br />The focus on having a child presumes everybody wishes to have one and is also obligated to do so. That said, it does a good job of showing how painful child bearing can be and how crazy it feels and how you're never going to be entirely ready for it so just jump on the roller coaster. I liked that part. It rang true.<br /><br />Based on a book which some have called \\"the bible of American pregnancy\\" by Heidi Murkoff. The budget for this picture was $40M and it made a bit over $84M at the Box Office.<br /><br />SOUND/MUSIC: B minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; HUMOR: C minus to C; ROMANCE TALES: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; WHEN WATCHED: early June 2013; OVERALL GRADE: B minus.
B00367XA1K|5.0|'Reds&#34; was overlooked when it debuted, now it is a classic.<br />Beatty is a genius & his casting superb. A must see for film buffs.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Downloads the ads just fine but wouldn't play videos and charges $2 to download videos.  Not worth even a free download.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Oh my gosh!!!! If you read the first book you have to read this book!!! It is a great book.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I really love the DVD! Now I can watch even when I do not have internet! These are some very creative and talented guys!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just got the new update v0.7.0  it's awesome it has cake I love minecraft  I found herobrine to he killed me I was so sad I found diamond
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Everytime I want a music to mellow me out and to dream and think of the islands...I turn to Bruddah IZ.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|This has to be one of the grandest revelations to occur in the history of recorded music. Warner Brothers have finally redeemed themselves. We finally have the original mixes of some of the greatest music of all time. This includes drums, bass, guitar and vocals. Included are 10 mini LP cover replicas.  The glitches that plagued the 2006 Tre Hombres remaster have also been corrected. Throw your old sixpack CD's in the garbage. While amazing, it is not without minor disappointments though. No booklet.  No liner notes.  No &#34;Legs&#34; single version, none of the bonus tracks from the 1992 greatest hits CD, the 2006 remasters, the deluxe editions or any tracks from the Chrome, Smoke & BBQ boxset. You'll want to save those. The price is a steal. Pick this one up right away and crack open a cold one.  In case anyone is interested, I posted an unboxing video on Youtube.  Search bluejay55118 or &#34;ZZ Top The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990 Unboxing&#34;.<br /><br />Also, to the uninformed people telling others that these discs have been compressed or &#34;brickwalled&#34;, please learn the definition of it before you make a false claim.  These discs have been volume boosted, not brickwalled.  Please take a listen to the actual CD's with some good headphones or a nice stereo system (mp3's don't count).  The stereo separation is perfectly intact and sounds amazing.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Now, this album by Muse is the best so far.  But of course I am biased to Muse.  But this album is great.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I started playing the original cross me and when I found this one, I was hooked! I just wish there were some new puzzles. Please create some new ones!
B002GZQYMK|5.0|The evolution of Muse continues.  Their style evolves to the better.  Combination of rock to classic on the same tune.  Classical rock?
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I originally bought this DVD to use in my classroom.  I chose the songs that I felt the students might enjoy.  They really seemed to be able to appreciate it.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|No other beats Muse.  If you are into their style of music.  Fist time I heard them....I got hooked on their style.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|but these days people don't have the patience to wade through Hugo's long descriptions and narratives, and that is sad
B004WKI204|5.0|I like this book because it's written by Tina Fey, and who doesn't like her?  If you don't like her then don't buy the book.<br /><br />It's an interesting insight into how she got known, and I really enjoy her articulate writing.<br /><br />The book is funny and feels good to read.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who enjoys 30 Rock kind of humor.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Once it updated it turned the controls small.  So it's hard to move. I want it before it was updated.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I missed this show, this was one of the best sci-fi shows I've seen.  I'm glad that they're back for me to see again!
0525953728|5.0|Seller sent the book fast.  The book is great.  I loved it.  I read it in less than a week and I am not a big reader.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I missed this show, this was one of the best sci-fi shows I've seen.  I'm glad that they're back for me to see again!
030789701X|5.0|I was a little concerned before purchasing this guide that the print would be too dense and too small and that I couldn't use what i couldn't read.<br /><br />The print is fine, a little small, but the photographs balance the words nicely; most pages don't look overpopulated with words, especially if those words are about a particular quest or question and you want to know more.<br /><br />One thing I would've liked is a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) that David (or somebody who worked on it, preferably David) may've thought of as he was playing the game like &#34;Can I adopt more than two children?&#34; (no, sadly).<br /><br />Great guide. I'd recommend it to any Skyrim addict, er, I mean, fan. Yeah, that last one.
B005HSL626|3.0|Sushi Chop is better. It has much more to do, more swords/knives to choose from, and more realistic levels, schemes, and beautiful graphics/backgrounds. Unlike Fruit Ninja, there are limited things to do. The &quot;Dojo&quot; isn't fun, I really don't see any point in having it in the game. You can't purchase anything in-game, and there are no levels, which makes it all incredibly boring and overly repetitive.<br /><br />For those reasons, this game is worthy of three stars.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|I ENJOYED WATCHING THIS MOVIE AND IT WAS WORTH PURCHASING SINCE I LIVE IN THE AREA IT WAS FILMED.  ALSO I AM A FAN OF JENNIFER LAWRENCE...SHE EARNED THAT OSCAR! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS BUT IT 'FROZE' UP DURING WATCHING AND I HAD TO REMOVE DISC AFTER SOME DIFFICULTY, AND FINISH WATCHING IN ANOTHER DVD PLAYER.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway Surfers is a great app. There are still some bugs and unrealistic acts in-game, and the purchaseable customizeable items could be cheaper, because I can barely buy anything. The same goes for the goals. Collecting 500 guitars just to unlock a stupid character?<br /><br />For those reasons I give this app three stars.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|this is good, but not so great...so tiny to hold with big fingers, but for on the application, this is great, this needs care while sharpening costly knives
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Our son LOVES this movie. It's his absolute favorite. It has wonderful colors and great music. Some cute added adult comments that kids won't catch that are also amusing :). Highly recommend!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What Christian would not like this? I like the reading narration, it can be a mutually benificial to all who read God's word.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Great series that we discovered later and so glad we did.  Love these guys.  Dean could be a member of my family because we are all quick with the wit.  Sam with his great looks and he is a smart hunter with a compationate side.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I may be bias, I have read most of the books in this series.  Jack Reacher is a complex character and although he is the main character in each book one can never grow tired of him. I don't feel the actor really brought this character to life.The movie wasn't bad, however, glad that I rented it instead paying to see it at the movies. It may be different to someone who hasn't read the book.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was worth every minute I spent engaged reading the chapters. Quality advice and though provoking questions we can all benefit from asking ourselves.
B001OSIV62|5.0|This film is breath taking and profound. It will leave you with an appetite for life outside of rules and restrictions.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I like the cool gadgets you use but after the first few levels it does get challenging and om nom is really cute (that is the monster)
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|....NOT. Finally after 35 years, we get some serious BS music. I don't count the ones on \\"Reunion\\" even though I thought they were good. Nice to have a final farewell from the guys as I grew up with them and though I didn't realize the talent then, their CD's have stood the test of time. The album is basicaaly what you would expect from Black Sabbath and hopefully now inspire new bands coming out today to carry on the torch....I love you all!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I liked the point of the game but it does get challenging after the first few levels you need a brain to do this
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you're a \\"Firefly\\" fan you are probably just purchasing this as a replacement for a worn out disc.  If you are thinking of this, get \\"Firefly: The Complete Series\\" and this.
B00992CF6W|4.0|If you like to build then this  is for you you use all kinds of resources just like survivor but it does get frustrating
078689136X|4.0|OK.  You should only buy this if you are a \\"Castle\\" fan.  This is not great literature nor is it a towering example of the mystery genre.  This is like eating candy corn; you know it's not all that good for you but, damn, it's tasty.  This is a great book to read in the airport or poolside on vacation.
B00C2U6EUG|3.0|A few good tracks like DNA and Earth (deluxe set), and the main theme isn't bad, but... this is no John Williams unfortunately, perhaps we shouldn't compare but we must. It probably plays much better with the movie. The main theme tends to get over done and you can't help feeling you have heard some of this before in the Dark Knight soundtrack. There is way too much percussion and the crescendo in the main theme(17) just falls a bit flat in the end. Hans Zimmer is obviously talented and has done an OK job here but it certainly won't be iconic like the subject matter.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|Story line is very interesting if not predictably, actors do an above avg job ,  Joe Fannigan does an outstanding job, not bad for a spin off
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Celtic Woman is one of my favorites. Their beautiful voices are always pleasing and pleasant. I will continue to purchase their delightful music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this Is better then tample run and I play play it every day so I rate it a 5 so that it so every one should play this game if you do play this game it's hard to stop playing this game
B000WYF2FW|5.0|Had this album since it was released on vinyl.  It is simply one of the best albums from one of the best musicians.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|Yes, this is your typical Garbage!  That phrase uttered in any other context would not necessarily be a good thing, but in this case it certainly is.  Fifteen Garbage songs, to caress, assault, and pinch your ears and heart, is a wonderous thing for Garbage fans.<br />They've been away from the game for a while, but they haven't lost what makes them special, you have a mix of industrial, rock, pop, alternative and of course, Shirley's voice; and something else I've always appreciated, the lyrics.  They are artistic not just fluff.<br />I did detract one star and let me explain why, I felt the mix was off on several songs, the guitars and the drum track was so invisible yet the echo effects etc. were dynamic, now they may have done this on purpose to give it a more industrial 'old school' sound, and that's fine, but for me, I would have appreciated the guitars and drums to have a fuller sound, clarity and the bass not buried.  It didn't ruin this CD at all, just a minor moment of question.<br />My personal favorite tracks:<br />Not Your Kind of People<br />I Hate Love<br />Beloved Freak<br /><br />More mainstream, download these tracks:<br />Authomatic Systematic Habit<br />Big Bright World<br />Man On A Wire<br /><br />If you like their previous works, you won't be taking out the trash anytime soon, this is a keeper.  Thanks and welcome back!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Really love playing this bingo! Love all the different locations throughout the world and the callers accents. Great time relaxer after a very long day! Thanks for all the fun.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I didn't know where this story was going when I first started reading it, but, from the beginning it was so interesting and different.  And, as good as it was in the beginning, it got even better as the story developed. A totally engrossing read. We are so lucky to live in America in the here and now. This is a stunning story.  One of the best.  I am going on to read some of the author's suggestions to enhance the experience.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Shipped on time and came in good condition. It's such a great movie too. The perfect gift for what i wanted.
B00B2166BS|5.0|It does what its meant to do, and that means I can now have my mini USB cable plugged into my computer for when I want to copy videos or music to my Nexus 10. As far as the speed of charging, I can't comment, since I usually charge my tablet while I sleep which is generally longer than it takes to charge regardless of cable used.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Falling Skies Season 1, where it all begins!  At first I was worried that this series was going to be like &#34;V&#34;, but to my delight it's not.  Well not the remake at least.  Falling skies season one is all about the survival of the human race when attacked by an unknown alien force for unknown reasons.  Then as humanity fends for itself we learn what brings these characters together.  Military and civilians are united and disperesed to keep up the resistance and to survive.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great! Easy download straight to my PC and phone. Can access music off or online and sound effects are accurate!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is a great mobo for the price!  This thing flies when it comes to gaming and video editing.  Has enough connectors for anything you can stuff into your case.  Just beware that it requires an 8-pin ATX power connector.  Had to get one for my psu as it only had the 4-pin.<br /><br />I paired mine with the AMD 8350 \\"Piledriver\\" and an Nvidia 650 GTX.  Runs all my MMO games great!
B008Y73940|4.0|This movie was unexpectedly engaging.  Matthew McConaughey did a great job and I'm not a huge fan of his. I would recomment this for anyone who likes who done it with a twist.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|This cd is the best collaboration cd ever made hands down. Kanye west and jay z made a crappy cd compared to this one. The reunion, Welcome 2 hell, and I'm on everything are great and funny tracks. Everything is really well made on this disc.
0061733199|4.0|This is a much larger book than I expected. It is packed with useful information. I would definitely recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game! even my three year old loves it. wish it was a little less confusing with all the separate areas though.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this series! I work long hours during the week so I've been doing marathon viewing on Saturdays. I even got my husband to watch with me instead of his beloved sports! I watched Upstairs Downstairs years ago and this is as good if not better.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|It worked for about a month and a half, and then one day I went to play it, pressed on it, It began loading, then suddenly crashed and brought me back to the home screen. It hasn't worked since. Really, is this some sort of joke? It's good it was free<br /><br />&gt;:(
1603429999|3.0|HAS SOME GREAT IDEAS. CAME IN TIMELY MANNER, GOOD CONDITION. I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE PICTURES LOOKED OUTDATED. WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE PICTURES ON INSTRUCTIONS LESS READING, AND BETTER PROJECT DEMONSTRATION. I HAVE GAINED SOME INFORMATION FROM THE BOOK. I JUST THINK IT WAS TOO MUCH MONEY AND NOT EXPLANATORY ENOUGH. IF I HAD LOOKED THE BOOK OVER BEFORE PURCHASE I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love unlocking bonus levels. I also love graphics and cute puns. It's loads of fun and addictive in a good way. I beat all levels but have not got all stars :P<br /><br />:D 100% recommendation<br /><br />Favorite bird: bomb bird.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well the game lacks in updates and help options.  It took me over a year to find out how to build a nether portal.  But besides that I can't find no diamonds or any of those other good things from things like PC/MAC version or Xbox 360 version and the maps you get from seeds are generally small.  But hey I can deal with it till it finally does update and I will be waiting.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I began playing this game and I loved it, but then after March ended they kept the aquamarine dragon for too long, and then after that the diamond dragon was kept too long (until June!!!). I was disappointed and bored with it and I was going to rate it 2 stars until I visited it today and realized you had to UPDATE it. I am pretty mad because you didn't have to update it before. Backflip always updated it before. Why didn't they this time? And why didn't they have the option to update it until today?
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game, just as the other franchises from Zeptolabs, is unbelievable fun and challenging. There's very few games out there that actually make you think without sacrificing fun gameplay and great art. As a level designer myself I highly recommend it.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!! It has good graphics, a cute guy, plenty of obstacles, and it's not glitchy at all. Only problem is that the upgrade is a little harder than the free one, but I'll get used to the new themes. Totally recommend it. better than the free one. Get it for sure.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's fun and entertaining my little sister loves it I have to practically pull my kindle out of her hands to get it back
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I've was not amused the moment I began playing it. Other people might like it, but it's just not my kind of game. I don't recommend it, but that's just me.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|The game is really fun but when I get out of it I can NOT get back into it. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE!!!
0393327655|4.0|The popularity of this book's call for an end to organized religion as we know it-- to an end of \\"priestcraft\\"-- is a healthy sign.  But, while stuffing all of priestcraft's evils into the black box of oblivion, like a Pandora in reverse, Harris should also have kept one good thing that it has provided-- a sense of human limits.<br />Of course, a sense that a vengeful, omnipotent deity limits humanity is wrong.  But many other things limit humanity, and Harris doesn't seem to have much sense of that.  At one point, he refers to a presumably bright future wherein we will  \\"colonize outer space.\\"  But is that really possible?  Or desirable?  Harris values evidence as a criterion for action, and the evidence we have so far indicates that colonizing outer space is well beyond our economic and scientific means, and that, anyway, outer space is a horrible, deadly place so far as earthly life is concerned.  Instead of spending billions on going to the Moon and Mars, we might have spent the money on developing a more sustainable, just, and humane economic and political system, not to mention preserving this planet's ecosystem--our only known source of life.  (When asked about the \\"future of space travel,\\" the Buddhist poet Gary Snyder pointed out that we have been traveling in space since we evolved.)
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|When I started playing it was the best you should play this game it's the best game ever since I played it. It was the best
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|this was a good movie for a rainy day and I thought it would be a &#34;chic flick&#34; but was actually easy watching for me and my husband.  I would recomment it to all the ladies but the guys might sit through it too.  Love Julianne and Josh.
1452115567|5.0|Love this book.....it's kind of William Wegman-ish...the relationship between dog and man, the travels, Maddie's placid willingness to deal....love it
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really enjoyed this game; could stand to be a tad longer though.  Fun tap and play game with puzzles that were fairly easy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Let me start by saying this isn't the type of book I normally read. Honestly I usually read romance novels of some shape or form. But my family convinced me to read it. Boy am I glad they did! This one the best books I have read in awhile. It is long but worth the time it takes to read it. But pay attention while reading or you could miss crucial information and you'll get confused later.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|would be additional discs containing full sets. Some great artists here & you only get to hear two songs? Very disappointing. Not everyone gets a chance to go to the event & it would be great to experience more of it.<br /><br />But that complaint aside, these have been great shows - wonderful line-ups & mostly terrific performances. Just want MOAR!! ;-)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I've read all of the books, watched all of the movies and will watch them again.  Bought this as a gift for my mom.  She loves it, it looks good and arrived safe.  Amazon makes holidays so much less stressful.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|It's just a great Jeff<br /> Kennedy book of them all. I loved it  it's my favorite book of them all. I loved it thanks for making the book
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I enjoyed this game though sometimes frustrating. Still when it was over I wanted more. Ready for Room number two!<br /><br />TT
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I loved this book with my sons and now with my grandson.<br />Wonderful gift for a new Mom or mom to be.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Not very challenging.  Couldn't get to advanced levels due to a lock out that I could never figure out.<br />Very basic.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to check the forecast, but also fun. I check the hair frizz forecast just to laugh!! There is banner advertising, but it is minimal in size and does not interfere with loading or using the app on my iPad.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|What gives? I am not going to buy this movie twice, one version 3D and another 2D. I see that Amazon UK will have a 3D/2D pack for sale beginning July 1. I wonder if I can order it from UK and have it shipped to US; I'll have to check into doing that. I don't want the digital copy because my household is multi-lingual and I seriously doubt that the digital copy will have Spanish language or Spanish subtitles.
B000VSQ17M|4.0|I like his guitar work and song selection on this CD.  I really have to listen to more of his stuff.  It's nice to find someone new like Jose'.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This is such a funny and cute book. I couldn't put it down, a great summer beach read! Sophie has done it again!
0802136834|5.0|I have always been very interested in all that involved Henry VII and his wives.  It is a good read.
B004LROUNG|4.0|It was good to have Grisham back in the courtroom again. Usual fare ... quite enjoyable. Lots going on, but wrapped up a little quickly.
1594204217|4.0|I only chose &#34;I like it&#34; because all of his books, to me, are good reads.. But, this one, while interesting, was too wordy. I found myself skipping pages rather than inhaling the words; waiting for certain subjects to be concluded!
0544139453|1.0|There are many tragic stories of American's struggle through 9/11, but it is altered as it is read through the experiences of a foreigner, as Moshin Hamid did with \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist.\\"<br /><br />Set in New York, and occasionally Lahore, this book dives into the mind of a young Pakistani moving to America to make a living. The theme of this book could not be found for it was a random book, with no obvious direction, but the theme seems to try to tie in with 9/11, even if it focuses on more personal problems to the character.<br /><br />There are mainly three characters, Changez, Erica, and the stranger to whom Changez is telling his story to. Changez is the main character, who is only trying to find his way in America in the beginning of the book. Erica is the girl who Changez falls in love with but she could not seem to love him back, for she could not get over a dead ex-boyfriend. Finally, the stranger is an American Changez had found in Lahore and had told this story to, the man is strange and mysterious, for he never talks, only pulls out his gun occasionally.<br /><br />The book starts out slow as Changez meets the stranger and starts his story where he goes to Princeton, then to New York. He explains that he gets a job quickly and falls in love with Erica as soon as he meets her. She shows him around America and they start to fall in love while Changez moves up in his job. As they are getting closer, he goes on a trip for his job. While he is away, he watches the bombings on TV and couldn't help but feel happy, but he realized that Erica was still in New York, and it was easier for him to act that the crime was unforgivable around his coworkers. He went back a few days later.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Changez would stop the story to have conversation with the stranger and how he should not be nervous around the people of Lahore. But he always continues his story, even if it does not have to do with the last place he had left off with. One of these times is as he explains his returning to New York. Erica and he had gotten closer after the incident, too close for Erica. With the love of Changez, Erica had been reminded of her ex-boyfriend and could not handle the memories, causing her to go to a mental institution. With this and the added stress of his family's well-being back home, Changez becomes unfocused on his job.<br /><br />In the end of his story, Changez had lost job, but he didn't care because he had already decided that he was to go home. Before he left, he decided to visit Erica one last time, since he had not seen her for a very long time. As entered the institution, he learned that Erica had gone missing and they believed her to be dead. They had found her clothes folded up but no body, and, because of this, Changez left his jacket before he left. As he lived in Lahore, he became a teacher and a leader of protests. He told the stranger how he got in trouble but is fine now as they walked to the hotel. As the book ended, the waiter from the restaurant had followed them and the stranger had reached into his pocket for an object that glinted like metal.<br /><br />As a high school student, I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was nicely written, but the story lacked point or direction. It was often confusing of whether the narrator was speaking about the story or talking to the stranger about whether he liked his food or not. It was a nice idea but the writer had gone through with it poorly.<br /><br />Another reason why I would not recommend this book is because the book is a bit disturbing at parts. It did not hide any facts and delved deeper into Changez's and Erica's relationship than what was needed to be known. What Changez had been willing to do for Erica would have been sweet, if it had not been so disturbing and so obvious that it would only hurt Erica more than she already was.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would not recommend this book to anyone. This book did not seem to havea theme or a reason. It had been confusing in the way it was written and had to be reread several times, even if I did not feel comfortable enough to read it the first time. This book seemed to be meant to show another view of 9/11, but it had done a poor job of this.
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|Classic blue collar gangster movie, see also Casino,Sopranos..godfather 1 & 2. Its not as much action, more of a storytelling.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game...really entertaining only thing I would do is add more military and make territory expansion more affordable other than that i luv it
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|It was my favorite app and I played it every day, until I got impatient and wanted to buy an upgrade for a tower instead of waiting to go up a few ranks more. I spent $1, didn't get the upgrade, and now I can't even upgrade anything else, even when I do wait to go up ranks. Before that, though, everything in the app was perfect.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I only wish it were longer so there was time to explore some of the other characters in depth. The cast clicked right into place as though they had never been away. Great film!
B000000OMB|5.0|I had this on an LP years ago! The local radio station played a cut from it the other day and I ordered it on cd. Very glad I did! The musicianship of this group is still fresh!! And I love the DRAGON! I wonder if the same person did the dragon for &#34;Merlin&#34;! This music is fabulous! For anyone who likes good rock and roll with incredible lyrics, you owe it to yourself to give this a listen for the first time....and those of us who have listened to them before...welcome home!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Shame on Fox for daring to cancel this incredible series after only showing 11 of the 14 episodes produced. So refreshing to see sci-fi with meaning, rationale and a firm and believable basis in real cultural history (not to mention a brilliant cast). Nothing since has come close. Will watch this over and over again.
B00000AF95|5.0|very good product
0446571415|2.0|I liked David Balducci novels and I enjoyed the other camel club books but I struggled to get through this one. The storyline revolves mainly around John Carr and has a ridiculous, overly complicated plot.  The President personally calls upon John Carr to resolve a crisis all alone with the knowledge he may get killed. This was a kind of &#34;punishment&#34; for something he did in a prior novel - he gets reinstated but before John Carr can leave on his journey he gets diverted by an explosion in a park across from the white house where John just happens to be when the bomb goes off (of course). He then partners with a female british agent because the british PM was supposed to be going through the park around the time the explosion occurred - which makes sense even less sense.  The original crisis that the president asked John Carr to handle into never enters the book again after the explosion - its bizzare.  The other camel club members are barely in this novel  They are in the background thoughout the story arguing with John Carr to keep them in the loop but he doesn't involve them. I'm not even sure why it was part of the series except for the fact that the John Carr character is in the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids play this game all the time and they love it.  It is easy enough for my 5 year old (who is now 6) and interesting enough to keep my 11 year old occupied. I have a daughter who is 9 and she also loves it.  This games is great for many ages and both genders.
B003K16P3M|5.0|The action was constant, the story moved at break neck speed and I was never disappointed in the direction the story was taking me.
B00C7CTYGK|4.0|Some of the LP is noisy. There's a swooching sound between songs on LP1 Side1. You can't hear it while the song is playing, but you can hear it at the fadeouts and between songs. I don't find that acceptable. I'm finding more and more reissues have problems like this! Even with that, I feel this pressing is noticeably better than the original Polydor LP (and even that sounds pretty good!). Dynamics are better. Better detail and quieter overall since the cutting pitch (and therefore the cutting level) is wider. I suspect there was less limiting since there aren't space constraints to get it all on 1 LP. Even if you have an original pressing as I do, I would still recommend getting this 2 LP set. Artwork is well done, and comes with a nice poster too.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I am sick of the haters.... Get over that there is two more Gideon and Eva stories I love the thought was such a good book and too think I was worried coz of all the bad reviews you people should just not read them coz you CLEARLY HAVE NO TASTE
0307895475|5.0|this book is a great read if you want to know secret stuff and hidden items on skyrim this is the book for you it helped me so much it is cool i loved it. anyone in the right mind should by this book
B008J34466|4.0|IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES, IT WAS THE WORST OF TIMES... Where's the beef?  How about them Cowboys? eh...
B009VIZDLI|3.0|This book started off well, was really interesting, but almost too soon you could tell there was going to be a feel good ending
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|\\"You own me, Eva. Wherever I am, whatever I'm doing, I belong to you.\\"<br /><br />Was introduced to these books by a girlfriend and read all three in a week. Entwined With You was everything I could have wanted! I was thrilled with the story, happy with the ending and now am excited for the next books!<br /><br />I LOVED IT!!! 5++ STARS!<br /><br />Since this is book #3 in the series, I am not going to talk about the plot at all here. This is not a standalone and should only be read after both Bared to You and Reflected in You.<br /><br />Hope you all enjoy the first two...and I have no clue what all the negative reviews were about.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|Not sure it's quite as good as Borat, but worth the time to watch. Great for some laughs and giggles.
B007SGM084|5.0|If you think these books are poorly written (as I have read some people wrote) Go back to Shakespeare.  If you read thought the 3rd book, guarantee you will cry.  I read book one, and decided that I wanted to see the outcome of this romance, It is really nice to see that the \\"Good People win\\" I will not ruin the ending but I would urge anyone to read all three books.  You will not be sorry.  Yes, there is sex and bondage and other things that I kind of skimmed over, other that I read word for word.  But you will not be disappointed.  Promise.
B005LAII3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I have the `original movie and it stays real close to the orginal movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! I love how you could update for new places.I also like how we can sign up in facebook.com so we can compete with friends! I reccomend this app to everyone.
1401308201|5.0|If u are a fan of wicked this is a good book to have. I bought this for my daughter as she is a big broadway goer. she loved it.
0375869026|5.0|This book will teach you friendship, bravery, caring, compassion, to protect your friends, and to not be afraid to be yourself. It is about a boy about the same age as us going through school problems but in a different way. There is more happiness than sadness in the book. Unfortunately, the story line becomes really predictable. Some of the word choice seemed juvenile for a 5th-grade boy. Ultimately, we recommend this book! :)
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Overall, expected the outcome of the episode. This sad, NCIS is a stellar show with great cast chemistry. Outstanding season, look forward to season 11!!
193700788X|2.0|And thank goodness!  I read &#34;Dead Ever After&#34; to have closure of the series and I received that.  The manner &#34;Dead Ever After&#34; ended made me happy there will never be another.  It is a relief I do not have to endure another sagging storyline and formerly loved characters any longer in the hopes the writer will return to the excitement, spontaneity, and fun that began this series.  The &#34;Dead Ever After&#34; storyline finalized the personality lobotomies begun in prior books.  Sookie was not any type of character that would attract my attention or loyalty as portrayed in these final books.  The mystery was subpar.  I was not in camp Eric or Bill.  I did not care if she loved the wolf or a Fairy.  I just wanted the ending to be in tune with the rest of the series and the choices the characters made along the way.  This book did none of those things and I did not like the ending in the least.  It felt totally contrived all the way around.  If you have read this series from the beginning you will want to read it just to finish it, otherwise I would not waste my time.
B004RL9T50|5.0|The whole family loved this movie.  Great for adults and children.  The animation, script, dialogue, plot, and music were excellent.
B00BSW6F26|2.0|total waste of money. The game wont allow me to move some items. When I click on the items & try to place them they disappear, requiring me to close & reopen the game. Have given up as its impossible to play on if I cant place an item !! Epic fail & waste of my $$$$$
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Must read book. Eva  and Gideon are such a hot couple. I love the crossfire series.....Book three was great. I need more!!!!!!
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|For the fans who want a complete Desilu/Paramount/NBC high def version, this isn't it. Yes all 79 episodes looks great, and all the 2 pilots are included, but the set is missing the infamous blooper reels and NBC produced promos which ran during its original 1966-69 run. I guess CBS/Paramount will have to go into the vaults,locate them and reissue the set yet again. Perhaps they may rescan it in 4K and double the cost of the sets.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Author Christina Kline has written a book based on a time during the 19th and early 20th Century when orphans were taken out of New York and to the Midwest by train to a life where opportunity knocked and challenges presented themselves inevitably along the way. I purchased this book directly from the author at a book signing. In her speech, Ms. Kline said she wrote every incident in the book based on researched fact. In addition, she managed to hit an authentic note describing the emotions involved in being an orphan-a real one like Vivian, and a foster child like Vivian's new friend, Molly. That she succeeded so beautifully in hitting the exact sentimental chord necessary for such a heart-wrenching story, is what makes this book not only a great read, but a GREAT book! A handy study guide at the back of the book is a plus for reading groups and students. Readers will be buying it off shelves for many years to come. [[ASIN:B009EW5BJA The Sleeping Beauty Mystery]]
1781162646|4.0|Joyland is first and foremost a fun read.  This is a must read for any fan of the King.  I really love his books where he draws you into the down on his luck protagonist, Insomnia and Bag of Bones really stand out for me. Those books not only have a lot of feeling, they put you in the shoes of the character. This book has that great feeling.  Any guy that had his heart broken by his high school sweetheart can easily relate to what Dev is going through and the importance of someone like Anne to come along and fix you.<br /><br />Having said that, this isn't for those who only like horror. Joyland is a crime novel NOT horror.  There is a touch of scary (I won't give it away) but just a touch. The major part of this book is whodunit and character development.  I am not a fan of crime novels but had to give it a chance.  It rocks.<br /><br />Now to my complaint.  While this book is thankfully not as political as the last few books he has written.  There are a couple of lines that just make you grown aloud.  Seriously, there is maybe a paragraph that is thrown in tastelessly to make sure we know what side you are on.  Trust me Mr. King, we know what side of the political aisle you are on and don't really care.  I disagree with you but hey you can keep bashing us in the head with it if you want.  I keep buying your books.<br /><br />However, there is one paragraph in this book that makes me question my decision to keep buying your books.  The one where you lament that Dick Cheney is still alive.  I am sure you feel that way but come on, the guy has family and friends and some of them may be big fans of yours and you are going to write that it is a shame he isn't dead.  That is tasteless.  Just my opinion.<br /><br />Despite what party affiliation you maintain, Joyland is a great book and up there with the best of the best from the King.
1619691809|3.0|Didn't like the narration - much of DeMille's wit and wry sense of humor was lost when listening to a narrator - I'll stick with DeMille's books
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|If you liked the first season you will love the second one even more. The second season picks up where the first left off and is very well done and I think better than the first season if that is possible?
B0026772N8|3.0|My son recommended this book to me.  Probably the most boring book I've ever read.  He obviously could delve deeper into the meaning than I could.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I saw this on Netflix and was really bored one night and thought, ok I'll watch one episode and if I don't like it that will be it. I saw the first one and was 'hooked'!! What a great series. Yes, it's bloody but you also see the human side of things, the choices these people had to make is a world gone crazy.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish!  It gave me a different way of viewing the main actor, since I have never seen him play a role like this.  The film had so many twists and turns, and I was sitting at the edge of my seat!  Excellent!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|We loved watching Torchwood! Just wish it hadn't ended so early.<br />Highly recommend this series to anyone who loves Dr. Who or SciFi!
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|Decent movie for Rudd but I have seen better. The movie was a little slow starting up but got a bit better the last quarter of the movie.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book broke my heart and made me laugh and took me on an amazing journey. No words can describe this book. A definite must read!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I couldn't put it down :) GREAT
B0050PYNP8|5.0|My wife and I watch this several times a month!  It is a scream! Another classic from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Silly as it can be but, funny!
B009CGLO3K|2.0|I should have saved my time and money. The trailer contained all of the special effects and a small handful of worthwhile scenes.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|In this DVD set, each disc is in a plastic tray that's glued to the cardboard case. Within a few days of purchase, ALL FIVE of the plastic trays fell off, making the whole package unusable. I have never seen this happen before with a DVD set. Cheap and shoddy construction.
B00B4ENTJK|3.0|good movie.  enjoyed family friendly.  older stallone movie, but as always he pulled it off really well. would suggest watching
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love how beautiful this game looks on my kindle! I honestly waste a bunch of time playing it:0 I wish, though, that you could get more pearls without having to buy them. Overall, I really like this game and it is very pretty and cool:)
B0037VNX44|1.0|hated it .. totally bad movie.  bad language.. quality was bad. just pure bad.  do not watch this it was awful
B005FVNIW6|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable and engrossing story. This story had so many layers. But while that could make it unbearably complex, the author seemed to have the ability to make it very simple and profound.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I mean it was sorta great but then 2 ads popped up and the only  way to remove it  to pay for the upgrade!!! :o &gt;:(
B009NY43NY|1.0|Oy vey. I’ve been a follower of Sookie, Charlaine and Bon Temp for years. Admittedly, the last several novels were mediocre, but this one was wretched.<br /><br />I felt as though I was reading a cheesy harlequin novel. Sookie had the notable hard-ass quality, but the secondary characters were lacking. The story line was slight to say the least and after 335 pages I was exasperated. It did not flow well and the pace of action was really bad.<br /><br />A few things happened with her previous suitors and it was worse than anticlimactic. I felt there was NO closure with ANY of the characters. I’m left with nothing, and quite frankly, I’m pissed!<br /><br />I put a lot of years into this series and the ending is less than desirable. I wished it had been more fulfilling.<br /><br />I don’t think I’ll ever read any more of her work. Refund!
B00D6M86RS|1.0|Don't waste your time and money on this crap app it will not install on kindle fire I never had a problem with any other app
B0042RUMH8|5.0|I think Jennifer Lopez records high quality dance music and is best listened to on a full stereo to get the full effect.
0740785508|5.0|this guy knows what he is talking about. I can't tell you how many art-related books and textbooks I have come across that are completely useless as far as learning how to think about art before you create. This book helps you start to finish, and gives you all sorts of new ways of looking at how to go about creating including new media, techniques, and process that can drastically change your work.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Hours of entertainment for when there is a need to wait for something. Keeps the kids occupied... a must for parents with children.
B00866H7SS|5.0|A little more realisitic. I loved 50 Shades, but this is great on an everyday level. Maybe change the C word
B005DN5BE4|3.0|Nothing remarkable about the production.  I can barely remember the plot.  Should have been better with Morgan Freeman in it.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Change the &#34;C&#34; word. Definately kept me hanging. I'm yet to find a male that is on Gideon's level. Bring on next book!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is in not good it is excellent but it be fun to have one of them in los Angeles
B00AAX68HG|5.0|The whole family loved this game. If they like cut the rope this is a great next challenge. Some of the levels were hard enough to look up solutions though
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I ENDED up enjoying the game and played until I finished, about 4  hours. I don't think that was long enough for the price. Too short....I want a game that challenges means keeps me coming back. I don't see a reason to play the game again since I completed all the levels and challenges.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE it. It's so fun. It really makes one think. It's not too hard and not too easy. It's really enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|a good read. fast-paced and hard to put down. would recommend it to the teen audience, but not for the squeamish.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It says u can play multiplayer. Pfft as if every time I log in it says password incorrect plz fix this bug. And this game is very very very fun.
0440419514|5.0|Excited to have this set since they didn't come out with the trilogy on film I can finish reading it. So glad this was available on amazon.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this book! I'm a very curious person & always want to know the inside details of what I've heard on the news and this book certainly answered  a lot of questions I had about this particular mission.  I also loved hearing his insight into his being a SEAL in general as well as about the training & other missions. It was also interesting to compare his viewpoint to Zero Dark Thirty. I highly recommend this book, it's a great read.
0061743526|5.0|While the book takes place in a Southern town in the thirties, it is applicable to Northern towns today.  A must read for all.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Update: Once you reach the upper levels of the game (Level 125 and higher) the Kindle game crashes so frequently it becomes practically unplayable. It will force close three to four times before I can clear my habitats, breed my dragons, and send gold. Forget about visiting neighbors. This could be a fun game if the developer would fix some of the glitches and upgrade it so the full iOS features were available on the Kindle app.   My review relates to the version of Dragon Story available for Kindle. I cannot speak for how it behaves on other devices or platforms.  The Good  Dragon Story is a game where you breed, collect, and raise dragons. The graphics are good, the animation is cute and it is fun to grow you dragons from egg to epic form. You grow your own food or buy it with gold; you buy habitats for your new dragons; you expand to make room for more dragons. It is fun trying to complete all the goals. the game doesn't operate against a timer so it can be relaxing.  It is also a socially interactive game where you need to become a part of Team Lava's Neighbors network in order to meet certain goals within the game. The social aspect is nice because it allows you to exchange tips with other players.  I have found a number of people there who share common interests. It is fun to chat about favorite books, hobbies, etc. with them. I like that you can be part of their social network without having to give out personal information like the games that use Facebook as a platform.  The Bad  As you level up in the game, the play becomes much slower. In the beginning, dragons hatch in a matter of minutes. As you level up, it can take hours, and sometimes days, to hatch most dragons. As you level up, habitats and expansions become much more expensive, time consuming and require help from your Neighbors. As an example after about level 40, a single expansion takes several days for to gather the necessary mystic maps from your neighbors, several more days for the expansionto complete then another day or more to clear the area so it can be used. You can speed up the process with gold, however, the game limits how much gold you can give and receive, so again you have to wait a long time to gather the necessary gold or you have to purchase gold with real money (you cannot buy gold with the coins you collect in the game). The game is structured in a way that you have to either have the patience of Job or be willing to buy gold to continue playing.  The Ugly  The Kindle version of the game doesn't offer the features of the iPad and even the regular Android versions of the game. There are a number of dragons and habitats that are not available to Kindle users. So you are asked to help Neighbors acquire items that you yourself cannot get.  Some of the rarer dragons are nearly impossible, if not impossible to breed for the Kindle user. Consequently, you reach a point where there is nothing left to do in the game. You can't really say you &#34;won&#34; because you haven't collected all the dragons and completed all the goals. But the game will not let you breed certain dragons. To get them, you have to purchase them with significant amounts of gold (1,500 - 2500 gold or more). As a point of reference, it would take $50 - $75 in real money (depending on whether you catch it on sale) to purchase enough gold for the elusive Diamond dragon or 4 - 6 months to save that much (depending on how generous your neighbors were).  The game is also extremely buggy. It is essential to have Neighbors in order to level up in the game but the game frequently crashes (force closes) when you try to visit them or post on their wall. This tends to get worse each time a new feature is added to the iPad version of the game so you reach a point where you spend more time re-opening the game than actually playing. Team Lava is not terribly conscientious in dealing with complaints relating to the Android version of the game (and there are lots of them in their forum). Idon't know if they simply lack the necessary expertise for Android coding or they just don't care because the Android market is smaller.  What I do know it that it is highly annoying and has turned a game that began as my daily source of relaxation into something that causes more frustration than pleasure.
0802473164|5.0|I have read several relationship books and this one is by far the most helpful. It is a quick and easy read. It gives direct and to the point advice on how to implement changes in a relationship.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|July 4 2013: Just received this device, very happy with it; sound very LOUD under water, is almost the same volume as a regular mp3 outside of the water. Easy to control while swimming.  In this version the sound is much better, almost no audible distortion, even no need to cover your ears. This time I give roughly 5 STARS!<br /><br />I did buy the first and second models, they are great and work perfectly; I can't swim without them, and I do a lot of swimming. I use it everyday for at least one hour or two. However, they always dead for the same reason: the wires of one of the sides gets disconnected because of the daily use and the hassle of putting in your goggles, sometimes the wires are too tensed; SOLUTION: put a shorter wire along the audio wires, so the lastone never gets tensed, with enough loose to avoid tensing. My second one already has this problem,anyway I'm using it hearing one side; I've been using it for more than 6 months. Now I'm going to buy the new Neptune, hoping be more durable, also hoping a better quality speakers, they tend to distort a bit, mainly bass. I give it 4 stars.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Good movie!  Nice spin off on a pre star trek.  Nicely done and great effects.  Glad to see that the movie did not stick with the<br />old star trek stuff of the 60's as what was cool then would have been hooky today.  Looking forward to the sequel!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I heard about this book from my brother-in-law, who shares similar tastes as me in literature. He said he liked it so I thought I would give it a try. I was incredibly impressed. Anthony Ryan has a talent for literature and create a very engaging story. It doesn't progress too fast or too slow. My only complaint is having to wait so long for the next one.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Excellent acting and great story-lines every episode. Love Moriarty's character. Definitely worth watching. Both actors have had major roles in recent movie productions--Star trek, The Hobbit.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Such an unexpected and brilliant book. So thrilled to find a series that rivals Mageborn! I want more! Hope they are all like this book!
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the cutest lil  app. And I don't have 2 use FB account 4 friends/neighbors as it has its own community of world-wide players. The graphics are beautifully designed, the colors are vivid. I'm playing on Kindle Fire. Game loads a little slow, but so worth it. Like most other games, plan 2 wait 4 things 2 happen unless U want 2 spend real $$. That works well 4 me as I can set up an action, then go visit neighbors, play another game, or tend 2 real life while I'm waiting.  Occasionally the game stops running when trying 2 access other peoples lands. I'm sure the developers are working on this, as I'm not the only one with this problem. Seems 2 do fine if I go home between each visit. I'm still totally addicted 2 it !!!  ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome and entertaining I play this game often getting my friends into it.  I wish there where more games like subway suffers.  Different level with different backgrounds would be cool tho
B001XUT6AG|5.0|It brought back memories of watching Star-Trek when it was a weekly show on television.  I had never seen the movies.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Now I know what all the buzz was about. Wonderful character development. Attention to all the historical events - from the sinking of the Titanic to the invention of the telephone to the war  interwoven into the lives of the Downton Abbey residents was genius. And oh, the fashion!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love all the aspects of this series. It is like a delicious dessert - I portion it out to myself so I have something with which to look forward.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|With all the talk and hoopla, expected a better story...just hype in my opinion.  First of the series, maybe 2nd & 3rd have a plot!
B0000AFX64|5.0|this a great part of the old series and I really like it, some series are better with the old version and not the new....
B001I45UFC|5.0|Probably the most familiar of the Chronicles, this is really the second installment and should be read after &#34;The Magician's Nephew.&#34; Good fantasy, and good moral lessons, like all good children's books!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I wanted this one for my husband this is one of his favorites,  this is a awesome show to see...thanks

B0012DP8A6|5.0|I dont like many musicals but Little Shop is a classic.  Its dark and funny and synical and the music is amazing.  Do you recognize Pam and Gina from Martin?? How about Bill Murray as the overly excited sado masochist?  Must watch again and again!
B004JNB4UO|5.0|He is acclaimed a Filipino hero, famous of his words and fulfilled promise &#34;I shall return&#34;. A remarkable and memorable movie to watch.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've tried a lot of gaming mice over the years in an effort to get that mouse that felt just right, and had the right features. I noticed that another reviewer mentioned the Razer DeathAdder in his review, and this mouse is very similar to that one in feel (which is a compliment; the DeathAdder is perfect in that regard).<br />What this mouse has over the DeathAdder, though, is huge. It has the same construction type to it,  with a slightly tacky rubberized shell that makes it easy to hold. The Anker has the benefit of having more buttons, and the side buttons are well designed and responsive. it's nice to have a mouse with more than the simple forward/back, but not an overwhelming or poorly laid out array of buttons that never get used because of a poor design choice. The only thing this mouse has that I don't consider terribly useful is the button ahead of the mouse wheel, that I actually didn't even notice until I looked at the picture when writing this review...<br /><br />I haven't found any flaws, which is crazy for a gaming mouse that sells for half the competition. The software is good, and easy to use. The mouse feels great and has all the options of a mouse that sells for twice the price, from moddable weight cylinders to on the fly DPI controls that actually work and are responsive.<br /><br />I feel like I could actually go on about it, but it's enough to just say that this is the best gaming mouse I've found and for some reason it sells for considerably less than much worse options. I love this thing, highly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a surprising book i loved it so much i could read it again i recommend this book to a lot of ppl
0810993139|1.0|Wow, I was really expecting to like this, but was pretty disappointed.  For such a boring book, this series is popular.  I can understand the appeal of the cartoons and the fun text, but Greg doesn't do anything but sit around judging his classmates all the time.  He's a jerk!  A really boring jerk!  There's almost no conflict in the story, and I think I remember reading this originated as a series of internet vignettes, which makes sense, but reading it is just dull.  I guess reading this book helped put the boredom of the concept of \\"normal\\" into perspective for me.  Greg's an entitled boring privileged kid and I just couldn't bring myself to care about him, which to me is a book not worth reading.  I'll try my luck elsewhere and skip reading the rest of the series.  This book is a breeding ground for \\"nice guys\\".  Ugh.
B00992CF6W|3.0|The new update is crap. You can't even play multiplayer . Suvivalcraft is so much better . There is horses sharks wolf's crows ducks and  a lot more.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I enjoyed the layer back style of the book and how the author almost immediately made you relate with the challenges of starting, doing, finishing, repeat. You'll recognize some of the signs...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I never have to look for a calculator now.  This app solves that problem.  Pops right up, nice big keys and easy to see screen.  The free price tops it all.  Get it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The only game I play is this game I love it its awesome,fun and and crazy and cool<br />You should play it
B0053O89KG|4.0|season 4,, is starting to turn a little soapy, less comical crime fighting, more personal relations,,,,, i think the script writers are running out of stories.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I hag really enjoyed playing subway surfed.  I have especially liked the missions, daily challenges, and the way you can by charectors.  I highly recommend this game to anyone, espesially temple run fans.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I was blown away. What can I say. If you love your family, in love,or want to fall in love, this is for you. It is absolutely one of the best anime movies I have had the privilege to view. It is funny, intense, and romantic. I fell in love with this family from the start. The animation is flawless and the Characters are unique to say the least. If you are an avatar fan, computer geek, or love anime in general, you will love this movie. You will not be sorry. All I can say is; it will make you laugh, cry, fall in love with happy endings. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game isgood its the new templerun and I love the season changes. I really prefer everybody get this app it is really fun and you wont regret it.
1603580557|5.0|i just ordered 4 copies of this book to give to some of my clients. a lot of their challenges will get solved as soon as they have a structured, systematic way to think about their challenges. this book provides this way of thinking. you should read it, everyone should read it.
0553386816|4.0|Ford County by John Grisham  Book review by Diane Williams      Ford County is John Grisham's first book of short stories. Its a collection of seven stories , each  set in Ford County, Mississippi. It is a measure of Grisham's audacious talent that he manages to make his protagonist's story work on so many levels. As with Grisham's legal thrillers, his short stories are page-turners as well.      In Grisham's story, \\"Michael's Room\\", he so deftly demonstrates the protagonist's radar for status distinctions, and in these pages he provides an acerbic sense of how corruption increases the profits of the rich and decimates the profits of the impoverished. In Michael's court case, the family felt duped by the rich, educated attorney who wins the case for the wealthy plaintiff; they both increased their profits, and enriched their lifestyle. Meanwhile, the poor defendant was left broken and living life with his son, an invalid. The writer shows the results of the resentment of a family filled with pain, frustration, and despair at the hands of a clever rich attorney winning a corporate medical case.      However, Grisham puts a surprising twist on the story. The writer allows the simple man a reward; the satisfaction of witnessing the sorrow and brokenness that the rich man lives with every day because of his arrogance and money. Grisham allowed the simple man to use his street wisdom to confront the upperclassman, leaving with him questioning himself and his Integrity. Simply put, the clever attorney looked like a babbling idiot.    Grisham continues the suspense in the following six stories. \\"Casino\\" tells the story of a rich, flamboyant, egotistical hustler, who was once respected, revered and, in some situations, feared by the towns' people.  The hustler was being sued and all the community came to the courtroom. The works of the simple conservative man made the people rejoice at the results; the hustler fell from his throne, leaving him penniless and babbling like animbecile.     In \\"Fish Files\\", the main character struggles with his family and his law business, and he wants to remove himself from both situations. He uses his lawyering skills in a  scrupulous manner to collect some unwarranted funds, which he then uses to start a new life.    Though \\"Blood Drive\\" is a serious tale, Grisham uses humor to tell it. A man was in a accident the hospital, and needed blood. The message was sent to his community and some of his friends gave their consent to provide the blood.     \\"Quiet Haven\\" shows the shrewd attorney and his bigoted partner in crime, \\"the caring giver\\", manipulate and rob the owners of the nursing facility and the hidden senior citizens, closed away and forgotten.     \\"Fetching Raymond\\" tells the tale of a typical dysfunctional poor white trash, \\"PWT\\", family. The community had alienated the mother's children. Unfortunately, all three of her sons  became residents of the criminal justice system.     \\"Funny Boy\\" records the behavior of a typical Caucasian family in the 80's.Their solution upon discovering that their son was homosexual was to send him away. He decides to go to San Francisco. However after several years, he returns home with AIDS. The family deemed him an unacceptable human being and placed him into the hands of an African American woman, who took care of him until his demise.     Though the stories are written in a coherent, simple language, the plot and characters are interesting and relative. The purpose of this book was to entertain, and Grisham does not disappoint his readers. Therefore, a general target audience can relate and enjoy each story.    In Ford County, Grisham reaffirms his place as one of this generation's most inventive and gifted writers. Grisham has long and correctly been recognized as among the greatest storytellers of the 21th century.    [...]
B0063IH60K|3.0|Seems that the program wins more than 95% of the time, but keeps you wanting to play more and more.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Glad I read it. After watching the movie first, I couldn't understand what all the hype was about. Finished it in one day, couldn't put it down!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has more characters,missions and boards(temple run doesn't have). You are on a world tour. So you go to different places and its way more exciting.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|BOOOOOOO.......BOOOOOOOOO......BOOOOOOOO I cannot believe that they are not bundling this. I have a 3D tv at my house, but only blurays on my boat. I always by the combo packs. They are having a hard enough time getting people to switch over to 3D. What an idiot move this is!
B009AP2G26|5.0|It was so good can't wait for next season I bet next season will be even better but it will be hard to bet season four
B001O6W9QC|4.0|I had been meaning to see this movie since it hit the theaters in '08 or so but it was never a pressing desire.  As the days passed I never heard anyone raving about it so I sufficed with not seeing it.  Just recently I decided to watch and I am so glad I did.  I almost cried laughing.<br /><br />I'm not a huge Stiller fan but I'll watch his movies.  I'm even less of a Jack Black fan but I won't go out of my way to avoid his movies.  And I had never even seen Robert Downey Jr. in a comedy.  I will say this:  Downey Jr. was classic, Stiller was good, and Black held his own.  Now for the X-Factor; the guy who didn't headline but was down right a riot nonetheless... Tom Cruise!!!  He was excellent in his small yet crucial role.  I never knew he could be so funny.<br /><br />Listen... this movie no doubt pushes the envelope which is one of the reasons it's so funny.  The humor is not for everyone as they toe the line with a few taboo topics: racial humor, gay humor and even jokes at the expense of the mentally handicapped.  I felt guilty for laughing but they were just so funny.  I could go on and on about this movie but I will end with saying: just watch the movie.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|what a pleasure.. these were a blast to watch.. now awaiting season 3 .. cant wait.. summer is here at last.
0307730697|5.0|An amazing story. An amazing man, Adam Brown. Adam's character came shining through all the difficult challenges he faced. His faith in God and his selfless acts of love made him easy to love. And I learned more about Navy Seals and what they do and that is incredible. I recommend this book. It is not one you will forget soon.
B00B769XB8|2.0|The excessive swearing [THE TIMING ISN'T EVEN GOOD] detracts from the story. The quality of the VIDEO and SURROUND SOUND is good. I should have rented it first. If I had, I probably wouldn't have bought it!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I never wanted to put the book down it was so good! It was a romantic, action,and thrilling book fof me
B00A2FSXHK|1.0|I don't know where to start, there are simply no redeeming features of this movie.<br /><br />This is no spoiler, you are told at the very beginning of the film; there has been no crime in DC for 6 years.<br /><br />Well, actually no murder, presumably plenty of other types of crime. How so? There are three \\"pre-cogs\\" you see, who see future murders which the police can respond to through the pre-crime unit.<br /><br />Right from the beginning you begin to discern what kind of movie this is.  There has not been a single murder in the six years this pre-crime unit has been running. Really? And yet in the movie itself the pre-cogs have a vision of a murder but it is too vague to discern the location! This never happened before? No one ever got it wrong, landed at the wrong location? This is silly. Really silly.<br /><br />I won't go through the cliches, but seriously, just imagine every cliche you could possibly think of and it's here.<br /><br />The plot twists are (ironically) predictable, you will soon find yourself endowed with the power of the pre-cogs as you easily and successfully predict every turn of the plot.<br /><br />All of the dialogue is a total bore, don't worry about paying attention, the movie will let you know when it's important, because people will get all serious and explain everything.<br /><br />The action sequences are also terrible, the dumbest I have ever seen, no really, totally full of inconsistencies, even a child could point them out. By the way there is really only one chase scene. If you're in it for the action, just watch mission impossible, it is a lot better than this.<br /><br />The music is bad, the camera work is not anything to write home about, the CGI is very bad (and pointless) and the movie is full of lens flare.<br /><br />I don't want to waste your time dear reader, this movie is awful from start to finish. If you desire surprises, thoughtful stories, meaningful dialogue, exciting action, touching moments, turn around now.Don't click the button, just leave and find something else, this is a long movie and a total wast of time.
B00CKWQN9S|4.0|i'm a big fan of jay z and was excited to hear he was the producer on the cd. beyonce's rendition of amy winehouse's song was just so-so. emeli sande's rendition of beyonce's song was great !
B004JN1D2I|2.0|The books are wonderful and exciting, the format leaves a lot to be desired. In the book only chapter titles are given; in the menu only chapter numbers. Since chapter titles are repeated numerous times and no page numbers are included, one tends to lose orientation in the four-book collection.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun game very upbeat and easy to level up. Challenging but super and now I'm just adding words to be able to submit
B002VPE1WK|5.0|So, it's a +-$20 bag but what makes it work is the fact that you can make compartments in size or shape you want.  It comes with velcro felt walls that you can velcro any which way to configure you want.  It's durable (enough) and has more than enough pockets than I know what to do with.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm not British, and I generally don't like British TV shows, but this one is actually very good, with excellent character development, dialogue, and historical referencing.  If you like those types of shows, this one is good.  If you don't like those types of shows, don't bother.  This show is either a love it or hate it - either you get into it immediately, or, you are bored out of your mind in about 15 minutes, and wondering what all the fuss is about.  As for the Amazon method of buying it, and then getting it to my PS3, it was a little cumbersome because I had to first download the PS3 app to make it work, but, once it was done, it's pretty easy.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This series is probably the best thing on TV. I was thrilled to have the entire second season and watched it within a few days. I'm now hooked! As usual, amazon's service was outstanding.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is an excellent book. I am now reading the second edition. My husband also loves that I read the book.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Not much of that left today.  Loved, loved, loved the Jack Frost storyline.  Wish there were zillions more like this out there - no blood, filth or gore!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is the only way to see Downton Abbey. Wait for a rainy day, gather friends and indulge your instant gratification needs by watching one episode after another. You cannot watch just one episode.<br />A note to the writers, however. QUIT KILLING OFF my favorite characters! I am not sure I will watch the next season - it is becoming depressing to &#34;fall in love&#34; with a character just to find that once things are looking up and people are happy, its a sure sign someone will die. I watch this for entertainment - not a lesson in the realities of mortality. This is my guilty television escape. Keep it lighter. Let the characters find some peace and happiness!!!!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|seems to time out and will lose some things when it reloaded. but overall fun and easy. I like to use workers on long projects just prior to leaving game. do short growings for spells.
B009AMANBA|5.0|What an intimate approach to life in the Lincoln era. The writer makes the every day life (and many deaths) of the era become real. Not a quick read, but an immensely rewarding read. I read it after my husband was done with the book. He is an avid Civil War enthusiast - I could not be further opposite. I, too,  enjoyed reading this book and was struck by the way the writer 'pulled me in&#34; to the era and made it seem so real and so personal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a pretty addictive game . me and my brother love it we would recommend it to anyone like you good grains too
0385349947|5.0|The concept that rang most true for me in the book is that &#34;Hell has as special place for women who do not support other women in the workplace&#34; (or similar words).  I've been shocked and disappointed to find over the years that a young generation of women seem actively engaged in the destruction of the careers of other women. It is so common that the men I work with, to a man, believe that &#34;women never get along at work&#34;. When a business conflict arises and it happens to involve two women, the common belief is that &#34;that's a woman thing - there can only be one queen bee&#34;.<br />Stop the insanity, read this book, and realize that trouble comes in both genders, that destructive, morale sucking employees come in both genders, and that NO culture can tolerate the downward spiral created by them.<br />We need to redefine leadership, the inherent qualities of a great leader, and include female in that definition. Women ourselves need to re-think leadership and the value of women! For too long we have fallen into the &#34;divide and conquer&#34; trap of the male defined model of business success. Sheryl Sanders makes a case for why more women in leadership positions is good for business and good for society.<br />This is not a &#34;feminist manifesto&#34;. It is a well written, intelligent case for re-thinking and re-defining our current business models. And men? If you want to give your wife, lover, girlfriend or female colleague a sincere gift, read this book, think about its message and discuss with her. You'll be handsomely rewarded on a number of levels.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|App works great but I would add voice feature to listen to ebooks like other readers are capable of doing.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This was an entertaining moving that I enjoyed watching with my Granddaughter. On a slow rainy, I may watch it by myself.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I love this game I just hope for the next update they have a crouch button. Other then that it's awesome
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've had this game for a long time, and I still love it.  Super simple to play, but can be challenging too.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|this is a great fantasy movie. I watched it with my kids when they were little and now I get to watch it with my grandkids.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've had this game for a long time, and I still love it.  Super simple to play, but can be challenging too.
B000H2FDTO|3.0|Too long, too convoluted and difficult to follow.  All came together in the end but for what purpose, too much message and not enough depth. Great actors working hard on a  script that didnt do them justice.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a good book and history lesson.  We should know where so research start. We also show know its ok to ask what and why some doctors do the things they do .
1451695195|3.0|I am writing as a very open-minded agnostic. I originally heard Dr. Alexander's story on Through the Wormhole and decided to give his book a read. Overall, I think that hard skeptics will remain hard skeptics, believers will be comforted, and open-minded agnostics will remain the same, although perhaps the latter will think the likelihood of an afterlife is very slightly higher than the likelihood they previously assigned.    Dr. Alexander is an intelligent neurosurgeon who seems to truly believe what he wrote. With that in mind, I think that it is fantastic that he shared his story. In reading through this book, I was primarily looking for 2 things: 1) evidence of an afterlife; and 2) details regarding what the afterlife actually entails. The book is definitely worth reading on both points, but it certainly comes up short of \\"proof.\\" I finished reading with a number of questions that, based on what Dr. Alexander claimed he witnessed, could have probably been answered in the book: Is there a hell? Many of the religions have their own facts and doctrines - which is right? (Are they all right?) Does it matter what I do in this life? What were those pieces of evil sprinkled throughout the universe? How far away are other intelligent life forms? What do humans \\"do\\" in the future? Was Dr. Alexander aware that he was from Earth? (Etc.) Some illustrations may have been interesting. These questions notwithstanding, we did get a pretty good idea of what Dr. Alexander's heaven is like - and it was interesting.    Dr. Alexander does provide evidence for an afterlife if you take him at face value. But, based on objective fact-checking from several neuroscientists, I do not believe it is a medical certainty that his neocortex was in such a paralyzed state that none of this could be possible (perhaps his brain could have been working post-surgery). (Dr. Wade, his doctor during his coma, did not give that assessment). I also think that some of the writing, especially in the earlychapters, was a bit sensationalist.    So, what evidence could Dr. Alexander have given? I think conclusive proof would have been to make a bold prediction regarding a testable, unknown fact. Maybe tell us what dark matter or dark energy really is, for instance. Just about any testable prediction would be great. (If he has done so outside of the book, someone please inform me!)    As a last point, the book seemed to be focused on the lay person, rather than an academic or well-educated individual. Dr. Alexander has a broad array of academic publications in well-respected journals, so I think this was intentional, but I was dissatisfied with the writing.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I'm a huge Denzel fan so I thought the movie was off the chain!  One you won't forget and it keeps you coming back for more.  I purchased hoping its one I'll want to watch over and over again.  Great movie.
B007YNBOJM|5.0|Great birthday gift for japanophiles. Was received with glee and squeals of delight. Worked as advertised. Because hey, robot cat ears, right?
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I've been using this product with laptop and I have heard improvement in sound quality. Everything sounds clearer. Fiio also makes a DAC called the e7 but I have read reviews that this one is superior.
034580404X|5.0|This is one of the best series I have read recently.  I was so sad at the end, a couple days after finishing I missed the characters and wished there could be another book added.
0393324818|5.0|This book has so many things going for it.  A famous professional sport.  A great story of the underdog doing well. Many stories of less than attractive (by traditional scout standards) who have made it in the Major Leagues.  And just plain old hard work and willingness to challenge dogma with evidence.  Enjoyed it very much!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This was a very different book, having been from the narrative of the dog.  I enjoyed it very much, as did my book club.  We had a great discussion.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is an entertaining diversion that rides the line between fun challenge and irritating frustration, as with any game where you have to repeatedly start from the beginning of the level. It doesn't entirely make sense that the gas and brake can control you in midair, but it's fun. Still not sure if the race car's aerodynamic upgrades make a difference on the moon, which of course they shouldn't. Easy enough to earn points that there's little reason to worry that you'll end up spending real money for upgrades, at least as I can tell so far.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My grandson loves to play this game. We have a lot of fun together building different vehicles to run on the courses.<br />He especially likes to watch them crash of course.
B00962341U|5.0|The first album was good. The second album was a treat to the fans although a tad self-indulgent. But this album is commercially her best yet!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Can't cheat or peek under cards.  Otherwise, same as physical cards.  No real challenge that I know of, as long as you don't miss any matches.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|We are now Throne junkies! Finally broke down and ordered HBO - couldn't wait until 2014 for season 3! The acting is great - love the good characters and love to hate the bad ones! Buy it and get hooked!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I played one suit forever.  Two suits appeared too hard, but it wasn't after I tried it a couple of times, used the back button a lot, looked up the hints.  Haven't mastered it, but it won't be as long before I try the three suits.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|With all the hype, I was expecting more, but it was worth paying to watch from my home recliner. My wife would have given it four stars.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was very slow an  hard to keep attentive with for parts of the novel. But overall very endearing and touching family story.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Works great.  I like knowing how long until fully charged.  It also tells me the percentage of power used.  That lets you know when to charge again.
B00007KWHG|5.0|All the tracks are what to expect on this wonderful compilation and its sounding excellent due to the fantastic remastering.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie is a classic and can be enjoyed by any age.  I would highly recommend it for a family movie night or a something to pop in for the kids on a road trip.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Just enough of a challenge not to be boring and doesn't rush you if you are doing other things. I like it.
0812550706|5.0|The book was inexpensive and in the condition I expected.  It arrived sooner than expected.  I've read the book several times and it's still my favorite.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Picked up this book not thinking much of it.  I just saw that it had really good ratings.  Then after finishing the book I realized why.  Ryan creates such a great story, with amazing characters and vivid action scenes.  I don't want to say, &#34;if you like Game of Thrones or Lord of the Rings you will like this....etc&#34;, because you can't compare.  This is a great book, independent of other classics.  I would highly suggest reading.<br /><br />Only one problem.....the next book isn't set to be released for a year.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Recovering elder Comic geek- there are purist whoso have not appreciated the as much as they could have if the storyline had stayed exactly the same. I will grant that- but they are in the extreme minority .<br />This film did exactly what it needed to do - establish the character for the franchise- it remained true to the spirit of the character and surprising the message in light the global market it was released into.<br />After all that- it is a Good Movie based on a Comicbook - & to any Geek - that is worth alot<br />Enjoy
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have to say temple run 2 was WAY WAY better! It has great new features like the zipline, spiked spinning log, and minecart! I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a game that you can play whenever for whatever reason!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is a pigeon. I read both books: Beautiful Disaster and Walking Disaster. I am about to read it again but slowly this time around.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I am not sure why this movie got high reviews, the story is so unreal and stupid to start with, other than the nice looking Jennifer Lawrence there is nothing good about it.
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|The most compelling information was about stress and the brain. I was hoping this would be a valuable tool for teacher professional development, but I'm not sure.
B004YM6JLO|1.0|When I started watching this series I thought it was much better than Twilight, but as the series goes on it becomes increasingly more and more stupid. At this point (18th episode of season three)I finally couldn't stand it anymore and Twilight suddenly looks pretty good! I think Scooby Doo episodes look smarter and even more entertaining. I can't understand the high ratings, maybe it is that this show is not for me. Damon and (surprisingly) Caroline are the more likeable of the bunch (actually Damon is pretty cool). Elena, who is the main character is annoying to death, and I thought that Bella was bad enough. And let's not start with Klaus (bad clown). I get it that this is fiction but even fiction has boundaries with reality in order to make feel the story \\"real\\". It looks like Roadrunner and Coyote Cartoon, they try to kill Klaus and never can. And the writers justify it now with the absurdity (even for fiction) that the bloodline will die with the original vampire turner. Voila! And they didn't move on, they stayed with the same plot since the last part of the 2nd to the 3rd season!. Don't they have more ideas? If they don't, well, hire new writers! I've seen a couple of season four episodes and it gets even worse!!! I won't waste time and money in this anymore. They should change the name to \\"The adventures of Klaus, the supervampire\\". If you are a fan of vampire stories stay with True blood or the old stuff where vampires are monsters of the night. In fairness the first season was good. The second so so. I wouldn't recommend the third season, but (like I did) find about it yourself. You'll be disappointed (like I am). What a way to waste a former good show!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This temple run is more fun then the first one it has a lot more features to  I highly recommend this game for a lot of kids who like fun things
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This game can really get you thinking.  Fun strategy and nice options. Wish there was a bit more guidance on the different plagues.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is a very good book. Action packed and enough mystery to keep you guessing right to the end. Definite page turner for sure!
B006LSZECO|5.0|still reading this but so far it is great.  Love the story line and it keeps you wanting to find out what happens next.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|I had taken my mom to see the new &#34;Star Trek: Into Darkness&#34; and discovered she had not seen/didn't remember this film. Fans of the new films will understand them better if they view this one. Montalban is fabulous! And as a soundtrack fan, I love the James Horner music. The quality of the picture (we watched via Roku) was most impressive. Don't miss this if you haven't seen it -- or watch it again if you have!
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|I was hooked on various styles of Nat King Cole as a teenager, still am as a grandmother.  George Benson has terrific voice and style.  Really enjoy song selection.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|The movie arrived safely packed in great condition! I enjoyed the movie, as I luv action flicks, and Tom Cruise! I would rate the movie 2 1/2 stars out of 4. It was enjoyable, but not as good as his Mission Impossible flicks. :O)
1616550414|5.0|The Zelda book is so cool and definitely worth the money. The artwork is amazing! It also tells the history behind each game.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|finally available on aneroid market!!! I love playing the game and its very addictive. after you reach higher levels and unlock all the different powers you'll be playing for hours. only problem is the sound glitches on kindle fire.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|There is nothing wrong with the app matter in fact, i love it! It tells me how much time is left on my kindle before it dies, it shows me the battery percentage. I love it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put it down from the beginning to the end ,it was always on my mind :)<br />I am not a big reader but  this book kept me interested
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Good thing I got this book for free.  I stopped reading it after a few chapters.  The author basically kept repeating the same thing over and over.  I don't have anything against romance but it seemed like there was nothing more to this book than raunchy romance.  I kept reading hoping it would improve but it was pretty boring and disappointing.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Easing reading and an enjoyable story.  The ending was a surprise but enjoyed the writing. I would recommend it for book clubs.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham's characters make you laugh. The story line is timely and is humorously set in the midst of serious subject.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|just like any other facebook game that takes time except with dinosaurs. it is real fun and is a great way to pass the time
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This movie is worth owning and keeping in your film library.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed it and was glad for the gift.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I guess its pretty basic. Well really you can go into the option thing on your kindle and go on device and I think that it tells you about how much time have left on your battery.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|Think this is better on TV than as a book.  Slow reading, lots of characters, I think you love it or you don't...in this case I will not order the next in the series.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I am very happy to have the The Lion King, both in standard DVD and Blu-ray for my grandson and the whole family.  It brings back memories from the times we saw it with our own children. The Blu-ray DVD has beautiful color and effects. Because he is very young, I do fast forward through the more intense, violent parts, for now.  He will be more ready for these when he gets older than just a toddler.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a wonderful bit of writing that keeps you up at night.  It captivated me and I have already recommended it to friends.  I do not often give a book five stars, this one is a 6.  Put it on your must read list, you will not be disappointed.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Has all the benefits that were lacking in the standard keyboard for text, notes etc.  It has really helped with messages and will learn your style for input suggestions.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is a very intense account of a family's struggle to survive a horrific natural catastrophe. The acting and directing a superb and create a very compelling story. If you are looking for an &#34;edge of your seat&#34; experience then this movie may be a good choice for you.
B00003CXFV|4.0|While viewing the riveting ERIN BROCKOVICH one has to ponder. . .if the REAL Erin is so talented and so intelligent, why couldn't she hold a job?  How did she end up with a string of loser men?  Yet, alas, based on the recent boating adventures that placed Ms. Brockovich in some legal peril, perhaps she's not quite as intelligent as the movie suggests.  But I digress.<br /><br />When we meet Erin Brockovich in the film, she is a bombshell single mom down on her luck--a woman absolutely fearless to wear tight, suggestive--very revealing--outfits.  When her auto injury lawsuit gets thrown out, she bullies her way into a job at the firm of the lawyer who represented her (Albert Finney, a curmudgeon to my liking).  But what's she going to do?  Turns out she's a heck of an investigator, uncovering a cover-up by powerful Pacific Gas & Electric.  The utility giant has been dumping toxic waste near Hinkley, California, and the poison has seeped into the ground water, causing premature death and gruesome disease.  Erin befriends the victims, convincing over 600 of them to file a class action lawsuit, while PG&E throws up roadblock after roadblock.  There are the (predictable) setbacks, and all the while Erin's personal life is put in serious strain, yet in the end there is a poignant feel good moment, augmented by a fiery Erin getting her long overdue comeuppance once she receives her bonus check from Finney's gloating character.<br /><br />This is my favorite Julia Roberts role (to be honest, there's not much competition); the actress aptly carries the freight the entire story.  Finney more than holds his own, and the chemistry with Roberts is exceptional.  Special kudos to Aaron Eckhart as the free spirit, shaggy, next door neighbor biker who ends up babysitting Erin's three kids on a full-time basis; Eckhart's character is the soothing balm that keeps Erin's life from spinning out of control.  There are some jarring moments with the victims, and this film, as it's based on a true story, will make you angry, yet overall ERIN BROCKOVICH is a win/win:  Justice is served, and it's delivered by a vehicle that's ever so easy on the eye.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.n a true story, will make you angry, yet overall ERIN BROCKOVICH is a win/win:  Justice is served, and it's delivered by a vehicle that's ever so easy on the eye.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B001BANK32|5.0|I've seen the movie many times and finally got around to reading the book.  Very scary.  Love Stephen King. I've read a lot of his books.
B0031QUTBA|4.0|I just got these the other day, and I'm super excited to have these in my collection.  They all came wrapped together and ready for viewing.  This is what I will be watching for the summer!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Silly plot but it will keep you laughing.  I don't know how they filmed some of the scenes since they must have been laughing the whole time.  Great Saturday night viewing!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it was very good. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were amazing!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had to play all the levels. Once you start very difficult to stop. Challenging because there are no hints but that makes it interesting.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|In 1998 Black Sabbath released their live \\"Reunion\\" album.  This CD contained two bonus studio tracks recorded by the orginal memebers...remember those two tunes?  Neither do I.<br /><br />I really don't dislike this album - Tony is in fine form and Geezer, for the love of God, is simply amazing, but in 5 years I figure I will reach for Vol. 4, Sabbath Bloody or Master before this one.<br /><br />Only time will tell.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|There are unseen creatures such as faeries, mermaids, vampires, etc.....There are Shadowhunters that protect ignorant humans from these unseen creatures, the girl is more focused on her looks and how she compares to other girls rather than learning to fight. Became very bored with this story, wouldn't recommend it, it is a long reading journey there are many many books in the series.
B008D36INE|2.0|Beautiful woman in interesting setting who just is hopelessly depressed and unable to see the light. Spend your time on something more hopeful.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|For a start I thought that Lee was going to be female since the person who recommended the book to me seems to prefer female authors . Then I started to read the book and really found it hard to tear myself away.<br /><br />Never have I read so much horror and gore. If previously warned I would have rejected the book instantly. However the more I read the more inconsequential it was to the thrust of the work and yet it was pivotal to the story.<br /><br />I would hate to give any of the story line away I would just recommend that people read the book and then go and buy some more. Lee Child has me hooked.
193700788X|5.0|It amazes me how many people think they are book critics, having to tear the book and author apart because of their unhappiness with the way the story is told.  I thought the ending of this series of books was 'right on'; Ms. Harris bought a acclaimed book series to a satisfying finish. I must be one of the few that hated Eric; promopus, egotistical, self-serving and in love with Sookie when it was convenient for him, he deserved the woman he ended up with - '200 years as a sex slave' as one person put it - he was right where he wanted to be, in the upper crust of vampires.  While I would have hoped that Sookie and Bill would have gotten back together I can understand why she choose the man she did - or more aptly the author choose for her.  This will be a series that I will reread many times.  Very satisfying finish to the series. I applauded Ms. Harris for a job well done.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Having read number one I was not surprised by this one other than to marvel at the imagination and capability of Lee Child to draw the reader in to the work.<br /><br />The inexorable Jack Reacher is a rogue, a specialist, devious and clever, but intertwined into this man is a loveably , soft gentle character with winsome ways .....<br /><br />I cannot wait to read what he is going to get up to nin the next book
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is an amazing puzzle game. Much different than other games, and I lean towards the puzzle/clue type of game. Can't wait for more Rooms!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Spoiler Alert:<br />Good read...a little thrown off that the author would know her heroine is the sister of her crush and make them have feelings for each other. I'm hoping by the end of the series there's another twist that makes us find out it was all a lie and the relationship is not incestuous! Or she makes them stop lusting each other, gross...
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love hidden object games and this one is no exception. Hours of entertainment. My only complain is that the icons are quite small on my Kindle Fire.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I use this at home and work to access network shares. Easy to use, and works very well. I would recommend this for anyone who needs to transfer documents, music, and pretty much anything else to and from their Android devices.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Beautifully done.  It tried but did not quite capture the heartache this War produced and the awful destruction it left in it's path.  God must have had His hand in the Legislative maneuvering freeing the slaves or it never would have happened.  This act did set the slaves free but it completely destroyed the lifestyle of the plantations in the South.  One must remember on many plantations slaves were thought to be part of the family and were cherished by their owners in a positive sort of way.
0307744434|5.0|Our book club covered Night Circus a few months ago. How refreshing and exciting - and very original. We all loved it.  The characters are interesting - the ones you love to hate and the ones you love to love and cheer on.  There is a wonderful magical element.  Very enjoyable!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Excellent movie. Very good growing up movie. Good acting, good plot. Very solid. Emma watson is looking great,  too, which doesn't hurt.
B004SIP7TE|5.0|The dvd came in perfect condition. I was obsessed with this movie for the longest time now i have this movie for $5
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Great movie, My enitre family loved this so much we purchased for the kindle fire. It was best thing I have watched in some time.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|I really liked this book, but I didn't think it was as good as the first one. I thought that it could have used a little more of the back story and I was expecting it to be in Mia's point of view and not Adam's but I really enjoyed reading it. I also like how at the beginning of some of the chapters they had parts of the songs that Adam wrote.
B0016492BW|1.0|It might just be my BluRay Player, but the disc only plays the menu. Click any link (Play movie, special features, scene selection, etc...) and it reloads the main menu. Ultraviolet code was good though.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like the Kindle app for my android table...it is easy to use and downloads are very quick and easy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show! It is my favorite series. I pay to watch the episodes. I can't stand for one episode to end before I am ready to watch the next one. I feel like I am part of the group and can't stand loosing someone. I put myself in this show every time I watch it. I have even been dreaming about it. I hope they continue to make more and more series. It is the best show I have ever watch. I never want it to end.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love mahjong games and this one is great!! The only thing I don't like is the shuffle icon which doesn't always work
B0025KVLT2|5.0|I needed the song \\"In My Life\\"; for a DVD I was making for a friend's 50th Wedding Anniversary.  Other songs on album are great, too.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for several months and, unfortunately, was a little disappointed. It has been more than 40 years since I read the book. The story was far more engaging and suspenseful than the movie. The acting is good, the makeup and costumes are great, the scenery is absolutely beautiful although the transition is sometimes disjointed from one scene to the next because they were filmed in different parts of New Zealand. The bad news is that the CGI fight sequences are way over the top and have no credibility. The fight between the Stone Giants and the excape was far to fanciful and tiring to watch. The whole sequence should have been replaced by a much shorter and more believable event. The dwarves excape from the thousands of orcs under the mountain was also way over the top. Other viewers have described it as looking like a video game. Again this sequence should have been trimmed and the flight of the dwarvs from the orcs should have been presented with, at least, some credibile elements.<br /><br />I see no justification for make the Hobbit a trilogy if only to allow for long sequences of run-away, over the top CGI battles.
B0058RCVYS|3.0|To be honest, I don't remember this movie. It could have been okay but if it was just awful I would have remembered that too. Sorry.
0061122416|5.0|i have got to say this order has got to be the fastest shipping ever i got it 2 days later and i needed this book for a paper so that was a bonus thank you so much and the condition was great perfect size i will be ordering from you guys again in the future.
B008D36INE|2.0|I didn't care for this movie too much. This woman married an older man, only to get bored with him and end up wanting the younger man. I didn't feel sorry for her at all, she was selfish and got what she deserved. I would recommend the movie to others.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Not as much action as Vince Flynn, more mature though.  I like the conversational form factor, though a couple times it was hard to distinguish who was speaking.  Minor quibbles for a solid story that kept me on edge throughout.
B003MXAQJW|5.0|Good representation of today's dysfunctional family.  Didn't pull any punches and covered the spectrum of extended family.  Convincing portrayals by these actors.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a good mahjong game. It moves smoothly, auto shuffles when there are no moves available, and flows nicely. Get this game a nd you will not regret it.
0739377957|5.0|This is such a beautifully written book.  It doesn't matter whether you understand the allegory or agree with the religious aspects, you will enjoy the beauty of the language.  The movie was visually beautiful but is not capable of touching your heart the way the book does.
0425263924|5.0|OMG!!! Is there a hotter couple than Gideon and Eva?  I don't think so.  I didn't think the series could get any better or hotter; but I was wrong.  This book had a lot more mystery than the others.  I thought this would be the end of the series but I am so glad to hear there will be more!!!!
B00CZ1HELA|5.0|UPDATE: Game bugs/issues were fixed so it plays perfect now.  I'm even impressed how my suggestion for improvement (such as making it colored) was considered good enough to change...Thanks David at Pixel Delight Studios.<br /><br />This is a good time passer but what I don't like is that it does not remember where you left off so you have to scroll across the numbers to get to the next level...if you even noted that.  Also, it would be nice if the different levels could change color to jazz it up some and not seem like the same thing over and over.
1449415881|5.0|The little notes and cartoons are spot-on for cubicle work. The blank backs are perfect for writing notes. When you write someone a note on a past day, the cartoon is a fun bonus.
B001GJ30S8|5.0|The product was brand new and in wrapping. As a reprint its still part of my collection.Very happy with it.
0307730700|4.0|We all know people who are willing to do dangerous things; but not many of them are fearless.  \\"Fearless\\" is the true-life narrative of a man who it may even be an understatement to refer to him as \\"fearless.\\"  While I have never met Adam Brown, this book makes me feel as if it would have been a true honor to be able to say that I had.  Nonetheless, \\"Fearless\\" makes it seem like I at least am able to meet him.<br />  Blehm takes the reader on a well-constructed trip through the life of Adam Brown from his humble roots and growing up in Arkansas, to the end of his life in Afghanistan.  In recounting tales from high school football, to basic training, and his ultimate mission with the SEALs, it seems accurate that Brown was a man who would not step down from anything if it was his duty to complete it.  Blehm's writing throughout is both technical and emotional, factual and gripping.<br />  \\"Fearless\\" will light a fire in the heart of even the most manly of men.  This is a good read, even though the print is small and more than 260 pages in length.<br /><br />I received my copy of the book from the publisher in exchange for writing a review.  I was not obligated to write a positive review; the expressed opinions are my own.
B001GJ30QU|5.0|The product was brand new and in wrapping. As a reprint its still part of my collection.Very happy with it.
1781162646|5.0|Great book, kept my interest for the 3 days it took me to read it. It was one of those books I couldn't put down.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|I was so excited to find WC Seasons 1, 2 and 3! I was introduced to the WC series in the middle of Season 4; therefore, I had no idea of the events which made the basis of the current series.  Now that I've enjoyed a steady diet of WC for the last couple of months, I'm all caught up and anxiously awaiting the new season to begin in September 2013.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|We were entertained and that's pretty much all we ask for in a movie. I hope you get a chance to enjoy it
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Seeing these comic book characters on the screen is very appealing and enjoyable.  The special effects were outstanding and the acting and directing were excellent.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Awesome story well researched and written with more passion than all John Grishams books I have thus far read. A story of redemption to a man who could not have fallen any deeper surrounded by and faced with the greed of the world and the temptations of the flesh but also with how God can reach through the depths of a persons soul through the prayers of another. Oe will love the introspection and the deep rooted strength of the writer as you get engulfed in the stories anmd backgrounds of a family and hnow far they cantake you if you let them.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|The movie is excellent and very entertaining.  Spielberg did a good job in presenting the story.  It was well acted and directed.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Yes this the JohnGrisham style I love reading.  got in a Grisham mood last week in between my own book writing and  am so glad I picked up The Litigators. Ou will laugh and smile and shake your head at all the twists and turns of a story worth your time. I loved it.
6305364648|5.0|An excellent film and well acted and directed.  It even beats the Terminator Series.  The special effects again were well done.
B004B7PX2S|4.0|It was a good story, but George Clooney never (well, almost never) smiled that engaging smile, making it too glum.  Yes, it was a tight situation for The American, but you have to laugh at yourself sometimes.
B000003FMY|5.0|The dvd was excellent and contains other pieces written by Russian composers.  Some are more well known than others.  A nice way to spend an hour.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|The following is something very different than usual TV. It's fun to guess who is in the &#34;cult&#34;. And I might add that Kevin Bacon is one of my favorite actors.
B003BZXHX8|5.0|It was nice to see Barbra at this venue singing some of her old standards.  It was beautifully done and a nice way to spend an hour and a half watching.  Brings back lots of pleasant memories.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|I liked this movie,it has action and its got funny parts, it also has a good story and it has good gun fight .
B001ANSSDC|3.0|As usual, this book was tons better than the movie. The characters are well developed and the author did actually write the main character as having bipolar disorder (something I questioned in the movie because there was apparently very little actual research done by Bradley Cooper who played the character with more traits of Asperger's syndrome.) The other thing that was fantastically better than the movie was the way in which the main plot point of the main character forgetting his past was slowly revealed. In the movie it is revealed far too soon.<br /><br />Okay, enough about the comparisons. Let's just talk about the book for a bit:<br /><br />The characters are all well drawn in the book. I've seen some reviews that state that the main character is portrayed as stupid, but I don't believe this is at all the case. The author does a good job of translating the mind of someone on antipsychotics onto paper. Likewise I believe that the author does an excellent job of portraying most of the other characters as human with all of their good traits AND all of their faults. You see, through the somewhat blurred vision of the main character, exactly what the author is trying to reveal about their character traits as well.<br /><br />My main complaint about the book (and the reason it did not get even four stars) is that while the author does a great job of drawing you into the book and keeping your interest throughout, he ties the end up in almost too neat of a bow. I'm all for a silver linings ending, but after all the sadness and intrigue in the book, you are left with the impression that the main characters are headed for a fairy tale life at the end, which is not likely. For me, the ending fell flat which is always disappointing.<br /><br />So, this book is a thousand times better than the movie, but it could have ended more realistically.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I had no idea where this was going and the ending turned me upside down. Must read. It is also a 'clean' book without injections of explicit sex and vulgarity.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I have had no problems with the app. its a nice easy to use and see battery monitor. It did not help me figure out why my battery has been draining so fast as of late like I had hoped.
B003B02O0A|5.0|awesome book, awesome read, couldnt put the book down....ive read it before but ill read it again with the sequal coming out in October
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Cute! It is a definite rent but not a buy to keep at home.  Cute for everyone to watch except small children.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game is a fantastic retro-arcade blaster with nods to Asteroids, Galaga, Space Invaders and many others (even Centipede).  Just the right level of challenge for a casual time waster.  I picked it up as the FAotD, but it's definitely worth the asking price.

B00005R5G9|5.0|I use to have this on VHS until my separation/now divorce, it went with my daughters when they were to stay with him for a few weeks then turned into 13 months. It never made it back to me. So for 17 years I've been looking for it in VHS until my VCR died over 6 years ago so now I've been looking for it on DVD. My oldest daughter is also a big fan of this movie and she directed me to Amazon to see if it was available. For the longest time it was only available in Region 2 which isn't my Region and I wasn't too fond of the sequel until recently when I finally got it. Now my daughter and I can enjoy watching it together again. And to think it only took 17 years and she's now 27 years old.
B001NA6096|3.0|It's OK. You enjoy too little of Vienna's beauty, listen to endless conversations, and wait in suspense to see if a serious relationship is developing between the two (3 stars rating also for their relationship).
B0028R3NCU|1.0|never worked. Just wasted my money. I dont know how to tell you, how embaressing it was when I got it. Can you take it back? I have no clue how to return . Because I never return anything before ever.thanks
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|\\"The only way to create value for yourself is to create value for others. Exercise: think of two people in your network who don't know each other but you think can add value to each other's lives. Introduce them.\\" That's sound advice from the book.<br /><br />Practice can be a different matter.<br /><br />I recently met an administrator at a civic event open to the public. He told me he had been a real estate analyst. When another drop-in guest mentioned she was thinking about a condo purchase, he said to us, \\"don't buy real estate\\", because his research showed that to be a bad investment in this market. The following week I met up with a friend. He told me that he and his wife were thinking about a home purchase. I told him about the analysis of the administrator, and my friend said, \\"I'd like to learn more.\\" The wife works at the same place as the administrator, but did not know him. I thought these people need to be introduced: the administrator talks to the public about his research in real estate, and the wife and administrator work for the same employer. I made the introduction by email. The administrator emailed back that he does not discuss real estate, and he didn't want to connect with the wife.<br /><br />Advice is good. Experience is gold.

0307352153|4.0|Susan Cain is to be commended for having the audacity to write this book, because she is standing up against the prevailing social culture. Susan Cain is my introvert hero.<br /><br />As any introvert can tell you, and as this book explains in detail, introverts are an underclass in this country. Similar to left-handed people a generation ago, introverts are forced to conform to the prevailing social standard, regardless of what it does to their sense of self-worth or their ability to be productive and effective people. They are not free to be themselves.<br /><br />I am an introvert (there, I said it) and this book spoke deeply to me. But much of it was a retelling or confirmation of what I already know based on my own experience. I was hoping to find a plan of action in this book. Unfortunately, the vagueness of her conclusions bothers me.<br /><br />For one, most introverts self-identify. We don't go to a doctor for a diagnosis. It's not obvious from our appearance. So how are we to tell the difference between an introvert--a socially acceptable condition--and the socially awkward person--less socially acceptable? The quiet guy who turns out to the be a mass murderer--do we as a society tolerate that because he falls somewhere on the introvert spectrum?<br /><br />For another, while I found a summation of everything that I have ever wanted is on page 264--\\"Solve problems, make art, think deeply\\"--Cain leaves unclear the question of how. How, exactly, do we get from where we are to where we want to be? How does a class of people who really don't like talking to each other get together for social change? What does it take? More education? More volunteering? More consulting firms? More writers? After reading this book, I'm still left with not knowing. Under the current social norms, some will succeed and many will fail.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing it is  very fun it is a good game it  is  just as  fun then  any thing  in the Appstore  I told my  friends about this game they  say it is really  cool

1936608898|5.0|Seriously! Life changing. I feel amazing after doing the Whole30 and am continuing to eat almost 100% that way still. The book is very educational and the eating plan ( one cannot call it a diet! ) had me losing weight and the most energized I have been since my early 20's. You will not regret it! Thank you Dallas & Melissa Hartwig, you changed my life!!!

B00D41H2PS|1.0|I had the same problem as the others.  Will there be a fix or refund?  The authors obviously never tried it out on the Kindle Fire.  Could have been an ok game otherwise.
B00BJENK62|4.0|My first Kindle version of a Lonely Planet Guide, but definately not my last...<br /><br />Love the Kindle features: Jumping around in the book by clicking links, offline maps etc. And of course the fact that I only have one lightweight Kindle to carry around instead of all my travel guides.<br />And Lonely Planet has always been the favourite travelguide. In my family it's known as &#34;The Travel Bible&#34;.<br />Lot's of good and useful info on what to see and do in Korea, as usual.<br /><br />Only one drawback. The guide mentions only the option of renting a cellphone because Koreas phonesystem is different from the rest of the world. But you can actually get a working prepaid simcard for your own phone if you're persistent enough. It requires an unlocked cellphone and your passport, as both you and your phone gets thoroughly registered before you sign a contract to get the one-month prepaid simcard installed! And preferably bring a korean speaking friend as there is little or no english in most phonestores (or have them call a translation service).<br />The biggest problem however is finding a store that can sell you the simcard. In Cheonan where I stayed (population about half a mill), there was only ONE place I could get the card: In the main SK office. In Seoul there is something like 5 places, including the airports, according to the internet chatter.<br />This info should be included in the next update of the guide. Until then I suggest googling it to find the nearest simcard store.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|This camera really needs to be attached to the crib to have any decent resolution.  I tried putting it on the dresser that's just a foot away from the end of the crib (propped up on some blocks).  The resolution - both daytime and night time - was horrible.  It really needs to be attached to the crib using the included mounting bracket.  It's pretty much a glorified binder clip.  Any baby who can pull to standing will rip this thing off.  My son is almost 3, so I've had to carefully explain to him that he needs to be careful and not touch the camera because it is very expensive and easy to break.  I would be really nervous to use it around a younger baby or toddler as it's really easy to yank off.  I guess you could mount a shelf and then put the camera on the shelf.  However, one big drawback is that it needs to be opened to 90 degrees or the resolution is even poorer (I learned this on the Withings FAQ website).  It's very tricky to pull that off without using the angled bracket that attaches to the crib (that is easy to yank off).  I'm seriously considering returning it for these reasons.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|my opinion is who ever out there that don't like this game you are wrong this is the best game in the world but i want to say the creator of the game is awesome
B0042VVLJM|3.0|I saw this in theaters years ago; so, I thought I'd show it to my family in order to help it appreciate the brilliance of Mozart.  We were shocked with the bare breasts that were displayed in one of the scenes.  I would have appreciated some type of warning that this scene had been added.

B001EJIMUG|5.0|BBC is known for its excellence in adapting classic literature - in this case, I didn't even have to focus on the talent of the cast, because they looked so real (no overt glamour to cater to modern audiences) and behaved so realistically, that I forgot it was a story, and one that I know very well. Instead, I was as caught up in the plot as I was the first time I turned the pages of the book it's based on. There are a couple of scenes that were clearly added to help bridge the story for modern audiences (such as when Captain Wentworth speaks to Anne in the Pump Room), which I could do without, but because they don't damage or otherwise hinder the overall story, I'm happy to give them a pass.<br /><br />All in all, just a beautiful, lovingly crafted tribute to a classic.
B000FC1KBG|1.0|As a future and then new mother I read many books to gather an arsenal of strategies to deal with my little one. I knew that no book was going to have all the answers, but hoped to find various ideas to try. Not only did none of the ideas in this book work for me, but the author's style created far more anxiety than relief. Of all the books I bought, this is the only one I wish I had skipped entirely. Her main argument of Eat, Play, Sleep sounds lovely, but assumes that the baby does not need to eat any more often than every three hours. I tried this from ages 2-4 months, resulting in a cranky baby who rarely slept for more than 30 minutes, because of her need to eat again. The author's categories sound helpful and fun, but I could not answer many of the questions and found that few of the predictions seemed to fit our mold. She insists that you should do sleep training from birth, which goes against many other common advice that reasonably talk about the babies special needs during the first three months of life and creates additional unneeded anxiety during the transition to parenting. I used an ergo carrier for much of the first three months and had little trouble sleep training the baby in the forth month. Another piece of advice she gave was to do a \\"fill up\\" when you were ready to go to bed, feeding the sleeping baby. I loved this idea, but every time I tried it I had a horrid night's sleep, with the baby waking every couple of hours wanting more food. Her hatred of pacifiers is almost comical (see Baby Meets World for a great history of this hatred). I am sure her strategies work for some babies, but not for us. More importantly though, I would be wary of any book that makes hard and fast rules about what is right for all babies.
B000002HMH|4.0|Is this what they sued napster over? Change for the sake of progression is not progression.<br /><br />Ok, they've changed their musical tastes, fine, that's not a bad thing. David Bowie's changed so many times yet still awesome so it's not a bad thing.<br /><br /> A couple of people mention their concerts are always full, great, good for them, but I don't think that's due to their current releases.<br /><br />Rock/metal's fallen out of the mainstream for a good 7 years now, so who's still around should be supported.<br /><br />With all that said, these types of albums are hard because there is a divide between what they are and what you want them to be. It's not like a band cannot go back to a previous sound, The Human Abstract is a good example comparing their 3 albums, with the 3rd reversing course back to the 1st LP's sound, and ending up much more extreme in sound.<br /><br />After a few listens, and approaching the album to judge it based on its own merit, it's good. Best song (opinion) is actually 'Mama Said', and I'm not into 'mom' songs.<br /><br />Oh well
B007B5EDEG|1.0|I thought it would be worth buying the Kindle version of the series just for the X-Ray capability.  I trialed the 5 and 4 book Kindle versions and no X-Ray appeared either my iPad or Paperwhite.  I figured that perhaps X-Ray was enabled on the sample so I purchased this version.  I downloaded to both Paperwhite and iPad..... No X-Ray to be found even though the  description above is clearly flagged for it.  To cross check my sanity I pulled up two other books just to verify it still worked at all.<br /><br />I returned this set 5 minutes later.  If X-Ray comes back for it I will gladly plunk down the $40.

B0056FMNYA|5.0|I have read the questions and answers for this product, and got one last week and hooked up to my D600 and D7100 with telephoto lens, keep in mind that this is not designed for you to carry your cam. jumping and running in a sport field. It is for someone with walking pace. I am happy with it, thinking to get another mounting plate so I can swap back and forth between two cams, you can always attach a strap from the cam. to the belt for added security. This is great, Italian made.

B0045INOCO|5.0|The movie starts fairly entertaining, becomes rather intense but has a bit of a disappointing end. Some of the scenarios are way too exaggerated to resemble reality but clearly that was done for dramatic purposes. If you like action and a bit of suspense you wont be disappointed.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a great case that charges your headset quickly.  You will get two charges before it goes dead.  It secures the headset and keeps it safe.  Love it and would buy again if needed.  Great for a traveler like myself
193700788X|1.0|As the majority of the reviewers, I've faithfully followed up the series, so no surprise here. I have read wonderful 1-star reviews that explained why the last book is so disappointing as a farewell to Sookie and her world. I can't do better.<br /><br />I'd like to add only one word: boring.<br /><br />I was never bored before reading any of Mrs.Harris novels - either it would be Lily Bard or Harper Connelly Mysteries or Sookie Stackhouse Series. But I barely finished this one: there was no tension, no feelings, no imagination; the intrigue and love, and characters - everything felt flat and seemed grey and uninspired. I would drop the book in a second, but after following up Sookie's story for the last 10 year, I felt I had to finish it.<br />What a waste of time.
B009I2UH2W|2.0|I like the coiled cord, the light on the adapter, and my past experiences with Griffin; however, I do NOT like that this particular charger stopped working after about 1 month of use. It was not plugged/unplugged excessively or abused in any manner...it just died. Disappointed.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Like lots of folks I started reading the books because of the show, and I have loved the books so much more than the show, especially since the show deviated from the books so much. I've always been Team Eric and I was veery disappointed at how the series ended.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie, even a year after it is released. Seriously addictive.<br />I personally love Tom Hiddleston and his role of Loki in Thor and avengers.<br />My favorite movie ever!

B005FPT51K|5.0|This is my 3rd monitor. I loved my 1st, which was just a normal Summer Infant. 2nd was the $300 Summer Infant, and had no tilt so you couldn't move it with your baby, but I loved the app where you can view your baby from anywhere. So when I came across iBaby, I went for it. The reviews are bad, and I'm not really sure why. I love love love this product. The app is flawless, the hardware is amazing, the picture is beyond anything I ever expected..... I can't believe people didn't like this product. If you love Apple Products, you will love this purchase.<br /><br />Sending my Summer Infant back today. :) Def going to recommend this to anyone and everyone!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Well done, griping, beautiful.  I am in this story for life. Have preordered the third season.  I check every day to see when its going to be released.

B0047Y17P2|5.0|I chose this rating because it deserves it. It kept me wanting more at every turn. The details on how the investigators get their information (I.e. police, detectives, forensics,etc.), how it all comes together. How even the Court System works; it was truly very interesting how at opening statement each counsel is required to outline how they intend to proceed. I never saw this coming; the protagonist actually being guilty, not only of the victims murder also the husbands murder and behind her own lawyer beating; it blew me away. I loved the ending<br />I will certainly recommend this book to all family and friends.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am a little torn by this book. I am not quite sure if I liked it or not. I thought EWY was the closure of Eva and Gideon's story but recently found out it's the 3rd of 5. We, as readers, waited a very long time for this book and I think that is where the criticism lies. While Eva and Gideon did uncover some secrets and take a very big step in their relationship, there were a lot of answers left unsaid that we were dying to figure out from Reflected. I understand why a lot of readers are calling this a \\"filler book.\\" I feel this story should have stayed a trilogy. Since there are so many complaints about this book and long waits in between, people lose interest. What started as a rivalry between Eva and Gideon and Ana and Christian, I am afraid the Cross series just lost that competition.<br /><br />Sidenote - I would be interested in a spin off book for Cary :)
B0093X805W|5.0|Still to this day, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remains my all time favorite book! Simply amazing and quick read.

B009ZE27US|1.0|I would give it a one star rating because it doesn't give your real age. You could update to get your real age. I also did not find it entertaining. It is sort of boring
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game, I don't love when it freezes up on me and even more frustrating is when they change the city ie I was killing it in the Tokyo version then they up and change it to the Miami one and ALL OF MY WORK IS GONE are you kidding me. Ugh....
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is good but it is missing things like Redstone. Not the complete version. I half recommend this game
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Use it every night and its awesome! I would highly reccomend it to anyone that enjoys noise to help them sleep.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Damn good CD, not trash as some might demand, but it is a good solid CD with memorable songs. I like it and have listened about 25 times already. If you like Cryptic and Youth you'll love this.
B00C4Y4434|4.0|I'm a collector of the dolls, I don't buy them as gifts for children or anything, but this particular doll disappointed me. I was so excited that they added a second wave of picture day dolls - I have the first four, and this is my first of the second wave. But Lagoona's clothing struck me as very low quality. The leggings are that cheap, shiny material that you might find on a dollar store doll (don't know what it's called but I may upload pics), her purse is like a shower pouf made out of plastic, and the pink top to the dress is also cheap material - i think it's called crinoline, and the ribbon to tie it to the back of her neck like a halter is a different material, also cheap and shiny/crinkly. Also her hair was completely matted in the back. That said, she's cuter in person than in the pic, but not happy with my purchase (that's what I get for buying at Walmart I guess). Also, not specific to this doll, but I can't stand that they've been giving the dolls earrings that don't match. Maybe I'm old fashioned. Swim Class Lagoona was also a huge disappointment due to quality - I bought her here on amazon, but I guess you can't win them all. Over all, I guess I give her a 4/5. But after I take her \\"glamour\\" pictures, I'm changing her clothes and hair!
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|This is a good movie to watch as long as you don't spend any money on it. It's not exciting and doesn't hold your attention. It is an okay way to kill a few hours, if there is nothing else to do.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I received this season in perfect condition, and it was about $20 cheaper than buying it from target. Definitely recommend it to any Big Bang fan.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I went in with no expectations at all. I wanted great riffs and solos from Tony and pounding bass from Geezer. I love Rage Against The Machine so I know what Brad would bring to the table too. Ozzy was the wild card here. I was not sure what to expect from Oz and to me he delivered & this is a solid 4 stars. Very solid and very Sabbath sounding to my ears. Now folks will give it a lower rating because it isn't the original Sabbath without Bill on drums. I get that but don't give it a piss rating because of it. Is the music mixed the perfect way? Maybe not someone's liking but not mine.  Sounds good to me. I have played it 3 times now and I will play this before say \\"Never Say Die\\", \\"Sabotage\\", \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" and I play those all the time since I love Sabbath. My 2 cents worth.
B0041KVV8U|5.0|The vinyl have a very good sound quality and the cover is good to. I recommend this item for everyone.
B009X01GJ2|2.0|I shopped for days for a proper case for my Kindle and decided on this one primarily because of it's ability to rotate.  I owned a Targus rotating case for my 7&#34; original Kindle and loved it.  This manufacturer gets an A for effort but the delivery of the actual product falls short for me when looking at value.  The case is heavy, the Kindle is difficult to remove from the case if desired and the rotating plastic base is tight making the one way rotation difficult.<br />The magnets or whatever &#34;magic&#34; exists to shut the unit off have to be carefully aligned to make sure the unit is turned off. sometimes it is and sometimes not.  This is certainly not a convenience item.<br />The elastic is already slightly floppy.<br />The  material is nice, the stand works well in portrait and landscape.  My previous Targus cover for the original Kindle was used a great deal and still looks great whereas this cover is already showing signs of wear.

B003HKN51Q|3.0|Back in the 1970's I first saw this movie, (or the movie this DVD was based on) during a tv late Saturday night showing. I think it was back in 1974. It was the start of me becoming an Elvis fan.  However this isn't really the movie I saw. WB took liberties with it beginning with the first song, Johnny B. Goode which they replaced with Don't Be Cruel a good song BTW but they shouldn't have changed it. They edited the car sequences where Elvis didn't know he was being filmed.  I know I remembered the origional correctly because a few years I bought the VHS and it was the way I remembered.  I'm not saying some changes shouldn't be made. I'm saying instead of taking things out put some concert footage in.  I understand they have tons of footage from the concert where he was wearing the pale blue outfit. and it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't have tons more of the dark blue and the white ones.  Why don't they take as and example what they did for That's The Way It Is. or Elvis Aloha From Hawaii or the 68 Comeback Special?  They did wonderful jobs on them and found the best footage of them for some real kick butt first class entertainment fit for such a great talent.  Get on the ball WB.<br />I believe in giving people another chance so please redo this and make something good into something GREAT!!!

B00634GHJA|1.0|I thought it would be easy to set up, but then I find I have to create a Google Play account and associate it with a Google email (which I never use) and create a Google wallet. I don't want any of that. Sorry I spent the $1.99

B00CWM3F4C|3.0|Yes, this album has the distinctive flavor of Alice in Chains, but the tunes seem like long versions of prior work that lull one into a trance.  There is nothing wrong with the distinct character of these tunes, they just didn't ring &#34;new&#34; to me and I was expecting more from a great group like Alice in Chains.
B0053O89JM|5.0|We haven't made it all the way through season seven yet, but am looking forward to watching!  Vendor was great getting this out to us in the mail!  Thanks!
B00CXN2JNS|3.0|I rated the album 3 stars because unlike albums such as &#34;Youthanasia&#34;, and &#34;The world needs a hero&#34; this album, which is technically challenging just doesn't thrill.  Dave Mustaine really can belt out difficult music at high speed but that just doesn't mean the tunes have the synergy to be great.  Sorry, just my feeling.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Thank you for such a great book.  It is very helpful for authors who like to create the kindle version of their books.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The movie was a wonderful treat for the eyes and ears. the color, 3-D, and the sound was the first test for my new 7.1 system and I was blown away. Spike who is afraid of thunder, had to be comforted and I had to turn the sound volume down to keep him from losing his composure.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Installation was easy, my bluetooth headset fits like new and the sound quality is great.  Plus I have 2 more just in case something happens.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|The leather is great, It revolves to stand portrait and landscape. I even bought one for my sister and an extra one just in case it gets damaged from use.
0979019710|5.0|We received this book as a gift from a good friend, and after reading it more than once now we have returned the favor passing it on to several different friends! Amazing, amazing book! Hal really knows how to write to move you!<br /><br />Thanks bud!<br />Britt and Steven
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I watched this when I was younger and recommended it to my daughter. She loved it so much she wants to get it as a gift.
B001NLKT60|5.0|i love how larsson develops his characters.  very interesting plot.  it does take a while for it to get interesting but once it does, you wont put it down
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It is a beautiful film with different stories of each member of a family,  fantastic actors of first quality.  I'm waiting for a fourth season soon.
1781162646|5.0|Growing up every summer the Thomas and Joyland carnival came to our town.  This book title caught my eye and written by Stephen King made it a must read.  It was an exciting crime novel.  I was guessing to the end if the murder would be solved.  Kept me up all night reading because it was so interesting.  King is a brilliant writer.  A murder mystery different from his usual works is just another road for him to explore.  It will bring him more fans who will want him to write more mysteries and old fans will come to love these books, too.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Usually, Android apps close by hitting the back arrow control on my phone but this one does not.  I have to click the X at the top right.  That's different but okay I guess.  Just not consistent with any other app I've ever seen.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible? How many bible applications can offer what YouVersion does? I have used this in so many ways. When I have been speaking to someone who just doesn't get it....including myself; in an INSTANT I can switch to the Message translation.<br />From NIV to New King James I can not see any other mobile bible that comes close.<br />Thank God for you guys and gals at YouVersion!<br />LesW
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|Skip to the last 25 minutes or do. Before that the characters are flat, predictable and irritatingly stupid. Good one-liners and action toward the end.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I love this show so much! It's brilliantly written, directed and acted. It's witty and quirky and campy and GREAT!
1616550414|5.0|This book is for fans! i recommend to acquire the book! It's really heavy. It's like a Zelda Bible, has almost everything you need to know about the series. What i don't like is that they missed to include a lot of artwork and the blueprints/character sheets, that are common in 3D. But overall, this is like having a treasure!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|its taken a good part of the week to get this order filled and shipped;  i use to be able to count on faster service which was one of the reasons i preferred Amazon.<br /><br />This DVD series is wonderful.  Great characters that are beautifully portrayed by talented actors.  And my teenage daughter loves the British accent so we get to spend lots of good family time together watching. Best thing about having the DVD set is we can watch multiple episodes at once and really get a fix!
B007ZXQNGA|5.0|This book was one of the best and easiest reads I have had for a while. If you are thinking about starting a business then it really gives you the motivation to do it!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well I believe this game is awesome because it was so cool when you play because y you get to do throat fun running that shows that you should never do Graffiti cuz that might happen to you. And you could be in serious trouble.<br /><br />  Game Rocks Love It!<br /><br />  Laters peeps We all rock at this game
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app every day very useful and no problems I change the area zip to see what the weather is at other locations very helpful planning my days off yard work and play won't go wrong with this app no problems where free makes it better yet
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is such an amazing game I'm so glad I go  it because I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE to stop playing since. It is really addicting.
B000I5SY5U|4.0|Just great story. Worth a watch, great acting. Michael York and Liza are supreme, although a bit strange at times.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun. Keeps the mind active and challenges the brain. Love the puzzles. The music is a bit irritating though.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|This was made while treatment of returning veterans of the Viet Nam war was still fresh and people remembered the frustration of soldiers not permitted to win. It is set in a small town in a forested area with some of the usual arrogant police and stupid locals who have no clue what fighting conditions were like in 'Nam, and a fairly savvy police chief who is also clueless about the mental state of the veterans.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so inspiring and heartwarming. Best book I have ever read. Highlighted so many great quotes from this book.
0143039601|5.0|One of my all time favorite books. I took it on a road trip around the Bay Area of California and Washington State it inspired me to write again and although it has a grim moment it was thought provoking and a wonderful read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has more of a realistic feel to it rather than some of the other games I have played. If you love horses as much as I do than this would be the perfect game for u.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I got this controller yesterday. Looks and Feels nice. It's a bit smaller than the Xbox controller, or at least it feels a teensy bit smaller.I like the text red grip but my biggest grip is that it will not power on the ps3.
B007L7JY3Y|5.0|I've been using 2do for around 6 years now, on every device from that dreadful original iPhone phaseII suffered through to my new HTC One and Samsung tablet. This app syncs wonderfully with Toodledo to keep your tasks in the cloud. I keep separate tabs for my legal practice and other lists. Very good graphical layout of the tabs,  which can also be hidden when not needed. On the iPad and other tablets 2do allows for drag and drop to change due date. I love the simple means of deferring a due date from the task list: just long press on the task and defer, I use it all the time for task management.  I don't understand all the one star reviews, they are totally off base in my opinion. 2do deserves better. Give it a try and see for yourself.
B000OLROWC|4.0|I watched this movie the other night and now I'm just running around my apartment sweeping legs and yelling that someone should get him a body bag. My roommate doesn't like the change in my attitude.  But what can I say other than Strike First! Strike Hard! No Mercy! Rational thought does not exist in this dojo.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app ever I just love this app buy it it's worth it I've loved minecraft and if your gonna get the computer version start with this
B00BJDARA0|5.0|Whitesnake made in Japan is an awesome,current example of their powerful rock n roll attitude and soundget this if you are fan of them or any 80s/90s rock genre.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a really good game I love playing it. I play it all the time its great even better than the first temple run.
B009HUB40Y|2.0|Have played slot of these and this is not one I would recommend.  Fun but not so friendly could make it better or more interesting.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|As many others have said this is a great game, but the game randomly resets all of my progress on my Kindle Fire. Easily a five star game otherwise, but the entire experience is ruined by a fairly common glitch.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love the storyline and the chemistry of the characters. The show is very captivating. Please add in Ssason 2
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but fun game. Totally enjoyed it for a bit of brain power. Would definitely recommend it if you are bored or need a challenge.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|another great game full of puzzles and adventure. good length if time to play through and variety in puzzles and hidden object.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This was a fun, not too hard, game to play.  I have enjoyed other flow and bridge type games, and this is on par with those!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I first got this app for my son, but I loved the game as well. I was able to compete with my friends and I was able to log into Facebook to play. Now that the name changed from Subway Surfers to Miami Subway Surfers, I have still been unable to connect to Facebook as I did before. It's been over a week. I'm almost thinking about deleting the game at this point. It's not fun anymore as it previously was. I've sent messages for help to Kiloo. The problem has not been resolved. Also, the game downloaded again and I've had to start the game all over a third time.
B004T340QY|4.0|Quest fellowship type plot with odd surprises. No cheep jokes or sexual scenes.  Slightly simplistic southern stereotyping but not excessive.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES. Second time I have read it. I Love that I can borrow it with Prime. And that the movie is free.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I can't believe this book ended like that its horrible. I was expecting so much more, it just ended unfinished. Not very happy.
B007EECSFA|1.0|I have no desire to even finish reading this book. I found it boring and dry. It didn't hold my interest at all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, lots of fun. Helps you to unwind after a busy day but also keeps your brain working but not overly difficult.
B000063DFQ|5.0|I had this masterpiece years ago on cassette and forgot how good it is. Definitely one of Iron Maiden's best.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie is a sweet telling of an age old story of boy meets girl, it has a fun twist that boy is a zombie and the girl is apart of the living. This movie a takes the awesomeness of zombies and bring love and comedy into it. It is a zombie movie you can have someone who hates gore,watch.  It has a love triumphs over everything messages which can be fun and it doesn't beat you over the head with it.  If you want action , comedy, and romance...besides Shaun of The Dead. This movie has it. Loveable characters, great pacing and JOHN Malkovich.
B005MMYMW8|2.0|I really enjoyed Spartacus: Blood and Sand, despite the Klingon-style English, the peculiar costumes, and the frequent disregard for historical accuracy. It succeeded for me because of its grand-scale characters and fast-paced storytelling, as well as its basic fidelity to what we know about the real Spartacus. Gods of the Arena, however, has no basis in history, and every episode simply cannibalizes one or more plot-lines from Blood and Sand. Still worse, Dustin Clare as Gannicus is an unappealing protagonist, without the warmth and humanity of Andy Whitfield and without even moderate ability as an actor. His principal efforts at characterization involve growling all his lines in a soft, menacing tone while maintaining a consistent three-day growth of beard. When you add the poor storytelling to the poor casting and the poor acting, and then take stock of the historical silliness, you get a big disappointment for any true-blue fan of the gladiator epic.  A few details of which the scriptwriters appear ignorant: First, in Spartacus' day, Capua was renowned throughout Italy as a city of wealth, luxury, and beauty -- yet in this series it is depicted as a squalid slum. Second, Capua was a multi-ethnic city that had only recently been absorbed by Rome. The local population spoke Oscan, while the city's new Roman ruling class enforced the use of Latin for all official business. The natives resented their Roman overlords, and there was a wide social gulf between them. We get no hint of this in the series. Third, gladiators never aspired to \\"honor.\\" They were well aware that, as social outcasts, they were automatically regarded as \\"infames\\" -- disgraced men with no hope of achieving honor. Yet we constantly hear Crixus the Gaul yammering about honor. It's fashionable now to claim that period movies and TV don't need to pay attention to history because they're \\"just movies\\" or \\"just TV.\\" But isn't it funny how the most historically accurate shows are usually the best?
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I bought this book on Kindle when it was offered for $2.99. Because it was doing so well I guess, somebody got greedy and jacked up the price to $7.99. Amazon sent me an email saying my \\"version\\" was no longer available and gave me the option to either get a refund or buy the new and more expensive version. Thanks but no thanks. I asked for a refund. Amazon replied saying that the email they had sent was \\"incorrect, and there is no action required to continue enjoying the book.\\" Despite this assurance, Amazon refunded me the $2.99 WITHOUT TELLING ME! I only found out when I wanted to read the book again and found it was GONE! I feel robbed!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is a wonderful app. There's a daily word feature that I really like. When I need to check spelling or a meaning, I have a resource at my finger tips.
B00447G2PM|4.0|Excellent 3D blu ray ,  Awesome underwater pictures, very clear images. Very  interesting subject matter. Highly recommended for adults and children. Only drawback was the documentary was not very long for the price. My advice is to purchase this Blu-ray used, dontbpay more than $12.00.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|As with all Die Hard movies, this ones just entertaining and funny. Good effects, lots of bullets and no love scenes... just action. Perfect for the action junky just layin around bored...
B0006HBZXS|5.0|By far, one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Loved the nature scenes, as well as the star of the show - the BEAR.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Honestly, I feel like I'm getting a history lesson every time I read one of Rick Riordan's novels. It's very refreshing to see him taking one a new kind of culture and people in the Egyptian world :D
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love the big bang series season 6 .As someone who studied science in college and got a medical diploma it nice to see intelligent good people raised for intellect and sensitivity . And yet be funny season after season
B009NY43NY|1.0|It was pretty obvious that Charlaine Harris just wanted to end the series. This was the worst book out of all of them, which is sad. It seemed like she rushed through the story, trying to wrap up all the individual characters. Not to mention one of the worst sex scenes I have ever read. It's an unfortunate way to end a series of books that I truly loved. Oh well. At least there's still True Blood.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|My husband and I both love this album. We listen to every song on it. It's is great to get a cd that has more than three or four songs that we listen to on it. AWESOME MUSIC!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|It was alot of fun to watch.  My daughter who plays the game loved it, and I, who doesn't play the game, enjoyed it very much.  Lots of action, great music.
B005C4ERHQ|2.0|Don't expect a big solutions from this book. The 34 themes represented in the book are so broad and the suggestions, action items etc. given are too generic to actually act upon it. It's more a starting point. I would suggest to take just the survey in gallup website as the report that you get after the test is more or less half the content of the book. The book as such didn't add any value!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Seems like the author just wanted to make some money and didn't put any thought behind finishing this story.  Very disappointing!!
B00028HBKC|5.0|Seeing Jesus go through incredible abuses leading up to the cross as well as his crucifixion gave me a much deeper appreciation for what it all means to me in my everyday life.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Not what I expected comp[ared top either google play version or pc  version. I will try to experientment with it later if I have time.
B0079J28NC|5.0|This is a classic Must Have! It makes a wonderful child's gift that the parents will treasure forever. Many a wonderful memory comes with this one!
B00899F0G8|4.0|These are very saga-licious, my dotter likes them, I listen while upon the computer, and so we have the shared interest.<br />I find the book's well-written, with a candid energy.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It free and its a good iron man game. I was kinda resistant to buy it but it really was  a hidden gem
B000SZHH30|5.0|Phoenix are Stupendous. We are so sharing them. I must meet this group, and hopefully play with them. Praying. Deeply/Lightly
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Long book but it might be one of the best reads I've had all year. Looking forward to starting the next book.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Amazingly crafted page turner which kept me riveted until the last word.  The characters were believable and the observations made about the nature of relationships was most thought provoking. Highly recommended
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a really fun game for the Kindle except I have one complaint: the updates. My friend has Minecraft for her IPod and she has all these new features. And since she got the update and I didnt we cant play on the same world. :( please fix
0525953728|5.0|Well Written, Don't want to put it down once you start. Feel like you were there and understand what really happened.
B009K86D86|5.0|Really opens your eyes to how our food is processed and how important it is to be informed to what we do to our bodies.
0425263924|5.0|just finished reading it, i loved it i wish the book was longer! i also wish it would not take so long for the next one
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book. The twist and turns make this book impossible to put down!  Just when you think you have it all figured out...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I HAVE BEEN READING AND LISTENING TO KING NOVELS FOR A LONG TIME . HE'S MY FAVORITE AUTHOR BESIDES EDGER ALLEN POE
B004UPALT6|5.0|Gotta love Bruce in any movie, because just like John Wayne. Bruce is Bruce in any role he plays. But make it a campy horror flick(s) and you have movie magic!!!!!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is one of those rare TV programs that is intelligently written, well performed and expertly directed that immediately grabs your attention and never let's you go. I purchased season one on Amazon prime and watched all the episodes in three days and was left wanting more.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Distracted by the strangeness of the animated characters. The facial characteristics were too flat and unchanging, and did not adequately reflect the feelings the characters were experiencing.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Many new characters, many new settings - all of them delightful, but I find myself missing the older story lines. Only half way through so I'm hoping for more updates on my missing &#34;friends&#34;.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Is teaching me strategic moves.  I am 75% successful.  Tried going to 2 decks...that is HARD.  I will learn that too.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|It was mailed immediately and was in perfect condition! I would definitely buy a used DVD from this source again.
B000083C49|5.0|This movie culminates the saga started in Wrath of Khan. Its success and entertainment value is derived from the plot, especially the interaction between the characters. You can see that the actors had as much fun filming it as much as the fans enjoyed watching it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book kept me reading.  It portrays humankind and middle schoolers quite authentically.  Thank God for the good ending.  I would recommend this book to adults and kids alike.
B00992CF6W|3.0|When will the up date be out?? The update is out on Apple devices. The updates are so slow and need to be faster.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I have read all of his books and this one does not rank as one of my favorites of his, however, he never does a bad job with anything that he wrutes.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|It was ok. Don't get all excited thinking you're gonna love it. You might but you have a better chance of not
1401201911|4.0|Mark Millar doesn't disappoint here. This is a great re-imagined idea of the most iconic character in comics. The integration of superheroes, politics, society and morality here is flawless. The last issue will blow your mind-hole. Dave Johnson's art is pretty good here. He does a nice impression of Tony Harris. I probably would have liked to see Tony Harris on this book. Highly recommended.
B005HSL626|5.0|It takes a while to unlock stuff but the game is really fun otherwise. My favorite thing to play is zen mode;no bombs.90 seconds-awesome.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Great movie. Great price. Fast shipping. Can in good order. If you have doubts about watching or owning this movie. Don't doubt it. This is a fantastic war film. Amazing direction. Amazing acting all around. There are, of course, naysayers that were in the military that have some negative things to say about the technical aspect of the film. But please remember that artists take creative liberties to create a poignant narrative and deep characters. This isn't Black Hawk Down (fantastic 5 Star movie as well), which has a single idea hammered through your head, &#34;Leave no man behind.&#34; The Hurt Locker goes deeper into the mindset, the heart and soul of its principal characters. It goes beyond idealism. It is more about motivation, reasons, and ultimate the addiction of war. Great movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is very helpful when I am @ church or just referencing scriptures without carrying my thick bible. Would recommend.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I chose this book because I love a good love story. The story was nothing like I expected, because it's very non-traditional. It starts slowly, and the author took a little longer than needed with the character introductions. After the first half of the book, this story is enthralling. It's a tale suffering, struggle, love, and healing, and the ending is simply beautiful. Thank you, Christina McKenna, for a story that brought me to tears.
1781162646|5.0|No, it's not The Shining scary or The Stand epic but what it is is a very well written book that can't help but tug at your heartstrings.  The paranormal aspect of it is pretty light but deservedly so as the story itself roots the reader into an age gone by and an industry that basically no longer exists.  The characters are well developed and extremely likable and even the villain came as a surprise to this reader.  It's very much a one sitting read.<br /><br />I've been reading King since his very first book, was even given a first edition copy of Dark Tower by Mr. King himself before it was ever even known about.  I've been there through the good times and the bad and didn't really know if he'd ever come back from his horrific accident and for a while there, it didn't look like he would but then he released 11/22/63 and I knew he was back (although, I also enjoyed Under the Dome.  This is another fine example of the King I grew to love throughout the late 70's and early 80's, until he started publishing based on the publishers schedule instead of his creative one.  I suspect having come so close to death, he's telling the publishers that they will do it his way from now on.<br /><br />For those complaining about no e-book, yes I can relate as I really enjoy my Kindle, especially being able to make the font more comfortable for my aging eyes.  However, I bought the book and then two hours later found the e-book online and downloaded it.  So the author deservedly got my money and I deservedly got an e-copy for my Kindle.  Seek and ye shall find (another reviewer even mentioned the site but I won't do that).
B007REV4YI|5.0|Enough with the negative reviews from what I have seen on this movie.<br /><br />This IS the best BOND movie, in many years, that I have seen<br />almost every one of those 007 flicks.<br /><br />Daniel Craig IS the best Bond to perform with the acting skills,<br />valor, wonderful characteristics that he instills in James Bond, 007.<br /><br />This movie was the best one I have seen in years; the villain was probably<br />pretty spooky and eerie in this type of spy flick! FINALLY!!! lol...<br /><br />can't wait for the next 007 movie already!! let's keep making awesome<br />007 movies until it is done!
B00992CF6W|1.0|i never really understood the whole concept of minecraft... i mean u build all this crap and dig with pick axes. i actually decided to give it a chance and this seven dollar pocket edition killed the whole vibe for me.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I liked this movie but I always like the authors books.  It was a interesting story and kept me watching it!  I liked the actors in it and they worked well together.  Recommend this to friends.
B000002KHH|5.0|I'm sure that with all of the reviews already done on this album, mine will be the singular review that makes up a buyer's mind to purchase this.  If you like heavy metal, if you like rock and roll...heck if you like MUSIC this is one of the premier collection of songs ever put together on planet earth...perhaps even in all of the planets of our solar system or any other, for that matter.  It is musical enlightenment.  You will float away on a rainbow of musical notes while listening to this.  Iron Man, Paranoid, War Pigs, Fairies Wear Boots...are you kidding me?!  Amazing.<br />To sum up, great music, enlightenment, best in solar system, float on rainbows. No other cd can make these claims.  Buy it.  Then listen to it.  Then buy it again.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It was very good and really about life as it happens to people.  Very realistic! Recommend as a good movie to watch.
B000FCKRDI|5.0|I can't say enough about this series.  It is fabulous.  If you like historical romances, you must read this series.  I was wondering how Evie's story would enfold and was delightfully surprised.  It was totally not what I was expecting.  It is a great storyline telling Evie's and Sebastian's story.  Their characters are great.  There is plenty of passion, love, danger, and suspense.  The characters from the previous books were also In this one which made it all the better.  There are many series that I have read where the first book is great and then they go downhill from there.  Not so with this one.  Every story is just as good if not better than the previous.  I love Lisa Kleypas' writing.  Don't hesitate to read this book and series.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I didn't like this at all.  Some people may like the scenes and they way they go from one screen to another but I thought it was very distracting from the story line.  I would not recommend this to anyone!!
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|wasn't what I was expecting  didn't like many songs bowie was sounding old he had a monotone voice during much of the songs
B002XXNSF6|4.0|I enjoyed it very much after watching the sequel 'Before Sunset' and saw how the characters had developed over time. I enjoyed it
B00006AW2S|5.0|Energy of the time in the early Stones. Makes a great contribution to my CD collection. I'd recommend it readily.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|A very original thought where a series of 5 people (as best as i can tell) affect two central peoples lives accross time and through reincarnation to bring them together or split them apart while they find and fall in love in each life time, from early history, to thousands of years in the future stranded on isolated worlds.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|From a mans perspective BLAH this movie dont do much for me infact we ordered this movie two months ago and have been waiting in suspense ever since what a let down and thats coming from a family of two girls one woman and two guy's we were all let down and as far as the 3D effects I can think of many others that will show off your 3D TV much more than this flop
B005544V6A|5.0|LOVE THIS SERIES AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW SEASON! I WISH THAT THEY DIDNT HAVE TO TAKE BREAKS- BUIT I KNOW THEY DESERVE AND NEED THEM!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I felt like someone wrote a move and then tought \\"hey, lets make it a Die Hard movie and we'll get Bruce Willis to follow this guy and make snide remarks\\".  The editing was poorly done.  This was shot more like a Bourne Identity move than a Die Hard movie.<br /><br />I hated it from the start and all the way through.  Very poorly done.  Don't recommend it.  I have been a Die Hard fan from the first move but this one definitely doesn't get put on the shelf with the others.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is so relaxing.  I enjoy a game or four and a good glass of wine.  Nice way to unwind.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Seriously?  What just happened to this great story I have been waiting so long for? Ok , this starts out great! And then we are crashing by the end and I can not believe the ending? I guess I wanted more closure for Eva and Gideon. For all their struggles it was time for some happiness. Please Sylvia do not keep us waiting to long for the next book . We might all give up!!
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|There has  to be something said for a book of any genre that can make you think that there might be some validity to its pages. Watchmen plays on the emotions of the reader intellectually and emotionally. There is no possible way to skim through this book. Even if you try, you will be disappointed at how engaged you become. It is a fantastic read that leaves you spinning.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My daughter's 5 &amp; 9 years old love's this app it's actually good for all ages I played with my 5 year old &amp; she was not happy with me playing her game it's really cute &amp; girly &amp; me &amp; my 9 year old do not care for make up to much but it's fun for us ...the only thing I do not like is that is no way you can pick your own nationality they is only one girl &amp; she white :( please update

0575096616|1.0|It read like True Blood for Second Graders.  Super elementary writing.<br /><br /> <spoiler><br /><br />In reality this whole book was unnecessary.  Amelia's dad could have just wished for his daughter back.  Why did he have to with for the cuel vie dor (or however it's spelled) to get her back.  Which makes the whole entire book built on a big giant plot hole.
B0058SNI5S|4.0|I am on my feet long periods of time.  If I wear black socks I can sneak wearing them in my business casual office :)
B0012IWNTA|5.0|Just love the way this concert started and its just refreshing  and the fans are just having fun as they sing and watch all the magic that the guys and their cast put on and I especially love the poll dance that Howard Donald and Jason Orange performed and may I say that Jason has a wonderful voice.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I expected a problem with the streaming, but it was very smooth.  Maybe because I was watching the movie on Saturday at 7:30 am, but regardless, that was a great treat.  I liked the movie, and of course JLaw.
B000005S27|5.0|A collection of just part of the greatest hits of Take That I just love it I recommend you to get it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I bought this game for my daughter. She lost interest, so I started playing.  It's fun but frustrating.  I refuse to use real money to buy ponies. The game is slow sometimes so I can't even play some of the games with my ponies. The ad at the beginning always crashes the game too.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is so very well written it is hard to put down. The details are so vivid it is easy to picture what is being described.
0307950689|5.0|Greatly surpassed my expectations.  Great read. U won't be able to put it down. Better than the da Vinci code!
0152465073|5.0|A true little gem, transcending age and time and cultures.<br />I have bought several of these over the past thirty years or so as gifts.  I bought one in French for an 86 year old dying man who hadn't smiled in years due to illness but he smiled when he received this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game :D this keep me so intertian I love it:D<3 during skool itmake my day better anyone who like games and are a gamer will hose this game and will love it take from me :D
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! It is soooo addictive I can never put it down. But I don't get why I can never go to sleep and I want to fight some creepers but I can't, and I don't even know what I look like and I can't figure out how some of the blocks work.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The new update for mcpe is awesome!!!!!!!!! Now with the 0.7.0  we have spawners, eggs, cake,buckets ( water,lava buckets) and lots of other things too! I love it !!!!! And i think everyone will too! Overall i give this app 5 stars!!!!
B00D3CB41Q|5.0|Very good CD as expected ! I waited a long to finally have the CD, the dowloaded was easy and quick.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Adam Beach played a great role! The movie does show the horrors of war but his character showed true friendship and humanity.
B000V86OKG|5.0|If you are a Dexter fan, then you will love the second season. There were two episodes that they could have done without, but for the most part, it was great!! On to the third.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Love Vince Flynn/Mitch Rapp novels however found this last one to be very slow until the last quarter of the book when Mitch came back into the story.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Let me start by saying that this is the first review I have written.  I have read close to 50 books in the year since I received my kindle, and have never been this disappointed.  For one I was under the impression that this was a trilogy, and at 50% I was thankful for that fact.  The story drags on and on going back and forth with the same boring insecurities that plagued the first 2 books.  I even skimmed over the sex scenes, nothing new or exciting.  I also thought that this book was supposed to expose Gideon's secrets?  We got nothing but the fact that his abuser was related to that pediatrician that lied to his mother and how he came to own a majority of Vidal records.  This book was a waste of my time and money and like another reviewer said, I feel the author did this deliberately to cash in on the sensation.  I will not read the next book.  I waited too long for this one and was severely disappointed.  Shame on you Syvia Day.  DON'T make promises to fans that you don't plan on keeping.  I will not read any more of your books.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Love all of the Nelson DeMille novels particularly the John Corey series.  Waiting anxiously for the next in the series.  Went back to Plum Island just to remind myself how John Corey started and am enjoying it as much as the first reading.
0816158525|5.0|I found this book to be uplifting and comforting.  I loved it.  I would recommend this to family and friends.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The entire three disk set is great. With the Blu Ray and a 50&#34; 1080p Panasonic Plasma, this movie jumps off the screen. Amazing picture quality and sound.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I wonder what was the point in this movie. Try to create as much as confusion possible? The theme of the movie is great but the execution is very poor.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Season 1 of Amc's the Walking Dead<br />6 episodes packed with horror,drama,and a little comedy def worth buying either here or in stores
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Liked this internal dialogue, good character formation without giving it all away. Feel like I should read it again in a year to pick up anything I missed before.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I think this ga.e is very good and has a very good feel towards the colors like the corals &amp; seeweed I like it and u should to
0345803493|5.0|absolutely loved these books. I read all three books in 1wk. couldnt take my eyes off these. This book is not as sexual as the first book, so some might be expecting this.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a awesome game.it kinds reminds me of temple run and its in like a different form but when your listening to a certain song it blast it when you have in ear phones.its very fun and challenging just don't listen to misic.
0345803507|5.0|Excitement is what you are going to get as the plot thickens and there are plenty of lows and climatic areas. Recommend the triology to everyone
B005R32L66|4.0|its good and it does work well but it does lag sometimes which causes my messages not to load however it is only sometimes but it mostly does work so over all its good
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it just as much as the first two. Can't wait to see what comes next. Super excited and well recommend Crossfire Novels to my friends.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It works amazing. It barly ever lags. My messages always load and send. It works well and i recomend it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game but I am not thrilled with the commercials, or ads, before every game that I play.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|fantastic puzzle game with lots of extras (hidden gems, hidden levels). i never played the first 2 but now i will - this game is kind of like sokoban on steroids. all i want now is a sequel.
B0091REZMW|4.0|You have to pay in order to get beyond the original scenes.  I enjoyed the beginning.  Challenging and enjoyable to play.
B003L77GGK|5.0|i have liked this series since season 1 so i think its great. so my advice is to try it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|My controller was a genuine Sony PS3 controller.  After reading reviews let by other customers I was worried I might get a cheap knock off controller.

B0058BI896|5.0|This show continues to be the funniest and freshest comedy out there. Hasn't gotten stale yet! The only show where I can watch the reruns and laugh as much as I did the first time even though I know what is coming!!
B0036UMM84|5.0|I was in the mood to watch this movie, went to Amazon Prime and there it was.  I was so excited.  As old as it is, it was still great to watch Barbra and Kris do their thing together.  Thanks for having my favorite movies on Prime.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put it down and was sad to see it end. Easy to get involved with all the characters and follow the story.  I may read it again!
B007FDE4Y8|4.0|Let me start off by stating what should be obvious, but seems to get overlooked - ALL stabilizers take time to dial in. I have spent time with a Steadicam Merlin, own the Glide Gear stabilizer and recently bought the Opteka Steady Vid Pro. ALL of them require time (and patience) to dial in, so don't be quick to give up. I suspect that many people expect to attach their camera and immediately start shooting, but it just doesn't work that way.<br /><br />The Opteka Steady Vid Pro is fairly well built and offers good features for the price. The design is clearly a knock off of the Steadicam Merlin (sorry Steadicam), and works on the same principals of physics and dynamics. The Merlin is a higher build quality and faster to set up, but my experience was that it didn't perform better than the Opteka Steady Vid Pro. I would guess the Merlin's build quality and nice case adds to the durability, but for amateur use, the Opteka Steady Vid Pro seems durable enough. I would recommend storing it in the shipping foam, and/or finding a suitable case to protect it. Unfortunately, Opteka provides nothing useful in the way of describing how to set up the device or what the various components do. Some of the components are obvious, but achieving balance is not an intuitive process. Different camera/lens combinations result in different weights, so every setup is a \\"custom\\" setup - there is no magic formula that applies to all. Search youtube for videos demonstrating how to set up a stabilizer, or seek out the instructional DVD for the Steadicam Merlin, to learn about the principles behind these stabilizers. Armed with that information, you can avoid a LOT of frustration.<br /><br />One video that (more or less) describes the set up is this one:<br />http://youtu.be/o5rDBm-uZuI<br />Its not ideal, but its a start.<br /><br />One issue that the above video mentions is that it is important to keep the silver locking screws tight after you have dialed in your SteadyVid Pro. The stabilizer will slip out of adjustment if these are loose, so this is a crucial area to pay attention to.<br /><br />Another issue that applies to ALL stabilizers is that lighter cameras are harder to balance than heavier ones. I think Opteka should include a wider variety of counter weights to offer more options, but I am able to get all my camera/lens combinations in balance with the included weights. My GH2 with the 14-140 lens balances quite easily, but the smaller 14mm and 20mm pancake lenses have so little mass that balancing is finicky. I added a cheap Giottos quick release plate, which adds some mass, and this helps when balancing with smaller lenses.<br /><br />Once balanced, I find the Opteka SteadyVid Pro makes a substantial difference in the smoothness of movement. You can safely manipulate the pitch angle by gently holding the lower counterweight without losing any stabilization. You can also steer the device by gently move the gimbal. Most people expect perfect one hand movement, but after watching many videos of Steadicam operators, I realize two hand operation has many advantages.<br /><br />My Glide Gear stabilizer actually works quite well, but I even though the Opteka Steady Vid Pro is a bit more finicky to set up, the results are smoother and easier to operate. I knocked off one star due to the lack of instructions and limited range of weights.<br /><br />I would urge anyone who is frustrated with whatever stabilizer they use to invest some time learning how they work before giving up on them. You'll be rewarded with an effective tool for video work.r will slip out of adjustment if these are loose, so this is a crucial area to pay attention to.<br /><br />Another issue that applies to ALL stabilizers is that lighter cameras are harder to balance than heavier ones.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The writing was outstanding, and I thought the concept of a pilgrimage most original. The character's arc was excellent - the life lessons Harold Fry learned as he went along. At times the pace was slow and I was not in love with the gory descriptions of the cancer plagued nun in the end. It didn't quite go with the story which was why I didn't give it 5 stars.  The ending was appropriate in that the result of the pilgrimage was a marriage saved.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The series is great so far can't wait to begin book three.  The books remind me of Twilight and Harry Potter all rolled into one.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|It's a fun game, I like to make all the men run around to different jobs. When you sail out to sea all these bad monsters attack you.
0689859414|5.0|I bought these as a birthday gift for a 10 year old girl. I had them shipped to her in California, she has not gotten to see them yet. Her grandmother received them and said they are a nice quality material, good looking books:)
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I am a big fan of TOS. I was pretty skeptical when this film came out, but I really enjoyed it.
B00AK57N00|5.0|Just don't like ads in my games. Otherwise, very well done. It is a simple yet addicting concept, And well worth $1..
6305428050|5.0|this was a gift to my daughter.  she watched this many times as a child and drove me crazy with it so i bought it for her and for her kids to drive her crazy with it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|What a relaxing game.  Nice way to unwind before bed.  Great for hand eye coordination.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes solitary card type games.

B008IJT0CE|3.0|Fairly intuitive gui. Adjusting volumes for sounds that are already in a favorite could be easier. Editing favorites would be a great improvement.

B0086213XW|3.0|I was really excited to see this film and was sad I missed it in my theater.  I liked the premise of the film and felt it had some moments of perfection with really honest dialogue and some beautiful shots.  However, I had trouble understanding Michelle Williams' character when she spoke in baby talk (which was way too often for my liking) and something was just lacking.  I thought it was well paced and kept my attention, but I was a bit disappointed.  Perhaps if I had lower expectations I would have liked it more.  I did think the performances were great, including Seth Rogen in a more serious role.
B00CCEHX5W|5.0|Black metal that has the melody and structure of a Godspeed album. Excellent. Deafheaven will get flak for playing a more 'artsy' version of a mostly hardcore genre, but who cares? Its the music that matters, and Sunbather never feels compromising: it feels revolutionary.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game seems simple at first. But it quickly gets more challenging and more addicting. The more you play it the more you get hooked.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|It was the best book I've read this year. It made me start thinking that maybe if I  change my mindset my relationships could be better.

B009NY43NY|5.0|Another great book in Sookie Stackhouse series. The story line introduces new characters, for me the story flows and keeps it very interesting
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I haven't come across any Susan Boyle music that I don't enjoy. This is truly a delightful album, especially if you enjoy music from the stage.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Just a wonderful, adventurous journey of a novel.  I highly recommend that you don't pick this one up unless you feel comfortable canceling your plans for the next few days.  You didn't need that job, did you?
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Lee does it again. This is the 12th book from the series that I had read and it still hadn't disappointed me yet.. I love the writing that Lee Child has it is awesome...
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was very poorly written, too many unnecessary characters too many of the same sex scenes that became very boring and too many times Eva acted like a spoiled brat and now we find out there will be 2 more books coming out...I'm done !!!
0486406482|5.0|My daughter will really enjoy this book next year as one of her home schooling assignments. I would purchase fron this seller again.
B009LGO88E|4.0|When I bought my 3DS XL as an upgrade for my default 3DS, I balked at the idea of adding an even bigger version of the Circle Pad Pro to the already huge 3DS XL.<br /><br />Suffice to say, after a couple of hours, I got over it. The overall profile for the device is more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the original Pro, despite it's larger size, and it's indispensable for games like Resident Evil-Revelations and Monster Hunter 3-Ultimate. It adds a considerable bit of girth to the 3DS XL, though, all but ensuring it won't fit in many pockets. That's the only complaint I can level against the device; this thing makes the 3DS XL difficult to carry around during my commute to and from work/college, due to the size. It ends up in my backpack most of the time, and it's size draws unwanted attention from strangers.<br /><br />Well, that last part is more amusing than a mark against the device itself, but still.<br /><br />If you have a 3DS XL and you want a second Slide Pad, you have little choice; this thing makes RE-R and MH3-U playable. As trade, you lose a bit of portability.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose five stars because this book is awesome.it has fighting,rebellions,and that everlark romance that I love so much.My best bud Collins has somehow managed to top the first hg.btw team Peeta!!!&lt;3peeta
B009HNDCC4|5.0|This show reminds me of &#34;All in the Family&#34; in its first season.  I was selling TV on Ch12, Wpri-TV in Providence; only 1 sales guy saw and understood what was going on; how it was state of the art, grabby, screaming funny and really pushed the envelope.<br /><br />After I saw a few shows, I had my customers lining up to get avails in and around this show!!  I made out well.<br /><br />Small world:  A good friend of mine got me to watch Modern Family because his nephew is one of the writers on the show (Paul Corrigan) and we are now hooked on the show.  This show is out there and reaching folks around the globe much as &#34;Family&#34; did years ago.  Keep on chuggin' guys.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Great game, great graphics love the way the dinosaurs move when you click on them. Gave it 3stars because it takes for ever to hatch dinos or buildings. Also the price of the dinosaurs especially the t rex!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I do not believe I have read any Grisham books that were not to my liking and this one is no exception.  All the twists and turns of the storyline would keep anybody interested.  What an imagination!  Would highly recommend to anyone that is a Grisham fan.
B00138J342|4.0|It's not &#34;Ten&#34; but Eddie Vedder is just as captivating. Takes me back to high school, in a good way!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little sharpener is outstanding value and works very well. It's small and light and the price is superb. I'm going to buy several more.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.
B000SVZIDA|1.0|This movie is absolutely amazing, but when I tried to watch it from amazon it wouldn't load. We got through about 10 minutes before we had had enough of the pixilation and the pausing. Also, no one at amazon could explain why it wouldn't work. They said it was MY Internet connection and no fault to them yet my Netflix and Hulu accounts work perfectly with no pausing or problems. I will be going to the store to buy my new rentals from now on.
0156030306|5.0|Read this as a teen and still the story is gripping.  A good read that I would recommend anyone 12 hrs and older

B00CDT41RY|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a long time!  One minute you are crying and the next you are laughing!  Great music!
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|That's all<br /><br />Fairly tedious, fairly dull<br /><br />Characters lifeless and uninteresting. Ending disappointing, very joyless and sad<br /><br />Liked major petit grew much more, at least it was funny
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved it  I have been slammed in the heart  college Hoover has done it again so emotional  you won't be disappointed
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|Like many others I own every Disney movie in every format, sometimes multiples of the same format. What Disney is doing with this release is the ultimate insult to loyal customers, I would have definitely purchased Oz had it come in the 3D and 2d combo pack. But will never purchase another Disney movie again if this continues including the upcoming Little Mermaid 3 D release,
B00CW665VI|4.0|Laughed out loud several times and mostly smiled throughout the entire book.  Light hearted read that I needed in between some other intense reads.  Enjoyed the male  POV, you don't get that much, and in this case it was entirely fitting.  Man-whore Drew gets sucked into something he never thought possible, the Fairytale life where he meets his Princess, only to become her frog for awhile.  It takes him awhile to undo the damage he's managed to do with Kate, but all is well that ends well.  Every Fairytale gets its happy ending....the story was cute, sexy, and very entertaining.  Loved the secondary characters, especially Drews niece Macenzie....
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in years, but it was as hysterical as I remembered.  My sensitivity to profanity has increased since I now have children, so I did notice the language a bit more.  But it's still one of my favorite movies.
B004SKJTY6|3.0|I bought this thinking it was the actual movie, so of course I was disappointed. My fault. I'll give it another chance after I see the movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't get enough of this show.  Love the cast and the acting.  I look forward to season three and hope it is on for many years.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I wiled away the hours playing this on a long car trip......it was fun and makes you really think too. Great brain exercise.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|Let's see: Russell Crowe is a fine actor who cannot sing, so Tom Hooper, in his Great Experiment, leaves out the acting part and has him sing (sort of);  Hugh Jackman is a multi-talented entertainer who sings, dances, acts and (probably) builds set props, so TH can't let him really sing (wouldn't want to make Crowe feel bad) or put much emotion into his character; and Anne Hathaway is one of a few very good living actresses as well as (who knew) a good singer, so TH let her act and sing (emoting far too much in the process) and then lose her character for the remainder of the film.<br /><br /> If this sounds ridiculous, just think about it:  Javert is a robot - hardly a change in his facial expression, far less his mood.  Hugh Jackman plays the role he is given quite well, but it is generally bland; and his singing is mostly the talk/sing that replaced spoken dialog throughout the film. Anne Hathaway takes a bit part - one that could have easily been fleshed out - and one of the most beautiful songs ever to come out of Broadway, and is directed to moan/sing the song and then disappear.  Make no mistake, I am not criticizing Anne; I am wondering aloud why a director would take so little from so much talent.  Why not show a bit of what led up to Fantine's plight, and give Anne a chance to make the audience really feel what has happened.  She's in and out of the movie so fast that anyone in the audience who doesn't already know the story will have to tear-up retroactively.  And, why not let her sing the beautiful song, breaking up at, \\"Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.\\"<br /><br />Look at what Geoffrey Rush did with the role of Javert. Can't you just imagine Tom Hooper saying to Russell Crowe, \\"Now look, Russ, this Javert's a real nut case, but it won't take much emoting on your part to play the role.  I want him to be almost like a zombie, just going mindlessly after Valjean. Not the way Geoffrey Rush did, yelling and chasing after Valjean; showing emotion.  But, you'll get a chance to sing.  Well, not sing, really, just talk in a musical way - like Lee Marvin did in Paint Your Wagon.  Of course, he did get to act some, too.\\"<br /><br />I won't even bother with Jackman, except to say: Is that the image of a man who has been tormented, chased, and imprisoned; who changed his life and took on the burden of caring for a young girl while having to keep a constant lookout for a madman who has no purpose in life other than to arrest him or kill him?<br /><br />Imagine what this film might have been.<br /><br />I don't really think this movie deserved a single star: normally, I would give a movie like this a 3.  I would guess that there are many who really like the 2012 version never realizing that this movie could have been made just as well with actors from central casting.  But, with the talent available for the 2012 version, it is almost criminal to make a movie as mediocre as this.<br /><br />After seeing this film, I watched the 1935 version and the 1952 version.  I had already seen the Broadway musical, the 1998 movie that starred Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush, and the 1978 version that starred Anthony Perkins as Javert.  I would rate them (Best to worst): Broadway play;  1935 version, 1998 version, 1978  version, 2012 version, 1952 version.

193700788X|4.0|I really like this series, Sookie was always like a fresh breath of air. I'm sad it ended but I can imagine the author after 13 books was tired and wanted to move to other projects. Thanks Charlaine it was a great ride.

B002SJIO4A|5.0|Set in South Africa. It's a story about aliens getting stuck there and being treated as sexond class citizens. Certainly there's a lot of parallels that could be made to how South Africans handle racial segregation, and language divides...the alien twist makes it fun.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh has put together a nice variety of songs that compliment his voice. The variety keeps the listener intrigued and wanting to hear more.
B004UPAIDK|3.0|It was fun and the start of this type of movie but seems to lack that something to make you want to watch it again.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|This album live up to its expectations.  The title song &#34;Golden&#34;  is a sure hit.  Along with the upbeat &#34;Generation Away&#34;.  I love the haunting lyrics of &#34;It Ain't Pretty&#34;.  Golden is about everyday life set to music.  As long as Lady Antebellum continue to compose music like this, they can't miss.<br /><br />wg
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I used to watch DW when I was in my nerd years and this was a great reboot. Scary but not so much kids can't enjoy it along with the moral aspect it adds that video games lack.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Clint Eastwood academy award winner just a great movie with great acting by Eastwood, Morgan & Hackman. A good modern classic western

B005D9MUWY|4.0|This app is the only reason why I was able to move on from a phone with a physical keyboard. I love this keyboard and recommend it to anyone, and if your apprehensive about the move to a touchscreen only phone don't be, just use SwiftKey!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this based on good reviews, and use it with my Zoom H1 to record DSLR video, and sync audio in post production.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I purchased this app for my 5 year old girl along with several others. Out of all of them, this is the one she plays most often. My 7 year old son surprisingly enjoys watching her create look after look without demanding a turn to play his own games! Definitely a super game for kids.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I bit on the flimsy side, as weight of DSLR camera, dual mount with microphone and light make it flex a bit. Overall, I'm happy.
0740797719|5.0|This is an amazing book about using color. I've read the entire thing and often find myself referencing back to it during my studies.<br /><br />James Gurney's insights are incredibly helpful and he does a good job of boiling his points down into memorable, concise bits without sacrificing the quality of each lesson. I like the use of his own paintings to demonstrate each point. It takes the book out of the how-to/textbook realm and gives it more intimacy.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book but was so blown away by the way it ended. I was left wanting to know so much more about the characters.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Fall of the Giants is a good read because of its historical background and well developed characters. I did not want to put it down.
B0026PA05M|5.0|I was so happy to find this bands music here at Amazon. Love this band. The only negative is that I had not heard of them before now.
B006VJMZXY|4.0|I always enjoy reading well researched historical novels where the reader becomes so involved in the story it becomes difficult to put the book down. Another great one for Phillipa Gregory

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|It took a while to come to terms with way this book was written and to become involved in the story. But when the relationships were formed it became hard to put the story down. An emotional roller coaster of a ride.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|This CD does not disappoint.  I love all of Lady A's albums and this is no exception.  Lady A has been my favorite group for the last five years.  Overall I cannot say I am a huge country fan because I love many types of music, but I will listen to Lady A anytime, anywhere!
1596177373|5.0|LOVE THESE CARDS THEYRE THE MOST ADORABLE THINGS EVER!!!!!!<br />got loads of compliments on them. these are super amazing woo!!!!!
B00C061I3K|4.0|I'm a huge Daft Punk fan, so I purchased this album immediately when it came out.  When I first listened to it, I was slightly disappointed.  The first song, \\"Give Life Back to Music\\", is one of my favorites and sets the bar high for the rest of the album.    My least favorite tracks are: \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\"-I personally don't like to hear someone talking during a song, \\"Touch\\"- that song is way too long, and \\"Contact\\"-wtf?  I'm also not a big fan of the auto-tune voice on \\"Game of Love\\"    However, I definitely applaud DP for making this more of an instrumental album. \\"Fragments of Time\\" and \\"Beyond\\" both have a great instrumental background.  I also enjoy Pharrell's lead vocals on \\"Lose Yourself to Dance\\" and \\"Get Lucky\\". \\"Instant Crush\\" and \\"Doin it Right\\" deserve an honorable mention.    I would recommend any DP fan to buy this album.  If you weren't a big fan of \\"Human After All\\" like me, please forgive them and give this one a chance.    1/6/15 Update: This album is great and now that I've listened to it over a million times, the only song I still don't like is \\"Contact\\". \\"Game of Love\\" has become one of my favorite songs on the album, and \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\" is a great instrumental track.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for my family yoga classes and soooo much more! I can put in pics and videos, notes and recordings. It's sooooo awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book!!! I could not put it down. It made me think, made me smile, made me laugh and made me cry. I can not wait to read all of John Green's Green's stories. Amazing, amazing, amazing.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I can't wait to see how this music fits into the theme of and tone of the film.  The music of Hans Zimmer makes me want to see this film even more.  There are twelve drummers who perform on this musical score.  My favorite instrumental piece is \\"Oil Rig\\".  It is 91 seconds of powerful drumming.  There is also subtle violin playing on the instrumental pieces \\"Krypton's Last\\" and \\"I Have So Many Questions\\".  The violin playing is by a woman named Ann Marie Calhoun.  \\"This is Clark Kent\\" is a beautiful piece that reminds me that Clark Kent is just as important as Superman.  It sound the piano is featured on this piece, but I don't see a piano credit in the musician credits. \\"Terraforming\\" is an intense instrumental piece that lasts for nine minutes.  I don't know the definition of terraforming, but this piece sounds like it would be used in a very exciting part of the film.  This music is probably featured in an earth changing event in the film.  \\"What Are Going To Do When You Are Not Saving The World\\" is my other favorite piece.  This piece makes my heart soar.  This piece makes yearn for a hero like Superman to save the day.  This music makes me believe in justice again.  Justice is not a word in the dictionary.  It is something that I should try to practice every day of my life.  The second disc contains music composed by a person named Junkie XL.  There is a piece entitled \\"General Zod\\" that reflects the evilness of the main villain.  This is superb music.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love all of Sylvia Days books.  This one didn't disappoint!!  Who cares if there are two more books.  I love to read about Gideon and Eva.  God I have never seen such whiny people.  And those who didn't even buy the book because of what others said really need to rethink!!  If you have ever read a Sylvia Day book you know that her writing is awesome.  I do not need to hear from big babies to help me make my decision.  I bought the book because she is a good writer. Buy the book its well worth it!!
0525478817|5.0|This is hands down one of the best books I have read in decades.  My thirteen year old granddaughter read it first and recommended it to me.  Although I was hesitant to read it at first due to the very sad subject matter, I was instantly hooked.  John Greene is a gifted, intelligent, and extremely unique author.  The love story is beautiful and the characters live in my heart still.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|This was easy to download to my Kindle Fire.  The story line was very interesting and inspiring.  Good to read about about a single mother who puts the child first and manages to have a good career.
B00B2GK4KW|4.0|I like it a lot, but the size or the circle is a little too large for my cards.<br />wish she would make a smaller one.
0786838655|5.0|I did this as a mom/daughter read with my oldest (who really isn't all that old). She got the graphic novel version and I got the adult one...or Young Adult one. She got the one that's mostly pictures and I got the one with words. You probably know what I'm saying here.<br /><br />I have to admit to being really impressed with this book. I've heard a lot of praise for it, but it was still better than I expected. It read really well. I really liked Percy as a character and as a narrator. There was an interesting assortment of side characters and a decent amount of greek mythology to be peripherally learned by readers. The whole ADHD/Dyslexic demi-god association was interesting and empowering for kids with such diagnoses and it ended well, despite being the first in a series.<br /><br />I only have two true criticisms. One, Percy never mourns for his mother. Not at all. That felt incredibly unrealistic to me. Now I understand the whole impermanence of the situation, but wouldn't a 12 year old boy still grieve. I also get that as middle grade fiction loss is probably a little too heavy to be address, but I still think it needed a cursory mention. Second, I had a really hard time remembering that Percy was supposed to be 12. He spoke, acted and was treated as if he was much older so I visualised him as such in the story. Again, I get that it's middle grade fiction and tweens are the intended audience and therefore 12 is an appropriate age for the characters, but he did not feel 12.<br /><br />All in all I'm thrilled to have read it. I probably wouldn't have bothered with it if I hadn't been doing it as a parenting activity. That's a shame really. I would have missed out.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was a great movie for the whole family. Lots of fun action and characters. The story line was cool and it was fun to see the different characters work together. Lots of cool action sequences.
0679805273|5.0|I love this book and am so looking forward to reading it to my students next year. It is going to be the basis for our theme for the year. It was also part of my wedding vows....
0525953590|4.0|This book tells the story of the discovery of the Higg's boson, what it is, what its relevance is and the intensely human nature of this endeavour. The book provided my best insight into the Standard Model and where the Higg's field and boson fit in. The author discusses the physics but puts it in context. The people involved and their contribution is truly amazing and the author explores the limitations of attributions and prizes  (Nobel) for such collaborative endeavours. This amazing discovery was the culmination of progressive systematic rigorous progress, the creativity and imagination of many many people. Solving the puzzle of a consistent theory that provides an explanation for mass of particles, esp bosons, affected by the weak force was fascinating. The importance of chirality in this was another example (to me) of the amazing universe (perhaps part of multiverse) we inhabit. This Higg's  field/mechanism/boson: the name that stuck and appropriately but is the product of the noble. passionate human journey and the author takes on this road with deep insights and honesty. (The appendices are well worth reading).
B00AN0KGWE|1.0|I love the show. This teaser is a waste of time. This rating applies to the teaser and not the show... which is only available by paying for each episode. Thanks Prime.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Wow I didn't think I would like this type of game but after playing it I found out I really really like it its a lot of fun challenging but not too difficult tree

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love it. We can't get enough of Game of Thrones.  We can't wait until season 3 is available on dvd.
0802473156|5.0|Every one I have given this book to has loved it, and one friend has in turn given it to everyone possible.  The concept is simple yet profound, and helps you know how to really show that you care in a way that will &#34;speak&#34; to the receiver.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's simple, easy, and is perfect for what I need it to be. Perhaps adding more abilities such as &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;cos&quot; would make it better.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Another great Hitchcock movie, along with great acting by the always-phenomenal Cary Grant.  Will definitely watch this movie again in the future.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I get the rebirth cycle and karma points but thought the movie lack deeper meaning of life and the interconnectedness between the people and their environment
B006LSZECO|1.0|I've never known of centipedes to be frantic. Just one example of the ludicrous, horrendous, and generally just awful metaphors Gillian Flynn is overly fond of in \\"Gone Girl\\". It's probably the single worst book I've read this year. It's actually on my list, along with \\"The Lovely Bones\\" of the worst, most overrated books I have EVER read.
0425263924|3.0|#3 in the series (suppose to be the last).  S. Day you are by far the biggest disappointment in the world how could you do this to your readers.  OMG this book should have been deleted your character Eva is turning out to be nothing but a gold digging whore.  Seriously doubt I will read book 4 (sure it will be out 6 months after the original release date).  NO MORE I AM DONE

0143113100|4.0|In The Brain That Changes Itself, Dr. Norman Doidge is able to effectively captivate even a non-scientifically inclined audience into the world of neuroscience. Dr. Doidge chronicles a collection of case studies that depict individuals overcoming extreme adversity and highlight how malleable the brain can be. In particular, Dr. Doidge demonstrates through individual examples how the brain can literally change its wiring, and functioning, much later in life than thought possible. This book is somewhat of a crash course in understanding that the brain is not as localized as scientists have previously believed. In fact, Dr. Doidge cites several research examples to show how areas of the brain can compensate for an area that is missing or has been damaged. This book does a remarkable job making neuroplasticity fascinating, and effectively communicates how the concept of plasticity is inspiring hope in medical cases previously thought of as hopeless.<br /><br />The caveat for this book is the potential for a reader to overgeneralize. It is possible that a reader might come away from this book believing that the brain is infinitely malleable with the right interventions and it could therefore encourage fads, such as Baby Einstein, which do not have evidence-based outcomes. Dr. Doidge's research convincingly demonstrates real life examples where individuals have made enormous gains in functioning, sometimes even decades after an injury. While inspiring, there is still so much about the brain and plasticity that is unknown, and there are countless neurology cases where little to no functioning has been regained. This book could have also included a more thorough contextualization to help readers understand the degree of impairment for each case study, and how typical their recovery is for other individuals who received treatment. The book left me wondering how accessible the interventions mentioned in the book are for disadvantages populations, who do not meet criteria fora research study, and who do have an advocate. Nevertheless, Dr. Doidge does communicate important basic knowledge about neuroscience, such as \\"neurons that fire together wire together\\" and the concept of \\"critical (or sensitive) periods,\\" in a very understandable, non-threatening, and interesting way. Dr. Doidge adds a personal dimension to neural plasticity with his case study examples and provides a well-researched and well-rounded chronicle of some of the most amazing findings in the field. This book will take the reader on an inspiring journey of recovery, discovery and hope.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie does not result to sexual innuendos or sexuality or foul language, drugs, violence etc to be the entertainment - it relies on the story. Appropriate for most ages, and a great family movie!<br /><br />I read all three books, one right after the other as I could not put them down. I am in my mid 20's and am not a Twilight fan or anything of the sort. This is the only series I have ever read the books for and typically do not enjoy reading. That being said - I am a HUGE fan of this series.<br />While this movie was very much based to the teenage world, it is rightfully so but is also very appropriate for a much more mature audience. I'll try very hard to not to give any spoilers in this review, but to thoroughly review my opinions of the movie.<br />First of all, I watched this on opening night and was thrilled with the movie and from that moment could not wait for the next. I also bought the movie during Black Friday sales as I couldn't pass it up, even though I try very hard not to mix Christmas and personal shopping - I'm glad I did :)<br />I will say that leaving the theatre I was slightly disappointed. There are several areas where the movie and the book were not on par, and to me these were very important parts. The manner in which the mockingjay pin is received (to me, this was  HUGE disappointment since it is so far off of the novel and that was a key part in my opinion in the book), next was the manner in which Peeta learned of the angle Haymitch had Katniss took since in the book he finds out well after the fact and that is the underlying issue that book 2 deals with. I'm very curious about how this will be portrayed in the next movie. The third issue that I had with the movie is the creatures at the end of the Hunger Games since they were vividly described in the book, especially the 'eyes' and the manner in which Cato and them run into each other.<br /><br />Once I was able to get over the differences (and VERY surprised at how many said how closely the movie and book followed) I was able to enjoy the movie even more. The premise of the story of course is the capital acting as a totalitarian, and forces a male and female from each district within the ages of 12 and 18 to fight to the death, leaving a single victor. This is the single reason many people I know had zero interest in reading the book or watching the movie. However, the manner in which this is done and the view that is taken makes it well worth the time. The killings are done in a very tasteful manner - it is appropriate for children of nearly all ages (granted children under 10 probably won't enjoy this movie, but preteens and beyond are easily able to follow and enjoy). As I said in the beginning, the movie does not result to sexual innuendos or sexuality or foul language, drugs, violence etc to be the entertainment - it relies on the story. This is an area I greatly feel that Hollywood should get back to, those items do not enhance a story and for many they often ruin what could otherwise be a great family movie. Some complain that the movie does not focus on the games as much and does not accurately portray the violence, but I believe that the violence is rightfully suggested and does not need blood and gore to get the point across when children 12-18 are dying in a battle - it's brutal - I GET IT! THANK YOU for not making me uncomfortable watching that! It's not about the deaths, it's about the story, the victor, and believing in something worth believing in.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My son loves this toy. It really keeps his mind working and he challenges this ball all the time! I would certainly recommend it to anyone, child or adult!!
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|Please Please Please don't waste your time! Even at $6.99 NOT worth it!. Boring, Zero story. We kept waiting for it to get better. It didn't.
1400069742|5.0|Good job by the author.  I never realized Roosevelt was so poll orientated.  I always felt that he was trying to lead us into war.  But if this author is correct why he may have wanted to fight he did not take the lead to do so.  The only error I found was on the Japanese internments.  While the camps may have lasted for the entire war a great majority of Japanese were freed after 18 months, long before the war ended.  A number of Italians also were put in camps and had their property taken.  All in all, glad I read this book and it does deserve 5 stars.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Loved the trilogy. Excellent writing. I got all three done within a week, that's how captivated I was.<br />I would definitely recommend this series.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Great performance considering they were only together for a few months at the time of the concert. Awesome sound quality!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Romance drama about a girl named Katie running from her past, while looking for the strength to embrace a new future. This movie got several harsh reviews however in my opinion its worth watching.
B001D8W7CW|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was younger quite often. I loved its eerie atmosphere, mostly thanks to Piper Laurie's role. This movie has influenced so many after it and is continuing to get remade (I have never seen either remake). If you haven't seen this movie, which would be surprising, you are really missing out.
193700788X|4.0|Dead Ever After tells the final chapter in the adventures of Sookie Stackhouse and starts off with a bang as Sookie is accused of murdering her one time friend and coworker, Arlene.  It quickly becomes apparent that she is being set up by others who wish to see her either dead or suffering in jail.  On top of this, Eric and the rest of the vampires appear to have exited her life abruptly and not all that kindly.  Will Sookie be able to beat the murder charges, stay alive, and perhaps find a way to a peaceful life?<br /><br />I enjoyed this final book, it seems a bit rushed but still retains the same feel and flavour of the earlier Sookie novels.  There's a little tension, some romance, and some humour.  I'm sad to say goodbye to Sookie and her friends but the ending seemed fitting to me; now time to move on and find another series that I hope brings that same anticipation and enjoyment.  Beautiful cover art on this novel as well.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|My kids love Toy Story and they watch all three movies every week as if it was the first time they were seeing it.
1616550414|5.0|This is a great book. It documents not only art and character designs but also concepts of what they were also considering. Nothing is held back. Plus it comes with a sweet comic at the back. I highly recommend for any Zelda fan. I have been a fan of the series since Ocarina of Time and the accuracy and detail is amazing.
B001NN4162|5.0|Monsters Inc is one of the best movies ever. Adults and kids love it equally due to its captivating colors

B00AZM7IQC|5.0|A great movie with even better 3D scenes... Very romantic, mysterious, and fun!! one of the best 3D movies I have purchased in a long time..
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Awesome story, best one yet in the series.  Better if you have read the series, and knew the \\"hero\\" from past books.  Author stays true to who the character is, yet makes him likeable, even loveable.  Strong female character who keeps fighting for what she knows is right.  No cheap plot lines here, the whole series is coming together with no easy answers.  As always looking forward to the next one.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Enjoyed the book, was sad to see it end.  Was still holding out for Eric but it's better this way.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I can't believe I never watched this show while it was on TV. If you're a fan of Sci-Fiction and love crime dramas, this has a wonderful blend of the two. Great acting, great writing, highly engaging story. Worth your time to watch.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The quality of this show remains great. AMC continues to put out quality TV. Often, you forget you are watching a show about zombies as you are so focused on the relationships between the living.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|THIS book should be a must read for everyone out there. It requires you to think of your safe shell you live in and requires you to step out of the boundaries to make your own choices. I could not put this book down! Surprising twists and turns along every step of the way.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I will admit that it took me several chapters to understand the book. You start out feeling like you've been dropped in the middle of a movie and have no idea what is going on. It didn't matter though. The characters captivated me immediately!!! The names and places were hard at first too but it all came together and I was unable to put the book down. I cannot wait to start the next book to see where the story goes!

B003WE9TU8|5.0|Brilliant book. The short story style of each chapter makes this a good read for people who love zombies and only have limited reading time and no time for bad books.<br /><br />Oh and by the way it's Stellenbosch not Stellenboch.
1475143389|5.0|I thought the book was written well and had very little if any filler. I think this aspect is missing in most books today. The author also seems to really care about helping people get in shape. As shown by the bonus material that comes with the book. He also emailed me within a week after purchasing the book asking me if I had any questions. After asking a few, he responded within a day. Of course I can't promise you the same. But back to the book, it was well organized, easy to read, and inspired belief in me that I could be bigger, leaner, and stronger.<br /><br />Thanks Mike,<br />Cody
B002KSPKRS|5.0|happy with wat i got it was like new and played very good for a good price id buy stuff from him agin .
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The book was excellent! Recommended to everyone who wants to see the movie. Great first book. Ready for the adventure to continue
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I enjoyed every second of this book & am truly sad that it's over.. I hate when a good book ends and this book definitely exceeds the title not a good book!!
B00881VLCE|4.0|the puzzles are beautiful but limited amount of free ones. it wouldn't let me download a couple of the packages either...
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved this...I even had a few times I jumped when things unexpected happen.  Graphics where better than any other I've played kindle fire HD.  Can't wait for a sequel.
B002WV5A9G|3.0|The movie was borderline ok. However, it took way to many liberties with the old story line.  It's not ok to rewrite history.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Fairy tale mutations are becoming  standard fodder for moviemakers these days.  This high budget revision of Hansel and Gretel is a chaotic, gory, often anachronistic story of what happens after the titular heroes take care of their initial witch.<br />H&GWH suffers from inadequate lighting, many scenes virtually indeiscernible.  One has to question the duo's success when they get their butts kicked quite often.<br />Most of the CGI effects are done well and the character of Edward the troll is a fun touch.  Acting is secondary element to movies like this but Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are effective heroes.<br />H&GWH is a fun popcorn movie or maybe cotton candy?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think the game is a great way to pass the time and to be able to get  a  sense of the real world
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great characters with lightning-fast dialogue and awesome action. nAtasha fun, fast-paced read that any sci-fi fan will enjoy. A new favorite.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Always been a fan of his writings. I have read many of his books,and this one was a very interesting theory.
B009NY43NY|2.0|no substance to this one at all.  Sadly missing the quality of the previous novels. Not much to it all
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Still trying to get through all the different patterns. So far, I am very happy with the performance. I hope there is a way to enlarge the tile size.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I like it very much, altho I haven't used it with my Kindle very much. It is a little bulky, but I am a stay @ home senior, and have used it frequently when going to the kids homes.. It arrived in excellent shape, and I am still learning soooo much about my Kindle Fire HD.. I do like the stand... It is easy to use, and protects the tablet very well. Very well made .
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This 212 Plus was my first with heat pipes. I'm very happy with this and my CPU is operating at about 32C.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded this app for my 7 year old granddaughter but was unsure how much she would play it.  It has turned out to be one of her favorites; providing educational entertainment and fun.
B004X60QE2|5.0|My brother recommended that I buy this.  It was great, and I plan on ordering the rest of the seasons.  Great program, thanks
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game doesn't appear as though it would be all that exciting,but I just can't put it down. Just when I want to stop, I get enough coins to keep playing.
B005LAIIJY|2.0|i wish i had not bought this dvd, i gave it away right after i view it,will review before i buy again
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is just a fun little addicting game. Nothing too special about it. It's not something that you'll just beat in a day. It'll last as long as you want to play it.
B00164CM46|5.0|This is a really great movie. It's hilarious and serious at the same time. Great cast, great plot, great times.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Okay I was kind of unsure about this book be for I bought it. I like to look at what people rate the book before I buy it. There were in a way lots of bad ratings on this book. Someone said they thought this book would be more mature and was disappointed that it was not. Well the person did get a Young Adult book and not an adult book. The book was really good. It made me want to cry at times. I think most people may like it. Anyone who likes a fiction reality should read it, or at least try it out.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is hilarious! In fact, it was so funny that I got two more copies as gifts for my friends.
B000QCQ8Y4|3.0|I liked this story of brotherhood-pulling together and being there for those who are important to you.  I miss that dedication and the reminder is heartwarming. Thought the constant computations were annoying but it sure have you something to think about.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This movie is a classic, which goes without saying, which is why I had to have it for my collection. Very pleased.
1934030597|2.0|Unfortunately, the book is not what I expected.  Gives the appearance of being a very basic book, but once into it...it becomes too broad.  Just doesn't address what I was hoping to get out of it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|My husband got hooked on Macklemore, so I bought this digital album for him for his iphone. He LOVES it...in fact, he loves ALL of their songs! And now I'M hooked on Macklemore too! We saw them at Lafayette College last month and they rocked the place!
B002BKIERI|4.0|I bought this CD for ONE song:  &#34;Mother's Blessing&#34;.  Sung primarily in Spanish (which I do not speak) and a bit of English, this piece is so moving, Snatam's voice is so clear and resilient, and the music swells with such heart that one cannot but play it over and over. &#34;This is your mother's blessing:  may you never forget god, not even for a moment&#34; ---these lyrics say it all and can only bring out the mystic in you and a deep love for the poetry of voice, music, and passion.<br />Buy it for this.  It is worth it!<br />Morgana Morgaine<br />Author of &#34;Borderless Broads, New Adventures for the Midlife Woman&#34;
081297381X|3.0|Not sure what I think about this, I work in prepardness and there are many new ideas post 9-11, and I try to keep and open mind. This one is ok to read, but only if you have the time.
B009NY43NY|2.0|The final disappointment in a series of disappointments.  Granted, The Southern Vampire Mysteries have never claimed to be more than the junk food fiction they are, I don't expect Fyodor Dostoyevsky and his ilk.  That said, I do still care about the characters and wanted to know in what direction Ms. Harris would take them.  So, if you are curious about the Sookie Stackhouse endgame, by all means, go ahead.  However, notwithstanding the desire to know how the story ends, I've read better fan fiction.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|this thing is great the calculator is so smart it knows all math and it is free but who cares if it is free love it!
B008OM0EDO|4.0|Ok, it's not Borat or even the other one, but it is funny. I laughed out loud at least a dozen times, and for me, these days, that constitutes(no pun intended) an above-average, funny movie.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|An amazing book  and completely shock a book can be this good. I would not say the movie is better whatsoever
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This album rocks! It is great to finally get a new album from these guys, they're awesome!<br />There isn't a single song I don't like.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|A lot of funny could have more weapon or flying options but still fun getting to pick different armors makes it that more interesting
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is a great game<br />Though the only problem I have is that the suits r way to expensive for my tastes
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great time waster. Its so addicting!! Wish it was easier to make friends though. Need them to buy certain ponies.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so #swaggaliciousness. I love it and played it with my friends and couldn't get enough!I wish you could turn the pages and get more characters. plus the price is high for 6 characters. WINK* WINK* NUDGE* NUDGE* to toga boca
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|This could be so much better if the developers weren't so greedy. It is almost to impossible to unlock an armour/upgrade one without spending real money. I understand they need to be paid for their hard work, but really???!!!! It takes a lot of money to get a somewhat good armor, and what do you get for your effort?? Enemies and objects that do more damage the further you go, and no way to regain your health other than dying and spending 15 more credits every time you die. Worth it if you have money or time to blow
B005LAII8K|4.0|Although not as thought provocking as inception was it was and interesting sci fi movie it could have flesh out the plot a little more though
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is filled with danger and thrill. Overall, I think this is a good book for people of all ages and is totally AWESOME!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My Kids love playing this game together. They can wait for the next update to come out. It inspires there imagination.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is full of adventure. Meet Piper ,Leo and Jason. Piper's dad is missing,Leo's a fire demi God and Jason's demi God of Rome.
B005HSL626|3.0|My kids play it sometimes, but it doesn't hold their attention for very long!  I even tried playing it and I understand why.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This is a very fun and engaging game that is definitely worth playing, as it takes all of the best elements of a 2D platformer and combines them with great visual effects. Not too challenging, yet also not easy, paper monsters is a must for any fan of gaming.
030788743X|5.0|I love this book!  It wraps technology, science fiction, fantasy, and the world of the 1980's all into a quick read!  I can't tell you how much this book hit a cord with me.  I relate so well to this book, how it is written, and the trivia in it.  If you like 80's trivia on movies, comics, books, music, toys, video games, and pop culture, this is a perfect book for you.  Think of the movie the Matrix with 80's trivia and a riveting story to drive it!  Just an awesome combination and well written to boot!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The next time you are sitting on the couch cursing the garbage that issues forth from your cable television, fire up your blue-ray with Peter O'Toole as T.E. Lawrence and be amazed as your attention and your intelligence are actually held captive (mesmerized) by the creations of David Lean. You and the couch and the whole 21st century will disappear into a timeless sea of sand turned red by the brutal conflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire. Seldom has the crass hypocrisy of British colonialism in the Middle East been laid so bare. Not only are we entertained by the acting, the action, and the cinematography, but we can witness the very birth of the oil based geopolitical quagmire in which we live today.
B0041I0N9A|5.0|I have seven (7) Star Wars ultimate collector's sets and this one ranks second behind the Imperial Star Destroyer.  This set is just larger than the actual toy that was made.  It is a fun build, although the wings get a bit monotonous, but still awesome.  It can be displayed with either the wings folded up or fully extended.  The figures with the set are an added bonus but not necessary, this set just speaks for itself.
0446580848|3.0|I have high regard for Mr. DeMille, having read the bulk of his work. However, The Panther left me wanting. I had to read nearly 600 pages in order to arrive at a rather pedestrian conclusion to the tale of CIA/FBI shenanigans in pursuit of an Al Qaeda mastermind. Frankly, my time would have been better spent elsewhere. I remain hopeful that Mr. DeMille will continue to craft wonderfully intriguing yarns.
193700788X|2.0|It was 2009 when I first read Dead Until Dark. I didn't know about true blood, or know if it was a series at that time, but I happened to be looking through Barnes and Noble and thought it looked good. I finished it in three days and ordered the next few books in the series. It wasn't long before I had every book in the series and the next one on preorder. I even checked out the Harper Connely series while waiting for new Sookie books. I've read every book in the series, but I've never bothered to write a review until now. I hate admitting this, but this book seems like an episode of Charmed. Everything is nicely wrapped up, all Sookie's problems are solved as easily as they came into existance. I almost feel like this book was ghost written. Had the Sookie and Sam coupling happened in the early books I would have seen it coming. Another thing that bothers me is that in Dead Until Dark Sam dares Sookie to read his mind, and then all of a sudden in this book she can't. It would have made sense if they figured it was something like Sam coming back from the dead that made his mind unreadable, but it was simply written away. Maybe Ms. Harris, or whoever wrote this book was too busy trying to squeeze everyone in that she didn't bother writing a solid story, but there is almost nothing redeeming about this book. Characters, even Eric, merely make guest appearances. Honestly, I don't know if anyone cared to know what happened to Quinn, or even Barry, or why they were included. I actually did like Barry in this book. I didn't like the third person pov, and I didn't like how easily everything wrapped up. I didn't like seeing Eric and Pam, or even Bill for that matter, reduced to a couple paragraphs. These were all major characters throughout most of the series, now they have been stripped of their personaties. This book was awful.
B009NY43NY|4.0|She did it. She ended the series. That's really hard to do, especially one that's gone on as long as this one. It was a good story too, if not the best of the bunch. Possibly the most impressive thing for me, though, was the almost OCD way she checked off dangling plot points. Is there a baddie whose fate is unknown? Checked off. A hero? Checked off. So many loose ends tied up, maybe the most impressive thing about this book is that it's not twice as long.<br /><br />I think it goes without saying that this isn't a good place to start, if you're not already a Sookie fan, but if you are one... this is the place to finish. It's not possible to read this one without getting spoilers for... almost ANY other book in the series, but it very neatly rounds the whole shebang off, and then puts a button on it. If you like these books and value resolution at all, this one is a must-read.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Absolutely loved this book and am having a very hard time finding a new book to keep my same level of interest!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is my favorite season; the chemistry between David Tennant and Catherine Tate is phenomenal, and not in a seual way. This also has my all time favorite episode - Silence in the Library.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|A great movie. Just plain fun - some gore - but that is part of the fun! You will never look at fairy tales in the same way!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|FIVE STARS FOR MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME! AUGGIE IS A CHARACTER THAT SUPRISINGLY ANYONE CAN RELATE TO, AND FEEL CONNECTED TO. LOVED IT!
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Was glad to get the background on this show. I really enjoy the friendship between the actors, it's very apparent they enjoy what they're doing. Season #3 please.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|purchased as a gift for my now married daughter and her husband. On there first date they went to see the movie UP and loved it. They watch it once in a awhile and it brings back all those quirky first date memories
B00008WT5E|5.0|If your just getting into acdc this is the album to start with! Before Brian Johnson came into the fold with the classic album back in black and before the tragic death of one of rocks best front men ( Bon Scott). Power age just has a engery and a edge that stills sounds fresh, they never play these songs live anymore which is a shame some of angus and Malcolm's best riffs on the other side of the highway to hell. Just a solid hard rock juggernaut of a album. My favorite of the acdc catalog. Check it out it will rock your face off!
034580404X|2.0|I ordered the series thinking I was going to love the first book and would want the rest of the books.  started reading the first book and hate to say it but I was totally bored to tears. gave the set to my sons girlfriend she hasn't read them yet.  To much hype given to the book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great! Super fun! I never get bored of it! I love that the location changes each month.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a really great puzzle game. This is by far one of the best of it's kind that I've played, and it is well worth the money.I highly recommend it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was amazing. I read about a book a day sometimes I even start the next one. This book is truly amazing one of the few that is extremely well written from the mans point of view. I found myself laughing repeatedly, holding my breath and couldn't put it down for a second. 5 stars
B000059TFO|5.0|This movie is one of my faves, it's hard to find but if you ever get a change to see it, you should.  I never see it on TV anymore, so it was worth the purchase.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series was so incredibly gripping. It had me on the edge of my seat after about 20% through. Then I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Hugh Howey is a genius.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Game is ok.  I spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to complete the task.  Good for killing time.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I found this book to be very different and enjoyable.  The story was very captivating and I could not wait to pick it up as soon as I had reading time.  Not your typical vampire fiction.  Well worth the read
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|I love the Silent Hill games and the first movie was just okayish in my opinion. This one was actually much more enjoyable. It felt a lot more like the game and has some really fun nods to the games that any fan will love. Give it a try. The price dropped so it's worth giving it a try.
0425263924|2.0|Towards the end of the book it started to get more rushed than the rest. I'm highly disappointed with the ending period and the fact that there was no real use for this book!!! Day did not leave much for readers to grab onto for the next book, even when originally this was to be a trilogy series!!! Dragging the story out between them would be fine with me IF you gave us something besides a disappointing book! I waited and waited for this book and I am not at all happy with it! Unlike some of the other readers, I was pleased with the sex scenes and am happy that they got married, just not the way in which they did. I enjoy most of the characters. That is why this got two stars.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|Love this show and this season is incredible. So sad they are wrapping things up and the next season will be the last!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Being 17 and being introduced to this book by my friends I can honestly say that I have never felt more alive and more sure of who I am. This has really opened my eyes and has made me realize I'm not the only wall flower out there.
B0083V2VW8|5.0|It is the theatrical portrayal of the rock opera Quadrophenia (The Who's, and quite possibly all of classic rock's, best album of all time) and they do a great job. They incorporate the music from Quadrophenia into the movie quite nicely. Worth the purchase.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Doodle jump free is great, but this version? Wonderful!!! And for only 99 cents! Thank you appstore and Lima sky llc studios!!!
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Classic movie and you can see Mel Gibson in his prime before he went cray cray. Perfect movie for men with all the gore and action, and women because of the romance.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app that's fun for all a g we. Even my little girl loves this! It's a great time passer if your bored.... Recommended for all. Go get it now....
B00AEBB8BK|4.0|Jim Carrey does a great job in a semi-serious role but manages to keep it funny. One of my favorite Jim Carrey movies of all time.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|Let me begin by saying that this movie was very funny and very well done.  My wife and I both really enjoyed it.  However, I tend to allocate two plus hours of my life to watch a movie because I want an escape.  At time this movie struck too close to home and ended with a less than euphoric feeling.  The end of the movie reminded me that being 40 sucks, although I'm not alone.  Glad I watched it but watching once was more than enough.
0307743659|5.0|Stephen King's scariest book is also his best. I am about to start it for the second time. Well worth the read!
B0026HKO2E|4.0|This was a great second chapter to the Matrix but the rave/sex scene was so not necessary.  I wanted to share the movie with my son but to do so needed to find a way to edit the scene out.  It didn't add to the story and seemed to be the sole reason for the 'R' rating.  Great movie otherwise.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|You have to pay attention throughout the whole book to get a full appreciation of it. I just have the attention span of a goldfish apparently.
B00571F26Y|2.0|I read this book based on the back cover description and the reviews. I expected to find some good ideas on weight loss and some good scientific, biochemical explanations.<br /><br />What I found were unpersuasive theoretical speculations based on very limited evidence.<br /><br />For example, there is a long chapter on why modern short wheat plants contain proteins that differ from tradition strains and are therefore bad for our digestion and nutritional process. The basic argument seems to be that the different proteins must be bad because there have been no detailed nutritional studies on how they impact the human body. That lack of studies is probably true and the studies should be done. But,the traditional wheat variety proteins have not been analyzed or studied either. The claim that the proteins might be different and therefore bad is insufficient. The older varieties are also different and might be worse.<br /><br />Also, I read that chapter thinking that he was describing modern, Monsanto style, untested genetic DNA engineering modifications of our food chain. I recently read an NY Times article that pointed out that there were absolutely no approved DNA modified wheat grown in the United States even though most corn production in the US is the result of DNA engineered modifications. The \\"short\\" wheat that the author attacks were produced by traditional hybridization and cross breeding done in the early 20th century. His descriptions were misleading.<br /><br />It was interesting reading this section of the book. But, I don't think he demonstrated that his conclusions about modern wheat strains were correct.<br /><br />Also, as far as I can tell, his evidence for the positive effects of dropping wheat from your diet were based entirely on positive reports from returning patients whom he had personally advised. There are several fallacies in this sort of evidence. First, the sample is small and he probably gave them additional medical treatment. Second, he heard nothing from his patient who got no value from his advice and did not return. That is a common problem. Patients who get no value from a specific doctor simply change doctors. The doctor who gave the advice, does not follow up with the missing patients and assumes that they did not return because they were cured. Sometimes they were cured and sometimes they were not cured.
B000M9BPEY|4.0|This is a good movie. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone. Kids will enjoy this flick too!
B00D555BBU|5.0|This is a great little product. I waited til it came out having used the older K-9 program. It's clean, efficient, has some options and I hear there is more in the works. It's easy to use with well placed icons and commands and unlike some others makes it easy to delete a lot of emails at once instead of one-at-a-time programs that are a pain when you have 100+ to get rid of.<br /><br />With the color coding you can keep email accounts separated and you always have fast and easy access to all the folders with even more options.<br /><br />One REALLY important thing, the developer is super fast and efficient in answering any questions or offering support and these days that's 80% of the experience when you need it.<br /><br />This may be an inexpensive program but worth many times the price for the clean look, options and features. Glad i waited.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This really is the best trilogy of the 21st century, if not, ever. Chris Nolan does a fantastic job of creating his own Batman story.
0807014273|5.0|Profound reading.  A must have in anyone's library who is interested in finding meaning in psychotherapy or in life itself.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|I don't think it is an accurate depiction of mental health, but despite that fact it is a great, heart warming movie. Plus it's got J Law so that's a plus.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|OK, So I see a lot of negative reviews, not more than positive ones, but still more than I would expect.  I am a Black Sabbath fan through and through, so if anyone should be critical of this it should be someone like me, however, I am super impressed with this work.  i really don't think I could ask for anything more.  I see people complaining about End of the beginning sounding too much like the original self titled song \\"Black Sabbath\\", but If you listen to the entire CD and how it ends (after Dear Father), I would think they intentionally made it sound that way.  i bought the Deluxe Edition and even the 3 bonus tracks are killer.  I believe this may have a chance at album of the year.  They are reclaiming their title as Godfathers of Metal.  \m/  BUY THIS ALBUM!  Support your bands.<br /><br />On a side note I would have made this 4.5 out of 5 stars because nothing is perfect but this is closer to 5 then 4 so 5 it is!  ROCK ON!
B000L212HC|5.0|I love the Chris Nolan and Christian Bale partnership. This is a fantastic movie with great acting. A must watch for any Nolan fan.
0439023521|5.0|I like how Suzanne Collins writes. She adds a little bit of humor here and there. Her ideas are clear and not confusing. I enjoyed the plot and fell for her characters. Could hardly put the book down. I can't wait to read the other two books in the trilogy.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I find that I usually use my Kindle reading and need to hold it.  If I have it on a flat surface in the standing position I find that it slips out of the holding slot when I turn a page.  It is sturdy as far as protecting my Kindle when closed.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game keeps me challenged and I do not get bored . It is fun to play. I recommend this game to all.
0425263991|4.0|After having read a number of her Psy books, I've found that her Angel books are much more enjoyable, because these ones get bogged down in the politics and world building when I'm more interested in her characters and the relationships.<br /><br />But I saw this one coming out and I'm on a new get-the-book-from-the-library kick, and I'm so glad I got this one!<br /><br />The story starts with a dangerous Cardinal Psy (his danger and power are almost endlessly repeated and emphasized through the story) and the woman he has rescued whose mind is fractured/damaged from years of torture and abuse. Her power is hinted at, so is their history. The most of the beginning is just the two of them in this big house and the heroine gathering her strength, mind and more depth of character through the passing chapters--plus the unfolding of their relationship. !!<br /><br />Unlike the other books I've read in this series, that had a LOT of politics/explanations, this book focused instead mostly on the relationships between the two characters. Singh is good at writing characters with some complexity.<br /><br />My one beef with the book is the end--it was kind of anti-climactic. The best part of the book was probably the first half. But if you've been reading all the books all along, things are changing on a big scale for the world of Psy and Silence!<br /><br />Liked it tho'! Recommend it to you if you've been losing faith in Singh's series.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|It is an entertaining and insightful look at the sport of ultra running and the mind frame of an endurance athlete. Although not a technical book, it gives good advice on training, life philosophy and vegan cooking that actually looks good to a meat eater like myself.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Cats are awesome, and this is an animated movie about cats, cats doing awesome things and being cats in general. Simply amazing.
B00AYQNOFI|4.0|Worth watching once, if you watch it on a big screen it has a little bit of wow factor in it. Well I did not get any flow in the movie if there was suppose to be one but it is worth watching just for it's brilliant cinematography.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I have now purchased these a total of 4 times. Two times for my daughter because she keeps pulling them off the wall once for my sister and another for a friend of mine. I love these They are totally easy to use easy to pull off and on if you have to move them We love them.
B000N2HCKQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  Stimulates one to think outside the traditional box.  Recommend for administrators of organizations from corporations to educational institutions.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|i will never purchase from amazon it took over 15min to get the movie down loaded I will wait until it comes out on dvd
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was always told to read this when I was younger but it never looked good except for the cover art, I thought well I'll give it a shot and after I had been reading for four hours I knew I was hooked. It was a good book. Definitely stands up to the test of time even though it's a scifi novel.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book would have been a lot better if Day would have written an actual ending.  It is ridiculous to have a trilogy and then find out it isn't a trilogy and there is not a title or date for the next book.  Makes me not want to read her books again.  There were too many open ends left in this book....there could be several more written just to clear up this one.
0920668372|5.0|So... Each one of my kids have a copy of this book. I buy it before their born. The message is very simple its one of love and a forever bond between a mother and her son. I don't find it creepy at all. It reminds me to slow down because my kids won't be kids forever.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Great movie the whole family liked it . Be sure to see it in HD for sure worth it trust me .
B000SOSS5W|5.0|Wonderful!  Now we're buying copies to give to worthy, discriminating friends.  Great performances, great music.  But it's very annoying that I have to write a required number of words to review this disc.
1451673442|5.0|easy to read and follow  very positive book  inspiring without being preachy  would recommend this book to anybody wishing to feel good and improve their life
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Absolutely a great take on the zombie movie genre. Action. Adventure. Awesome soundtrack. And of course, lets not forget the Zombies!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|ready for an upgrad on this app. once you buy all the ridess you just collect money and have nothing to spend it on.  Not much fun after that. Whist I could have got it on the Kindal faster.  I think the kids are goinng to like this app also.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|I love the Die Hard movies and am a big Bruce Willis fan.  So, I bought this movie and boy is it terrible.  Horrible!  an embarrassement!  Even 12-year old boys would find this disappointing.  I want my money back.
0547848412|5.0|Amazing book, captivating, and so compelling that from word one you are transfixed with the story of Pi and how he has to struggle alone and overcome such difficult odds. Yep I took the journey with Pi and through the fear and terror, I survived.
1401311083|4.0|Richard Castle and Kate Beckett, and the other regular characters from the TV series CASTLE, come to life under other names in this novel supposedly penned by the writer protagonist. That's an interesting device; I can't think of another media tie-in which has the main character from the TV series listed as its author. Of course in the TV show, writer Castle creates exactly these characters - writer Jameson Rook and detective Nikki Heat - after being inspired by shadowing Beckett and her team.<br /><br />In this second Nikki Heat book (I have not read the first one yet), Detective Heat arrives at a crime scene to find writer Jameson Rook already there and waiting for her. Heat and Rook became lovers in the first book and broke up at its end, and Heat is not a bit happy to see him again in circumstances that guarantee his re-entry into her life. For the murder victim, gossip columnist Cassidy Towne, was the subject of Rook's next article; and whether Heat likes it or not, he knows things about Cassidy's recent life that make him useful to the investigation.<br /><br />The story is a decent one, and whoever is writing as Richard Castle certainly can turn out a competent thriller. I enjoyed myself despite coming in with serious misgivings. I'll be looking for more work by \\"Castle,\\" so here's hoping the same author continues to wear this pen name.<br /><br />--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\"
B00785P2QC|4.0|Though fairly simple, this game has it's moments. It's hard to find a good truck simulator game. This one, therefore, stands apart as unique. It's just a casual game, but still very much fun. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a nice, amusing little game.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I began playing and then had to fork out more money to upgrade it - a bit deceptive, which I did not appreciate.  But I love playing it.  I wish they had added more expensive items to buy as you go through the 3 tanks quite fast and become a mess with all the stuff you must buy to gain a new trophy.  If you play a lot and then you either have to start over as a new player, or quit playing.  I enjoy the matching of the shapes to see if I can beat the clock more than filling a tank, but kids would most likely love doing this and the graphics are nice looking.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It couldn't have ended any better. Jordan and Sanderson have surpassed Tolkien himself. How will I ever find something that bests this tale..
B009KY5OGC|4.0|We have, in our American cultural consciousness, burned deeply and with laserlike detail, the shameful treatment of African-Americans through many decades of slavery and many more of discrimination and Jim Crow.  Same with the Jewish people in the time of the Holocaust.  To a lesser extent, same with Japanese-Americans during WWII.  Any schoolchild can tell you all about the injustice that these people have faced and overcame.  And future generations may well look backward with similar shame and fury on our treatment of gay, Muslim, and immigrant Americans.<br /><br />It's different with Native Americans.  We may have a vague sense of guilt, a feeling that our ancestors mistreated them somehow.  We may also have a vague admiration for the \\"noble savages.\\"  Then we go to a Cleveland Indians game and cheer on Chief Wahoo (maybe we got tickets from a scalper), go play slots at an Indian casino, watch them fight cowboys on TV, then switch over to the Redskins game.<br /><br />Why is it different with Native Americans?  Probably because there are so few left to tell their side of the story.  That's why this book should be required reading for every high school.  Although the author is white, he has compiled a pretty exhaustive history of the Native Americans' resistance, relocation, and resignation to the US Government from 1860-1890.  In addition to the usual suspects (Cochise, Geronimo, Sitting Bull), the book covers dozens of others you've probably never heard of, but who are no less important to the overall story.<br /><br />The chapters get a bit repetitive, but that's only because history repeated itself for most of the individual tribes: They fought soldiers, the government brokered a peace, then broke that peace when it wanted more land, and the tribe withered away to almost nothing.  The fact that many tribes experienced similar atrocities doesn't excuse the historian from telling each tribe's tale.<br /><br />My only other complaint is that the book ends very abruptly with the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee.  Having followed the tribes for a few decades of resistance, I would have appreciated an epilogue transitioning to the then-current time period of the 1970's.  But if we can learn anything from the sad history of the Native Americans, it's that you can't always get what you want.  ...Unless you're the government.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I had a marathon watching these last week. I loved Star Trek as a kid and I haven't watched these movies in years. I'm so glad I bought them! I did have a difficult time opening the plastic cover, but it wasn't meant to open so that's why. :{ I'm a nerd.
B001NA6096|5.0|I thought the movie was great.  loved t and am looking forward to the 2nd of the trilogy.  Must see
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This novel is more like a group of loosely connected short stories.  I often wondered where the book was going.  Often the switching  from past to present seemed disjointed.  Hosseini is a great story teller; as a result, the book went quickly.
0425263924|5.0|Okay, people, get over the fact that Sylvia Day is extending the series. I for one am glad about it. I'm not disappointed with this book in the least - in fact, it's my favorite of the series so far! Also, I'm not going to rate this with one star just because she's making more. Grow up - you should be ecstatic that your favorite series will love on longer, I sure as hell am.<br /><br />Not that I enjoy the waits. Cause I hate that - Crossfire should be her sole project for the time being.<br /><br />Wow! I thought it would be the same plot and sex scenes recycled for the third book but... WOW! She never ceases to surprise me with all the twists and turns in her books! There's never a dull moment, something is constantly happening and I absolute love it. All of her characters are so alive with their own personalities and flaws, I'm so glad she's continuing the series. I can't wait to see what else she has in store for us!<br /><br />THE SEX! The sex is SIZZLING - I thought the other two books were hot, this one is... wow! And the fact that she brings something new to the table each time, it doesn't feel like just more sex. There's always something new to keep it hot and exciting. Holy hot damn - I have never been breathless while reading a sex scene before! (The club scene - nuff said.) It's so hot, I'm so impressed with her skill to keep it so romantic while raunchy hot and sexy.<br /><br />Cary's story has taken an interesting turn - the same with Eva's relationship with her sexy rock star. Her mom is beginning to annoy me (you'll find out why) and Corinne is should an annoyance! I can't stand that woman just as much as Eva. There's more to the Nathan case that kind of comes to light in this book, I'm curious to see where that takes us. Sylvia leaves us with a lot of loose ends that need tying, as the next (2?) books will do.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know where this story is headed! All I can say is I can't wait for the next book because I'm along for the ride until the end. And so far I'm LOVING IT more and more with each book! Keep up the great work, Ms. Day, I'm a fan forever!until the end. And so far I'm LOVING IT more and more with each book! Keep up the great work, Ms. Day, I'm a fan forever!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was awesome YES any way this book is abot a girl that finds out a bout a garden a secret garden...........or
0425269205|4.0|I enjoyed reading this last book in the Sookie Series. I'm glad I purchased the linen bound, signed version. Its a beautiful looking cover and case to the book. I'm a fan of all of Charlaine Harris' books. She writes strong female lead characters that women of all ages can relate to.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I loved the hole series you can just picture what the characters and look like hope they turn these into movies.
B009EAO38C|4.0|I was first introduced to the Piano Guys on YouTube, and am so happy to learn that more of the world is coming to their fandom.<br />This is easy listening-mostly pop, yet roots of classical music show.<br /><br />Caution:  Although, I like to have them as background music while I work, you may find yourself stopping to get the lyrics to some songs, so that you can sing with the Piano Guys being your accompaniment.
B005ZO6NRA|2.0|I like Jason Momoa but he is no Conan by any stretch. This movie had a big budget and that is the only thing positive to be said about it. There was so much more dialog in this reboot than the 82 version but it felt thin and very cookie cutter Hollywood style. The movie has its moments but they are few and far between.  Pack on about 40 pounds more muscle and cut the wasted dialog and Momoa could make a great barbarian but Arnold will always be Conan.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This product is a MUST for anybody that moves their system around a lot, especially if you are sick of showing up to a lan party and you don't want to tag along your TV. I keep my system stored in this case and bring it out when its time to play. I have had no problems connecting to the screen, but if you do not have an HDMI ready device, you will need an adapter for this screen, there is one HDMI input on the front. For those of you that think you can just leave everything plugged in and close the case, YOU CAN't. The case has pouches to hold all of your cords and a couple of controllers. Just don't be lazy and pack your cords when you are done with your gaming. The video is fantastic, and the ventilation has been good enough for my system. No complaints about this product whatsoever. The case can be locked in case you have little or older siblings who like to get into your stuff as well!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love to play this game!  It's a puzzle game that my kids can play too!  I can easily play this game during my break at work too!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Good size pool for little ones.  The sprinkling sides makes it more fun than a regular pool.  I like how it's flat so I can put just a little water in it for my 1-yr-old and 3-yr-old and not worry about them drowning.  They can easily run in and out of the pool too because of the low sides.  The slide is small, so it's more of a decoration than actual sliding.  It does include the whale, turtle, a few tubes, and a tree looking thing for play.  They are detached so my kids took them inside to play too.  Overall my kids like it.  I can see 4 or 5 kids running in and out of it easily without bumping into each other.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I am SO disappointed I purchased UNO from Amazon for my Kindle Fire HD, It WILL NOT download at all. All I get is a error message that says it will not download.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I was a big fan of the original series, and so I was thrilled to learn that Netflix would be adapting it with a Washington, D.C. setting. And I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey easily inhabits this role, exuding a cold lust for pure power mixed with an irresistible devil's charm. The rest of the cast perfectly fit their roles and all deliver strong performances, contributing to a range of characters caught up in the dangerous game of the Washington spotlight.<br /><br />The direction and cinematography are nothing short of film quality. The writing and pacing are spot on, the story unravels relentlessly without being predictable. Watching just one episode is a near impossibility.<br /><br />The show isn't just for those who enjoy politics as it is really about power and fame and how it can corrupt human relations. A must watch for any discerning TV viewer.
B0094K20FK|4.0|The best of the earlier Star Trek movies. Ricardo Montalban creates a believable foe with believable circumstances in this movie. Much better than saving whales.
B0027MJU00|3.0|The good news is that the author is getting better with every book.  Like a lot of novels in the mystery/suspense/thriller genres, the journey was more entertaining than the destination.  I recommend you check this one out from the library.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Full Collection ... now with this latest film and Tarantino pack 20 I can say that I have all of the teacher, thank you for this opportunity to achieve incredible things. -
B000002O5L|5.0|Of course, here is another five star reveiw.... I won't bother repeating what everyone else has already said, probably better than I could, but I will say that you most likely already know this record front to back and back to front. If you do not, there is no doubt that you should check it out... I will say that one of my favorite things about this, and about any record I have ever heard, is how Petty and Lynne decided to end with 'Zombie Zoo,' a bizzare, rocking tune that is one of the strangest and most fun ways to end an album I have ever heard. Is it out of place? Yes. Is it AWESOME? Why, of course it is... you know Petty knows what he's doing.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|Good old day...just recognize I'm old.  It really brings good old memories back.  I love the bonus live performance much.
0316154687|5.0|David Sedaris is a fun and twisted soul. I always love his work. Great fun and a good summer read at  the beach.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Loved this heartfelt story called The Innocent.  John Puller is an amazing character and I can't wait for the next one in the series.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I had read the first two books in the crossfire series several months ago so I read them again before reading Entwined with You. I was entralled over the three days (read one book a day) and just absolutely love the series. Gideon & Eva are two of my favorite characters ever (and I read a lot). I was shocked that there were negative reviews - did we read the same book? It was perfect. I don't believe in retelling the story in the review and would hate to spoil it for someone else. Read this book, the love story is wonderful, the sex is beyond hot and the characters are extremely well developed. Sylvia Day's writing style is perfect. I truly don't get why people give bad reviews based on when books are released - go get a life and read something else while waiting instead of putting down a great series and author.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!what do you think well I love this game me and my grandma play this game
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I have loved every Philippa Gregory book I have read. I have lost myself in the stories of each book. It is obvious that she does a great amount of research.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun and challenges your reaction skills. I recommend this game to anybody with two hands with two thumbs!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I really thought that the dictionary was useless. You can't even search words. You can only hope that you eventually get to the word that you want
B0086700CM|4.0|I really like this game. It is fun and action-packed. The only thing I don't like about this app is that it needs internet connection a lot, and then if you don't have wi-fi, you are unable to play.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I could watch this over and over. What a fun show!  The mushc is fantastic and Fat Amy is hilarious!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Just like being in the front row. Great sound and selection of songs. What a great band. Al has as good vocals as ever, and Brian sounds great.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|this album kicks a**! It has a decidedly 70's sabbath sound. I'm a hard core fan of metal, having earned my metal wings on Master of Reality in the late 80's. Next up was Metallica and of course Pantera in the 90's. Nowadays I am listening to Lacuna Coil for the most part. I thought I'd give Sabbath a chance after finding much of Ozzy's later albums boring. I'm glad I did, this is a great album.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|Another great release from these top-notch musicians. People who are familiar with their music will not be disappointed. The CD package also features some impressive artwork. If you are new to this band then check them out (but don't expect \\"shred\\" guitar).
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|great game. very addicting. free game play. no need to purchase any in game items. good graphics. fast production. does not take up too mich space.
B002O3Z50Q|4.0|This give a good overview to the complexities of the Iliad. Gave personalities to the various participants on both sides of the conflict.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I caught a marathon of season two on tv and had to go back to watch season 1.  Glad that Amazon had it available through Prime.  Such a good show.  I'm hooked, and was all caught up in time for season 3.
B001EC0OMM|4.0|Loved this old comedy. Each of the main characters goes on a small journey seeking wisdom and maturity while everyone works hard to keep things light and easy. No one is one dimensional-- which is surprising given how predictable the overall plot is.Each character is willing to give up something important to help another character. Katherine Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant are wonderful in the title roles.
