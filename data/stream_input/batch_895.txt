B0000CFW87|5.0|When my mom first brought home this CD, I had my doubts... more than half of the songs were in a foreign language! But 1 minute into the first song, I reliezed that my doubts were ill-founded... this guy is great!
B001GQACGE|1.0|Beyonce is a talented singer who fronted the supergroup Destiny's Child years ago; but it seems that with every solo release the quality gets worse and worse.  \\"Dangerously In Love\\" was a classic, \\"B Day\\" was all over the place (vocally, lyrically), and this CD seems to be a COMPLETE waste of time and money.  Sure, there are a FEW decent tracks like \\"Halo\\"  \\"Broken Hearted Girl\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (which is the best track overall), but there are plenty of \\"Fast Food-Drive Thru Songs\\" that i call music for the moment, but nothing that will last or stick years from now. I would hope that with her next release she really looks deep into her heart and find herself and bring that person back to the forefront and then maybe we will receive another classic from this talented lady.
B000002GJH|5.0|Out of my collection, I'll have ta say the collaboration between   Chris Cornell & Eddie Vedder was a 'session' where both legendary   heavy-weights closet thier predominant wild potentials, chastise themselves,  and do the 'get-down' on the nitty-grittys of thier collaborative Blues-Rock perspectives.  'Temple Of The Dog' is a true collectors piece in ANYONES eyes....

B00000K0E5|5.0|goldeneye, the best bond thriller of the bond movies to grace the movie screen. lots of action love, and suspence,if you are a james bond fan, then you will love this movie.you can never get enough action buy this movie, that is my recommendation.

B001DPHDCY|5.0|Pretty much every knows the story of Horton's Hears a Who.  The friendly elephant who hears the little creatures that live in their own little world and befriends them. This movie was alot more enjoyable to me than the Grinch in terms of drawing you into the world of Horton, and hopefully any other adaptations for film of his other works follow the lead.  Wonderful movie that is visually great, and the all star cast are also steller in their voice overs.    Bit of Spoiler/More Caution:  Just one bit of caution for young ones who may be sensitive, with a bit of spolier for a scene, there was one scene in particular where there was a threat to the Whos (boiling oil), which my younger nephew found a bit upsetting, though he always loved the books.  So you may want to take a quick glance through and see if is something to skip.  It is probably not a huge problem, but though I should point it out.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Carl Fredricksen is a young boy enthralled by the legend of and adventures of Charles Muntz (voiced by Christopher Plummer), a Zeppelin flying globe trotter who has discovered a lost world in South America called Paradise Falls. Muntz is disgraced because one of his discoveries is deemed a fraud. He leaves vowing not to return until he has the living animal as proof. None of this dissuades Carl from his hero worship of Muntz. On his way home, Carl having a backyard adventures discovers a kindred soul in Ellie, a girl his age who wants to grow up to be an adventurer herself. Ellie makes Carl promise to take her adventuring to Paradise Falls, they grow up to be best friends, they marry, and get jobs but life keeps getting in the way of the adventure to Paradise Falls until a lifetime passes and Ellie dies, and the hope and spirit of adventure die in Carl too.<br /><br />As Carl (voiced by Ed Asner) settles into retirement, the neighborhood he has known with Ellie has changed around him. Instead of neighbors houses and Oak trees his house is the last standout amongst strip malls and skyscrapers. One day he is surprised by a knock at his door it's a Wilderness Explorer named Russell who is trying to earn a badge in assisting the elderly. Carl gets rid of the kid by sending him on a snipe hunt and he thinks it's the last he's seen of Russell. Through a mishap during a confrontation with an official of the construction company trying to buy Carl's house, he finds himself being forced to go to a retirement home. Carl trying to honor his vow to Ellie to go to Paradise Falls spends the night filling thousands of balloons with helium and escapes the clutches of the retirement home by deploying the balloons and the house floats away headed for Paradise Falls. There's one little problem, after Carl is aloft and sailing on the currents of the wind he's again surprised by a knock at the door, it's Russell who was looking for the snipe under Carl's house. Carl and Russell make it to Paradise Falls and there the adventures begin, but not what they expected it to be. They're befriended by a giant bird Russell names Kevin, a talking dog, and the aged Charles Muntz still obsessed with vindicating his name and returning to civilization with a living creature which turns out to be Kevin.<br /><br />UP is a great adventure for young and old, children will love it for the adventures Carl and Russell have in trying to get to Paradise Falls and the adventures once they get there. And adults will remember the promises of their youth and the adventure they sought and will hopefully make the discovery Carl does, life is the adventure!<br /><br />I think too many movies have sequels made, not because the story can carry it, but because the original made a lot of money, but as UP was ending I was wondering and ready to see what the next adventure for Carl and Russell will be!<br /><br />Like Wall-E before it UP is taking full advantage of the full expressive effects of the medium, there's an almost 20 minute nonverbal beginning & it works to fantastic effect! It's a great adventure for kids and for adults too, it shows you how to open yourself again after your world seems to be shrinking.<br /><br />I noticed some reviews unfavorably mentioned the beginning 20 minutes as not being for children, but that's absolutely incorrect. While the first 20 minutes tell the poignant story of Carl and Ellie's life there is nothing explicit or anything used just for sensational effect. This movie is all about love, hope, adventure, either capturing those emotions or recapturing them in your life.ise Falls and there the adventures begin, but not what they expected it to be.

1587613379|5.0|The Ethical Slut is a very good, eye opening--sometimes eye popping--book about exploring an alternative relationship. Inside, I found out just what I was looking for in that the author(s) doesn't hold back in the descriptions about what it entails to actually do something like this. These are real life experiences told by people who have been invloved with polyamarous realtionships, so you're going to get the gist of it. I have yet to see another book on the subject that comes close to this one.
0762434279|1.0|I feel disappointed. I didn't receive the book right now. And I don't have time to complain.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Opera is so cool! In \\"legitimate\\" theater it would be difficult to mount a successful production in Austria, performed in Italian, with principals from Russia, Mexico, Italy, and Moldova, yet that is what this production of \\"L'Elisir d'Amore\\" does- with a Viennese conductor. I listen to opera for the singing, and when I attend the opera, whether in person or on DVD, I want to see good acting and staging. I also want to see something that is reasonably true to the composer's intentions. This does not mean that an opera originally set in 17th Century Spain must always be set in that time and place, but I want the opera to be recognizable. This \\"Elixir\\" is beautifully sung and acted, and cleverly staged. I am the first to complain when an actor is over the top in hamminess, and I can see how people could see that in Rolando Villazon's Nemorino, but I found his portrayal to be fun and engaging, and his singing superb. The voice is big, but he keeps under perfect control. I thought his antics were in character and it appeared that his Adina, Anna Netrebko, thought so, too. I could look at her and listen to her all day long, and her Adina is just flirtatious enough and just restrained enough to balance Nemorino. Leo Nucci and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo also sang and acted wonderfully, and Inna Los was excellent as Giannetta.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Cool down in hot humid Louisiana with the vamps and weres.  Great fun and imaginative story.  The characters are unforgettable and very different from the usual tv series people.  Highly recommend TrueBlood Season one for a great escape into another world.
0553381687|5.0|I bought this book based on all the positive reviews. I am so glad that I did. Every free moment I have was dedicated to this book and it was so hard to put down! I can't wait to read the next one!!

B000TXG3YA|5.0|Yep, they started just like Mastodon (soundwise) and some other Sludge bands out there. A couple of records later Baroness stands on it´s own ground and boy they ripp.    Great album from the beggining to the very last song, no fillers. Great melodies, twin lead guitar assaults and crushing riffs.     Can´t hardly wait for their new record.    Great music indeed, you won´t regret it, in fact, I think you NEED to listen to this one.    Enjoy.
B000008LOV|5.0|ordered the wilburys, was here in a veryshort time and in great condition.   thank you
1400049628|4.0|Wonderful book, frighteningly detailed.  I am however, disappointed with the lack of explanation of how zombies actually stay alive. Well...\\"alive\\".
B000RGGYI4|5.0|From the second you hit the play button, you know you're in for a real treat with this album.  The first song, \\"Time Was\\" starts out with some gorgeous acoustic guitar, which is soon joined by bass and then two singers singing \\"I've got to rearrange my life,  I've got to rearrange my world\\" in lovely harmony.  After a few minutes, drums herald a second, more energetic melody accompanied by electric guitars.  This first song demonstrates excellent song writing and construction, mixing the many elements that made Wishbone Ash such a great rock band: very tasteful and inventive twin guitars, lovely vocal harmonies, good bass and drums, and the alternation of acoustic and electric sections.  The entire album is simply inspired, full of charm and energy.<br /><br />\\"Time Was\\" is followed by a fairly sad song, \\"Sometime World\\" about a lonely man who feels that the world has passed him by.  But the first line, \\"I met a man who felt the same way\\" lets you know that the narrator who meets the man shares his sadness.  Despite the sad opening, it transitions into a faster section which is much more upbeat.  There are no lyrics to account for the change of mood, but maybe the two guys have cheered each other up by realizing they're not the only ones feeling down.  (Or maybe it was just time for some kickass guitar solos.)  It's another great song.  This is followed by \\"Blowin' Free\\" about an ex-girlfriend with hair that blew free like a cornfield.  This features all 3 singers and might make you think of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.<br /><br />\\"The King Will Come\\" is a song about the second coming of Christ on Judgment Day.  It builds from near silence into a funky melody which then shifts to one of the best riffs on the album.  Ted Turner then gives us a terrific guitar solo full of the blues.  This is followed by a lovely piece of poetry, \\"Leaf and Stream\\".<br /><br />The original album then finished up with a matched pair of songs about war and peace.  The first, \\"Warrior\\", is about a man going off to war.  It features a very uplifting chorus, \\"I'd have to be a warrior - A slave I couldn't be - A soldier and a conqueror, Fighting to be free.\\"  The second, \\"Throw Down the Sword\\", talks about the same man after the war is over.  Note that the first line of \\"Warrior\\" (\\"I'm leaving to search for something new\\") is nicely balanced by the final line of \\"Throw Down the Sword\\" (\\"Only searching for an answer\\").  I think the point here is that war didn't give the narrator the answers he was looking for.<br /><br />While the dual guitars of Andy Powell and Ted Turner are what the group is famous for, Martin Turner's bass playing is excellent and is well captured by engineer Martin Birch who engineered and/or produced albums by Deep Purple, Rainbow, Wishbone Ash, Black Sabbath, and Iron Maiden. It's nice to hear a bassist so clearly, especially one who plays with so much melody.  Every song but one features harmonized singing from two or even three members of the group.  Steve Upton provides tasteful drumming; he keeps his rhythmic textures light, allowing the other instruments and voices to shine.<br /><br />I got the deluxe edition which includes a second disc with live recordings captured by the BBC after the album had been recorded.  This is actually quite expensive ($35 compared to $11 for the single CD), but I'm glad I got it since I really like the music a lot and enjoy being able to hear the live versions.  But many people might consider the deluxe edition too expensive.  What you get are live versions of 5 of the new songs (with \\"Blowin' Free\\" and \\"Throw Down the Sword\\" repeated) along with another live version of \\"Phoenix\\".<br /><br />The extra songs on the first disc are live versions of \\"The Pilgrim\\" and \\"Phoenix\\" from the group's \\"Live in Memphis\\" EP together with \\"No Easy Road\\" which was the B-side of a single.  Note that the single CD version has a live version of \\"Jail Bait\\" (which was the third song from the \\"Live in Memphis\\" EP) instead of \\"No Easy Road\\".  I don't know the song \\"Jail Bait\\" yet (which was on their second album, \\"Pilgrimage\\"), so I can't say which song is more desirable.  While I like \\"No Easy Road\\", it is stylistically quite different from the rest of the music due to its boogie feeling and use of piano and seems out of place on this album.  It's inclusion is the only flaw in an otherwise perfect album.
B002CNV52A|5.0|Let me preface by stating that I'm much more of a progressive rock fan than a progressive metal fan.. you music nerds out there know exactly what I'm talking about.. everybody who doesn't get it.. just forget about it and read on...<br /><br />PAST::<br /><br />Dream Theater, at one time one of my favorite bands of ALL time (Scenes From A Memory-era) lost favor with me starting with Train Of Thought... which I found to be too heavy and too one dimensional for my liking.. I've grown to love the album since, especially after seeing Live At Budokan, which really puts the TOT material in perspective and it all makes perfect sense.  Hats off to you, Portnoy, for knowing this before I would know it.. anyway..<br /><br />lets move on to OCTAVARIUM, which actually really impressed the hell out of me and is one of my favorite DT albums of all time (I especially LOVE the super-epic title track!!!)<br /><br />Then came Systematic Chaos, which really tested my metal as a Dream Theater fan.. I seriously thought they had lost their minds and run amok on roadrunner and that the whole album was an embarrasing throw-away.. but upon further listen, MINISTRY OF LOST SOULS is freaking badness... and I never doubted that for a minute.. unfortunately.. besides MOLS and Constant Motion, the album is an embarrassing journey.  The DVD that came after was even more embarrasing... with the band sounding like a poor cover-version of itself on horrible versions of amazing songs like Blind Faith... anyway.. I really thought they'd lost it, and I would never travel to see them again (like I had in the SIX DEGREES days) but then -<br /><br />CURRENT DAY::<br /><br />Dream Theater, my favorite band who seemed to have lost their touch in past years, drops a new album called BLACK CLOUDS & SILVER LININGS and it BLOWS ME AWAY!<br /><br />Talk about a comeback of melody and strong keyboard performances... the 6 songs on the BC&SL album are an amazing statement from a band I had wrote off.  Really, I had moved onto not-as-heavy bands like Frost.<br /><br />Anyway, Black Clouds & Silver Linings is the best new thing from Dream Theater since the final notes of Octavarium played out... Let me go through each song to make this review as annoyingly inclusive as possible.<br /><br />------------------------<br /> A NIGHTMARE TO REMEMBER<br />------------------------<br />The song I've been waiting for Dream Theater to write since Scenes From A Memory... wow.. what a collection of great hooks to anchor amazing instrumental breaks... just - wow.. without a doubt, this epic song has some of the best melodies written by DT since SCENES ... I'm so happy to hear them experiment with key changes as they do from 5:00 on... the line \\"hopelessly drifting - bathing in beautiful agony\\" is one of the greatest prog melodies ever written.. the whole part from the first time they sing it until they sing it in a totally different key..  I LOVE THIS SONG!  BRAVO!  DREAM THEATER IS BACK!  WOOHOO!<br /><br />------------------<br /> A RITE OF PASSAGE<br />------------------<br />Oh man.. this was the first song they released from the album, so I've been rocking out to this one for a while now.. I freaking love everything about it.. a big epic return to the Dream Theater that can write radio hits.. this is a freaking hit to be reckoned with.. bravo.. I freaking love every second of it.  EVERY SECOND!<br /><br />----------<br /> WITHER<br />----------<br />A decent slower song.. it sounds very current though.. I wouldn't say it resembles the blatantly pop stuff from AWAKE, but it seems kind of a bit too radio-ready for my tastes.  Still a good hook by DT's standards... I like it.<br /><br />------------------------<br /> The SHATTERED FORTRESS<br />------------------------<br />The conclusion of the mostly disappointing quintology about Portnoy's struggles with alcohol abuse.. okay I'm about to go music nerd madness on you.. skip ahead if you are weary...<br /><br />1. The GLASS PRISON -<br/>  amazing intro to multi-part epic.<br /><br />2. This DYING SOUL -<br />  incredible instrumental breaks throughout.. this is DT at their collective best as far as chops are concerned (everyone reading this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to see the performance of this song on the LIVE AT BUDOKAN DVD.. oh my god.. they prove that they were at their tightest that year.. I get goose bumps when I watch the last half of the song on LIVE AT BUDOKAN.. much respect all around.<br /><br />3. The ROOT of all EVIL -<br />  I LOVE OCTAVARIUM, and this song really is mostly composed of original passages, and it opens my beloved OCTAVARIUM album, so I really love this one.. no further explanation needed.<br /><br />4. REPENTANCE -<br />  This song, like much of SYSTEMATIC CHAOS, is a mess of ideas gone wrong.. Petrucci saves it with an amazing solo... but the song is rather pointless otherwise.. get over the samples guys.. that's so not cool anymore.<br /><br />5. The SHATTERED FORTRESS<br />May lightning strike me if I got that wrong.. anyway.. okay, THE GLASS PRISON is freaking awesome... and then THIS DYING SOUL is easily the best of all 5 parts... I've listened to them in succession, believe me.. I'm a bigger music nerd than you can ever dream of being.<br />THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL was a great fire-filled opener to the perfect OCTAVARIUM album (in my humble opinion).  So the last two parts of this epic concept piece are REPENTANCE(REP) and THE SHATTERED FORTRESS(TSF), which I will address both here at once because they are both flawed for the same exact reason.. most of the song (especially TSF) is simply rehashing every riff from the songs that came before it.. though REP has one of the best Petrucci solos on that whole album.. so since this is a review of the BC&SL album, I should just point out that TSF is a very disappointing ending to a great idea.<br /><br />-------------------<br /> The BEST of TIMES<br />-------------------<br />Oh my god I LOVE this freaking song.. it's softer prog rock, which is the sound I prefer to prog-metal.. great hooks throughout - doesn't Styx have a song of the same name? anyway I don't listen to Styx past Cornerstone, so I don't know wtf I'm talking about.<br />Anyway this is a fabulous song from top to bottom.. around the time you get to this song on the CD, you start thinking (thank GOD they decided to concentrate on 6 songs instead of putting out another double digit mess like Systematic Chaos<br />I will always urge DT (if they even read these reviews) to TAKE THEIR FREAKING TIME!  jeeeeez.. we don't need a new album every year, guys.. I mean, thanks for being prolific, but I'd rather you guys really concentrate on a small batch of songs for a few years even, like Spock's Beard does.<br /><br />---------------------<br />The COUNT of TUSCANY<br />---------------------<br />When I first read the name of this song and saw the length, I hoped it wasn't literally a story about the count of tuscany... well it is... but fret not, DT fans, it's a great song.. I love every part of it.. it's very trippy, pink floydish, almost.. but it just sounds like DT and I LOVE IT... I absolutely adore Labrie's vocals from 14:45 to the end of the song... very raw and very good!  I love Labrie when he nails stuff, and he does it throughout this whole album and especially this song... very tasteful stuff...<br /><br />In closing, I need to say that this album presents a very grown-up DT... but they still sound so much more convincing and hungry than they did throughout their last album and live DVD..<br /><br />This album really surprised me... I'd say BLACK CLOUDS AND SILVER LININGS is possibly a peer or even better album than my beloved OCTAVARIUM.everyone reading this is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to see the performance of this song on the LIVE AT BUDOKAN DVD.. oh my god.. they prove that they were at their tightest that year..

B00164GDD2|1.0|One of my top 5 all-time favorite movies. But, as has been noted by other reviews, the transfer is terrible. To add insult to injury, the special features are not special at all. The DVD collectors series looks better on my HD screen, and is packed with extra's. Very disappointed.
B000B8QG22|5.0|I talked to my coworkers about buying this moving for my Dad. All of us were in tears laughing, and discussing scenes. It was a great Father's Day gift!
B000P0J0D8|1.0|It's not a comedy. Therefore, the plot does not make sense with all the killings. It's not interesting either.
B0026IA0QS|5.0|Finding this film on Region one DVD was great.  It's an excellent surreal horror film from Alejandro Jodorowsky.  If you got the boxed set with El Topo and Holy Mountain, you have to get this also
0316017922|5.0|Everything that Gladwell writes in this book you inherently know to be true. In this day and age when most would apply a slant or a bias in speaking on the subject of what makes success Gladwell is just reporting the facts. This is no Tony Robbins psychobabble cheer you up, this is a practical understanding written in a very approachable manner.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|This album is for those of you who have been wishing that Prodigy released another album like Fat of the Land.  Heavy bass, infectious beats, this album takes no prisoners with no filler tracks.  There are old school rave-style synths that are somewhat dispersed throughout the album that just adds to the goosebumps of nostalgia, but laid over heavy beats reminiscent of Fat of the Land style production.  Vocals (when available) are on point.  The production in this album is ingenious: even infectious beats, when they play for long enough, can become monotonous and this album is full of clever build-ups, breakdowns, pauses, all ingeniously placed at just the right time.  I'm not trying to hype up this album too much, but honestly if you're one of the ones missing the 90's big beat tracks then this album is your dream come true.    The only prerequisite for this album is that is MUST be listened to through speakers capable of doing the album justice, very unique and heavy basslines.  You have to crank the songs up loud to do them justice!
B0016CP1Q4|5.0|After coming to the conclusion that Washington Square Serenade (WSS) is possibly the best thing Steve Earle has ever done I was prompted to revisit his back catalouge and have not been disappointed. Given how impressed I was with WSS I seem to be listening to Copperhead Road with a new appreciation. \\"Townes\\" now seems to be entrenched at the top of my play list. Choice Stuff.
B001WCBPCW|5.0|Kasabians West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum is without a doubt the album of the year so far. This album has a feel of a spaghetti western soundtrack to it. If you listen to it with headphones on, eyes closed you can picture the wild west. Fast Fuse is a true standout track. It would be right at home on a soundtrack to any Tarantino film. Vlad The Impaler is brilliant. West Ryder Silver Bullet and Secret Alphabets are unreal with such incredible grooves to them. Fire is another outstanding song. Not a wrong turn on the whole album. It is truly one album that should be listened to in its entirety every time. Kasabian has crafted their finest album and one of this centuries best.
140120841X|5.0|To anyone that has seen the movie and enjoyed it, but has not read the book:   DO IT NOW.  The movie is not even the same story, it just has a similar message. So many changes were made for NO reason. God I wish I could film the story Alan Moore wrote here, instead of the wachowski's drivel. Seriously though, this is one of the greatest lessons in true patriotism and the power of symbols over the masses. For anyone as fed up with the current state of global affairs as I am, this book rings  true in the same fashion that Orwell's \\"1984\\" or Huxley's \\"A Brave New World\\" did in their times. A man with a finger truly on the pulse, prophetic and foreboding, and a little too close to accurate. Read this now, and always remember the 5th of november.
0307454541|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I thought it was intriguing and a great read.  I recommend it.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A little slow for adults but interesting and without the adult humor you find in other cartoons.    My daughter loves it.    Watching the behind the scenes clips, I wasn't impressed with who I guess was the director.
0439023483|5.0|Never before did I think I'd be angry to see a rating for a book that was below 5, but I find myself doing just that this time. This book is amazing! I was reading it whenever I had the chance, not to mention when I slept I was dreaming about it.   This is an amazing book and I absolutely reccomend it to everyone. The only bad word I can remember was a** and I believe it was only twice or so, which is great because I can't stand a book with lots of cussing.    Anyway, please read this book...you won't regret it. I'm 13 years old, I just finished it and I'm already wanting to read it again. I can't wait for the 2nd book to come out!!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This album, simply put, is an incredible album from start to finish, and easily Metallica's best since the Black Album.  Unlike many, I loved the Black Album, it is the first album I ever bought of Metallica and I just think it is a tremendous and underappreciated album.  This album is not quite the old Metallica (Pre Black Album), but it is definitely not the slower, bluesier Metallica of the mid to late 90's or the melody-less Metallica from their last atrocity (do I really need to type the name).      When this album begins with That Was Just Your Life you know that this is a return to form from Metallica right away.  The thunderous drumming by Lars, which cannot be missed, Lars just plays the hell out of the drums on this album, its awesome.  The riffs and solos on this album are just executed perfectly, Kirk Hammett is back with a vengeance and takes his place once again as one of the best guitarists of all-time.  That Was Just Your Life is a very fast, thrashy song with incredible riffs by James and Kirk and as I said brutal drumming by Lars, it is a tremendous album opener, it gets the blood pumping right away.  The End of the Line is another very heavy song, heavier than the first track, but is also very fast, and probably has some of the best riffs on the album.  Also, the lyrics by James on this track are just exceptional (as they are throughout the whole album actually).  So, basically it is another blistering thrash metal song, but the chorus slows things down a tiny bit and sounds something like Fuel from Reload, a great, great song.  Broken, Beat, and Scarred is a slower, but very heavy song.  It sounds somewhat similar to St. Anger with the shouting of \\"What don't kill ya' make ya' more strong\\", and also features some of the best work of Robert Trujillo on the album, he has some great basslines in this one.  The Day That Never Comes is the \\"One\\" of this album, it starts off with some beautiful guitar notes like \\"One\\" and just keeps building and building until they have a fantastic breakdown with riffing very similar to \\"One\\" and \\"Fade to Black\\", it is a great song, very melodic.  All Nightmare Long seems to be a favorite of most people and it is very heavy, and has the heaviest riffs on the album overall, the way the intro of the songs builds and builds off of Lars' drum work and then erupts into a full on assualt by the whole band is just classic, definitely one of the best songs on the album.  Cyanide starts off with a great bassline by Trujillo, then the riffs kick in and this is one of the songs where you can clearly hear Trujillos bass throughout the whole song, and he does a great job, the song is great overall.  The Unforgiven III is the slowest song on the album and features piano accompaniment at the beginning and for some reason seems to be the least favorite of most people, but I think it is one of the many highlights of the album due to the undeniable melody, haunting guitar work, and some of the best lyrics off of the album.  The chorus is really beautiful too, like all the Unforgiven songs and this song has an incredible solo by Kirk, as every song does, but I really like this solo a lot.  I would say that this Unforgiven is better than Pt. 2, but probably doesn't top the original, which is pretty much impossible.  The Judas Kiss simply has the best chorus on the whole album and also features an awesome intro with (surprise, surprise) monster riffs by James and Kirk.  This track also contains some of the strongest hooks on the whole album, the song just sucks you in and when the chorus kicks in it just becomes pretty much the best track on the album(probably).  I would have to probably say that The Judas Kiss is my favorite off the album, just classic.  Suicide and Redemption is the only instrumental track on the album and is basically 10 minutes long, and truly epic.  It is probably the best instrumental I have ever heard, even without words it is one of the Top 3 tracks on the whole album, the song just blows you away, these guys are playing together in such great form on this album that it is scary, the song has very heavy parts, softer, more melodic parts, grinding, heavy parts, it has a bit of everything except vocals, it definitely has the best softer breakdown on the whole album around 3:55.  Just a perfect instrumental, truly.  Lastly, My Apocalypse is the most brutal song on the album and the shortest.  It sounds a bit Slayer-ish, but just without the screaming, growling vocals.  It probably features the hardest drumming by Lars on the album, which is no easy task because he beats the living hell out of the drums the whole album.  The solo in this song is definitely similar to a Kerry King solo but way better, we all know that Kirk is a million times more talented of a guitarist than Kerry King, no offense Kerry, I still love you too.  This song is just pure thrash with death inspired lyrics, great, great way to close a perfect modern metal album!      Overall, just a perfect album as far as I am concerned, the sound quality is not perfect, but it is not nearly as bad as many of these overzealous reviewers are saying.  The only concern I have is that Robert Trujillos bass is sometimes buried underneath the other instruments, but Metallica have always sounded like that really.  This album is almost flawless and I would recommend it to everybody, seriously it is that good!
1439130833|4.0|I like the daily teachings. They serve as a daily reminder to keep the law in mind. It starts on Monday as Day 1, and it would be good to have it on your desk at work or in your office at home, so you will remember to look at that day's lesson/thought. I think this would make a nice gift. If my husband wouldn't think I was crazy, I'd like to tear out certain days & post them all over the house to really keep them in my thoughts. I have to keep my mind focused on the law of attraction daily, or it's easy to slip back into old habits of negative thinking, so this works as a great daily reminder.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Ignore the reviews from the bigots and haters. Many are willing to believe that he was guilty of molesting children.  They are willing to believe this because he was eccentric. Never once will they consider extortion. They never thought it was strange that the families were willing to accept money for such a tragic event.    As far as Thriller (the original music) is concerned it will forever be a classic. Thriller is just brilliant from beginning to end.  Mr. Jackson will be remembered for Thriller and the rest of his musical accomplishments for years to come. Long after his detractors have come and gone.     Rest In Peace Mr, Jackson and God Bless You.
158270208X|4.0|I purchased the gratitude book along with the diary, and it seems redundant, but it does help me to separate my need to journal sometimes from my need to list my goals in gratitude mode. I like that the gratitude book isn't dated and doesn't have the days on each page, so you can start any day. The page on the left is for listing what your grateful for now. The page on the right is for listing future intentions, things you want, so you state your gratitude for them in the present tense on that page.<br />I like the old world look of the book and magnetic closure. It's really lovely and would make a great gift.
0312360266|1.0|I could not stand the main character of this book. She's terribly Mary Sue, and the entire book follows suit in the sense that it is cliche and melodramatic. I'm not sure if I would like this book had I been as young as 13 when I read it; it's that juvenile.    The dialogue is completely unrealistic of modern teenagers, something that surprised me because the book was written by an English teacher and her teenage daughter.    The plot is predictable, and it seems the author had to make too much of an effort to keep the characters from seeming plain by pouring on odd, cliche, and ridiculous \\"quirks.\\"    Also, the author is from Oklahoma, as am I, and the view she portrays of the inhabitants of our state through the main character's roommate are degrading and unrealistic. It seems as though she tried to fit the word \\"y'all\\" in this particular character's dialogue as many times as possible, sometimes making the sentences very awkward. Her clothing, as well, is ridiculous. I'm sure there are a few teenager girls out there who would choose to wear Wranglers, girly plaid, and cowboy boots, however, I have yet to meet one. This character is portrayed as the average Oklahoman girl--and this unrealistic portrayal is an insult.    I wanted to like this book. The story has potential. However, fans of vampire literature have been let down once again, something that has been happening far too often lately.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I don't know why I didn't write this review when I first bought the album back in November. Fearless is an absolutely amazing album that you really won't regret buying.    Fearless - as she says in the podcast accompanying a purchase of this song as a single on iTunes, it's about a perfect first date and how no matter how much we've been hurt by love we always jump back in, completely fearlessly. It's a song pumped full of optimism.    Fifteen - a trip down memory lane. Taylor recounts meeting her best friend since freshman year, the first day of high school, and falling in and out of love. It's a soul-touching song and I'm amazed it wasn't released as a single. It's amazing! At an awards ceremony she sang it with her friend Miley Cyrus.    Love Story - there's good reason it was so amazingly popular for so long (it's still on the bestselling tracks on Rhapsody after all this time and on the bestselling country tracks on iTunes). Love Story is about forbidden love and following your heart. The music video is incredible. She wrote this song by herself, which shows she has some amazing talent!    Hey Stephen - written for a guy she likes from the band Love n Theft. I enjoyed it though I wouldn't say it's my ultimate favorite.    White Horse - a sad, quieter ballad about a breakup; the first song on Fearless with any negativity, about how fairytales don't come true. It's another tribute to how Taylor can transform heartbreak into a gorgeous ballad. Proof of its success? It was featured on Grey's Anatomy and was turned into a great music video.    You Belong With Me - I suppose you could call this one White Horse's opposite. Taylor wrote this insanely popular hit by herself as well. It's upbeat. The basic storyline is that Taylor's crush - her best friend - is with a mean girl who only drags her boyfriend down. Watch the music video. It has a happy ending - and features Lucas Till. :)    Breathe - about how Taylor broke up with a friend who only hurt her, even though she couldn't breathe without her. It's cowritten with Colbie Caillat and is a nice song overall.    Tell Me Why - at 3 minutes and 20 seconds, it's the shortest song on the album but also the most quickly-paced. Her vocals in this song are absolutely amazing. It's not apparent whether the song was inspired by an actual situation. It's harsh and to-the-point. Difficult to comprehend until you hear the actual music. I was going to write out a sample of music, but seeing it written is a far cry from hearing it yourself.    You're Not Sorry - this song immediately made iTunes's top 10 list once it was released as a single. Originally, it was going to be \\"You Don't Have to Call\\", but this version is far better in my opinion. It's about giving someone you're with countless chances, but they fail every time with the lame excuse \\"I'm sorry\\" when you know they're not.    The Way I Loved You - it's addictive. A song you actually WANT to get stuck in your head. Swift sings of past love vs. a new one - the past one hurt so much but she was \\"so in love that I acted insane\\", while the new one is more serene but \\"my heart's not breaking 'cause I'm not feeling anything at all\\". Excellent instrumentals. Taylor demonstrates her vocal ability extremely well in this song, too.    Forever & Always - she wrote this after Joe Jonas dumped her over a 27-second phone call. (And honestly, I am sick of people saying \\"Oh she has to get over it\\" when they see her sing it at her Fearless 2009 Tour. Really, it was part of her album, so even though she's over it, she's going to sing it at her concert - it's a great song!) Few songs make me cry but this one succeeded. As in White Horse, Taylor was able to turn her heartbreak into a beautiful song.    The Best Day - it's all about her family! :) It's slower, gentler, and quieter, and her voice, while lowering in volume, loses none of its strenght or power.    Change - it's full of energy and fills any listener with a feeling of power and hope. It wasan excellent idea to release as Fearless's first single.    Overall, the album was simply amazing and I didn't regret buying it.
1401203078|3.0|I enjoyed reading the lastest entry to the League line up. I enjoyed the continued romance of Mina and Allan. It was fun to have some background on other League members but not essential to the story development.     I didn't care for the way it ended, didn't want to punch out the paper reading glasses so I could read the last few pages. I like to keep my novels in the shape I bought them. I will be reselling most of these in the near future.    J
1600243916|5.0|Identifying and modifying specific leadership behaviors are how we change organizations, but Gladwell helps his reader to appreciate how some individuals and cultures achieved the success they earned from a systems and longer term perspective (ex: over generations or even centuries).  The book also helped me to see some system, organizational and societal interventions that change people and cultures.
031606792X|4.0|I'm new to the Twilight Phenomenon, but I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the saga over the last two weeks. I will admit that I did get feed up with Bella's whining and Jacob's desperation at times. However, unlike most people I really enjoyed Eclipse. I found the banter between Edward and Jacob to be hilarious. As for Breaking Dawn, I found it to a pleasant end to the saga.  I have heard speculation that there is another book told from Edwards perception that was in the works until it was leaked over the net.  As I am far older than the average reader, I find the details surrounding this to be a bit \\"shady\\".  The story giving has a lot of missing pieces.  I believe this to be a PR scheme.  Nothing sells books or movies tickets faster than a scandal or drama.<br />Here's what I do not understand, why was there not any legal maneuvers at least by the publishing company to stop the spread over the internet? They have the most to lose in book sells. I think it was leaked by the publisher. And the BS Ms. Meyer's is spouting about waiting two years to go back to it.  There's no way with the reviews the draft is getting in the blogs that the publisher's will let it sit for that long.  It's a like sitting on a pot of gold. And who is to say the interest will still be there in two years? I have no worries that the book will be published.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|With 662 reviews, mine isn't really needed, but I want to say how much I enjoyed this book. It is still a top favorite after all these months. I loved it so much that I am planning to re-read it this summer. I usually pick one book every year to re-read for the summer and this one wins hands down.  Some summers it's hard to pick, but not this year! I'm sad that the author is deceased, but grateful she left this delightful book for us. What a gifted story teller!<br /><br />Update:  I re-read this book in July and enjoyed it almost as much as the first time. Sure I knew what was going to happen, but I loved the characters so much it was like re-visiting old friends. This story was like comfort food to me. Warm, familiar and satisfying.....but no calories!  ;)
0312383436|2.0|Why do I keep trying to read Madeline Wickham books? It's those darn book jackets that pull me in. I'm expecting a fun, frothy beach read (like her Kinsella books), and they are nothing of the kind. When she writes as Kinsella, she is funny, witty, romantic, and enjoyable. As Madeline Wickham, she creates unappealing characters and boring plotlines. In this instance, she makes Simon so unappealing that the reader never warms up to him. Why would I want him to get the girl? I don't. Molly, the heroine, is sweet, but frustrating. She is never honest with her loved ones. The \\"secret\\" theme has been done ad nauseum, and this sheds absolutely no new light on it. I think if the book jackets were more appropriate to the slower, more serious story lines, I would have the proper expectations when I buy one. However, this is nothing like the fun chick lit it appears to be and that I enjoy reading occasionally. It's bland and completely forgettable.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I have been a huge Madonna fan from the beginning, 20 plus years, and I am constantly amazed at her ability to re-invent herself and keep her music current.  When I first purchased this CD it took me a few times to really enjoy it, I think because of the initial shock over how different it was from some of her others.  Now?  I can listen to it over and over and never get bored----very catchy, unique, and makes you want to get up and dance more often than not.  I wanted to give it a 5, but that would only be if I absolutely loved every song and that is not the case but that's okay, I am sure I am not alone; every fan of any group always has a song or two by them they don't necessarily care for. The real proof that this album is good and Madonna will always stand the test of time is the fact that I have convinced more than a few people to buy it and they ALL love it, some of them not even Madonna fans. Keep on bringing the music, Madonna, it will never get old!
B001PA0FFO|4.0|The original play \\"Doubt\\" was a powerhouse built around four actors, suspicion and a new vs old church divide that made it intensely dramatic. However, that kind of staging would be near impossible to film, and the movie adds characters (like the young boy Donald who is the source of the conflict) and a church full of congregents. The movie is still a heavy, densely wordy affair, but the inclusiuon of more bodies and business dilutes the ambiguity, or the \\"doubt\\" as it were.<br /><br />However, when you have Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman turning in their most ferociously thesbian performances possible, \\"Doubt\\" still comes out as a really good movie. Both Amy Adams as the innocent (who utters the scene stealing line above) and Viola Davis (who torpedoes the self-rightous certainty of Sister Aloysius with the rules of the world) as the mother who will protect her son through any or all make deeply impressive supporting appearances, and all work with John Patrick Shanley's fine adaptation of his original play. Togther, these folks were all nominated for Oscars, that is how good each individual is here.<br /><br />Streep, as Sister Aloysius Beauvier, takes that crusty old nun that everyone remembers from Sunday School and infuses her with both wit, wisdom and Nunly Facism. Hoffman's Father Flynn is the new breed of Priest, a big Catholic teddy bear who thinks the church must become more human and humane, but Sister Aloysius sees that as both weak and suspect. When she sees Father Flynn acting with (what she sees as) undue compassion towards the new kid, she decides to drive him out of the church at all costs...even if so much of her certainty may be flawed by her mistrust of change.<br /><br />At a very taut 100 minutes, \\"Doubt\\" works both as an indictment of the scandals within the Catholic Church and as an allegory to the modern day, when \\"Change\\" became a buzzword in the making of a war and a new president. Viola Davis, with maybe 10 minutes of screentime, tears all of the arguments into shreads, making the theme of doubt in the movie play right into the ambiguous ending. Powerful stuff and worthy of all its awards and nominations.ts into shreads, making the theme of doubt in the movie play right into the ambiguous ending.

1594481717|5.0|The context of this book is spot on for parents nurturing developing young minds.  We need to really move away from the old way of thinking (L-Directed thinking), and encourage the next generation to have an open approach to learning and leading.  We need to grow the next generation of leaders and the suggestions in this book will give us a huge boost in doing that.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is the BEST sitcom since Seinfeld. At last, it's comedy for those with a slightly higher IQ - you actually feel smarter after watching this show (as opposed to the opposite effect all other current sitcoms have on you). BBT has charm, wit, laugh-out-loud hilarity, and a PHD in Physics. I hope they can keep it fresh for at least 2 - 3 more seasons!

B000065NOS|4.0|This has to be a movie that people would either laugh their butts off watching, or turn it off and never finishing it because it was so stupid. Fortunately, as someone who loves absurd humor, I was entertained by it. Yes, it's one of the dumber films you'll ever see, but it's supposed to be stupid - a satire on the shallow people and world of male fashion models.    Ben Stiller is outstanding as \\"Derek Zoolander,\\" the brainless model who's number one. His status is in doubt by newcomer \\"Hansel,\\" played by Owen Wilson.  Stiller, Wilson, Millo Jovovich and Will Ferrell are good at playing weird people, as they do here. But it's all in fun - plus a serious comment about child labor - and the movie is simply to be enjoyed for what it is.     Film fans and celebrity geeks will enjoy all the cameos in here, along with the wild outfits - male and female - and all the goofy looks on the faces, mainly Stiller's poses. In between all the dumbness is some smart satire on several topics dealing with the fashion business.     Just know what you are getting into here, and you should get enough laughs to make it an entertaining hour-and-a-half.

B001FEA9QU|2.0|Death Magnetic is the Metallica I have been waiting for since ...And Justice for All.  The songs rock.  All the classic Metallica qualities are there: long songs, time changes, intense speeds, dual guitar lines, et cetera.  Unfortunately, the audio quality of the album sounds like someone took a cheese grater to the sound waves.  It's been compressed, clipped, and shredded (in a *bad* way).  I don't understand why anyone would do this to these songs or think it was a good idea.  I'm stuck somewhere between being sad and pissed off over it.  Either way, I'm certainly not satisfied with Death Magnetic.  Again, this is some great Metallica, but the crappy sound teases you with what could have been.

B000R8YC18|4.0|This is really a film classic and one of the better ones.<br /><br />Travis Bickle (Robert Deniro) is a loner cab driver who loves working the night shift due to his insomnia.  During the course of his rounds, he becomes obsessed with a young political operative, Betsy (Cybil Shepherd).  He is a rather strange guy and ends up taking her to a porn movie on their date.  After this bizarre behavior, she wants nothing to do with him.  Unfortunately, he is obsessing on her.<br /><br />His preoccupation with Betsy leads him to a deep hatred of pretty much everything after she dumps him.  One of his targets is the presidential candidate for whom Betsy is working.  Bickle decides to assassinate him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, he becomes enchanted in a non-sexual way with 12 year old prostitute Iris (a very young Jodie Foster).  His anger at the poor treatment she receives leads to other consequences.<br /><br />This is an interesting look at alientation and loneliness of some of the fringe people in big city life.  This is a rather extreme case of it.<br /><br />All in all, this is well done and quite entertaining.

B0029358GM|2.0|Let me start by saying I'm a long-term and fanatical Wilco follower. I have libraries of their music both studio and live, attended many concerts, and have been an evangelist for their talent and sound to anyone that listens to music.     This album, however, has certainly confirmed my worst fears...their 'evolution' is turning them into something almost irritating and boring to experience.    The collection of songs on this record sounds like the B-list of Sky Blue Sky tunes that didn't make the cut for that album....only more unorganized and less refined in every aspect.      I judge all albums and their ability to \\"move\\" me by one standard. I remember the first time I heard U2's Achtung Baby...every song, every sound, every lyric, every production element left me with a dropped-jaw....so far advanced that I was speechless. I've come to expect that from Wilco (and always hope that's what is delivered), but that hasn't happened in a long time, and sure doesn't with 'Wilco'.     Suffice it to say, \\"Wilco\\" left me shaking my head in disappointment, and in my opinion they've taken a major step backward toward irrelevancy. If this album sells 500K copies I'll be surprised. YHF is 10x the album of this one...Ghost is 8x the album...Sky is 4x the album....    That's a disturbing trend.

You can see their \\"crazy\\" fans around the world, like here in Brazil or in Argentina, when Iron Maiden cannot leave the hotel before the show, and you can cry with the colombian fan when he got a gift from nicko.

Now the only down side is the battery last a day and some hours. so your gonna be recharging it a lot even when you dont use it. Then teh volume controls have no way of telling you if you maxed the  volume up or not.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Really enjoyed the suspense and the use of non professional actors from the neighborhood.  The ending is a surprize and has me wondering if the private detective made the right choice.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|WHen I bought this I didnt know how it was gonna be, But I in up enjoying it. Because I love action movies, no matter what their about. It might not been as good as his earlier movies.    But there were parts in the movie I loved.And some that I hated of course.

0758232225|4.0|Practicing What You Preach is an excellent presentation of what happens when a person comes down with a case of Pharisees Fever.  The most prevalent symptom of the disease is a dedication to living by the letter of the law rather than the humanity of it.  Such is the case for Melissa Anderson.    After rededicating her life to Christ, Melissa focuses on her job and her religion.  The problem with this is that her religious mind is overriding common sense.      The book is one that challenges the reader to pull out their own bibles.  Some will call this work preachy, others will find it nourishing.  What I found is that Ms. Davis-Griggs skillfully presents real life conflict while seaming it to the necessity of needing to truly understand the laws that govern your life, but not missing out on life due to constraints of self-imposed rigidity.

0143034901|4.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a captivating and complex mystery set in Barcelona in the mid-20th century.  The story pulls you in immediately, featuring a boy sleuth who is out to unmask the identity of a faceless, book-burning villain.  A haunted house, youthful passions, and a nasty old cop who's bad to the bone all figure prominently in this fast-paced debut whodunnit.<br /><br />The book is easy to like, but not necessarily easy to follow.  Like many mysteries of this ilk, there are numerous characters introduced in the early chapters, with complex and coincidental relationships tying many of them together.  If you're a quick reader, who can breeze through 500-page books in a couple-few days, it may be relatively easy to keep track of everything in your head.  But if you're a bit slower, or only find time to read on weekends, then it may be helpful to jot down a few notes to help sort out the key characters and relationships.  In particular, paying attention to the early passages on Penelope, as well as the introduction of Jorge Aldaya and his schoolboy pals in Chapter 25, will serve you well as you read this enjoyable Spanish mystery.
0517122707|5.0|I don't even know how to begin to describe how fun and unique this book is.  I think you have to be in just the right mood to enjoy it, but whatever it was it was one of the most entertaining experiences I've had in a really long time.  The book is so preposterous, and original, that I have no idea how the author came up with any of it--but I love it.  Initially the main character, a blundering oaf of a man, Ignatius Reilly, is utterly repulsive, but by the end of the book he's somehow won me over and I think he's a true hero of our blighted age.  I love that despite the fact that he's pretentious, self-absorbed, patronizing, obese, and ridiculous that he is completely unrepentant about it.  The book is way ahead of its time and, I suspect, so is Ignatius.  I am a huge fan now.    Busily,  Justice
0307341569|4.0|\\"Dark Places\\" by Gillian Flynn<br /><br />Kinnakee Kansas, 1985; Libby Day is the lone survivor of the brutal murder of her family. Her 2 sisters and her mother were all slain. The prime suspect in the case was her older brother Ben. The crime scene which included satanic words and symbols on the walls written in the victims blood led to Ben being labeled a Satanist and murderer. Libby's testimony which recounted the events of that night was used to put Ben in jail for life.<br /><br />Present day; Libby now 31, has been living off of donations made by well wishers soon after the murders. Libby has never truly gotten over the murders and as a result has never gotten her life together. This is unfortunate for her because her \\"Well wisher money\\" has just run out. An unsuspected business proposition arrives in which Libby can trade information about the murders for cash. Libby has been unable to relive that night but now out of choices she has to go back to that time even if it reveals her condemning testimony wasn't exactly accurate...<br /><br />\\"Dark Places\\" was an interesting read. The story provides 3 perspectives which includes Libby Day current time, Ben Day in 1985 and Patty Day (Libby's mother) 1985. The story unwinds along these perspectives gradually giving the reader more and more information about the murders in 1985 and what led up to them.<br /><br />The Good: Gillian Flynn's writing style was interesting. The story itself and the way the plot developed and expanded were done well. All of the characters were well written and had good depth.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable<br /><br />Overall: Not a bad read. If the story sounds interesting pick it up and give it a try.
B00297FEUS|1.0|There obviously was an error made somewhere along the line.  Either the wrong master was used to press the cd or something.  I find it hard to believe that the mastering engineer would turn over a product like that.  The audio is so low on the disc its crazy, and the recording sounds so muddy.  I am not a fan of today's mastering techniques with heavy compression, limiting and pumping things as loud as it can go, bordering clipping - but this is an extreme in the other direction.   I would pass on picking this one up for now until the issue is resolved.  Its disappointing, i was looking forward to this release for a while.
B00297FEUS|1.0|I bought this cd yesterday and was looking forward to having a remastered version of Stay Hungry.  It is one of my favorite albums ever.  OMG was I disappointed.  What everyone is saying on here is absolutely true.  It sounds BEYOND horrible.  It is so soft.  What is the deal?  How could this happen?  This is a major rip-off.  I am going to Best Buy where I bought it.  I was going to try and get another one thinking maybe I just got a bad copy, but after reading all these reviews, I'm going to tell them about this and see if they'll let me get another cd I want.  I am mad at Twisted Sister for this.  To plaster REMASTERED on the cd and for it to sound this horrible is just a rip-off.  How could they do this to people in this economy.  To spend money on this and for it to sound this bad is bad to do to the fans.  Dee and Twisted Sister......you should be ashamed of yourselves.  And to anyone reading this, whatever you do...DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE RECORDING!!!!!!!    UPDATE:  Hello.  I just wanted to give an update to this post.  I went to Best Buy yesterday and told the girl that the recording was horrible and you can hardly hear it.  I said I was originally going to ask for another one but after reading the reviews here, that I didn't even want another one.  I know usually they just let you exchange a cd for the exact same one.  But I was going to ask if I could return it for a cd by a different artist (one with respect for the fans).  But before I could even get the words out, she was sticking my money back in my hands.  She said \\"Normally we don't do this\\".  I said \\"I know\\".  Then she said \\"YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO COMPLAIN AND RETURN THIS CD.\\"  Isn't it sad how Twisted Sister did this to the fans?  But I am glad people are returning them and getting their money back because Twisted Sister shouldn't make a dime off this garbage recording.  I'm glad I got my money back and I will be using it soon to buy the new live Judas Priest Touch of Evil cd.  I'll say it again: DEE SNIDER YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!    I just want to let people know DO NOT BUY THIS CD!  I got burned and it's not a good feeling (although thanks to Best Buy I got my money back).  I just want to prevent anyone else from getting ripped off.  Thanks.    SECOND WARNING:  To anyone thinking of buying this cd, and then just sending it in if it is bad to Rhino for the replacement, think again.  Rhino is hassling me about sending me a replacement disc.  I bought the cd again and it was the same horrible quality, and now Rhino refuses to send me a replacement.  Twisted Sister is responsible for this mess for having Rhino as their record company in the first place.  If I buy a product from a band and it is bad, I hold the band responsible...PERIOD.  And now Rhino is hassling me about sending the replacement disc that they promised and would supposedly make everything better.  I will never buy a Twisted Sister or Rhino product again.
0374139563|5.0|This brief is searing and straight forward, and sure to upset the status quo and those who believe money solves all problems (you know, the school of thought that says, \\"It's not that we are spending too much, we're spending too little).  The helping class don't like this book - and I find the negative reviews to be mysteriously similar, and make me think they were planted.  Frankly, if Oxfam doesn't like it, it must be good.  Worth reading - and can be done in an evening.
1573300403|5.0|I am so distraught over the death of Michael Jackson...I brought this dvd about three weeks before he died because I just wanted to see his videos.  I am so glad I did! Michael Jackson will be missed!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The DVD's are great and the remastering is done in a subtle manner that only serves to bring the graphics closer to modern day abilities without distracting from the show.  My only complaint is the fact that these discs have both DVD and HDDVD format, increasing the cost for a feature that is now worthless with the death of HDDVD.
B000002KEV|5.0|What can you say the loudest rock and roll band upto that date. Seven great songs, it does not get any better than that. With the exception that I bought them on double 8-track for a $1.50 and worn them out.  Deep Purple has no match they stand alone.
0061231401|4.0|More of the same... and if you're a James Rollins fan (as I am) that's a good thing.  The mystery is intriguing.  The action is non-stop.  The world is in peril.  The characters are the ones you've been reading about it for years if you're a Sigma Force fan.  Bottom line is Doomsday Key is an enjoyable read.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|Judas Priest has really outdone themselves with this two disc epic. I'm reminded of epic tales of old and the haunting melodies of soundtracks like \\"Labryinth\\" or even \\"The Princess Bride.\\" This isn't the metal of \\"AC/DC\\" or \\"Black Sabbath.\\" Instead, this is a much slower paced more thoughtful metal in the vein of \\"Symphony X\\" \\"Dream Theater\\" and 'David Bowie.\\"     I highly recommend this album.
B0017M8XS6|5.0|This just arrived today from Amazon, and I have yet to listen to the first two CD's in the set, but the SACD sounds incredible.

0061767581|5.0|I love Lauren Conrad and i love the Hills, but when i heard that she was writing a book i was like what have they got her into now. I didnt know how it would turn out, even though i love her that type of writing just really isnt the kind of reading material i like. I was hooked by the first few paragraphs and i read it all in a day and a half and i dont read fast. I think that lauren has found what she should have been doing all along and she should continue to do so even after the other two books are publised.    Its a great read for anyone that wants to be on a reality tv show or someone who is thinking about it. Personally i think it is a book that all different ages can appeal too, everyone whether they want to admit it or not want to know what goes on behind the scenes of a show like that. It always ends with a cliffhanger, what is going to happen next kind of feeling which is always good.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I searched high and low for a good deal on the first six Star Trek movies. Those are the ones featuring the original crew.  This package of seven Blu-Ray mastered versions was by far the best deal available. Not only was the price great, the seventh disk containing interviews with the captains and first officers was outstanding.
B001TH16DI|4.0|First two movies look remarkable in blu, but the rest either suffer from soft images or over-saturated contrast.  Kinda annoying that all the movies dont look as good as st 1 and 2, but the set is great and Im proud to own the star trek movies on blu!  All of these, from what Im told, are the best possible in sound and video quality of all time on home video for these movies.  I can see why, despite st 3-6 not being as great a pic and sound as one would hope for on blu, they all still look remarkable and well worth the $75 i paid for them brand new :)
B000Q6GUW0|1.0|first off, this is a review for the series as a whole and not just the first season. I HATE THIS SHOW!!!  I can't begin to fathom how this show ended up on a premium channel like showtime when it clearly belongs sandwiched between House, NCIS, Monk, or Burn Notice or any other of the god awful shows that the USA network craps out when it isn't busy regurgitating reruns of Law and Order.  \\"Characters Welcome,\\" this network bosts, while it should be adding to its slogun \\"Quirky Annoying Characters For A Not-so-Funny, Kinda Dark, Police-based, Comedy/Drama are Welcomed With Open Arms To Our Shamelessly Lame Network.\\" that may be a little long though.  as far as dexter goes, the character is a new feeble attempt at rejuvinating the tired serial killer genre by making it so the killer is actually a forensic blood specialist with a painfully abnoxious habbit of letting the viewers listen to his oh so typical dark, brooding inner  monologue such as \\"I have no emotions. I'm so mysterious. I don't consider myself human. Even though I care about the well-being of other characters i still stick to the story that I have no emotions.\\"  the supporting characters are so carefully cookie cut into their little quirks and isms that makes watching a man perform oral sex on a house cat seem more appealing.  i will never understand how this show landed on showtime, a channel that pays the program creators themselves for their work rather than depend on advertizing for its program creators to make a living.  don't get me wrong, i absolutely love many other shows on both HBO and showtime.  i love the Sopranos, Deadwood, Rome, Big Love, Oz, The Wire, Curb Your Enthusiasm... I love Brotherhood, Californication, the Tudors, Weeds... dexter, however, has no right to compete with shows like these.  the show's title character is a complete coward becouse he needs to sedate and restrain is victims before killing them by means of nothing more original than a slit throat.  seriel killers like patrick bateman from American Psycho and Hannibal Lecter from his character's books and films are more respectable because they are physically dangerous and kill without the use of restraints.  this is why i see dexter as a completely cowardly, unoriginal character.  for your own preservation of taste, please stay away from this garbage.      p.s. hey USA network, i liked you better when all you had to offer was re-runs of Walker Texas Ranger and Jag.

B0029LHWHM|5.0|I had been teetering on the edge of atheism for a long time and had suddenly come to the only conclusion that I could...I really was an atheist...a very hard thing to admit to oneself. That being said, I came across this book and wanted to see what Dawkins had to say. He made some murky issues very clear but what struck me most about all the topics in the book was the sad ongoing  practice of indoctrination of (fill in the blank) religious dogma to vulnerable children. When another religion does it it is called brainwashing, when someone's own religion does it it is for the good of their god. How sad...most children never have a chance to think for themselves. Anyway, a good read.

B0026J8LHM|3.0|I was worried that DT had jumped the shark with [[ASIN:B000PTYP5C Systematic Chaos]] and it appears I was right. This album is at best mediocre. It seems they've abandoned all attempts to be a progressive rock band, and are now squarely in the camp of \\"yell at the microphone as loud as I can\\" modern metal music, although with more instrumentality than most. After having given this album a full listen, it is the first DT album I will not be purchasing since [[ASIN:B000002JPA Images and Words]]. I rank two DT albums amongst my top 10 albums of all time ([[ASIN:B000021XS0 Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory]] and [[ASIN:B00005HDTM Awake]]), and not everything they can do can possibly be to that standard. But this is just plain bad. I give it 3 stars because it's DT, but I weep for what DT has become.
0553103547|2.0|I read this book with much anticipation because I read and heard so many great reviews.  Very disappointed. I agree that the book is rich and very well written.

B000000OE7|5.0|when i read a new queen album was coming out featuring freddies final recordings,i was the 1st in my area to buy it!?!<br />i would disagree with neoninfusion on its sound. it was a mix of new and 80's styles beautifully engineered to give the freddie fan a taste of his ranges on many levels.<br />the opening song \\"it's a beautiful day\\"with its first verse sung acapella,was freddie as we remember him.strong high pitched,and screaming at us to enjoy every day,as they are all a blessing and a wonder.<br />from the first song through the fourth it almost sounds as if freddie is begging for another chance.\\"let me live \\",with roger and brian joining him,trading singing verses,and the choir,makes for a powerful song.\\"mother love\\" is a freddie looking back to when times were easier and he was comforted by the warmth of the womb.it is a haunting and eerie song,that i can not recollect ever hearing anything similar in their past,save for maybe queen 2.<br />then the music becomes 80's queen,upbeat,fast paced,and visions of past videos.<br />brian may recorded \\"too much love will kill you\\" on his solo album in 1985,but was not sung by freddie,but by brian.they do have similar pitch.<br />the most amazing song on this album is \\"a winters tale\\",absolutely the prettiest song,and if you close your eyes and listen to the lyrics ,you will fly like the geese,and ducks he tells us about.a fairy tale told in front of a fireplace ,only sung gorgeously.<br />this is a freddie album with great influence from his band mates,who unselfishly took painstaking efforts to honor their leader.<br />this is one of my favorite releases ever by the band,and it could be yours too..........SIMPLY AWESOME.......
B001XJEKGC|4.0|this dvd is so good that after I had purchased the album I had to see the video,and it did not let me down. The interviews were insightful and etertaining sa well.there was only one song that I did not like and that is track # 12, steve's voice didn't lend well to that one.

1595141715|5.0|Teen Clay Jenson is still reeling from his friend, Hannah's suicide when he receives thirteen tapes Hannah made before she died. The messages are going to be mailed to all thirteen people and each will have to listen to the part he or she had in Hannah's final, devastating decision. Without giving away the plot, Clay agonizes, as he begins to listen to the tapes in the required sequence, about what responsibility he holds for Hannah's untimely demise. This book raises so many questions but also should be mandatory reading for high school students.<br /><br />Hannah's haunting words implicate those who started vicious rumors that perpetuated a stereotypical attitude toward Hannah in her final days. Just as potently are the accounts of events in which people traumatized her life based on those rumors or failed to speak in circumstances, words that might have healed rather than added to the expanded versions of the rumors. One person is given credit for being honest, straight and faithful in the face of so much petty and overwhelming meanness and lack of sensitivity. The culpability, for the most part, is leveled at every other person and gradually increases the reader's sense of dread at what is obviously going to turn into a horrific disaster.<br /><br />Jay Asher is a very talented writer who has chosen audiotapes as his venue for such a dire issue. While there is not much of a counter-balancing point of view as to how Hannah was processing this awful last year of her life, the message within each account and its implications are potent, poignant material that could provide much grist for group discussions that just might save one (or many more, probably) more young adult life.<br /><br />Excellent, timeless, plot-driven and wise novel, Jay Asher! Read it and think a great deal before you speak to a teen who appears to be just \\"fine.\\"<br /><br />Reviewed by Viviane Crystal on July 1, 2009

1400063515|4.0|In my opinion, of all the characteristics that define economic activity, connection is the most important. Institutions considered \\"too big to fail\\" are in reality \\"too connected to fail.\\" The web of interdependencies that girdles the globe, linking the boardrooms of Wall Street to the kitchen tables of Main Street, can be the economic system's greatest vulnerability - as Nassim Taleb argues in The Black Swan - or its greatest strength. Job No. 1 for leaders of the world's financial institutions and market-regulating bodies is to design the architecture of systemic connection to assure strength.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|After renting the first disc of the John Adams series, my husband and I were hooked! We decided to go ahead and purchase the series and compared to the nearly $70 at Best Buy, purchasing it from Amazon was a no-brainer. Shipping was extremely reasonable and faster than I expected. I love the fact that Amazon uses USPS for shipping.  The series itself, is very informational and gives you an excellent look at what John Adam's life was like and is much better than the history book glimpses.   Overall, this was a joy and Amazon continues to make a customer out of me.
0307266303|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, it has so much in it and I wanted it to go on further. There's the story of the race and of the Tarahumara and the ultra world but there's so much more. Somehow the author weaves a story that has suspense, inspiration and human evolution into a great human story that should inspire anyone who reads it to go for a run and be a better person.
B001AMVN3U|5.0|I've got to say that I am not compelled to buy a lot of CDs. I usually pick and choose only the tracks I like and get them through services like amazon. I heard a friend's copy, and I didn't like it at first. However, I wanted to listen to it again, and it grew on me. Now, I love it.     Here's something I can't say about a lot of albums: I listen to ALL of the tracks. It's amazing for me to like half of an album's tracks, but the whole disc is amazing. I have done this probably with more Offspring albums than any other band.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I really, really disliked this book. Unlike \\"Dark Places\\", which was an unbelievable murder mystery, this was just not entertaining. It was difficult to be in the heroine's corner, there wasn't a single likable character, the ending was depressing. No good. \\"Dark Places\\" had a very flawed main character but you were rooting for her. It had a sense of humor and was such an unbelievable page-turner. This book? I couldn't wait until it was over. Such a disappointment. And I say this as someone who loves murder and horror stories.
6304711891|5.0|This movie is so awesome I have trouble even saying it. One of the best action movies I've ever seen. Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage infiltrate Alcatraz as the whole city of San Francisco is taken hostage by Ed Harris and his group of mercenaries. Oh, and did I mention it has just about the greatest film score ever made as well? Go see at once. Highly recommended*****
B0027MJU00|5.0|Title for my review says it all. I couldn't put this book down. The main character is deeply flawed but you're rooting for her all the same. It was deep and dark but had a real sense of humor at the same time. Incredibly well written, well thought out. Not crazy about who did it, but the characters were so rich and layered it didn't matter. A+. Wish her other book was as good.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of some of the very best of Whitney Houston and includes my favorite,\\" I Have Nothing \\". This CD is truly a crowd pleaser with hit after great hit. It is truly a must buy for any fan of this talented Diva.
0452287022|4.0|The unabridged audiobook had it's good and bad points.  The bad points being the depiction of all men in the book being cruel and/or selfish, and basically unaware and unconcerned of the feelings and dignity of a woman.  Every major male character abused Griet in some way.  Vermeer, by causing her pain, physical and emotional, the future husband, by illicit sex, the patron, by groping and fondling her.  The good points were - showing the total obliviousness artists and creative people have towards their surroundings, and the people around them, when deep in the creative process.  The other good point was:  showing the main character, Griet, to be tough, and to get past disappointments, and on with her life.

1416562605|1.0|there is no valid reason for the protagonist to kill his master, which is the high point of the fiction. he could have just stolen the money and disappeared. killing him just didn't further his goal. that's totally illogical and makes the work lame. for good stories set in the reality of india, slumdog and six suspects are much more entertaining with no sacrifice in depth.[[ASIN:031260503X Six Suspects: A Novel]]
B002CMLIJ6|5.0|I have seen this movie four times.  I haven't seen the other X-Men movies or read the comic books so I can't rate it on authenticity.  All I can say is OH MY GOD! Logan, Gambit, and Dead Pool are sooooooo hot it's scary.  Girls, don't miss this one! And it even has a great plot!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I really am disgusted with the Oscars for not being able to recognize a film like this or Valkerie in the same year. Unbelievable. Clint Eastwood's perfect film. It brings all the toughness, tenderness, suspense, and humanity of any of his other films and crystalizes them into a work of art everybody should see.
0307346617|3.0|While I wanted to love this book, I could only like it.  While the author is realistic in most aspects in the book, he removes the logic of biological processes when it comes to the zombies.  How can a zombie moan, unless it breathes, and thus has air to pass over its vocal cords?  How can a zombie survive unless its heart is pumping blood through its veins to supply its cells with nutrients and oxygen.      Otherwise this is a story of magic zombies, that can do anything.      The discord between the rest of the novel's realistic real world as  compared to \\"do anything\\" zombies just did not work for me.
B000QCS9NM|2.0|I saw Fight Club the movie, so I thought this guy might have some good books.  I went to get his latest \\"Pygmy\\", but a reviewer suggested if one hadn't read any of his books to not start with it because it was written in broken english for effect. ok, so I get choke, it looked interesting enough.  And for some parts it is but he beats the sex to death and the filth.  `like some adolescent being dirty just to be dirty. yuk
1400158648|5.0|This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\". I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.<br /><br />Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).<br /><br />If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)<br />The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.<br /><br />In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again.<br /><br />[[ASIN:014043268X The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches (Penguin Classics)]]
B00297FEUS|4.0|I am a HUGE Twisted Sister fan, and ws more than excited to hear they were remastering Stay Hungry.  I have always felt that cd was missing something, it never sounded as heavy as they do in concert, or some of the other cd's do...in fact I will go so far as becasue of the bad mix job, the original Stay Hungry may be on the bottom of my list of favorite Twisted cd's.  I bought this yesterday and I am very happy with what I am hearing.  I think it sounds alot louder, alot crisper than the original.  Certain songs, like The Price and the classic Were Not Gonna Take It sound great, alot better than the original cd. I am not sure why this is getting such bad reviews...    As far as disc 2, after quick listen it isnt all that great, the demo for Burn In Hell is AWESOME...and the new song 30 is great also. As for the rest it is alot of hit and miss...with the emphisis on miss.    If your a fan of the CD, I can also recomend STILL HUNGRY, released maybe 3 years ago, it is updated version of STAY HUNGRY performed by the band, sounding very loud and very heavy...and the extra songs on that CD blow these out of the water.
B001PL4HZW|5.0|I am not usually a fan of movie soundtracks but this is a very very good one, I never take it out of my cd player.
B00004VVND|5.0|This is one of the better movies.(science fiction)I have seen it several times and enjoyed each time.
B001TODCII|5.0|The premise of a kidnapped child rescued by an incredibly skilled father has become something of a film genre over the past three decades, with the parent usually portrayed by an action movie icon (Bruce Willis, Charles Bronson, John Wayne, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example). The latest addition to the category, \\"Taken\\", treads on familiar ground, but succeeds in breathing fresh life into the concept through the unusual casting of Liam Neeson as a retired special ops agent; eschewing glamor for gritty determination, Neeson is so good that the film becomes a homage to not only the genre, but to a father's devotion to his child in an increasingly dangerous world.<br /><br />Neeson is clearly a dinosaur, not only among the flashy, media-savvy operatives of the intelligence community, but as a parent, as well; his over-protectiveness of his daughter is scoffed at by his ex-wife (Famke Janssen), and his ongoing surveillance has a nearly creepy quality. Yet when his instructions are ignored, and his daughter is abducted by a white slavery ring in France, Neeson quickly proves himself to be their worst nightmare, a relentless, unforgiving adversary.<br /><br />While a legitimate argument can be made that the story's resolution is too 'sugar-coated' and pat, it does provide an optimism that is too often lacking in recent films, and I enjoyed it...<br /><br />\\"Taken\\" is a terrific suspense film, and certainly worth owning, especially if you're a Liam Neeson fan!
031606792X|5.0|Wow!  Excellent conclusion to the series!  Stephanie Meyer is brilliant author who makes you feel everything the characters feel - you will be holding your breath everytime Bella does!  And don't mistake this for a dark, gothic, vampire series - this is definately a fairy tale!  And the best one I've ever read!
B0009X766Y|5.0|I've been looking for a copy of this movie for ages, and the remastered 5.1 audio and 16:9 presentation really did it for me. I've always loved this movie, and this was better than I could have hoped.

B0019LY5IM|2.0|I loved the first four seasons.  Lost was always interesting (or at least when it occassionally ran off track it would JOLT you back into caring).  But once it started into the time-traveling, everything just started spiraling out of control.  Once you bring time travel in, then nothing matters any more.  Anything is possible and so everything becomes immediately uninteresting.    There was really nothing I found very interesting or exciting about the entire season.  Nothing until Sayid shot young Ben.  I was shocked and entertained at that...for about 30 seconds...before I said to myself \\"...wait, wait...he BETTER have actually died!\\"  Of course he didn't, even though, of all people, Sayid should have been able to stop that kid's heart from beating.  So even the one thing that could have been the \\"Oh my god!\\", season-making moment (think Locke being thrown out the building), didn't happen.  It was just smoke and mirrors.    So much of the season was just time-traveling around randomly so we could have nostalgic looks down memory lane.  For example, Jin meeting a young Rousseau...for no reason, et.al.    Then we've got the ridiculous, contrived relationship between Sawyer and Juliet.  Is ANYONE actually buying this?  Totally, totally lame.    And now Locke is a reincarnated ancient god, who just killed another god.  Or not.  Or something.    And oh my god!  Juliet just sacrificed herself!  Or maybe not.  So who cares any more.    Who.  Cares.  I watched this show for 5 years under the assumption that there would be a huge pay-off at the end, justifying my investment in all the mysteries and so on.  Now it would make as much sense for E.T. and Harry Potter to show up in the final season.    When the 6th ends...the Internet is going to be a damn firestorm of hate.  Guaranteed.  Well, Im glad I'll be one of the few able to laugh at the whole mess.
B000002J6F|5.0|I've often said that this is the best band Steve Stils ever played in and I still believe that now.  It is one very tight and practiced group and the songs just jump out of the speakers. The four sides of this album, diverse as they are, hold together as a whole more perfect than the parts and yet each side stands on its own.  It rocks - no doubt - but also provides a perfect vehicle for Stills voice on the softer and more thoughtful pieces with the pitch pefect harmonies with Chris Hillman.  This is a timeless record that stands up well and I still listen to it all the time.  A can't miss addition to any collection.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|When I heard their REMISSION album, I wasn't impressed. I began to dismiss them and ignored them. After hearing CRACK THE SKYE, this was a total 360 degree turn around. This is perhaps one of the best albums coming out of the USA in some time.    This album is pretty dense and thick wall of progressive genius. Excellent production and some good solos.    I am not much for words but after 30 years of listening experience, all I can say is that this is very impressive and should be checked out by anyone who enjoys intelligent, heavy, and loud music.

B0017V7GTY|1.0|None of the songs except for \\"Here's Looking at You, Kid\\" stand out and the songs on most of the album sound alike.  It doesn't help that the lead singer has the same tone on each song with a lack of range or emotion in his voice.  I'm disappointed after hearing all of the hype and positive reviews.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|I loved this movie although it was quite a roller coaster to watch, keeping you on the edge of you seat from start to finish, taking you from the lowest of the lows (when the father realizes they were homeless) to the highest of highs in the pursuit of happy-ness. It's not a date movie, rather one to watch at home with tissues close by.    Don't miss the bonus features - an interesting mini-documentary about the real Chris Gardner, who was actually on the set almost full time as an advisor; an in-depth view at how the movie was made by a foreign director who spoke very little English; the father-son relationship, on an off the set, and how Jayden was cast (yes, he was the best kid for the role out of hundreds who auditioned); and the Rubik cube, how it was invented and top \\"speedcubers\\" solving the puzzle in less than 30 seconds (the record was 30 minutes in 1981 when the movie was set), and an unbelievable bit where a guy solves it blindfolded in two minutes flat.     Will Smith's son is fantastic in this movie, but it's definitely not for children - some scenes might be too dramatic and may be difficult to explain to younger ones.     In short, simply a great story of a father's love for his child, perseverance and triumph against the odds.
B0029XZODY|2.0|The one thing I notice is that 'negative' reviews are not looked highly upon, especially shows with a following.<br /><br />And another thing about rating this. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be rating the product (blu-ray dvd), or I'm rating this season of the show.<br /><br />More specifically I am rating this show's season.<br />I am a huge fan of this show, but i felt this season was VERY sloppy. Very underdeveloped ideas, sub-par drama, followed by lousy resolution and following action.<br /><br />Compared to the first 2 seasons, it seemed like this season was a collection of random ideas they joined together that were rejects of the other seasons.<br /><br />The Shows acting was great, and the first 3-4 episodes were good/great. It led to some mystery and developing drama... But just became unfocused, and seemed like... the person who originally was writing the plot died and let some random person just try to finish it.<br /><br />Great Show, i love it, I just hope the next season redeems the show.
0765342294|5.0|Ender's Game is the one sci fi book I can hand to anyone and know they will love. The book combines many story elements and themes to develop a complicated young boy who faces the worlds challenges. It is a fun fast read, that I love to pick up and read again and again. As you learn more about ender and the other characters in the ender-verse you can more deeply appreciate the boys losses and wins and the emotions he goes through while getting there.

0307460444|5.0|As with all Martha Stewart's compilations, this is a collection of preexisting favourites.  New recipes are usually reserved for her magazines and periodicals, so you can be sure that these are some of her most popular and proven recipes.<br /><br />This book is also the perfect size, not too thick, not too thin, not too light and not too heavy.  It has a generous 170+ recipes, each with Martha's signature photography.  The recipes are not complicated but are also not overly simplified and most importantly the results taste and look good!  A very beautiful book that is excellent for gift-giving. I also love that this book is about cupcakes and not \\"cutesy\\" cupcakes, although there is a separate section on decorating styles.<br /><br />A cupcake seems to be a very North American thing and visiting friends, family and clients from Europe often ask about American desserts such as brownies, anything peanut butter and especially the cupcake. Even the snobby, elitist Viennese girlfriend of an Austrian buddy loved American cupcakes, and actually asked to be taken around to several cupcake boutiques around town.  I made them the red velvet cupcake for their plane ride back to Austria as a sweet reminder of their visit and they were the envy of the other passengers.<br /><br />I have made several of these recipes and each time they have been a hit both with friends from home and abroad. I just emailed the Meyer Lemon Cupcake recipe over to England for a friend's wedding and she is considering this book as a wedding favour.<br /><br />I also now know what to give my family, friends and clients as a souvenir of their visit.
B001P9KR8U|2.0|Another example of an over hyped movie. Not terribly original.  I found myself bored most of the time. Certainly not worthy of any Oscars for film or acting.
0307341569|4.0|I found this book to be fast paced and very engaging, much better than her first book. I had a hard time putting it down. Most reviewers seem to believe that the main character, Libby, is mean, yet I sensed more of immaturity than meanness,  never quite having finished growing up after suffering such trauma. Not to mention that she is extremely depressed, and doesn't know how to handle her emotions or even do some of the most basic day to day activities. I actually liked her character and thought that she was interesting. I enjoyed the way the plot was constructed, being told in the present day by Libby and the day of the murders by her mother and brother. I found most of the characters quite believable (another thing that other reviewers had trouble with apparently). I particularly liked reading the mother's viewpoint.      As for the ending, I can understand that some reviewers say that they could predict it early on (as I did as well) or that it relied too much on coincidences, which (IMO) doesn't mean that it is unbelievable. Either way, I couldn't wait to finish the story and I was sad when I did.  The characters will remain in my thoughts for a while now. I highly recommend it. Just one more thing, there is a very graphic description of animal abuse, but it is easily skipped over if need be.
0756405890|5.0|It took a few pages for me to get into the book, taking days to get back to it to read it even. I finished Book 1 soon enough and was dismayed that Book 2 is not yet published. I looked up the author's website. It stated that his parents taught him to read and to build. And that was my impression of his book as a whole - a very sturdy building block for the trilogy, and the block itself made of a series of heavy building blocks built slowly but surely, one at a time, solid and heavy (unmoving in the wind, certainly), but each of them interesting and giving a new facet to the block as a whole. Each new thing you learn about the character, each new chapter that introduces another event to Kvothe's life, occupies a good portion of your attention prior to moving on to the next chapter. It's a bit difficult for me to explain except using this visual image - very different from the impression I got from books like \\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell,\\" where you found yourself flitting through fantasies like a dancer, just floating in and out of fantastic stories, confused about which part reality stays. I am eagerly waiting for Book 2 to come out, to find out what happens to our Kvothe in present and Kvothe from the past. As a side note, I should never get a book in a trilogy when the remaining parts remain unpublished. The wait will just about kill me.

0670020745|4.0|My violin teacher sent me a link to a YouTube video of Dr. Taylor. I pretty much had to get the book to learn the end to end story.    Weaving immediate perception of stroke, academic knowledge of the physical event, personal perception of a lengthy recovery and appreciation of losses and gains, Dr. Taylor tells a compelling story of love and support from her mother  and a story of unfolding beauty. How many of us would have such a steadfast partner in recovery, or find the beauty in the experience and aftermath. All in a very accessible read! Bravo!!
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Major Spoilers in this review! Beware!    Although I enjoyed this movie and give it 4 stars. I can come up with all the other stories and movies this one movie copies from.     1. The Fog (Obviously)  2. Curse of the Demon (Creature from another dimension) (Dana Andrews)  3. Any Outer Limits episode that deals with creatures from other dimensions.  4. The Illustrated Man (yes, it's hard to believe, but in this movie, Rod Steiger finds that the world is going to end and decides to kill his family before this happens. He survives, but the next morning when the world should have been destroyed, it isn't, but his family is dead by his hands.)    Overall, The Mist is still a good movie despite that it's doesn't really tread new ground, but it's enjoyable.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Sorry, I disagree with most reviews on this  cd, maybe b/c of my age my hearing isn't as accute as it once was (same age as Bruce) , but I think this is better than \\"Working On A Dream\\". Bruce has that hardcore edge on this one and the Big Man on sax is great! This is Bruce rocking and I'm sorry I missed this tour, b/c it would have been a high energy, fist pumping production. The ballads on this are also good.  I kinda wandered away from Bruce after Born in the USA tour. This cd renewed my interest . Don't get me wrong I was into earlier Boss sounds , not just the commercial stuff.                                       chad in VA.

It was definitely an escapist novel, and I read it quickly because it was hard to put down.  I didn't like Devil Wears Prada at all, so this was a welcome treat.
B000CNESU8|5.0|What an interesting and provocative movie. Reinforcing my belief that best movies were made in the 1970's (before my day so I am not writing out of nostalgia). In order not to spoil I will be vague. The last five minutes seems rushed and ill contrived but I suppose if you let yourself go with it, its fine then. The writer could of spent another few more minutes building up to the end scene and involving less people in the cabal to make it more realistic. This movie is so finely done I cant believe that it is not adapted from a novel. It has so much depth in both plot and characterization that a puny screenplay couldn't hold all the subtext and character's motivations. A superb example of satire, without the preaching.
0743455967|5.0|The advice and insight provided in this book is invaluable. EVERY aspiring writer should read it. I've even bookmarked certain pages to refer back to while I finish up my manuscript. Glad I bought it!    P.S. This would make a great gift for someone interested in becoming an author.
B0027G783W|5.0|It's been a long time since Moby released \\"Play,\\" the subdued mix of gospel and dance music which made him a superstar.<br /><br />Moby's newest album, \\"Wait for Me,\\" is a glorious return back to subdued strings, bass and dance, but with a much more soothing tone.<br /><br />If \\"Play\\" was a celebration of the zest of life and love, \\"Wait for Me\\" is a calm reflection on life, love and beauty itself. It's slower and slightly more melancholy than \\"Play\\" ever was, but it sounds so relaxing. And it is one of his absolute best.<br /><br />To give an example of how serene the album gets, the song featuring the scratchy vocals of a female singer in \\"Walk With Me\\" sounds as depressing as Beck's slowest depressing album \\"Sea Change.\\" With the vocalist singing, \\"All I know is this journey, won't you let me sleep,\\" it's clear that Moby is emotionally down in this song. But unlike Beck, Moby's melancholy is a warm caress, filled with comforting strings which enrapture listeners.<br /><br />Even though Moby sings with more fear than we've ever heard before in the song \\"Mistake,\\" there's a wonderful gentleness in the silky smooth strings, the thumping bass drum and the rich chords of the guitars. So while he may be singing, \\"Oh you've never felt this lost before/The whole world is closing doors/I never wanted anything more,\\" the music is a heartfelt Debussy-like mix of trance and ambience.<br /><br />Probably the most beautiful song, however, is \\"Jtlf,\\" which is rich with acoustic guitars, heavenly synth string orchestrations, beautiful harp-like sounds and the soothing, wonderful voice of a female singer.<br /><br />Moby says this album was inspired by a speech given by David Lynch about creativity. He says that in \\"Wait for Me,\\" he focused more on making something he loved, without any concern about its marketability. But even if he didn't concentrate on the marketability of \\"Wait for Me,\\" it still sounds wonderfully beautiful. There nothing more effervescent than the beautiful sounds of the chorus in \\"A Seated Night,\\" or the lovely loop of a minimalist keyboard as a gorgeous female sings over it in the title track, \\"Wait for Me.\\"<br /><br />Although there is a \\"Play\\"-styled track with a gospel preacher, titled \\"Study War,\\" there aren't as many upbeat, preachy gospel tracks. It sounds like a subdued, but syrupy mix of trance, ambient music and African-American gospel. And although it isn't as dance-heavy as his previous brilliant album, \\"Last Night,\\" the new album reaches a serene level of excellence that we haven't heard from Moby in a long time.<br /><br />This is a definite must-buy for any techno fan. Even those people who aren't into techno will certainly have to take a gander at this reflective mix of tranquility.lovely loop of a minimalist keyboard as a gorgeous female sings over it in the title track, \\"Wait for Me.\\"    Although there is a \\"Play\\"-styled track with a gospel preacher, titled \\"Study War,\\" there aren't as many upbeat, preachy gospel tracks.

B00164GDD2|3.0|It's worth saying \\"I LOVE THIS FILM!\\" for context.    The Blu-Ray transfer, though, is quite disappointing.  All in all, for a movie of that's actually newer than Blade Runner or The Empire Strikes Back, the quality is way lower than one would expect.       Interestingly, the worst grain problems are in the introductory scenes in the public library, and the one \\"the dead are rising?\\" scene, which is just terribly grainy.  After the library, the quality gets somewhat better, but as noted above, it simply falls short of what one should expect from a high-budget blockbuster from that era.
1400063515|5.0|The title of the book comes from the observations of Europeans that all swans are white. Much to their surprise, they came to Australia and found their first black swan. The book starts with this story to illustrate the \\"limitations to our learning from observations or experience and the fragility of our knowledge.\\" As Taleb points out, it very different to think there is evidence of no possible black swans, than there is no evidence of the possibility of black swans.<br /><br />Taleb has received lots of press and admirers given the recent meltdown in the financial markets. The book was published in 2007. Taleb seems to have perceived the coming collapse (and probably got a rich financial reward based on his strategy).<br /><br />His supreme self-confidence (arrogance) shines brightly through in his writing. He has little time for shallow thinking and those who think they understand risk or the financial markets.<br /><br />Another example running through the book is the first 1,001 days of a turkey's life. For a 1,000 days the farmer brings food to the turkey every morning. On that last day, things change dramatically. The farmer shows up with an axe instead of food. A surprise and horrible change in circumstance for the turkey. But all the historical evidence for the turkey indicated that the farmer would show up with food and not an axe. Of course, on the flip side, the farmer saw the axe day coming.<br /><br />As Yogi Berra philosophized: \\"It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.\\"<br /><br />It is the unknown unknown that is most dangerous. We spend too much time focusing on knowing what we know. We need to spend focusing some energy in realizing what we do not know and what we do not know what we do not know.<br /><br />As a compliance and risk professional I was particularly intrigued by the story of the four largest losses by casinos. As you might expect, casinos run very thorough security programs, compliance programs and risk management programs. The four largest losses fell completely outside the casinos' models. One was the white tiger's attack on Roy, the second was a disgruntled contractor who attempted to dynamite the casino, the third was the kidnapped daughter of a casino owner, and the fourth an incompetent employee who failed to file the 1099 reports with the Internal Revenue Service.<br /><br />It is also important to draw the distinction between positive contingencies and negative contingencies. The black swan can be one that brings unexpected destruction or one that brings an unexpected windfall. His philosophy is to play it safe, but hedge for a disastrous losses and spectacular windfalls. Mitigate the unexpected consequences.<br /><br />I expected to get a lot of insight from the book.

0440236304|5.0|I'd meant to skip this one, thinking that `Seven Roads' might stand as representative of all Burgett's books but then my mum found this for me at a church fete, so here it is after all. I'm glad too as this is a war account in every respect. A lot of men die and Burgett is very lucky to avoid death in training and in battle. I think of it like this. If you have a thousand men, split into groups of ten, each of whom draw straws to select a winner. Then you take all the winners, regroup them and put them through the same process and then put the new winners through again, you get a sense of how Burgett survived. Also as fantasy writer David Gemmell wrote, among all warriors there are princes (in terms of their skill/luck etc), and then amongst the princes there are kings. To me men like Burgett were a bit like this. Men who were lucky but who also made there own luck by being quicker and more deadly than their enemies. He himself is astonished at how he continued to survive when so many others died.    This is Burgett's first book and it covers his training as well as his fighting in Normandy. Maybe it's partly to do with the 1960s layout but at times this seemed more like a lurid fictional work than a memoir, something like a Commando comic or an episode of `Combat'. Again authenticity doesn't seem in question. Perhaps it's because this book was published in the 60s, it reflects the war writing styles of the day. I recall reading that Webster's book was knocked back by many publishers as they were seeking more sensational, fictional type war accounts. Perhaps these influenced Burgett. Perhaps it's also to do with the fact that Burgett simply killed a lot of Germans. He was in an especially target rich environment but no one else has written of so many specific instances. Indeed, taking into account an episode where he is temporary on a machine gun, I think he surpasses James Megallas  in total `kills'- and that's just in this one battle! He doesn't reflect too much on this though. He really is a hard man in this respect. His training and hunting experience simply makes him a very deadly soldier indeed.    There are quite a few jaw-drop moments too. The one where he sought, though ultimately was dissuaded by intense machine gun fire, a unique and particularly ghoulish souvenir was almost unbelievable. There is another, where several dozen prisoners are forced to march up a road to discourage German machine gunners from firing is also very jarring. For several reasons, I'd almost be inclined not to believe it, except Burgett has seeming established his bona-fides. Aside from his ongoing naming of the others who were with him, several of his experiences have been quoted in other books on the battle, for instance, the one with the two Germans horribly injured by artillery fire. On this, there are several very graphic descriptions of battle injuries that are quite astonishing. These are the sort of things people want to forget but as Burgett himself writes - how could you? Burgett has an eye for such things and his descriptions are vivid and blunt and not for the faint hearted.    This is more war book than memoir if that makes any sense. Bizarrely, having been on the hunt for an account that really lets go in terms of killing, now I've found one, it's left me a bit squeamish. I have only praise for the author's candour however. In terms of explicit combat this book is on a par with Sledge's `With the Old Breed'. Very highly recommended.
B001PA0FFO|2.0|The movie was just ok. It apparently received nominations for awards but I have to admit that I caught myself yawning a few times during the movie.
0679745203|4.0|An odd tale of four wounded persons meeting in an Italian villa.  One, the novel's namesake, is burned beyond recognition.  His companion is a nurse who has lost a father and too many young soldiers to count.  They are soon joined by a disfigured spy/thief and a misfit and outcast Indian sapper.  These four negotiate interpersonal relationships and the meaning of identity in a devastated, but new, world.  Strange and quiet, but entrancing with unforgettable characters.
B00196XXPI|4.0|I wish I read French so I could read the original writing.  However, you can still tell Francoise Sagan is a great writer even with the English edition of her works.
B001M4YZ90|3.0|An interesting cast was assembled to tackle a twist-filled script, directed by a craftsman experience in the genre of everyday mobsters in modern day London.  Every editing trick in the book was used.  Clever camera work was deployed.  A pulsing soundtrack provided a burst of extra energy.  Yet in the end, ROCK N ROLLA is a whole lot of elements that look like they should be something resulting in a movie that is less than the sum of those parts.    Guy Ritchie doesn't really seem capable of directing a thoroughly engaging, focused film anymore.  ROCK N ROLLA has a fairly complex plot, full of deceptions and back-stabbing...yet we follow it easily due to constant narration.  I don't mind narration...but what it does for this film is take the place of tight filmmaking.  We're too often being TOLD what's happening and what it means rather than experiencing and learning for ourselves.  It feels like Ritchie is just repeating himself here, copying ideas that have worked for him before, and throwing them into a blender with some narration.    I won't attempt to rehash much of the plot here, but much of it revolves around London mobster Tom Wilkinson trying to work with incoming Russian mobster Karel Roden.  Roden wants to pay Wilkinson the agree-upon sum of $7 million to smooth the way for building permits...but the money keeps getting stolen.  The actual thefts are executed by some lower level thugs (Gerard Butler & Idris Elba), but are planned by Roden's deceitful accountant (Thandie Newton).  In addition, Wilkinson's got a rock-star stepson named Johnny Quid, who has stolen a valuable painting that needs to be returned by Wilkinson to Roden.  And so on.  Mark Strong plays Archie, Wilkinson's right-hand man and our narrator.  Strong's narration attempts to tie everything together for us, but as I said, being led by the hand SO much takes away some of the joy of discovery.    There are actually several enjoyable performances in this film.  It's nice to see Wilkinson asa Brit, and he tears into his role with great gusto.  He shows the much younger cast members a thing or two about commanding a scene.  I enjoyed Strong as well...he's a very interesting looking actor, and he gives a very tight, contained performance, which serves as a good contrast to all the blustery work everyone else is doing.  Gerard Butler and Idris Elba are very amiable indeed, but aren't given a lot to do. I can see these two starring in a movie together and making a nice impact on an audience.  This is NOT the film for that...and if you're watching it to see Butler, who is so heavily featured on the DVD box and in the trailers...be aware that his part is not all that big.      On the other hand, Thandie Newton once again manages to be supremely annoying.  While not quite reaching the depths of  her performance in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE II...she just doesn't carry any heft or credibility.  She's supposed to be a cool customer who likes danger and living on the edge...but she mostly just gets the cool part down.  Standing around in tight dresses and smoking a cigarette does not a convincing performance make!  Also poorly used are Jeremy Piven and Chris Bridges as a couple of American club owners/managers who get sucked into all the mess.  A couple of tweaks to the script, and these characters could have been dropped altogether...so their presence here feels like little more than a ploy to give these two actors the \\"cred\\" of working with Guy  Ritchie, and to make the movie more appealing to US audiences (and fans of ENTOURAGE, I guess.)  In the end, the two men leave no impression.    The best scene in the movie is a prolonged chase scene, in which Butler and his buddies steal the money from a couple of VERY tough and determined Russian thugs who simply won't be stopped.  It's funny to see the footchase, as Butler and his pursuer get more and more tired.  The scene combined humor and action in a fun way that most of the rest of the movie lacked.  Interesting, all killings happen either offscreen or at least, outside of the shot.  Thus, it's a very violent movie that shows little violence.  There's very little sex...so the R-rating comes from the constant bad language.  And while the movie does have some verbal wit...it is far less clever than it thinks it is.    I've used this cliché before...but it REALLY holds true here:  ROCK N ROLLA is full of sound and fury signifying nothing.  The movie is really only for die-hard Ritchie fans (are there any?) or Gerard Butler or Tom Wilkinson completists.
B001SAHOBO|3.0|The movie itself is excellent and the DVD is a good print. I had watched this film on an overseas flight on a Tiawenese airline and had since whatched another version back home which prompted me to buy this as a gift. What was dissapointing is that this versions' subtitles are not the same as either of the other versions I had seen and contained many explitives ( swear words) not present in the subtitles of other versions. I dont know if this is a more accurate or just more colorful version in that sense but the buyer should be aware.
0385737424|5.0|\\"When You Reach Me\\" is a smart, thoughtful book about smart 6th graders written for a young audience.  The central theme is time travel, but it is ultimately a novel about friendship and tolerance.  It tackles casual prejudices, including race and class.  Miranda, the central figure, lives with her single mother in a small, semi-shabby New York apartment.  Some of her friends have two parents, some only one.  Some have money and some are in families who struggle to make ends meet.   Ultimately, their circumstances are far less important than their own good character, and when their friendships are tested they manage to work it out.    Beautifully written, the conversations ring true and Stead's descriptions of Miranda's feelings often reminded me of myself in 6th grade. My fifth-grade granddaughters love the story, and I suspect they will each revisit it from time to time.   An exciting adventure/mystery with no villains, this is a great book for girls age 10 and up.

All the great ingredients of a Wilco album with a few nice surprises (Feist) thrown in. All in all a fantastic record to add to your collection.

B000FS9MV0|5.0|Renee Olstead's Skylark is an album worthy of Judy Garland or Ella Fitzgerald!    Sinatra would have made it a point to sing with Miss Olstead. So would Dean and Sammy, Bennett, you name it. Why? because renee is simply the best there is at what she does. She not only has a unique and beautiful voice. She not only interprets difficult standards with more insight than most singers with decades more experience, Renee just plain has attitude! She would have been right at home at the Sands in 1958 clowning it up and singing with The Rat Pack! Boys if you can here this girl, has she got pipes or what?!

159448385X|5.0|This was a wonderful book, but I could only take it in small doses.  It took a couple of months for me to read it.  I would also read more light hearted short stories before and after chapters to keep from being too affected by it.    As a mother of young children it was especially difficult to read, but important to have an eye open to the suffering of others in our world.  The author told the story well.

B001DDBCUU|5.0|This movie is fantastic! The scene where Carrie gets out of bed and travels through the snow on New Year's eve to be with Miranda while Auld Lang Syne plays in the background makes me cry every time I watch it. The movie is about love, sure, but mostly it is about 4 friends who know each other very well , love each other in spite of their difference and will stick together forever. The four stars are so natural together, and it is a credit to the writers and producer that they make it look so effortless. The other star of this movie is NYC, and it is a love story about that beautiful city as well. I think they are making SATC number 2 and I honestly cannot wait!
B000268QB2|5.0|I must have been in a coma in 2004 to have missed this CD.  Absolutely awesome, great vocals and every song is wonderful.  What triggered my purchase was catching Keane on a repeat of Saturday Night Live and I turned to the channel just as he was completing \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" and I've been spellbound ever since. I will now be catching up with their 2006 & 2008 releases !
B0029358GM|4.0|Man, what do people have against Sky Blue Sky?  It's one of my favorite albums from the last five or ten years.  As for Wilco (the Album)...    I've really gotten to like \\"Wilco (The Song)\\"  a lot for what it is.  It's fun and rollicking, and it's not even quite as silly as it seems at first.  \\"Deeper Down\\" is very pretty - overwhelmingly so in places -- but not overly exciting.  \\"One Wing\\" has some really fantastic imagery and evokes an emotional response, but not the kind that I want to have every day.  Still a very nice song, though.  \\"Bull Black Nova\\" is definitely interesting in that it does a very good job of painting quite a picture, but it chugs along for too long - it's not necessarily its length, but its repetitiveness.  I guess that's part of the point, but it doesn't completely work, and the track never really has a killer hook.  Too bad, too, because it seems like it's on the verge of being a truly great track.  \\"You and I\\" is real dern purdy.  No real complaints with it, as it's not the kind of song that really needs a hook.  \\"You Never Know\\" is kind of a drag.  It has one or two clever lyrics, but it never really goes anywhere, and musically it's exceedingly boring.  I'm really baffled as to why they decided to play that on Conan.  Not a very strong track at all (for Wilco, anyway).  \\"Country Disappeared\\" is kind of pretty, but also kind of sleepy and quite forgettable.   I like \\"I'll Fight\\" quite a bit, although it too is a tad on the sleepy side (not in a necessarily bad way, though).  I think \\"Sunny Feeling\\" is pretty good, and it reminds me of certain parts of Sky Blue Sky.  I guess I just don't get the point of \\"Everlasting.\\"  I suppose there's nothing wrong with the sentiment in conveys, but it's kind of clichéd and the song does nothing for me.  The album would be better off being one track shorter.  Oh, well.  Overall, I think the album is somewhat lacking in drama and hooks.  There are some terribly pretty passages on it, but the rocker in me misses the... rock.  It's a nice album in general, but I feel that it ranks near the bottom as far as Wilco albums go.  I do think that even a weaker Wilco album is still quite good, though.  I'm admittedly a bit disappointed with it as a follow up to Sky Blue Sky, but I'll live.      By the way, the product description erroneously states that Wilco debuted some of this material at the 2009 Jazz Fest in New Orleans. I was there for the entire show, and they didn't play a single track from this record. In fact, John Stirratt was interviewed before the show, and specifically stated that they wouldn't be playing any of the tracks from the yet to be released album.

0452289963|2.0|I give this book two stars because I agree with the basic premise that people should embrace the present moment. The problem is that the author repeats this basic idea over and over. While certainly some repitition is justified in order to get the point across, the repetition here rises to absurd levels. I think this book could've easily been written under 100 pages, but then, alas, it would be difficult to sell. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Even though friends had lauded it to the heavens, even though, the reviews I'd read all outdid each other in effusing its praises, I was completely unprepared for what happened once I slid in the first disc of this series.  Mistakenly taking this for a dark comedy, and indeed, laughing riotously during the first few minutes, I felt myself drawn inexorably into the vortex of a world created by genius Vince Gilligan.  It is a world both beautiful and terrifying, hilarious and heartbreaking.  It is as complex as the compound chemicals taught and mixed by our hapless hero.  It is, quite simply, great, great television.    The premise is not particularly difficult to believe (particularly not in this economically harrowing age) but instead of going for the expected \\"in\\" jokes, obvious \\"fish out of water\\" sight gags or sauntering hipster/counterculturespeak, \\"BB\\" moves us through an ever shifting human landscape, doing so with an ease that embraces both grace and awkwardness.      The first episode alone is like being seized by the throat and taken on a fearful joyride you've no choice in taking.   We watch the hapless high school chemistry teacher, Walter, at the heart of the series, as he is ripped from a mundane life in suburbia, and propelled into the dizzying ____ - a nightmare forever threatening to spiral out of his control.       Our chemsistry teacher, Walter, a mild mannered family man, with a newly pregnant wife, a teenage son suffering from cerebal palsy, must work nights at a car wash and suffer ridicule from the wealthy suburban idiots failing his class, but who we know will, by sheer dint of their families crests', become the future captains of industry and leaders of their community).  Upon discovering he has lung cancer and not too long to live, that the newly 50 year old nonsmoker examines his life, predicts a future of hardship for his young family and takes the bull by the horns.      Led by Bryan Cranston in what must be the performance of his career,the entire cast snap, crackles and pops with life.  Anna Gunn captures the desperation of her situation, and yet radiates as the pregnant Skyler.  It's impossible not to be charmed completely by his son, Walter, Jr., winningly portrayed by RJ Mitte.  Something must be said here, and I'll say it.  We've approached for FAR TOO LONG, portraying the so-called \\"handicapped\\" with awkwardness and awarding them a blessedness not always earned (or deserved) and Breaking Bad does away with all of that.  Walt, Jr., here is just a kid with a family who adores him and actually blind to any \\"disability.\\"  In one of the most satisfying moments of season one, as some knuckle-dragging \\"cool kids\\" ridicule his son, Walter, Sr. does something most of us hope we have the balls to do.      Walter's in-laws, Betsy Brandt and Dean Morris, provide plenty of comic relief as a bitter know-it-all radiology technician and a self-proclaimed superstar DEA agent.      With Cranston's amazing turn as Walter, too many critics continue to overlook ne of the series most important characters, Jesse, in what should be a star making performance for Aaron Paul.      The cast, look, script, cinematography, music - the other worldly New Mexican topography, all combined with the elements of remarkable storytelling make this one of the most magical shows on TV in years.  There is a \\"feel\\" to this show that feels epic - not in the overused, bland commercial way we apply to almost anything - but almost as in a Homeric manner.  I've rarely been more impressed by anything in American \\"series\\" television.
0312370849|4.0|A worthwhile book to read. Interesting and well written. The book deals with important details about France in W.W.II. At times, it leaves you with strong emotional feelings.
B0000634EV|5.0|Damn, this album is great. Its not quite as heavy as NOLA but its much darker.  Its definitely an excellent sophomore effort. The thing i love about II is the tempo changes in songs like \\"There's Something on my Side\\", \\"Lysergik Funeral Procession\\" and \\"Ghosts Along the Mississippi\\".  Overall, DOWN II, IMO, is southern rock, blues and sludge blended together to form the perfect sound. DOWN's coming to OKC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AMEN bruthas and sistas.
B000UG78NG|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed this book but I have to give fair warnings to other potential readers.  It is long, it is part of a trilogy and the author is very slow coming out with the other 2 books.  I also think this is book is for the older readers out there.    I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book.  The characters are very well crafted and the story is very engaging.  I give kudos to the author; I do not enjoy third person narative stories yet I enjoyed this one.
B000WC3A0S|2.0|I love the Rocky series and was excited to receive it.  Until I realized 2 of the discs are messed up and won't play.  I'm hoping the set I received is just a fluke.  This is the first time I've received defective product from amazon. Hoping it will be the last time.
B0000DFZZC|5.0|Seabiscuit was a great horse - few would argue that. This movie does an excellent job of presenting the story of the people surrounding Seabiscuit and then showing how the rather mismatched crew made it all work so well.

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|Advent Children in a nutshell is the sequel CG movie to the 1997 video game Final Fantasy VII. Advent Children Complete is a director's cut that includes an extra 30 minutes of scenes that really help make story more understandable, enjoyable and a better viewing experience overall. This movie overall is light on story and more focused on action and if that is what you are looking for then you will probably enjoy this film. If your a FFVII fan then you probably already watched it or have it on DVD and depending on how big of a FFVII fan you are may want to get this director's cut of Advent Children.<br /><br />Visually this CG film still looks great after a few years with the new scenes having noticeably better lighting then the original footage.<br /><br />There are extras like an overview of the 1997 video game as well as the compilation of games surrounding the franchise. There are trailers as well as packed onto the disc.
B00275EGTC|3.0|An engaging sci-fi enigma provides a thought-provoking premise, but too many unanswered questions and too many similarities to superior staples of the genre leave Duncan Jones' Moon simply a platform for compelling performances by Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell. It's almost a two-man (or maybe one-man) mystery and the creepy, lonely setting (heightened by a brooding score) might have worked more effectively had the film ventured further towards thrills than morality, but it's rare to see a complex and intelligent science fiction film not bogged down by overwhelming predictability.<br /><br />With only two weeks left of his three year contract on the moon-based mining compound Sarang, solitary crew member Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) can't wait to return to his family on Earth. But the mind-numbing isolation and utter detachment from human contact has already taken its toll on the miner, and bizarre visions and troubled dreams disrupt the efficiency of his work. Strange occurrences with communications systems and abnormal behavior from his robotic assistant GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) put Sam further at unease. After a perilous accident with one of the excavation units, he awakens to find that he may no longer be alone in the mining facility...<br /><br />Moon explores the very heart of science-fiction through the most quintessential themes, many of which mirror possible realistic futures, straying away from the more outlandish subjects. There are no aliens or heavily armed spaceships, no time travel, warp drive, black holes, or dwarfish, wizened green men who tutor in ancient sorcerer's ways. Instead, the ideas of isolation, loneliness, the value of human life, productivity, solutions to global energy crises, artificial intelligence, and cold corporate business practices are examined. While materially futuristic, the setting is one of the key elements that make Moon pure science-fiction.<br /><br />It's hard not to make comparisons to Silent Running (a solitary man strikes up conversations with his plants while watering them) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (Kevin Spacey's calmly eerie voice all but duplicates HAL 9000), along with several other less notable precursor sci-fi films. Sam Rockwell steals the show, and considering he's practically the only cast member, it's a good thing he's such a likeable, believable actor. Accompanying his performance is pleasantly foreboding music that perfectly sets the mood, masterfully placed throughout the most spellbinding moments by composer Clint Mansell.<br /><br />Moon is one of those films that rely heavily on a shocking discovery by the only main character, which can't be discussed in detail without spoiling considerable realizations. While mulling over hallucinations and a mysterious doppelganger, Sam is slow to interrogate and doesn't overreact like he ought to. His reactions are generally not inquisitive enough. It's an effort to draw out the plot in the form of a terrifying conspiracy, but the result delays answers to the hundreds of questions forming in the audience's minds - some are sated but others are left open-ended. In the end, Moon engagingly sets a bleak, scarily inhumane atmosphere that is interesting but not spectacular.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsth his plants while watering them) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (Kevin Spacey's calmly eerie voice all but duplicates HAL 9000), along with several other less notable precursor sci-fi films.

B00006D295|5.0|I love this movie.  It's a bizarre musical comedy.  They call it a cult classic because it's really easy to get into after you watch it a couple times.  The music is catchy and the actors and actresses really make their roles work.
B0029358GM|3.0|Appeasing older fans of the band's more relaxed and predictable alt-country approach, Tweedy and company may sound like they are enjoying themselves more though that rarely translates to producing songs that engaged like the last few albums.

B0026J8LHM|3.0|Ever since their foray into the epic prog genre (ala Yes) with Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence DT has fixated on a formula of 10+ minute mini-masterpieces replete with instrumental virtuosity and vigor. Save Train of Thought, this effort really doesn't deviate from that formula at all. Each of the four \\"mega tracks\\" is a musical mélange of just about every tempo, tuning and timbre that will leave the prog metal purist in catatonic bliss but for some may confuse and confound. If one had to use a past LP as a point of reference, Octivarium comes to mind--with a dash of Change of Seasons thrown in for good measure (especially if you purchase the special edition). While not as dark or cohesive as Systematic Chaos, the album does a better job of showcasing their influences and musical prowess. This is especially evident in the first and final tracks.     Drilling down into Black Clouds you get some familiar riffs and modalities. Arguably the finest track has to be the first. \\"A Nightmare to Remember\\" recalls the same chemistry (and even the subject matter) that made Scenes From A Memory one of their best. \\"Rite of Passage\\" is perfect fodder for the airwaves, being one of the more \\"compact\\" songs that articulates a more prog-thrash feel that was evident on Train of Thought. Even more of an FM darling is Wither, which is catchy but not much more than the obligatory token \\"ballad\\" that shows up on each Dream Theater release. The subsequent tracks--\\"Shattered Fortress\\" borrows a page from the \\"Fear\\" continuum that Rush employed years ago ala Mike Portnoy's songsmithing with his trademark heaviness (and ubiquitous growling)\\"Best of Times\\" even goes a step further by jumping into a Rush tribute tour-de-force that made me want to reach for my copy of Permanent Waves. Both are all over the place musically, and not entirely recommended for the uninitiated. The final track, \\"Count of Tuscany\\" is a journey into the macabre that is probably one of their most intriguing compositions. Showcasing just about every stylistic modality in their bag of tricks, this track does a fine job of wrapping up an interesting release in the same fashion as it started. If nothing else can be inferred about Black Clouds one must conclude that the instrumental execution is just about unparalleled. Substantive, for the most part, it's really not. 3 stars from a diehard DT fan.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|Not sure whether she is just trying to do something different but, if so, she has gone in the wrong direction.  Perhaps she thought this was safe and, just maybe, she was was right, but judging by the reviews on this site; not.    Bland, uninspiring and certainly not what we have become used to.  \\"Walk on by\\" and \\"Ipanema\\" are particularly insipid.    Diasappointing.
B0026RHR6K|2.0|It really shouldn't be surprising that the wheel has turned though.  Back in 79 or 80 when the original Battlestar Galactica ran for one season, it was a hard-nosed sci-fi action series set in the deep of space and aimed at males.  And yes, there were a couple of cheesy episodes, but for the most part the shop was pretty hardcore sci-fi.  (Now, Battlestar Galactica was actually re-done a year or so after the original 79 season with a few of the original case members but set on Earth, that 2nd version of BSG was huge mistake and was absolutely horrendous).  Why do tv shows completely change concepts when they have a successful show? Who knows?  The same thing happened with Buck Rogers, great 1st season, then  the show is completely re-written and, viola! terrible season 2.    As for the newest version of the show (the 3rd version) with Edward James Olmos, in keeping with the new concept of making it primarily a show designed to attract a primarily female audience, the role of Starbuck was re-written as a female character, who surprise! acts just like the male version, (ie: likes to fight, play poker, beat up the male characters, chew cigars etc).  The special effects are very solid, and the ships look pretty believable, the show does exchange the old shows sense of adventure and exploration, for numerous romantic encounters though (you might begin to think you are watching Desperate Housewives).  I do think the show made a big mistake in changing the origin of the Cylons.  The new show has revised their origin, and instead of mankind encountering a machine race out there in the depths of space desiring to eliminate all non-machine life (a pretty cosmic idea), the new show suddenly decides that the Cylons were simply invented by humans!  What a boring idea, how common.  It also doesn't help that they have essentially taken away the alien-ness of the Cylons and instead they have completely humanized them.    At any rate, I found myself, having to fast forward through long swatches of soap opera in this show to get to anything resembling science fiction, and what is the most important thing about sc-fi tv series, (it is not two people going \\"how do you feel?, \\"No, how do you feel\\", or everyone's hormonal urges), great sci-fi is about great ideas, and great visual images.  This show doesn't quite cut it, but, overall, I will give it 2 ½ stars, mainly for the production values and special effects.
0316044695|1.0|The fact that this quite awful book was \\"co\\"written by a British hack (a rather odd choice for an American soldier) already explains a lot. There is a time honored tradition in British special forces memoirs to simply make stuff up, usually more violence, to make the story sexier. The most famous example, of course,is \\"Bravo Two Zero\\", which according to currently available information never had any enemy contact at all, but whose exploits in several contradictory books and a movie morphed into an epic running battle resulting in hundreds of dead Iraqis. I suspect the same happened here. There is no question in my mind that some heroic things happened on that mission; I don't think they would give the medal of honor to someone who didn't deserve it. Unfortunately, Luttrell is the \\"lone survivor\\", and his account, or rather his ghost writer's rendering of it, has way too many holes in it to be believable. This isn't how it happened; this is what the ghost writer thinks the American audience wants to read, complete with silly political rantings the kind of which I have never read in a military memoir before. From a marketing point of view, judging by the vast majority of reviews posted here, they hit it right on the head. But they've done a disservice to the special forces community and to those readers who want serious military history, not artificial patriotism a la FOX news.
B000068FY0|5.0|The only thing I can say about this product is that if you like Supertramp, this one is my personal favorites. It's slower, softer, and more polished, it may not be for everyone, but it's definitely my favorite.
0143038419|1.0|I love reading and I love the idea of traveling .. but this book just didn't cut it for me.  I got read this book because of the great reviews but I was miserable reading it.  I really just could not stop thinking about food during her time in Italy - probably not a good idea to read this if you're on a diet! Meanwhile, India and Indonesia just made me bored.  I found the book to be full of complaining and whining and just did not enjoy it.  I don't understand why she went on a trip to find herself and be away from all the drama of life if she couldn't just relax and enjoy it?  She seems to not understand what she would be getting herself into and neither did I... I finished the book because I was hoping for some glorious ending, but I never got it.    I'm not a super girly-girl so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it but it was just a tough book for me to get through.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This is a great album, filled with funky beats, hip hop club anthems that are reminiscent of 80's New York. I love how Madonna continues to challenge herself with keeping up with sounds that are modern, yet old-school. The lyrics to Miles Away and Incredible are a sad indication to her failing marriage, longing for rekindling and once was, \\"I am Missing My best friend, sex with you is incredible.\\" Madonna still pens like a romantic, but still edgy with club dance. Those of the negative haters are just a bunch of old rumps who can't get into hip hop. Spanish Lesson, Dance 2Night, Candy Shop, Heartbeat, and The Beat Goes are also my fav standouts. True Madonna fans would love this album.
B000062XFG|4.0|The only thing that disturbed me was the envelope... It's a collectors series, or good enough to be one. My package was slightly damaged because it was sent in an envelope. Other than that, great deal!
0887307280|1.0|I agree with the other one- and two-star reviews.     As well:    * the book is clearly padded, using a large font and lots of paragraph breaks.    * his \\"Sarah\\" narrative is grandiose, smarmy, fakey, idealized, and annoying.    His points could have been clearly explained in a pamphlet.  A SMALL pamphlet.  It would have made him less money, though.    Thank God I got this book from the library, rather than paying for it.
1423101472|2.0|While I liked the first book in this series, it has become progressively more and more an obvious ripoff of Harry P., so much so that this installment was almost painful to read.  Our hero, a genetically superior teen with the power to see the magical world all around us hidden from the rest of us Muggles, lives with other similar teens in a special, separate environment where they are being trained how to best use their magical powers by, among other creatures, a centaur.  Our hero uses magical creatures as well as shadows to transport himself around the world and leads the fight against the power of evil that is intent on destroying civilization.  Our hero also just happens to be the ostensible subject of an ancient prophecy.  The teens have to all join forces to try to deal with the forces of evil but there is a traitor among them.  Yada yada yada.  We've heard all this before, except that this book has none of the characterization, humor, or camaraderie of the Rowling series.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|BBC created miniseries about MP with a secret life.  MP is young, seemingly immune to corruption an happily maried to a successful business woman with whom he has two children.  Then suddenly, tragedy strikes.  His young research assistant who helps him on legal issues regarding oil industry is killed.  She is shot and pushed under the train.<br /><br />Being that politics and media go hand in hand, media becomes particularly interested in a case when MP cannot hide his distress and tears from the public, journalists and TV camera.  It is obvious to everyone that connection between the young researcher and her boss is more intimate.<br /><br />I loved all the characters involved in the story as they were perfectly developed.  One cannot be but intrigued with connection between lobbyists, politicians, government and media.  Shattered families and personal lives and feelings are only minor side effects in this compelling story.<br /><br />Great cast, some of the British finest.  I particularly liked Bill Nighy (in his role of a newspaper editor), James McAvoy (his son, freelance journalist with estranged relationship with his editor father) and Polly Walker (MP's distressed wife who is the picture perfect of a modern wife and mother that takes charge of her own destiny and life).<br /><br />Be prepared for the shocking and unexpected closure of the story.
0812580346|3.0|Flashforward, which is the basis for an upcoming TV series, is more of a character driven drama than a fast paced SF thriller. Although, there are no spaceships or time travel, there is a glimpse into the future in which everyone in the world shares. The story explores the ideas and motions what people would do if saw a slice of the futures two decades in advance. There seemed to be more philosophy than drama and story telling.

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|I have always been a huge fan of the Final Fantasy franchise. Final Fantasy VII was amongst my favorite of the games, so I was very excited to hear that Square was going to release the FFVII film. After watching the original movie, I thought it was awesome. But after watching it a few times and thinking it over about the plot and other elements of the film, I realized that I was being blinded by my previous love for the game that I was not able to see the many flaws of the original version of this film. Sure the graphics were superb, and the fight scenes were amazing (even better than fight scenes of other movies such as the Matrix trilogy in my opinion), but that wasn't enough to make a good movie. There was no plot development and the motives of the characters (mainly the villains) were not obvious enough or explained very well. Not only that, previous main characters with the exception of Tifa and Cloud did not play a large role or \\"any\\" role in the movie at all. Characters like Yuffie, Barret, Cid, etc. were just there (and literally appeared out of nowhere) in the movie for fan-service. I was rather disappointed with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.     And then, the new release: FFVII: AC Complete. I was not excited to see this film, but I thought, \\"What the heck. I'll just add this movie to my collection.\\" After watching the Complete version, I was thoroughly impressed. Even though it did not fix some of the major problems I had with the original, the story was explained much better. The new added scenes tied everything together, making concepts such as Geostigma more significant and relevent to the story. Geostigma did not seem very threatening in the original version, but the new scenes showed the importance and madness that came about after the Meteor as well as the threatening affects of the new illness, Geostigma, on the planet and its people. And then, Denzel's role and background were explanded on, making him a lot more relevent to the story. So basically, elements that seemed random or unimportant in the original now takes on a new meaning and is shown as being more relevant to the overall story. Not only that, the fight scenes even showed some blood! This makes the fights a bit more realistic and cooler.    I watched this movie three times and never got tired of it. It was such an improvement to the original film that I could not stop wanting to see it again. I wished all \\"director's cut\\" of other films had this much improvement to the original.    Now what did I think of the English dubbed? I thought it was amazing. There were even some voices that I thought were superior to the original Japanese cast. I was surprised that the English dub company was able to gather the english cast together in order to dub the extra scenes in the Complete version. The voice acting was simply amazing. The only voice I was uncomfortable with was Mena Suvari's Aeris. Could have been a bit better in my opinion. But overall, I give the english voice acting an A+.    So overall, I give the original a 6/10 and the Blu-Ray \\"Complete\\" version a 9/10.     I recommend this movie to any Final Fantasy fan or even people who just like a lot of cool fights and action packed sequences. Any die hard fan who likes the original are going to love this new and improved Advent Children.

0425129608|5.0|Agatha Christie continued her winning streak with Evil Under the Sun, a masterpiece of misdirection.  If in subsequent years EUTS has seemed a bit inferior to the earlier Death on the Nile, it is possibly because, well, for one thing it is the same story just told from a different angle; and for another, it just misses creating a character as mesmerizingly passionate as Jacqueline de Bellefort in Nile.  The focus here, and the best character study, is on the \\"evil\\" woman of the title, Arlena Stuart.  Arlena is a startlingly physical presence on the beach of the Jolly Roger Hotel, the kind of woman who puts others in the shade.  No man can resist her for long, but that's her tragedy too as well as her claim to fame.  I will say that the Pixy's Cave seems like a perfect place for Arlena and I'm sure that Freudian-minded Agatha Christie must have had a ball devising this chamber for her.<br /><br />The story from which she disappears is also a bittersweet, heartwarming tale about how a group of damaged people reconstitutes family life after the death of the mother.  Community is much on Christie's mind in this book.  There's another extraordinary scene in which Poirot manages to get all the available suspects to accompany him on a picnic, which goes completely the opposite of how you'd think it would go: i.e, it makes the characters loveable, the meanest of the bunch revealing unexpected strengths and charms.<br /><br />Maybe in retrospect it's hard to believe that the killer could count on his witness to respond exactly as she does.  I can't make up my mind whether or not the whole plot would have collapsed had she decided to read a book instead.  Well, Christie makes it plain she wasn't the bookish type.
B002CGPI3O|5.0|Being a long time listener of Moby I have been somewhat disappointed with the last couple of issues.  This time he hit it right on again.  Chill out music.  Peace
B0029358GM|4.0|Wilco (the song): Bad Company, Bo Diddley, Talk Talk and Kool & The Gang all enjoyed this track.  Black Sabbath, however, thought it sucked.    Deeper Down: sort of musical steampunk, half baroque and half postmodern.  It's well written though.  Pat Sansone gets a partial writing credit for this, and it is similar to the music that Sansone and Stirratt make with their side project The Autumn Defense.    One Wing: one of the strongest tracks here, and you get the sense that this could be an epic live track.  Cline feigns launching a huge Impossible Germany style solo around the two minute mark, but really he's just building a bridge between two different sections of the song.  Then the song fades out over his lead at the end.  Potentially a huge blank canvas for live improvisation.    Bull Black Nova: Impossible Germany's evil twin.  You could call it jazzy, but it's Return To Forever, not John Scofield.  Dissonant at times, but the narrative and the music keep building up to a frenzy.  A musical kindred spirit of songs like VU's \\"The Gift\\" and King Crimson's \\"Thela Hun Gingjeet.\\"    You and I: having a female voice on a Wilco track is interesting for about ten seconds.  The most intriguing thing about the song is Nels' Adrian Belew-like outtro.    You Never Know: lots of 70s FM rock ideas (e.g. the piano riff from Deep Purple's \\"My Woman from Tokyo\\") melded into one song with mixed success.  Nels is DEEP in George Harrison's bag, so much so that I'm expecting a lawsuit from the Chiffons any day now.    Country Disappeared: sort of an ego-free song.  No particular musician stands out here.  Eventually generates some heat after sagging at the beginning.    Solitaire: never really gets off the ground musically, but the lyrics are fascinating.  Don't know if it's intended to be autobiographical but the song could easily be about Tweedy.  If you wanted to say \\"thank goodness I've gotten over myself and don't behave like a pretentious tweet anymore,\\" writing a song aboutyourself would be an ironic way of achieving this.    I'll Fight: they recycled \\"On and On and On\\" from Sky Blue Sky.    Sonny Feeling: a musical tribute to Alex Chilton and Big Star.  John Stirratt never travels far without a little Big Star, so it's not surprising to hear these sounds creeping into Wilco.    Everlasting Everything: kind of a lightweight song to end the album.      My real rating is 3.5 stars or 7 out of 10, but I'll round it up to four since we can't give fractional star ratings.  Not every Wilco fan is going to love this album, but we can all at least appreciate the fact that after fifteen years they are still willing to try new things.  One analogy that might work: Robert Plant once said that Presence was the \\"most Led Zeppelin sounding\\" Led Zeppelin album.  It probably isn't anyone's favorite Led Zeppelin album though.  Wilco (the album) might be the same thing.  It's the most Wilco-sounding Wilco album, drawing from all facets of their storied past, but not many people are going to think it's their very best.
1594201749|5.0|Please read this book. It is not only the story of an inspired leader it inspires to make us makers of peace. You will be informed about Mandela, South Africa and rugby.  You will cry all the way through the last third of the book so make sure to have alot of hankies nearby.    Mandela is a carismatic person who knows how to manipulate and inspire people to do better than their base instincts would have them do but he is also a cool calculator who knows how to capture the moment and turn it into a pivotal moment for the formation of his countrymen.    The author makes it clear in several passages that Mandela has a temper, that he does have deep resenments, he is not a bloodless saint but his  conviction that revenge is not the way to forge a country and fix its problems and his self control make him the statesman and person he is.  How easy it would have been for a man kept prisoner for so many years to take up the gun instead of the flag of national unity.    The proof of Mandela's theory has been watching South Africa play with a national team in the latest soccer championships held in South Africa.  They almost won.

045122499X|5.0|\\"World Without End\\" continues the story of Kingsbridge, a medieval town noted for the awe-inspiring Gothic cathedral designed and built some 200 hundred years earlier in the 12th century by Jack Builder.<br /><br />Gwenda, a female medieval version of the Artful Dodger, is one of five starving children in a very poor family. Despite the horrific punishment that sees the hands chopped off a convicted thief, she's being raised by her father to be a cut-purse and a pickpocket. Ralph is a tall, strong boy whose hopeful family see him as destined for greater things. They imagine him as the young squire of a noble knight or (dare they wish for such an impossibility?) perhaps even elevated to the rank of knighthood and nobility itself. But Ralph is an aggressive bully and although he certainly seems to have the strength and the warlike skills to achieve such an ambition, he is sadly lacking in the ability to soak up any academic learning at all. Descended from Jack Builder, Merthin seems to be the polar opposite of his stepbrother, Ralph. Merthin is a kinder, gentler, more intelligent person whose innate pragmatic genius drives him to wonder how things work and how things are built. Caris, also a descendent of Jack Builder, shares in Jack's and Merthin's intelligence but she is determined to use that academic brilliance to study medicine, an activity strictly forbidden to mere women in the 14th century.<br /><br />In 1327, these four children slip away from the confines of Kingsbridge and play in the forest, a dangerous activity forbidden to them by their parents. But who among us hasn't ignored a prohibition like that at one time or another? When, to their horror, they witness a killing that they cannot understand, their lives become inextricably entwined together and it is not until many, many years later that any of them will understand the dark motives behind the brutal event in the forest that unfolded before them that day.<br /><br />Of course, \\"World Without End\\" is a sequel to Ken Follett's runaway bestseller, \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and, as you might expect, Kingsbridge Cathedral, the priory and Merthin's skills as an engineer, a mason, a designer and an architect, all play a central role in the continuing story. Caris' cousin, Godwyn, also a descendant of Tom Builder, becomes a monk at a very early age and sets his career sights very high indeed. With an abundant supply of self-confidence and arrogance, he is absolutely convinced that it is in Kingsbridge's and his own best interests that he become no less than the Prior of the cathedral. Of course, this is still the 14th century and, clearly, Godwyn, the priory and the authority of the Catholic Church will have no small part to play in the history of Kingsbridge as the story of the four children's lives begins to play out against the rich medieval backdrop that Follett provides.<br /><br />Feudalism, medieval law, the iron hand of the Catholic Church, the innate male chauvinism of the day, the nobility, ongoing war against France and, of course, the Black Death that savaged Europe in the second half of the fourteenth century, all play a major role in Follett's epic tale, \\"World Without End\\". Given the setting of the story in terms of time and place, this shouldn't come as a surprise. What may come as a surprise is that, although readers of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" who waited so long for this sequel were desperately afraid that Follett couldn't possibly repeat such a literary triumph, their worries were quite groundless. Follett has provided his fans with an epic tale that veritably leaps off the pages - bloody war and battles; greed, ambition and power; lust, love and loyalty; suspense and intrigue; and, of course, a realistic, astonishingly well developed historical setting that will transport delighted readers to the heart of medieval England.<br /><br />\\"World Without End\\" is a doorstopper weighing in at a hefty 1000+ pages. But, without a doubt, it's the fastest 1000 pages that you're ever going to read and you'll still be sorry to see it end. What a story!<br /><br />Paul Weiss'll still be sorry to see it end. What a story!    Paul Weiss

Grab a green tea or two and a lemon cookie.<br />Her alllegiance to the \\"Queens\\" of Jazz/Blues/Folk has been duly documented above. My favorite tracks are \\"Lonesome Road\\", one of the best renditions I've ever heard and \\"Don't Cry Baby\\", though I was hoping for something like James Brown's sonic exercise on said opus. She really needed to open up and go Soulful on at least one - there is a samey quality to every single cut.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.  Although a fantasy, it is so much more with wonderful performances from all leads.  A Star comes to Earth and what occurs next (and throughout the film) is unpredictable (well, for the most part), very funny and touching.  I think likeable characters are essential for a film of this type to work - check!
B000008FIR|3.0|Haven't heard this CD in ages. First hit the stores in 1985 as this was Fastway's third record. Maybe a bit more commercial than their first two efforts but still good. Tracks that did the most for me were \\"Tired Of Your Love\\", the rocking \\"Little By Little\\", title cut \\"Waiting For The Roar\\", maybe \\"Girl\\" and the uplifting \\"Doing Just Fine\\". Noticed they had a couple of new members this time around - Paul Reid on bass and Alan Conner on drums. Should've known this was an 'original' line-up that wouldn't last very long. I mean the disc is fine, just not as out-standing as their 'Trick Or Treat' or their first two.
B000001ELD|3.0|I was SO EXCITED when these solo albums came out!  I had no money so I had to choose which one of the four to buy first.  I choose \\"The God Of Thunder\\", expecting a rockin' dark time!!  How wrong I was.  Gene shows off his influences (both good and bad) and interests (ditto) on this album.  Lots of guest stars and some overproduced numbers here.  That being said, there are some good songs (many of them more mellow) that I really enjoy.  If you really like KISS, I highly recommend you continue your journey and get ALL four of the solo albums.  I like Paul & Ace's the best.  Peter's is NOT COOL, but you gotta hear it!!  11/27/09: Over the past few months I've noticed that 2 people haven't found this review helpful.  Let me restate my case:  this is a good album for KISS/Gene Simmons fans.  However, if you are expecting a darker \\"in character\\" demon cd, you will be surprised by the songs. Gene writes in a variety of song styles and this album is proof of that.  Very enlightening and fun stuff.  Really, give it listen!
B000NA2348|1.0|How does one go from Ziggy to this crap. If I wanted to listen to soul music I would have pulled out my mowtown collection. I actually had the displeasure of seeing this tour live. Cant tell you how disappointed I was as I had no idea he was going to do this garbage. This album never should have been made. Wish I could rate it less than 1 star. I'm afraid it was all down hill for Bowie after he lost the brilliant Mick Ronson.

B001UREJWM|5.0|The so-called classic live \\"Reunion\\" album, with all the hoopla and hype of the \\"triumphal return\\" of Ozzy to the lineup, ain't squat alongside this set that resulted from Sab's wanting to add a few extra treats to the 2007 Rhino compilation album \\"The Dio Years\\". The quartet found that they had recaptured the chemistry of 1992's \\"Heaven & Hell\\" after just cranking out a zit-faced speed metal product in the later \\"Dehumanizer\\", which had been more of a Wayne's World soundtrack than an album. There isn't a dud on this effort, although you'll find that if you put it in your player either before or after the three bonus tracks from \\"The Dio Years\\" you'll find that the mix on this album is more powerful than those. Don't get me wrong--they're worth having, but they just don't kick the way these ten do. There's no driving \\"almost-speed\\" like the '92 track \\"Neon Nights\\", but if you want that one, put that album in the player too. If you don't own it anymore, shame on you for putting a Black Sabbath album in the used bin. This album doesn't have that track's speed metal pace the way \\"Dehumanizer\\" did, but that was for a niche \\"valley boy\\" demographic. The real Sabbath fan isn't locked into that pattern--no one generation owns Black Sabbath. And this album doesn't suffer from the absence of burnt-out inarticulate Ozzy. I was surprised to listen to \\"Reunion\\" and discover that I could understand every word he sang. Tony needed Ozzy back in the day to help found Black Sabbath, we owe him historical respect for that--but the Old Mumbler just ain't got it no more. Let him go on selling texting cell phones. This bunch, with Ronnie at the mike, is BACK. I hope for keeps. I don't care why they had to use a different name--it's still THEM.

B000089RVX|5.0|The lyrics are deep and really apply to life, I've listened to this album over and over.
B00005ASOC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie about a young black boy who is great at basketball and want's to write.  Sean Connery plays a reclusive writer who ends up being a great mentor to boy.  It is by far a great \\"feel good\\" movie.
6304359217|5.0|My eight year old was begging me for Space Jam as I searched the web I came across this video for $2.95.  Still having 3 VCR's in the house I purchased the video and the kids have been watching over and over. The video arrived as promised in described condition.
B0007O38XU|3.0|Being a long time Star Wars fan, I thought that Mel Brook<br />may have gone one evil empire too far here?<br />I enjoyed the movie, but the character of Luke<br />was pretty much left out?<br />Anyway they never made a chapter eleven or 10 prequels did they?<br />You realize that the last three prequels and the last paint into av corner episode all came after this \\"pigs in space\\" comedy.
B00005JPCF|5.0|What can you say about a movie? Either you like it or you don't. My son loves this movie and this is the best price ever!
B000BYRCH4|3.0|The movie seems like a Hollywood sex-ployation of Jessica Alba<br />than a real underwater treasure hunting film.<br />We learn one thing about how to blow sand off a wreck using massive watter blowers, but the rest is a pretty bad drug based plot<br />that gets a lot of people killed by people and sharks.<br />I actually disliked this film after being a long time fan of underwater films from John Wayne on(John Wayne when he played in the movie \\"Reap the wild wind\\". The movie was made in 1941 by the famous film director Cecil. B. Demille.)

B0028SVXR6|3.0|The Mars Volta are an exceptional band that fuse jazz, rock, and latin styles of music into an epic odyssey of aural bliss. Octahedron is a very mellow and laid back version of what this band is capable of. It is nice to have a slightly different album from this band but I am a little underwhelmed by the album as a whole. The moods and soundscapes are still there but the intensity and rock influence is lacking. Only track 5 has the bombastic groove that we have come to love from these guys and it's a case of too little too late. Overall Octahedron is a good addition to their catalogue but it certainly isn't going to be a landmark album for them. Finally I have to say that I am deeply saddened by the underuse of Thomas Pridgen. He is such a great drummer that should be building a killer recorded legacy with a band as good as this.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|As a TMV/ORL fan change is something you expect and get excited for when you first listen to a new offering.  With this album you get the softer side of TMV and I like it.  This is the best vocals Cedric has produced to date as you get a chance to really hear what he can do.  His vocal range is amazing and he is horribly under rated as a frontman/leadsinger.  My only complaint is that while Cedric is given a chance to shine the AMAZING Thomas Pridgen was totatly under used.  After hearing him on \\"Bedlam\\" I was wanting more but was left a little dissapointed.  Still a great offering from the band and I recommend this album to any Cedric Bixler-Zavala fan.
B0017UAO58|4.0|I've not stumbled across a CD like this in ages.  Great mix, moody, mellow, intricate and polished.  Not as abstract as some Radiohead, but not mainstream either.  I do hear some progressive rock influences, not concerned with tradition song forms.  I am anxiously awaiting the next CD.  Great stuff.
0061767581|4.0|This book was a good read but I thought it was going to be more of an autobiography of Lauren Conrad. In other words almost like a behind the scenes of \\"The Hills.\\" Some, if very little of this book was about that. The characters in this book are very flat. This is definitely a good book for teenagers! The main character, Jane is definitely someone a teenager can relate to.
0307454541|3.0|Which for me, is a little too long, how about two hundred pages too long. The investigation into the murder, which is the primary plot line, does not really start until well after 300 pages into the boook. These are some intersting things that happen before that point, but for a murder mystery to take that long for the first real clue to come along, is, in my humble opinion, too long.<br /><br />The main character does not seem too interested to doing much investigating. And so he does not really do any. He does other stuff, like bed women, and eat, and walk, and go to jail, and talk a lot, but he does very little investigating. The longer I got into the book, the more I wondered when any kind of progress would be made in the investigation, and what realy was the point of the 300 page prolouge.<br /><br />There is a good second lead character, in fact, the book would be much better with just her doing the investigation. As an editor, I would have dumped the boring, meandering, main character, and just developed the main story around the female investigator. Her parts are interesting. His are not so much.<br /><br />There is also a second plot line involving corporate bad guys. I would have trimmed most of this out too, it adds little, and drags down the main plot line. And is what much of the not so riveting first 300 pages are about.<br /><br />The book is interesting overall, and very good in parts, and for the most part I enjoyed reading it. But it is also tedious in parts too.<br /><br />At times the english translation is poor, which for a major book publisher, is quite surprisng.<br /><br />I recommend it, but with only three stars
0316010669|3.0|I didn't care for this book much--certainly not as much as I did the author's previous Tipping Point.  This one seemed no more than a bunch of magazine articles strung together, with no over-arching vision or even a unifying thesis.      Ostensibly, it's about the power of the unconscious in judgment.  But there's no Freud in there (neither Siggie nor Anna) except an interesting quote that a reader of the first edition sent him that Gladwell stuffed into the \\"Afterward.\\"  There's also no Butler (who wrote several books on unconscious memory--including one entitled Unconscious Memory) and no William James, who discusses the nature and power of unconscious thought very interestingly in Varieties of Religious Experience as well as in his massive Psychology.  In fact, Gladwell doesn't seem very widely read in this subject at all: he just goes the interviewer route here, talking to loosely connected \\"experts\\" from a wide variety of fields (from battle strategy to auditioning violinists) and then making a half-hearted effort to pull their comments together--all with no any cohesive theory.      Sometimes the \\"blink judgment\\" is desirable (as when a tennis pro can tell when a server will double fault on his next serve or when an art historian can tell a fraud immediately with little or no examination).  At other times it may only result in discrimination against female musicians or black pedestrians.  But Gladwell knows neither when it should be trusted, nor how it knows what he thinks it sometimes knows.  These are issues that have been studied for the last couple of hundred years, yet Gladwell doesn't cite a single source in his book and doesn't seem to have read a very much on the topic.      But well, why should he?  It reads quickly and is a best-seller anyways. Besides, Gladwell's got his next golden goose to think about....
0385737424|5.0|Miranda and Sal have been best friends practically since birth. They did everything together--from daycare naptime to walking to school--until sixth grade when Sal is suddenly punched by the new kid. Sal shuts Miranda out of his life, and that's when Miranda's life starts to spin out of control. The spare key to Miranda's apartment is stolen, the crazy guy on the corner's behavior becomes even stranger, and Miranda starts receiving mysterious notes from an undisclosed person. These notes are what freak her out the most because they reveal things no one should know, things that haven't even happened yet. But even though Miranda would like to forget all the crazy new things in her life, especially the notes, she can't, because as unbelievable as the messages seem, the impending tragic death they warn of doesn't feel like a lie. And Miranda might be the only one who can prevent it, if she can only truly understand the notes before it's too late.     When You Reach Me is a truly delightful and remarkably unique story that incorporates themes as simple as friendship and love to concepts as complex as the scientific possibility of time travel. Readers will be drawn into Miranda's story from the first page with the exciting air of mystery Stead creates. The mystery of the notes is probably the most thrilling aspect of this novel, with their seemingly unexplainable appearances and threat of real danger, but all the other sections of the story are also similarly well developed. Stead does a fantastic job of making When You Reach Me believable, even with farfetched theories such as time travel. Miranda, somewhat precocious, and the rest of the cast are three-dimensional characters easy to understand. Stead also portrays the tween years well, when peers' opinions start to make an impact and guy-girl interaction is more about tentative crushes. It's a rare gem when you find a novel that successfully and wonderfully combines a realistic version of everyday life with complicatedscientific mystery as much as Stead has in When You Reach Me. In fact, Stead's storytelling skills are so advanced, I'm surprised this novel is classified as middle grade; the only things middle grade about it are Miranda and her friends' ages and the air of innocence to the story. I think the middle grade audience may even have some difficulty understanding the discussion of time travel; I know I did at times. But as well as that slight confusion, this novel also provokes deep thought of the complexities of modern science, and faith and hope in the future.    When You Reach Me will be enjoyed by readers of all ages, from middle grade up. This novel, one of the sweetest and most genius I've ever read, will be enjoyed by those who liked A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle, a novel much referenced in this story.
0471267554|2.0|Reading a good non-fiction book should be a pleasant experience, exposing you to fascinating and illuminating new ideas which give you those \\"aha!\\" moments we all love.<br /><br />I had no \\"aha!\\" moments reading this book.  I was too busy struggling with all the problems in it.  And there are many, but the concept that sums them all up is a general disrespect for the intelligence of the reader. The author spends most of the time speaking AT the reader rather than WITH them.<br /><br />The most obvious example of this is the unbearable \\"used car salesman\\" tone the author uses, where it feels like he/she can't go more than a few sentences without reminding us how this diet will fix almost every chronic health problem in existence and change our lives.  Really, why don't you let the research and data speak for itself?  Show me, don't tell me.<br /><br />The problem with that is that there is almost no research and data presented to the reader.  The author usually introduces an idea by saying \\"my colleagues and I determined that so and so\\" or name dropping some other researcher, then presents some numbers, hoping that we just take it on authority that the research is correct rather than showing us how the research was conducted and actually comvincing us.<br /><br />To lower the standard of \\"evidence\\" (and respect for the reader) even more, the author even resorts to anecdotal stories of people who underwent the paleo diet and experienced incredible health transformations.  Yeah, just like infomercials do.<br /><br />Then there are the contradictions and unanswered questions this book raises.<br /><br />The author doesn't miss any chances to take pot shots at \\"faddish\\" low carb diets, saying they encourage too much animal food while limiting cancer fighting fruits and vegetables, then later on mentions the inuits lived free of chronic diseases on a 97% animal food diet. The apparent contradiction seems lost on him/her.<br /><br />The author warns of the dangers of fructose, as found in table sugar and high-fructose corn syrop, then in the next sentence says eat all the (fructose-based) fruit you want! How is eating fruit better? The reader is left wondering.<br /><br />The author says it's impossible to overeat animal protein, due to it's effects on satiety, then warns of the dangers of animal protein overconsumption leading to \\"rabbit starvation\\". Which is it?<br /><br />I'm really trying to think of something positive to say about this book.  The author really does seem like he/she knows this subject very well, as evidenced by the 21 page bibliography, but simply does a very poor job convincing the reader.  I do believe in the healthful benefits of following our natural, evolutionary diet, but wanted a bit more certainty, and this book failed to deliver on that.<br /><br />I would recommend reading this book for a basic introduction to the Paleolithic diet, but not as a convincing critical analysis of whether it's healthful or harmful.rop, then in the next sentence says eat all the (fructose-based) fruit you want!

B000BB1MHS|3.0|The packaging for the product was good and it seemed to be in good condition. The movie is pretty good I'd seen it before, definitely different from the original movie, but definitely funny. Johnny Depp has such a range as far as actors go.
0385341008|5.0|The book had a lot of meaning for the women in my book group. I'm the youngest at age 62.  Some of us lived through World War II during our lifetimes, others of us remember the stories of our parents.<br /><br />  This story created a microcosm of the Nazi empire building obsession. Stretched thin and dependent upon the resources of the conquered community, the humanity and inhumanity of both captive and captors made for a well written novel.<br /><br />  Some of the subjects that could not be raised in this novel, but which probably would have brought the Nazis and the Britons closer would have been their shared ideas of race and class.  Without those kinds of tensions, the fate of the heroine, Elizabeth brought enough drama to the novel.<br /><br />  It was a delightful read written with a good deal of wit and purpose.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Myself, my husband and my 9 year old son ALL just LOVE this movie -- it's hard to get my husband to watch a kids' movie more than once. . .but HE requests this one on movie night! :)      In our opinion, it's fun, even a bit educational about food & flavors (you'll wanna eat Italian afterward!), kind to animals ;)  and I love seeing Paris!  Genuine FUN for the whole family.  We buy few movies but we were in line when this one came out! ;)  ENJOY!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I am pre-ordering 3 copies to pass to family and friends that do not live in a city with an art house theater.  I am, also, passing on a copy to friends that are \\"the working poor\\" that are eating junk food.       I raised chickens 40 years ago and sold a dozen eggs for $1.00 to a high of $1.50. Now a dozen eggs is frequently $1.50 and for organic $3.00.  Something is wrong with the economics of 40 years and a tiny dollar change.     I would like to know how law suits against \\"free speech in criticizing large food companies\\"   has been allowed to happen in this country?   WHERE are the multi-famous lawyers that talk the 'big talk' against corporations hiding?  and, why are the lawyers not suing the massive food corporations?     I am glad that this movie did  not blame the poor cow and chickens.  When, it takes 75 gallons of oil to bring the meat to the store  that is not the cows fault.

B000VBIEXS|2.0|I totally agree with other users comment about the horrible mastering of this CD.     First, the overall volume is very low for a CD. Second, the voice is simply buried by the instruments while guitars, piano and organ volume are higher than everything else, including percussions.     Track one is an abomination. The volume REALLY shift after 1m30 or something, and all the song is so damped that more than one audition is intolerable. I skip it and directly go to track 2 everytime.      Just listen to the Amazon samples above and then, listen to the Rhino mix. You won't believe the difference !!    I give it two stars because of the packaging which is an honest effort ...
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is such a unique and fun show. I've owned this set for a few years now and I never get sick of it. There's always something new and fun to bring to the table. Yes, ultimately at the core of it all, its main idea is the relationships between characters, especially the Mom and Daughter relationship(s). (Lorelai + Rory, Emily + Lorelai, even Emily + Rory) However I feel it does a great job of showing character development without it getting too stale or boring.     I really love that this show is so funny. It does a great job of making me actually laugh out loud and if you're anything like me, will try to challenge themselves to figure out where most of their little comedic \\"references\\" come from.     Overall I adore the first season of Gilmore Girls. The writers do a great job of making Stars Hollow become a believable, little, small town community, even including the quirky personalities to be found in said towns. They keep you interested in it from the moment the pilot begins until the moment the final episode of the series ends.     About the only complaint I have is the super-fast talking each character has to be able to speak at just so the writers can get everything in that they wanted to. Thought after a while its not hard to pick up on and you will barely notice it anymore. I guess it could actually add to part of the shows charm if you want to look at it that way.    I enjoyed the special features on this dvd a lot. I feel it gives good insight into the story and characters. I especially loved finding out something interesting about the character of Luke. (Which I could tell you but wont because Im not going to ruin it for anyone.) And it gives good insights into how they were able to get the cast that they ultimately ended up with.    Anyway, this is a very good show to watch. It's a great way to get one's mother/daughter to sit down for an hour and do something together. Actually, my entire family enjoys this show, not just the women. I guess there isenough humor in it to make it passable for guys to watch too.

1585673927|4.0|Jeeves and Bertie Wooster are my all-time favorite Wodehouse characters. The book, although written almost a hundred years ago, is still a lot of fresh fun. Impeccable language, unforgettable characters, and timeless humor - what can be better?<br /><br />Some might consider these short stories a little repetitive, and I will agree with them, but I enjoyed this book nevertheless.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone interested in classic English humor.
B0013A1T8I|2.0|well i have to say this was a very weird film. the fact that they callled their souls deamons was very odd. i do not think that the creater of the golden compass wanted to include any message that would be against god (for all you who didnt know the author of the books doesnt believe in god but i dont think he believes in saten either.)um so yeah very weird movie i didnt get the concept of dust and what it is or why the gobblers wanted to take the children and remove them of there souls was odd and that \\"cut\\" was removing the dust which i still dont get!!!!! watch the movie see what ya think but i just happen to not like this movie with a burning passion because well it is very very confusing.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This was a fantastic movie.  It portrayed a grumpy old veteran who has all his old stereotypes perfectly.  Clint Eastwood made a great choice when he decided this was his last film.    The characters, though maybe not the best actors, still have a lot of dynamic to them - something that you miss in a lot of recent movies.  The priest is a good man who cares about his flock, which is a much better (and true) representation of a Catholic priest than any other movies that have come out lately with a priest in it.      I would watch this over No Country for Old Men any day.
0553819577|5.0|I read a lot of fanticy series and this is one of the best. Had my interest from the start.
1416500294|5.0|The pirate theme has always been one of my favorite. I'm a big fan of the Goonies and Peter Pan may be my favorite Disney animation. I even enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, the other two... not so much. The pirate genre didn't start with Robert Lewis Stevenson's classic novel but his is probably the most influential. Treasure Island was written in the later half of the 1800's before `Shiver Me Timbers' and `Pieces of Eight' became overused pirate phrases and `Dead Man's Chest' became the traditional anthem of movie pirates.<br /><br />It isn't a deep engaging story that makes Treasure Island such a classic. Quite frankly it's a pretty straight forward tale involving a treasure hunt and a mutineering crew of pirates. What makes this story a classic is in the storytelling and Mr. Stevenson makes it seem effortless. When I read books of lesser quality I can sense the author chiseling out the words rather than letting them flow. Books shouldn't feel crafted they should immerse the reader to the point where you forget there's even an author behind the story. Movie scripts are particularly egregious in trying to pound out a catch phrase to stick in the audiences mind but I see it in books also. Without even trying Stevenson created or popularized half a dozen or more sayings that have survived for over a century. With Long John Silver he essentially created the pirate template that has been used endlessly from Captain Barbossa to Spongebob Squarepants', Patchy the Pirate. Just don't blame Stevenson for the fact that John Silver has become a clich&eacute;.<br /><br />Young Bill Hawkins is the main protagonist in the story but Long John Silver steals the show. Silver is a wonderful multi-faceted anti-hero that you can't help but root for by the end of the book. This is the kind of book anyone can read but the target audience is probably teen and preteen boys. In fact it is probably the quintessential example of a book that targets young males, a genre that has essentially withered away from its hay day in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Perhaps books like this could inspire younger male audiences to read more than just comic books and video games cheat codes (not that there is anything at all wrong with either pastime). Let me reiterate that if you are not young or male I still recommend this fantastic book. Treasure Island is definitely a story that exceeded my expectations and lives up to the title of classic.has essentially withered away from its hay day in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.

032147404X|5.0|I am fairly new to photography and I thought this book offered a good deal of insight into the world of digital photography without all techinical reasons for why photos turn out the way they do (I can learn all of that later).  Being a beginer, I thought the book was geared for me and I think it could help anyone that has hit a \\"plateau\\" in their photography.  I also really like Kelby's writing.  The book was a fast, informational read that was laced with the author's own brand of humor that I thought was great.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get started in photography.
1881273156|4.0|Thought this book was very very helpful in understanding what spoke love to my then new wife.  I am a physical touch and words of affirmation kind of guy and of course that was what I thought my wife needed when what really spoke love to her was quality time.  Throughout my marriage I've been able to avoid pitfalls knowing how to love her best and this book gave us the understanding we needed to love each other better.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|But I really disliked the main characters.  I found them to be very annoying, especially the cameraman.  When you're rooting for the monsters to kill the cast off and the movie isn't even halfway over yet, it's not a good sign.  The handheld camera view was also hard to endure.  When it was over, I wanted an hour and a half of my life back.  I don't think that the presence of the \\"MST3K\\" cast would've helped this film any.

0765342294|3.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" is the type of book that incites profound passion in the readers; either they absolutely love it and think it is the greatest sci-fi novel ever written (actually Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" is the greatest sci-fi novel ever written) and that this book will save humanity with it's enlightenment, to the opposite feelings and that this book is the worst piece of trash that has ever existed and is more dangerous than \\"Mein Kampf\\". There are no opinions in between supposedly.    Wrong. While I find much to fault in this book I also find much to praise. First the faults. Looking at it from a literary point of view I don't like the huge amount of uninterrupted prose, going several pages without dialog. I prefer an even dosage of prose and dialog and using the dialog to expand scene descriptions instead of overusing the prose to do that. Minor point, the author Card has already addressed that as his style. Second point is the age of the characters and the level of dialog they use. Another reviewer was right, simply add five to six years to everyone's ages and it all turns out right. Card is less successful defending his view on this.    While I do not agree that there exists an abundance of obscene man-boy erotica, someone does need to explain to Card what real barracks life is like. Also the brother/sister subplot just doesn't seem to work for me despite the superb prediction of the Internet and laptops.    What many people also get wrong is that the main character of Ender Wiggin is not totally without empathy or remorse; on the contrary he is profoundly aware of the danger of descending into the \\"Dark Side\\", he wrestles with his decisions all the time, and Card gives great insight into Ender's inner torment. As the Guru once said, Genius and Self Awareness seldom go hand-in-hand.    What does work is the creation of characters that so many people can relate to. I myself relate to my own fleeing from becoming Ender just as he flees from becoming his brother. On the other hand the character rings so disturbingly true that those readers who cannot personally relate with their own life experiences are appalled by Ender and his compatriots and refuse to accept that any child could ever be like that, though they are unaware of the genuine presence of such people all around them (Boo!).    And that is where this novel works, because it fits its own niche so perfectly. One hundred years from now our descendants will still be debating these very points ad nauseam.
B0028SVXR6|3.0|Hearing Mars slowed down and paced is just like when I heard Rage Against the Machine when they dropped his vocal effects. Not pretty. There didn't seem to be any surprises here. It is still a fan-album, though. You like King Crimson? Well, they always have something new. Just not the youthful shock or awe. Still great to see live - no disappointments there. Not sure I'd be comfortable with my windows rolled down blasting Octahedron. And btw - the math-rock isn't quite so hip-breakingly difficult as before. I really miss the complexity and the difficulty. Then again, after a few concert tours, most bands tone it down a little bit. How you doin' Incubus?
B000FC1LOC|4.0|This story sucked me in immediately and held me to the end. It's an interesting premise and a very well-written portrayal. I don't particularly like the ending, but others might.

B0000062FJ|5.0|Carlos Santana is probably in my top three favorite guitarists ever.  The guy simply knows how to play a guitar solo where *every single sequence of notes* is absolutely spectacular.  I just sit there on my chair and absorb every part of his guitar playing, and I sure hope I'm not the only one out there who does so.  It's so easy to get caught up in what he's doing.      That's why the more guitar solos I hear on any given Santana album, the more likely I'll end up loving the album.  THIS album has its fair share of guitar playing, but another highlight to me is the way the album sounds so beautiful, fresh, and exciting from beginning to end.  This might not seem like a big deal to many people seeing as how Santana has MANY albums that are enjoyable from beginning to end, but you see, this album came out in 1969, when most bands weren't able to come up with something THIS fresh and THIS original.      For that, I truly admire and love this album.  \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" is the highlight for me, but I also LOVE the piano playing on \\"Treat\\" and the guitar playing that I mention above is brilliant the entire time.  I seriously have a hard time NOT drooling over Santana's guitar playing because it really feels like I was put on this planet to absorb every note he plays.  I wonder how many people out there can relate to what I'm saying?  This is NO ordinary guitarist.      The band may not be putting out as many songwriting-perfect albums nowadays compared to the early 70's, but the guitar playing has always remained incredible to me.  Pick up THIS album first (or Caravanserai, another masterpiece).
B00005MP58|5.0|I am a great fan of Pride and Prejudice, having read the book and watched  the later version starring Keira Knightly at least a dozen times.  I found this A&E version at a video rental store, rented it and watched it.  I was surprised at how long it was (5 hours) but I enjoyed it immensely. It was well worth the extra time.  It followed the book quite well and included much that had to be left out of the shorter version.  It is a wonderful production and superbly acted.  I had to own it for myself.  I heartily recommend it to all Jane Austen fans.
0451219597|5.0|Follett's books always keep me reading, even long after the sun has set. Jackdaws is even more fascinating, since I'm a woman,  cuz it's about women spies in WWII. We tend to think all brave \\"resistance\\" spies are men and that just wasn't the case...
B001PPLIFU|5.0|We were introduced to a seasoned, machco, womanizing, wise cracking British Secret Agent 007 through the fabulous Sean Connery.  Surrounded by a cast of supporting characters; M, Q, Moneypenny and Felix Leiter and lots of gadgets.  We never got an indepth relationship or background character information.  Just good special effects, action and stories.  And of course the arch evil enemy organization, S.P.E.C.T.R.E..    40 plus years later 20 movies and 5 James Bond's we start again, fresh, a new beginning of 007's career.  Casino Royale, James Bond's 1st 007 assignment without extreme gadgets but great character development and a fantastic story, a new James Bond (aka Daniel Craig, awesome!) This was a ground breaking movie to re-establish 007 into our lives.  A new original and deep (OUTSTANDING PLOT) storytelling experience.    A first also was \\"Quantum of Solace\\" a sequel or Part 2 of \\"Casino Royale\\" a continuation of Bond's in depth character.  Plus closure, finale to many loose ends.  Brilliant!!!!!   AND we now have a new evil organization, \\"QUANTUM\\" (GREAT VILLANS).  \\"M\\" is the only returning supporting character.  Judi Dench is wonderful as Bond's boss.  Dedicated \\"M\\" and Bond having a stormy relationship through \\"Quantum\\".    This Blu-ray installment captures all the action, visuals and sound that is expected of HDTV or HD Home Theatre now better than the movie theaters.    Quantum begins / continues where Casino ends!!  All key characters return and their destinies are determined in Quantum.  Daniel Craig's James Bond has a more human, compassionate dedication to \\"Her Majesty's Secret Service\\".  We get to witness how 007's character develop and personal relationships are deeper and more satisfying.  The storyline is very detailed and sophisticated.  Dialogue is complex and important information is quietly and effectively used to move the story along.  A weaving of the grandest style.    Believe you me this new James Bond is awesome.  More more action and special effects and edge of seat events.  Such gratifying conclusion to this 2 parter.    Give this James Bond (Daniel Craig) a chance he is brilliant!!!    Special Features are many and behind the scenes data is quite informative!!!     This is a MUST HAVE Bond movie!!!!   Enjoy.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|The sound quality is incredible and the performance is amazing.  Did I mention that it contains 2 of the most talented musicians in the world?  This is one of the best Live albums that has been released in the last 20 years...    You can't go wrong with buying these CDs...absolutely fantastic!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I think the most surprising part about this book was how intense it was - it feels like a very fast read but as it turns out it's just so engrossing that far more time passes than you think!    I read it so that I could discuss it with my nine year old nephew.  It's quite good and the perfect level for him - the names are tough and I agree with his assessment that it would be nice if they had a pronunciation key in there somewhere.      I do have one fear that he may take this as \\"gospel\\" truth on the Greek mythology but any classes he has in it won't be for years yet.  Some of the characterizations are mis-matched to what we learned but overall it was really a great way to introduce the concepts and characters from mythology.    Percy is a great protagonist, with a clear sense of his own limitations and a desperate desire to overcome or at least compensate them.  He takes them in stride and is very matter of fact about them, which will help kids who have some concerns, whether over their own struggles with spelling and reading or with their friends' struggles.  I think it treats things like dyslexia and ADD and ADHD pretty respectfully without minimizing the necessity to overcome them or find ways to harness them.
0205313426|5.0|Though this book was written many decades ago (co-author E.B. White also wrote Charlot's Web,) the information contained within is timeless.

B000RIWAVW|2.0|I don't understand what people saw in this movie. I bought the movie because it was cheap and I was looking for a good horror movie to add to my collection because I am a big fan of the genre. However, the movie itself was a huge disappointment. It was very slow moving, not scary and overall, the plot was weak. It basically is about a mass murdering other worldly person named Micheal Myers who goes around and slaughters people for no reason but to kill. Not only are there not many kills but hardly anything happens in this movie and it was just very boring. There was almost no action except for the final encounter at the end. Critics said this was one of the best and most scariest horror movies made. They were dead wrong. To name anything positive about the film, I liked Micheal Myers theme song but that's it.
B000I9975M|5.0|This is a funny, quirky, family style comedy that can be a bit violent at times but most of the violence is forgivable by way of a laughable predicament that the two main losers get themselves into.  With the supporting cast and the high paced action followed by insane thought out story lines this movie is one that you can watch over and over.  There are a couple of suggestive scenes but they are done in true Asian fashion with little crudeness.  So if you have little one watching it should be o.k. as long you don't mind them watching someone getting smacked over and over or a bit of minor cursing.
B0024F08RO|2.0|The first two seasons of this show were amazing, never dissapointed, and the characters were rich, motivated, and unique. Watching season 4 makes me want to watch season one and two again. These are not the same characters. The writing is hokey, and awful. There is no driving force, and too many hokey \\"aha!\\" suprise moments. The characters seem to be written wrong deliberately. T-Bag pronounces a word wrong, and is corrected (would never happen), Sucre has a man crush on Bellick, and Bellick is a smarmy good guy. No way. I know they had to hurry up and end it since they probably knew they were cancelled halfway through the season, but they really screwed it up. Just buy the first two seasons (possibly the third), and pretend like the end of that season is the end of the show. You will be happier.

B00000K31V|5.0|In the future, a special technological and biological achievement has been created called \\"eXistenZ\\" which is an organic living cybernetic thing that taps people into a virtual reality video game universe that makes them escape from reality. An inventor woman named Allegra (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who created ExistenZ has been targeted for assassination but lucky for her, a security guard named Ted (Jude Law) saves her and must try everything in his power to protect her. However the two must play the game of ExistenZ as they are in a special artificially created world that feels real soon becomes a dangerous game of life and death.<br /><br />Underrated futuristic Sci-fi/horror/action thriller from famed Canadian director David Cronenberg (\\"Scanners\\", \\"The Fly\\", \\"Videodrome\\" and \\"History of Violence\\"). The film co-stars Ian Holm, William Dafoe, and Sarah Polly as it offers an interesting yet smart storyline with bizarreness and of course some neat special effects. It's a gory yet action packed thrill-ride that came out during the same time as \\"Matrix\\" in 1999 yet it's almost as good as that movie but it's more of a long awaited semi follow-up to his masterpiece \\"Videodrome\\" in the traditional sense. Howard Shore who is also collabrated on Shore's films (Except \\"Dead Zone\\") does a fine score in this movie and there's good performances with ideas that make this one of David Cronenberg's most overlooked movies that has gained cult status.<br /><br />This DVD has only one extra and it's the trailer but that's ok it's still great as it is.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Tron\\", \\"Videodrome\\", \\"Scanners\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", \\"Akira\\", \\"Total Recall\\", \\"The Running Man\\", \\"Vanilla Sky\\", \\"V For Vendetta\\", \\"Minority Report\\", \\"The Fly (1986)\\", \\"The Matrix Trilogy\\", \\"The Animatrix\\", \\"Ghost in The Shell 1 & 2\\", \\"Children of Men\\".

B000002KBU|5.0|This recording belongs in your collection. Saying it is a masterpiece is understating the issue. Along with Patty Griffin's \\"Living with Ghosts \\". I can think of no finer female music or lyrics. This is right between the eye's.
0385474547|1.0|I read this twice for college lit and I can't stand it. It was slightly better the second time around but that didn't make me enjoy it any more. I completely disagree with missionaries coming in and slaughtering cultures in the name of \\"salvation\\" so, it's not a fun read for me.
B00000G5WJ|5.0|I'm trying to find a song that Debbie Allen and Albert Hague sang together on the television show Fame and was looking for the soundtrack, found this, but it doesn't list the songs.

0316017922|5.0|I liked it.  I try to read each of Gladwell's new books, and so each new one doesn't seem like a new book per se, but a continuation of a saga of learning.  In this book, Gladwell mainly addresses the influence of culture on performance.  While I found it interesting, I can't make much practical use of the book, because I cannot change my cultural background, for better or worse, and probably am not wise enough to do so if I could.  I can try to leverage my culture's strengths and guard against its weaknesses, which Gladwell advises, but I endeavor to do that already.      So, while I liked the book, I don't see much potential for impact to my life, beyond making me better-read.  In contrast, \\"Talent is Overrated,\\" by Geoff Colvin, addresses the `IQ problem,' and from Colvin's book I could see some life applications - - in terms of implementing `deliberate practice.'      So, as a long-time Gladwell fan, my advice is: read \\"Outliers,\\" but after reading \\"Talent is Overrated,\\" by Geoff Colvin.
0312383436|4.0|Out of all of Wickham's books, I liked this one the best. It is about 10 years old, but much of the content is still relevant. Characters were well developed and the reader is given a decent insight into their background and purpose. How much of one's past impacts decisions in the future? Telling the truth is important to any relationship and is at the core of this novel. The main characters are not honest with themselves or one another, never mind with the supporting cast, which does result in their questioning decisions and actions made by all.<br /><br />My main area of discontent is that most of the plot is predictable. One or two twists had me guessing but the majority of the time, I was just waiting to read what I predicted. In addition, the ending is very tidy, to use a British expression. There are few if any loose ends, which does provide closure. Depending on how you like your novels, you may or may not like that writing style. I think it is a decent read and worth acquiring - either purchasing or from the library.
0743298039|4.0|It took me a few months to get through this book.  It was slow in spots, and though the story was interesting, perhaps it didn't suck me in as much as I'd expected (or hoped) it would.  I'm glad I stuck with it, though.  Without giving too much away, there are some pretty huge twists in the last few pages that make the slow journey of getting to that point worthwhile.  I found the ending to be satisfying (and, more importantly, plausible in the context of all that had come before).<br /><br />If you like fast-paced action, this is not the book for you.  But if you can appreciate a story that unfolds slowly, then you just might enjoy The Thirteenth Tale.
0452295548|4.0|This was a facinating book to read.  I had heard her interviewed on NPR and immediatly ordered it.  I loved how she explained how the hemispheres of the brain work together.  It was written in laymans terms, easy to understand.  I did not give it a 5 star rating because near the end of the book she got a little spacey and seemed to get into new age type thinking.
B002FLO0MG|3.0|\\"Stargate\\" is, obviously, the movie that later spawned the hit \\"Stargate SG-1\\" TV series, and its spinoffs.<br /><br />But taken on its own merits, \\"Stargate\\" is a pretty entertaining blockbuster with some big flaws. It uncomfortably straddles the fence between \\"shoot-em-up bombs'n'action\\" and \\"mythology sci-fi,\\" but provides a solid villain, some sketchy writing, and the foundation for a hit TV show. Well, it's definitely far better than your average sci-fi blockbuster.<br /><br />Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) has just lost his job, when a mysterious old lady invites him to become involved in a secret military project. Soon he finds out why -- a massive stone ring found in Giza decades ago, with strange symbols on a central ring. When they use his calculations, the Air Force is able to open a wormhole to a distant galaxy.<br /><br />Obviously a recon team is sent through, led by the grieving Colonel O'Neil (Kurt Russell). This new world is a desert planet, inhabited by a race of primitive human slaves who practically worship the strangers. But things turn deadly when a pyramid ship descends on the desert, and a malevolent \\"god\\" decides to obliterate Earth -- using a nuclear bomb O'Neil brought along.<br /><br />It's a pretty straightforward action plot -- scientist opens gateway to new planet, bad guy shows up and makes trouble, good guys attack bad guy with the help of plucky natives. \\"Stargate\\" doesn't add much to the typical formula, but it does dress it up with gilded robes, giant stone statues, glittering starships and sandswept deserts.<br /><br />In fact, spectacle is what \\"Stargate\\" excels at -- it has big armies of invading, big ships, big pyramids, and big battles with Ra's warriors. When it comes to gun battles and explosions, Roland Emmerich does a pretty decent job. However, he gets mesmerized by the gilded interior of Ra's starship and the prettyboy alien slinking around -- the middle part of the movie is very slow-moving.<br /><br />It's more clumsy at the intimate stuff of character development, such as Daniel's serious romance with a chief's daughter, or O'Neil's depression over his son. It just never feels natural or deep. The accompanying dialogue is usually pretty solid, but sometimes gets downright clumsy (\\"I don't want to die. Your men don't want to die. These people don't want to die. It's a shame you're in such a hurry to\\").<br /><br />Spade pretty much steals the show as a lovable geek who sticks to his guns, even if it makes him a laughingstock. And the geek gets the girl, not the military grunts -- a nice change. Russell is stuck with a rather stiff, humourless military man, although he loosens up in the last lap. And Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital and Erick Avari all get kudos for making the lovable, deep characters come alive without a word of English.<br /><br />The ultimate edition actually has two different versions of the film: the director's cut and the original theatrical edition, and the transfer is awesome. But the extras are a bit skimpy -- basically you have a handful of featurettes (and one is devoted to aliens and the pyramids!) plus some commentary.<br /><br />\\"Stargate\\" is a fun movie for the spectacle and slam-bang action scenes, so long as the weak scripting doesn't hold you up.

0307266303|5.0|First, I want you to know that was not a runner when I bought this book, but Born to Run convinced me that I needed to become one. I picked it up on a whim because it looked interesting and I was intrigued by the brief description on the back. I never would have guessed that it was one of the best books that I would ever read.<br /><br />Sure, it's a book about running, but it also covers so much more.  McDougall writes about his personal quest to find out \\"why his feet hurt,\\" but he also writes about ultrarunners (Jen and the Bonehead are two of my favorites), the Taramahura Indians, barefoot running, and several significant scientific theories related to running. As a person with a degree in both anthropology and philosophy, the section on the evolutionary theory that humans developed as a running species (the Running Man Theory) riveted me. In fact, it made perfect sense. We need to run, if we are going to stay healthy because that is what our bodies have evolved to do.<br /><br />In addition, I suffered for years with lower back pain, but I never considered that my shoes had anything to do with it. Since reading this book, I've started paying attention to what type of shoes are on my feet and the pain has gone away. Also, the section on diet was quite valuable.<br /><br />In short, this book helped me to look at running in a different light and it made me reevaluate my entire lifestyle. Since reading this book, I've thrown my overly expensive sneakers in the trash, changed my diet, started running, and I'm looking forward to competing in my first marathon this fall. To be honest, I've never felt better in all my life. Born to Run is one of the best purchases that I've ever made and I highly recommend it. Thanks McDougall.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|WOW!!! This was one great movie. To this day, I'm still a huge fan of the game and I'm also a huge fan of this movie when I first came out. Since I don't have a Hi-Def tv yet, I can't make much comment on how great the resolution is. What I can say is that I do think the the visuals are beautiful and on a regular tv, they look fantastic. Thanks to the reediting and addition of scenes, the movie is alot more easier to follow with depth given to characters such as Denzel. I recall hearing that when creating this movie, the creaters weren't fully happy with the results. This is probably what they were really looking for in the end. One of the things I like best about the Blu-Ray version is a feature that basically gives you a run down of the events in the games. Overall, it's a great improvement over the original and a must have to anyone who's a fan of the original game.
0743270754|5.0|I chose this because of the story of Obama's reading it and finding things worth emulating, and because it was supposed to be terrific.  I certainly hope so and it is. Lincoln was simply amazing at seeing both details AND the big picture, knowing when and how to be patient, leading to successful timing of actions, and in being able to be secure enough to allow personal affronts if that meant focusing on higher objectives.  In the words of Union General Ulysses S. Grant, \\"... he seemed to possess more of the elements of greatness, combined with goodness, than any other (man)\\".  The other people surrounding Lincoln are likewise made so lucidly that it is easy to understand them as humans of mixed qualities and wholeness.  Seward, Stanton, Grant, Hay and Nicolay, and others come off so fine as to motivate further curiosity about them.  Others, Chase and McClelland and to some degree Fremont, do not fare so well.  The women and children and families are also important and included and well done, Lincoln's wife Mary, Chase's daughter, Seward's wife, and many others come to mind.   My own biography doubt was thoroughly cured in the reading. In Goodwin's sure hands, the people and times of Lincoln's life flow with terrific clarity.  She used detail, quotes, and observations from what had to have been exhaustive and meticulous learning on her part.  I will surely look into her other biographies.  This one is great.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best excercise DVD I have ever used.  I typically jog for exercise, but when it gets really hot, in the summer, in Central Texas, its nearly impossible to jog outside after 9AM.  I bought this DVD to help me get in my daily exercise, when I miss my morning run.  I actually think I burn more calories doing this DVD than I do on a 30 minute run.    The first time through I was very sore a couple days later, but felt stronger and tighter all ready.  I would compare the exercises in this DVD to some of the classes offered at the gym, where you use light weights and do high reps.    I highly recommend this DVD, but would caution against doing it if you are an extreme beginner.  I think it would be too tough for someone who is not all ready working out.

0316044695|5.0|This book was amazing. It kept me on edge and was well written and authentic. I have to admit-the first part, the training for the Seals was interesting but nowhere as compelling as the excursion into the Taliban war zone, after the initial Seal training. I understand more about the military than I ever thought I would know or even want to. This book is like an action movie in print!

0375703764|4.0|To be honest, I picked up this novel because of the abnormal way the author chose to present it after I flipped through it in the bookstore.<br /><br />What I found was a visual labyrinth that was as interesting as the story itself. It's important to keep in mind that this is a faux essay written about a video within the universe of the novel. It is about a guy who finds that a house he and his long-term girlfriend bought is bigger inside than outside. Before long, a hallway appears, leading to a labyrinth.<br /><br />This part of the novel kept my attention pretty well, for the most part, leaving me a little bored when the author goes off into the scholastic aspect of the faux essay, such as quotations from some real and imaginary sources. It helps solidify the illusion of an essay, but it detracts from the novel itself.<br /><br />The other part of the story has to do with a man named Johnny Traunt who is reading this faux essay that he found from a dead friend of his. In my opinion, this could've been left out as it detracted from the novel more than the scholastic parts. When reading, one would be reading through the labyrinth story and see one of the many footnotes and some of them would be citations, but a lot of them were personal stories from Traunt that had absolutely nothing to do with the story itself. Traunt is ripping the spotlight away from the labyrinth story to talk about himself.<br /><br />Upon a second reading, I might pick up on some subtelties about the constant change, but reading through the first time, I get as lost as the people in the Navidson Record (the report in the labyrith story.)<br /><br />All in all, it was an entertaining novel, but I feel a lot of it was to pad it and make it 700 pages. After all, the author does that in a couple of other different ways such as putting a few words on each page, leaving a couple of them blank, putting in pictures, and so on.<br /><br />Also, I've heard people say the story is frightening. I didn't see it. Maybe I missed something, but neither story scared me. I don't really get how someone could be scared, but it was entertaining.<br /><br />I give it a B-. It loses points for pointless graphic sex scenes, an overuse of foul language, and the overuse of Johnny Traunt. I plan on reading it a couple more times in the near future. Once just the Labyrinth story and the other just the Traunt story. May raise it to a B+.tory scared me. I don't really get how someone could be scared, but it was entertaining.    I give it a B-.

B00007KQA3|3.0|We have not watched entire movie yet although this is a DVD we having been wanting for a long time after seeing snipets.
6304698682|3.0|The DVD transfer for this film is not very good.  It's grainy and lacking in the detail quality one normally associates with modern DVD releases.    The storyline is straight out of George Stevens' masterpiece, \\"Shane\\", filmed 2 decades before with Alan Ladd and Jean Arthur.  While \\"Pale Rider\\" has a little more realism thanks to location shooting, that's as close as it gets to the original.  We never see the conflict within the protagonist (Eastwood) that made \\"Shane\\" so good.  The rest of the cast seems to struggle somewhat with their roles and I have stuggled to give this film and the DVD transfer more than 3 stars.  Just buy \\"Shane\\" instead.    Recommended for:  Eastwood fans and, perhaps, western movie fans.

Since there's such a significant age span, this is difficult to do. This game totally ROCKED in terms of keeping the whole family having fun together.
067088278X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books from childhood. It is beautifully illustrated with simple verses that are not too complicated for those just learning to read. It's probably been 15 or 20 years since I've seen this book, but I still remember each verse.
1416534784|5.0|Out loud to your family, or silently to yourself, reading this magical classic inspires the best of feelings, making it impossible to feel anything but happy, appreciative, and content.  Dickens' wonderful story about the meaning of the Christmas Spirit is a story that we all know, but if you haven't enjoyed the original version (or haven't for a long time) I strongly recommend you do so, and soon.  While the cartoons and children's books get the general gist of the story across, they lack the subtle qualities that make it so beautiful and compelling in its original form.  Heart-wrenchingly emotional scenes of Family and chuckle-inducing moments of humor propel you through this story that provides a powerful lesson for us all.<br /><br />Also, this short book provides an excellent example of the writing style of Dickens without getting into an 800+ page monstrosity that most of his other works are.  You'll almost certainly find you love his subtle wit and dry sense of humor while reading this one, and I then encourage you to seek out those other monstrous and magnificent novels.<br /><br />Whether you buy it in this version, or another, get your hands on Dickens' original tale.  Treat yourself to an uplifting story as you remember what it means and how it feels to have the Christmas Spirit.

B001WCBPCW|5.0|I'm old enough to have seen rock music recycle itself several times over. In some ways this makes me jaded, not easily impressed by the latest 'hot act'. However about once every decade or so artists come along who make such a huge impression on me that I buy everything they produce, never stop listening to them, and they take their place in the playlist I'll be jamming to when the guy with the long scythe comes for me. In the 60s it was Free (Paul Rodgers), Hendrix and Small Faces; in the 70s it was Bad Company (Paul Rodgers again), Skids (Stuart Adamson) and Santana; in the 80s it was Big Country (Stuart Adamson again), The Cure and R.E.M. In the 90s I was blown away by Pearl Jam and The Verve. Now, with no disrespect to The Cure and R.E.M., who both put out perhaps their best albums in 15 years in 2008, the last 5 years have for me been dominated by Kasabian and Interpol. About Kasabian: I have sons who are older than Tom, Serge & co but that doesn't detract from my awestruck reaction to Kasabian as a band. Everything I have ever loved about British music is emcompassed in Kasabian's first three albums and this latest offering, West Ryder, etc. is perhaps the best of them all. If a better album comes out this year I'll be surprised. Buy it, you won't be sorry.
B0029358GM|4.0|Sky Blue Sky served as a reboot for Wilco.  After three albums of increasingly experimental pop music, Sky Blue Sky was an anti-grower.  It took Wilco back to it's roots and had more in common with the bands debut AM than with their three previous albums of increasingly experimental pop.  It was shocking at the time considering where the band had been musically, but in hindsight it made sense.  Jeff Tweedy kicked his migraine medication addiction, he had his stressful partnership with Jay Bennett 6 years in his rear view mirror, and he had a consistent band lineup for the first time in his life.  So it's no wonder Sky Blue Sky sounded a bit conservative.  He was starting over musically.    Wilco (The Album) is the new Wilco's version of Being There.  It's not quite the amazing leap in songwriting and quality Being There was, it's more like a modest step forward, but it's a step forward nonetheless.      (The Album) is front loaded with four great songs.  Wilco (The Song) is arguably the loosest and most fun they've ever been.  It's literally about Wilco taking care of their fans, giving them an aural shoulder to cry on.  Wilco will love you baby.      Deeper Down is a very poetic song with some great imagery.  It's also has some very beautiful moments and some nice shifting dynamics.  One Wing features some beautiful moments as well, including some great guitar playing from Nels Cline.      Bull Black Nova is the best song on the album.  Lyrically it seems like the sequel to Via Chicago, where the subject of the song has killed his girlfriend, has blood in his hair, and is driving a bull black Chevy Nova with the body in the trunk.  It's actually a pretty startling contrast to the lovely pop of the previous two songs.  It's got a jerky and choppy feel to it.  It's the only song on the album with any real tension.      After the first four songs however Wilco lapses in to soft rock or references the best of 70s rock and pop.  You and I has that poignant moment on Gray's Anatomy feel.  It's grown on me a bit, but it sounds a bit cheesy.  You Never Know sounds like a combination of My Woman from Tokyo by Deep Purple and Everyday People by Sly and the Family Stone.  Sonny Feeling has some pretty overt power pop references in it.        Though the last 7 songs aren't up to the quality of the first four, it's still an enjoyable listen.  They're all strong compositions melodically and lyrically.  The fall in to the solid but unspectacular category.  They sound like Tweedy and company are on cruise control instead of writing more challenging material.  The end of Everlasting Everything is a nice way to end the album, because it sounds like the song is unraveling.    Hopefully the small steps forward on Wilco (The Album) will lead to some kind of late period great album some time down the line.  The steps forward here are encouraging, but the band does lapse in to predictability a times.  Still, any Wilco fan will enjoy (The Album).
0756405890|5.0|I don't normally write reviews, this is actually my first, but I loved this book THAT much and seeing people give it one star here really pissed me off.  You ever watch a really great movie with your friends and then the minute it's over, you just can't wait to talk about it, only to have them say something like \\"eh, it was ok\\"??  Doesn't it make you want to smack some sense back into them?  That's pretty much how I feel now.  What is there not to like about the book?  It's exceptionally well-written, has characters so mesmerizing I can practically picture them and really feel what they feel, and it leaves you begging for more.  Don't get me wrong, if you're expecting some Warhammer 40,000 type of non-stop,brutal action, then this is probably not your cup of tea!  The more mature readers couldn't have picked up a better book.  I even regularly check the author's website for details on when book 2 is coming out, and I don't do that for any other authors... Martin, Sanderson, not even the late, great Jordan!!
B0015QT78O|5.0|Best show of the '80's . Loved the music and story! Stumbled on a Starman convention at the Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. so I know there are other people that want it. I was pregnant and on a leave of absence from skydiving at the time or I would have not watched TV. Starman with Robert Hayes was a wonderful way to spend a Friday night. Too soon it was gone, like FireFly of recent times. Linda Kretzler Dayton Ohio.

B001SO69IY|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Red and Meth in concert in Philly in November 2008. They were so on point it was ridiculous kinnda like this album. This is the second best Hip Hop release of 08 after Q-Tip's The Renaissance. Meth and Red having amazing breath control, their rhymes are tight and creative and they have matured very well as a duo. This album is a great follow up to The Blackout. Too bad they didnt get much press or air time.
0805027009|5.0|I recently recieved my vintage copy of \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" by Dee Brown, sold to me by Carol Symonds at mightyreader bookseller.  The second edition hard copy was exactly as advertised: tight binding, as-new dust jacket, mylar cover with little wear anywhere on the book (and the book is almost 40 years old), all for a very reasonable price.  I strongly recommend any book sold by Ms. Symonds or mightyreader bookseller.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|I read a few reviews of this product then stopped when I encountered too many varying opinions. This was definitely an instance where this die-hard Michael Jackson fan needed to make a personal critique.<br /><br />Although not as refined as the music videos that we use to seeing, this was a pleasant trip into the past. Vintage M.J exhibiting his first attempts at this form of expression. A couple of his earlier video's somewhat rudeimentary by today's standards but oh the vision of this great entertainer was present.<br /><br />Watching some of the great performances of this world-renowed artisit has been of particular comfort for me during the days following his sudden passing. Already this DVD is giving me a great deal of joy and I only got it delivered today! Hours of noteworthy entertainment from the late, great Michael Jackson available at the touch of a button. What a pleasant surprise to recieve a product even more compelling then it hinted to be.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Entertaining series, but if you have read the books you'll find that the stories are a bit different.
015206396X|5.0|Kristin Cashore's Graceling is a wonderfully surefooted novel that pleases from start to finish.  It is set in the land of the Seven Kingdoms, where some (Gracelings) are born with a particular talent ranging in scope and usefulness:  mind-reading, fighting, cooking, climbing trees, etc. The main character, Lady Katsa, has a fighter/killer Grace which she usually employs (rarely happily) in the service of her uncle, King Randa as his \\"muscle.\\"  The story opens with a bang (actually some flying kicks, savage punches, useless swordplay, and so on) as Katsa uses her Grace for her own purpose, performing a daring rescue of an old man, kept prisoner by another king.  On the mission, she meets another Graceling fighter, Prince Po (son of yet a third king).  The rest of the book explores several plot avenues. One is Katsa's growing revulsion at how Randa forces her to use her Grace and her fitful attempts to control her Grace and her anger.  Another is the mystery as to why the prisoner was taken and who was behind it.  A third is the deepening relationship between her and Prince Po as they travel together.  And yet another is the mystery surrounding yet another of the kings of the Seven Kingdoms.  On the surface, we've seen much of this before. The singular magical \\"talent\\" some are born with (LeGuin's Powers series is another good exploration of this relatively common idea), the awkward burgeoning relationship between two young characters (see any number of YA), the character fighting against his/her own powers; a spunky young princess.  But truth is there isn't a lot of wholly new out there; what differentiates the very good, good, middling, and bad, is what you do with the usual ingredients. Cashore, it turns out, is an excellent cook. There isn't a misstep or bad taste anywhere here, making Graceling one of the better reads of the year.  The plot is compelling throughout with excellent pacing--not overly long, no abrupt shifts or lagging sections, lots of tense moments but not piled up one atop the other, good breaks of humor and more quiet moments, mysteries that are resolved at the right moments, twists and turns that connect logically and are well set up.              The characters are strong in their own right--sharply defined, individual, complex (Katsa more than Po but he is fully three-dimensional and gets his own special complexities toward the latter parts of the book) and as compelling as personalities as the plot is for tension and mystery.  Their characters are revealed in a variety of equally skillful ways:  interior monologue, well-crafted dialogue that doesn't feel crafted, actions both subtle and large. Side characters are also nicely sketched in efficient strokes:  Katsa's servant woman, Randa's son Raffin, Po's brother.  The villain is a bit abstract and amorphous, but this is more due to plot requirements than poor writing and its very abstractness adds to its horror.              The relationship between the two of them is also well done--handled in much more adult fashion than we usually see, skipping over the cookie-cutter \\"let's instantly hate each other, bicker endless and falsely for half the book, then resent falling in love and bicker some more over that, then give in and be a couple\\" form so prevalent.  It feels more real than 90 percent of the relationships in fantasy books.     Beyond the big picture of plot and character, there are many lovely moments throughout the novel:  wonderful moments of dialogue, of interior thought, of description (though less so) and some great set scenes.  The novel exhilarates in both the large and small.  It wraps up as a fully independent story, and there are two \\"companion\\" novels (not strict sequels but set in the same world and very roughly around the same time) planned, one of which comes out in the fall.  I'm looking forward to both.  Very highly recommended.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I purchased the complete series of this show today - know how much it cost me? $12 brand new and sealed. And that's Australian dollars. Which makes it about $9 in US currency. The prices on Amazon for this series are ridiculous. As brilliant as it is, who wants to pay $30 for a used copy?     If you're sick of those shows that are rife with cliches, then My So-Called Life is for you. The characters are unique, the dialogue is original and the plots are unpredictable. Really captures the essence of adolescence.
B0027WNRJ0|4.0|I must say that the deluxe editions of the Def Leppard classics are fantastic.  Great bonus cuts and packaging.  I must give them props for giving the deluxe treamtment to Adrenalize, as one would expect only Pyromania and Hysteria, their two biggest sellers, to be remastered.      To those who are calling this their least favorite album, I must say that it was a huge success when released.  I look at albums like X, Euphoria and Songs from the Sparkle Lounge and realize that the Steve Clark connection is what makes this album still listenable nearly twenty years on.  To me, every song is great and worth the rediscovery.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Season One, incredible.    Season Two, I wanted to love it, but ended up thinking it was good.    Season Three, wow what a step up.    1) The characters are evolving: it is great to see.  Grats to the writers for having the courage to take risks.    2) Dexter is faced with new human experiences we haven't seen him have to deal with before.  While these may not be action sequences, they are insights to how he thinks, which I loved in the first season, and felt like I missed in the second season.    3) There is witty writing not just in a few episodes, but many.    4) The action pace may seem slow, but the writers are building you up to experience what Dexter does.  It is worth the cost in action, and there really is plenty to think about on the way.    5) Not least, but the actors, all of them, did a great job! Jimmie Smitts does an excellent job with his guest appearance!        In short, with this season, I would say this series is on par with Sopranos' best seasons and Battlestar Galactica's best.  It really needs to start being given awards for the writing, acting, direction, and music.
B00127RAJY|5.0|After letting my health club membership expire late last year, I started looking around for some free exercise options.  I suppose it is not technically \\"free\\", but I found my cable company offered many workout programs \\"on demand\\" anytime I wanted to workout.  My wife got me watching The Biggest Loser a couple of years ago, so I tended towards the workouts from those trainers that I recognized.    I can say, as a 30-year-old man in above average shape, that Jillian's workouts are great.  The mix of strength, cardio, and abs in different circuits keeps your mind engaged, and with pushups, shoulder lifts, and bicep curls I feel that most all of my male-related muscles are being worked.  I have noticed more quickness in my weekly basketball games and definitely get off the ground better for rebounds.  My wife and I liked the \\"Shred\\" so much that we purchased the DVD, so that we can use all levels at anytime we want.  Thanks, Jillian!
0307269981|4.0|I'm a big fan of Scandinavian mysteries, so I approached The Girl Who Played with Fire with great anticipation and relish. I hadn't yet read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, which had been on my to-read list for months. But since this one landed in my hands sooner, and other reviews said it wasn't necessary to have read the first book, I forged ahead.<br /><br />While it's true that reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't mandatory to understand and enjoy The Girl Who Played with Fire, it really would have added depth and meaning to the experience. The title character (I imagine in both), the fascinating and highly enigmatic Lisbeth Salander, made her debut in Larsson's first book, as did the journalist Mikael Blomqvist, and there are numerous references to the events of the earlier book. Most are explained adequately in passing, but some are kind of left dangling, as if Larsson assumed most readers would have read the books in sequence and was mainly just giving a nod to the rest of us.<br /><br />That said, this is a smart, fast-moving, thriller, with countless intertwined plot lines and relationships. (In addition to Salander and Blomqvist, the chief detective, Bublanski, was a really interesting character.) As a result, Larsson will largely keep you engaged and guessing until the end. I had a few problems keeping track of all of Blomqvist's colleagues and the various cops working on the case, as well as some of the many villains. I also found the sheer range of Salander's remarkable talents, which span fields ranging from computer hacking to breaking and entering to self-defense to security and disguises (not to mention mathematics, which she pursues as recreation) implausible at times. (If Wonder Woman and Rain Man had had a child, she might have been the result.) But if you're willing to suspend belief a bit, you'll likely find this book a highly enjoyable diversion.

B00004RFFS|5.0|For those who are uninitiated your knowledge of Vampire Movies is in no way complete until you have seen the master of them all, Interview with the Vampire . It is the exception to every rule and the rule to every exception . Lush, powerful, poetically charged with emotion and overwhelming in its portrayal of what it means to have everything yet be left wanting by the sheer tedium of perpetuity & immortality - it is a movie that deservedly embodies the meaning of the word 'Epic', so often overused as a descriptive modifier yet very apt herein . There are films of its kind that achieve the status of Cruise Ship but 'Interview' is truly the only Oceanliner out there, the QM2 of its time and its kind . Heavy, calculating, intricately layed out - yet never resting for a moment in its potent ability to storytell . The first half of 'Interview' provides the interviewer (Christian Slater) with the poignant background of who Louis (Brad Pitt) is and where he came from, the arrival of Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) who plays the protagonist human epicenter of the dynamics between the living and the undead, and LeStat (Tom Cruise) who has brought Louis and Claudia, unwillingly, into his world - from which only sunlight, beheading or fire can provide final escape . In the second half of 'Interview' we arrive in Paris circa 1870, Louis & Claudia searching for LeStat's maker and in so doing hoping to find out more about themselves and the knowledge of the dark gifts LeStat has denied them . What they find instead is Armand (Antonio Banderas), at four-hundred years of age he is the World's oldest living Vampire, Claudia & Louis will be torn asunder after crossing paths with the seductive one - Louis's existence will never be the same again . A gilded era guilty pleasure, frought with love, death, grief, betrayal et al . Breathtakingly filmed with a cinematography that renders everything else in this genre to be pale and anemic by comparison - Interview with the Vampire is the heavyweight, the masterpiece of all Vampire movies, in a league and a class of its own, it attains excellence despite the presence of Tom Cruise, introduces the world to an impressive and powerful little girl named Kirsten Dunst and showcases what Neil Jordan is capable of in a timeless classic that will never go out of style . A must have for any serious Vampire film lover and for every collection to be considered complete .

If you love dance, I guarantee that you will love this movie!
0634060384|5.0|This legal 6th edition version is becoming the new standard. Many gripe about missing tunes and different chord changes compared to 5th edition, which was used for 30 years, but complaints seem to come from folks who bought the bootleg 5th edition for $40-50 and can't accept that this newer legit version is only $20. Sour grapes, I think. You decide. Bootleg version is assembled from messy looking photocopies, is expensive, not always easy to find (it's illegal), and finding the Eb, Bb, and bass clef versions can be tough. This Hal Leonard version is clean and easy to read, songwriters are compensated, and readily available in all keys for a low price. Contrary to what some people have said, most musicians that play jazz DO use charts on the bandstand. Nowadays, this is the book to get.

B001U0HBPG|1.0|Three hours long -- a pointless movie.  The make-up was terrible too.  The whole thing was unbelievable and incredibly boring.  The only thing curious about this case of Benjamin Button is why the film was made and why it received Academy Award recognition in the first place.
B000N4SHPS|3.0|Here's an incontrovertible:  There is no state boxing commission in existence that would grant a boxing license to a sixty-year-old.  And there is no heavyweight champ--no matter how lousy his reputation is--that would agree to get into the ring with a fighter of six decades, exhibition or no exhibition.  Sorry, but I just couldn't get past the obvious before suspending my disbelief while watching ROCKY BALBOA, the final (we think) installment of the dearly beloved Rocky franchise.<br /><br />(Had this fight been sanctioned in some foreign country that wouldn't object to the massive risk involved--say the Philippines, or one of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula--the plot would have been more believable, but I digress.)<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone returns in the role he was born to play, only now he's sixty, a lonely widower, and has a son (Milo Ventimiglia) who resents living under his father's famous shadow.  Rocky, while pining away at his wife's grave, realizes he still has a burning rage inside him that must be exorcised--and only a boxing match will do the trick.  Because the video games (or whatever they're called these days) have him actually beating the current reigning champ, Mason Dixon (great fighting name, played by a stoic Antonio Tarner), why not have life imitate. . .recreation?  And the rest is standard Rocky fare, from the training music to the raw eggs.  The fight. . .um, yeah, okay.<br /><br />Sly is Sly, hair color or no hair color, yet this time he is curiously articulate and able to wax philosophical at the drop of a hat.  I kind of liked that.  Burt Young must be tired of playing a drunken idiot.  And the fight. . .um, yeah, okay.  But what raised the reviewing stakes of ROCKY BALBOA in the eyes of this reviewer from two to three stars was the film's ending, which was an impressive tribute to Rocky the movie icon.  After all, this is the last installment of the Rocky franchise. . .isn't it?<br />--D. Mikels, Author, Walk-On

Such a precise and immensely visual book for the reader.      To be consistent with the succinct book itself, I trust the three sentences above give a perspective from a  family of three, who all read the work.  Double bonus for having a female heroine!!    Happy reading!
B0029NY9YO|5.0|I read the graphic novel about 8 years ago and the film is very true to the book. The story answers the philosophical question Who Guards the Guardians? or, in this case, Who Watches the Watchmen?    The movie takes place in 1985 in which all, but 2, superheroes cannot legally exist. Those that continue their crime fighting do so outside the law, Richard Nixon is still President of the United States and tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States are at an all time high.     Some former members of the group Watchmen are targeted for assassination by an unknown killer and the group's members also become ensnared in a conspiracy with worldwide implications.    The point of \\"Watchmen\\" is not one of ideology.     Rather, the conflict exists between the powerful and the non-powerful.     The charachters motivated by power and altrusitic virtue try to force the world to go their way, regardless of the cost.     The central point of the novel and movie is: who is making sure that our leaders/heroes don't run amok?     I think the book's author, Alan Moore, tried to show that the validity of that question doesn't change with political leanings or ideology.    Simultaneously, through 'Watchmen', Moore also demonstrates his rejection of the bankrupt utilitarian notion of 'the ends justify the means' and showing how dieties (in the form of Doctor Manhattan) would not be able to resist the urge of domination.     The end justifying the means is almost always the rationalization of people in positions of power who will, by hook or by crook, work to \\"make a better world\\" even at the expense of other people's lives in order to achieve some sort of \\"common\\" goal for \\"the greater good\\".    A movie like this could not have come out at a better time since almost all people subscribe to the bankrupt idea that sometimes it is appropriate to violate the rights of other people.    After doing so, one need only look in the mirror to see who would be next in terms of having theability to exist erased because \\"the greater good\\" or society demands it.    Also pay particular attention to the character Rorschach, who is based on Steve Ditko's character 'The Question'. He is the only voice in the trailer, with the phrase \\"The world will look up at us and shout: Save Us! and I'll whisper 'No!'\\"    The message of the movie is timeless and, like the film itself, the acting, sets and special effects are all excellent.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|The Logitech G13 is the best gamepad I've used in over 30 years!        In ease of use, and comfort, the G13 is simply amazing. Each button is angled slightly different to provide superb ergonomic fit & feel for your fingers. The gentle slope and curve of the overall controller allows your hand a very comfortable form of function position. The Belkin N50 & N52 have high arched form that is only slightly adjustable. After hours of use the G13 is still very comfortable while the N52's arch is painfully rubbing my palm.        Programming is so easy as to be labeled intuitive. Unlike the Belkin N52TE, the programming of keys and macros is straight forward and automatically saved. Belkin requires you to upload the changes into the controller. I can't tell u have often I saved a new save only to find the change not working because the program did not automatically load the change! Even other controllers such as the Claw & the Wolf aren't as easy to program with macros as the G13.       I've read others complain of the width & weight or the joystick. Frankly, the G13 is about the same size as the other controllers & the weight makes the G13 very stable during a wild firefight! The joystick is the best of any alternative keyboard controller. Besides, like the vast majority of players, I use my mouse and controller buttons for direction & motion control, not a joystick.        This gamepad is a really amazing find for me. I have severe pain in my hands & feet due to nerve damage. To help ease the pain, I have an implanted pain pump. The G13, better than any other controller, has helped me continue to play PC Games, especially World of Warcraft!.       I thank you for reading my review. I leave with one last piece of advice....         BUY The G13 NOW!         \\"DocPayne\\"
B0026J8LHM|4.0|Alot of nay sayers, in regards to Dream Theater's latest cd, Black Clouds & Silver Linings. Well, personally, I think the cd is a solid effort overall. Yeah, there are some not so spectacular moments, but that has to be expected, even from musical masters such as Dream Theater. For those that may feel the band to be on the downside of its career, you may want to think again. Copied straight from their Myspace bulletin, Black Clouds & Silver Linings has broke the Top 10 Billboard Charts in the US. Read for thyself.<br /><br />DT cracks the US Top 10!!!!<br /><br />Body:  Just got this below email from our A&R guy at Roadrunner....<br /><br />Dream Theater's Black Clouds & Silver Linings entered the US Billboard Charts today at #6!!<br /><br />This is truly amazing....that after almost 25 years together, this band is still growing and progressing and doing bigger and better numbers than ever.....I can't think of many bands that can claim that...<br /><br />Plus - a progressive metal album with four songs over 12 minutes in the US Top 10???<br />(wedged between Jonas Brothers, Eminem and Hannah Montana!)<br />Hell must've frozen over!!!!<br />(this must be a first of its kind.....)<br /><br />See the statistics below.....<br /><br />Thank you everybody!

B000002HPT|4.0|I own everything in the DT catalog and I really enjoyed Falling Into Infinity.  There's something on every one of their albums to discover, to enjoy or simply to marvel at.  I appreciate how good these guys are  individually and how amazing they are as a unit.  Few people outside the music business understand the constant conflict between the artist seeking creative autonomy and the record label seeking commercial success (e.g. revenue.)  In fact, no-one should blame DT for seeking that balance within their own catalog (as evidenced by Falling Into Infinity.)  This is their livelihood after all.  It's easy for others to dismiss this album as a \\"sellout.\\"  It's not.  It's different.  Open your ears, appreciate the talent and find something to like.  DT has never been a band to troll out garbage.  So give them a break.
159102594X|5.0|The thoughts in your mind that you wouldn't dare speak aloud, the evil ideas you wouldn't follow through on, the positively devilish things that you'd never want to happen to you but might just be side-splitting if they happened to someone else?  Welcome to Joe Abercrombie's world.<br /><br />In this, the first of three connected works, the author creates a world that in interesting, but the true gems are his characters.  Whether it's the nine-fingered barbarian, with many hard learned lessons from his bloody history, the torturer with no qualms about his work and no illusions that it's always about justice, or the simply vain son of nobility trying to make his name...these characters are your dark side, made real.  It's having a conscience but having to \\"be realistic\\" and often cast it aside.  It's cruelty mixed with dark humor.  These people are both awful and, at the same time, awfully compelling because they're not \\"evil\\" just for the fun of it but because of necessity, culture, or being the middle rung on a high ladder.<br /><br />If you want a work of clear cut good and evil, I advise you to look elsewhere.  This is not it.  The words \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" do find their way into these pages, but never as the absolutes we see in far too many treatments.  And that nuance makes this work (and the two that follow) much more interesting than it would be in a world where one side is right and the other wrong.  If you enjoyed Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series (incomplete as it is) then you will likely find a nice companion in this and Abercrombie's other works.
0380730405|5.0|There is a reason it's called a classic. It is one of the best written books in history, in my option, and it really resonated with me, long after I finished it. My mom suggested it, and usually I don't care for her fare, but I am so glad I read it. I won't go into any detail because I'd hate to spoil it for anyone, but let's just say, it's a winner. Also, I loved the movie--[[ASIN:B001D8W7EU Rebecca]].
159448385X|5.0|My thumb and index fingers left small crinkles and tear marks on several pages because of the odd sensation of actively participating in the story -- gripping the page tighter when reading intense, pulse-quickening, gut-wrenching passages. I often felt as if my heart sank into the pit of my stomach. There were moments when I felt frustrated that I couldn't will my eyes and brain to read and register faster, but I also found myself savoring the prose and imagery despite wanting desperately to know what would happen next in the story.    I very much appreciate the insight and perspective that I've been able to gain from this novel -- of Afghan culture, history, etc. But more so because it was through the voices of two women who give a name and face to those countless nameless/faceless beings that have endured similar experiences. Most of all, I appreciate the acknowledgment of three universal themes: faith, hope, and love.
B001GCUO1G|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy the actions parts, you could tell that's where the money and attention by the part of writers, director and producers (yes you, Jackman) went. I'll definitely get the DVD as many female fans are--for the Eye Candy! I love that Jackman is not so full of himself and that his first solo X-men flick--he spread the hottness around. I don't know if he did this because, he feels more comfortable in a group ensemble; or because he just rather give another actor a hand up. Nevertheless, in this movie you get to see more characters and a lot, A LOT of Fine Men.    LADIES TAKE NOTE:  Ryan Reynolds stands out as Deadpool--so much that a spin-off is in the works. His typical smarta$$ mouth comedy makes his one liners really zing. And the man can swing a pair of swords, and look bada$$ doing so.    Also, a lesser known Korean American actor/model Daniel Henney as weapons expert Agent Zero, makes his first appearance on a US movie. He's mostly known for Korean TV, Cinema and modeling. Yet in this flick, his supermodel looks work in his favor as he brings an icey sharp demeanor that make him one to take note of--and makes fans like me pray for a Agent Zero spin-off. His action sequence at the beginning of the film left me wanting more.     Friday Night Lights star Taylor Kitsch as Gambit was a big crowd pleaser in Comic Con, and he delivers on the big screen. This one might also have a spin-off in the future. The ladies sure love him and the guys seemed pleased with his deliver of the gambler as well.     Howevery I agree completely with other reviews. The plot was weak, and they didn't explain much about Logan's past (which was the purpose of the movie). We kind get a glimpse and quick run through and the rest is all BOOM! BAM! POW! All in all the movie was worth my money. I got a great night out with friends and a lot to drool over for. Thank you Jackman for all that nakedness! *shivers* I am totally still hoping this movie does well on DVD release. Cuz Jackman's such a good guy that he deserves it.       I hope in the upcoming spin-offs they do focus a bit more on the plot. Just a wee more than they did on this one. Cuz altho they might have felt the male comic geeks would love all the BOOM! BAM! POW! actions stuff, and female geeks would love all the nakedness and sexy...Sexy Men, we'd also would like a better story line to bring it all together. I think that's what made the X-men flicks work and do so well, so I hope they go back to that blueprint in future installments.
B001W63DX2|5.0|What can I say, it's Iron Maiden and the best movie I've ever seen in my life. The live songs videos are just out of this world.
B0029358GM|4.0|Wilco has been one of my favorite (the favorite) bands ever since I heard Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and this album continues the band's enduring legacy of great music. Wilco (the album) finds the band returning to their alt-country roots with more relaxed mood and less complex song-writing. This album reminds me of the vibe I got from Being There or Summerteeth.     Jeff Tweedy sounds like he is finally comfortable with himself and the band, which gives this album a really relaxed and laid-back feeling. Tweedy's song-writing has stayed strong and his vocals mesh well with the band. There are no big rockers on this album like Sky Blue Sky or Ghost is Born, but it's ok because all of the songs fit together so well, in the calmer atmosphere of this album as a whole.     The album opens with Wilco (the song), a shuffle that gives a good taste of the band. Leslie Feist is featured on \\"You and I,\\" the vocalist from the group Feist. She sings a duet with Tweedy which makes for a beautiful song. This is followed by You Never Know, which sounds almost reminiscent of a song from George Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass.\\" The album is mostly a peaceful affair, such as \\"Solitaire,\\" one of the calmest Wilco songs I've ever heard. The experimental and rock-out that were common on the last few albums can only be glimpsed at on the last few songs of the album, like on the catchy \\"I'll Fight.\\"     This is a very tight album packed with feel-good, relaxing, country-tinged songs. The band sounds as good as ever; like they finally feel at home with themselves. The songs are all 3-4 minute range and the album is around 43 minutes total, so it's not overdone, and will give you many hours of listening pleasure!
0385737424|5.0|I took a chance and picked this one up for summer reading for my 11 year old daughter. This was a good move.<br /><br />Here are her comments:<br /><br />\\"This is the strangest book I've ever read. It was really good, maybe even as good as The White Giraffe. It's one of those stories where you don't understand what's happening all the time. Ideally liked it.\\"<br /><br />She finished reading it in two nights, so I guess she really did like it. Five stars from daughter and Dad.
B001USHRCK|4.0|While this is a fun set, it is a full fifty dollars more here than at Lego's website. The free shipping doesn't make up for that fact!
1591841992|5.0|An  excellent guide to thinking visually and unleashing your visual creativity. Inside of a few hours, it helped me think of new ideas, new visualizations, and new ways of communicating. What more could I have asked of a book?
B0027G783W|1.0|Snagged this for $4, when it was a Daily Deal over on the MP3 section and I still feel like a overpaid for this. You should not feel like you have to buy the whole album for congruity's sake. There's maybe 1 or 2 good songs and the rest comes off as filler. I loved Play ... this is no Play. I feel like Moby phoned this one in.
B002CGPI3O|4.0|Wait For Me has the feel of a compilation of the mellower songs throughout Moby's career.  For me, the highlights include the crying guitar in \\"A Shot in the Back of the Head\\" (which could have fit on Animal Rights), the desperate \\"Mistake\\" (which would have been a standout on Hotel), and choir-backed \\"A Seated Night,\\" (which could have fit on I Like To Score or Play).    Though a pretty consistent album (I find many of his official releases to be a bit inconsistent in terms of album listening), it feels just a tad too long.  For me, \\"Study War\\" (a poor imitation of Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad/One of These Mornings/etc.) hurts the flow of the album.    Next to Play the B-Sides and Hotel Ambient, I believe this will become my favorite Moby album.
0451169514|3.0|its an ok book but considering the length its not a very good bang per page. Also, a book has never scared me ever so maybe thats my problem. I thought the intro was pretty cool but some of the book just had some painful boring moments. Especially when they took you back in time to discuss some of derrys history. Also, I never cared about what happened when they were kids because you knew them as adults. If they were being chased you knew they werent going to die because they are adults now. I think that really hurts the book.
1416549447|5.0|This new book is more detailed and educational than the original edition and is presented in a more flowing, reader friendly format. It answered some lingering questions I had from reading the first book, making it easier to incorporate the new concepts into improving my running.
B001MYIXAW|4.0|In support of what others have written already, \\"LTROI\\" succeeds wonderfully as a romantic horror film, but this DVD release version suffers from a sub-par subtitle track.  The English dubbed track isn't that great either, but it soars in comparison to the amateurish and overly-simplistic English subtitles.<br /><br />I'm a firm believer that foreign films are best watched (and listened to) in their native languages.  Sometimes the dubbed-voice acting just doesn't measure up.  But until they re-release this DVD with a proper set of English subtitles, the dubbed audio track may be the best viewing and listening option.  Such a shame to give such horrible treatment to such a terrific movie.
B001G8NW6Y|5.0|This classic test is clear, convincing, and sorely in need of re-reading in the era of \\"economic stimulus bills\\"
B000002UJQ|2.0|The album has a few (not many according to me) excellent tracks. But i think I was kinda disappointed probably after all the positive feedback this album received. As said by several reviewers the album has to speak to you. If this is not the case, you probably will not enjoy most of the tracks. This is pretty much my case. But this is only a matter of opinion.    My recommendation is to try to listen to the album before purchasing it coz you could either love it or hate it.    Still the track \\"No Surprises\\" is super famous and really really good.
B001UDYI9K|3.0|I keep wanting to like this new CD from one of the most important APP alumnus, but I can't. Despite a gift for lyrics and phrasing, there's something lacking in this CD from Eric Woolfson. While Woolfson was able to pull this off in Poe, that can't be said here.    In listening over the past few days, it's clear that the brilliant layering of the instruments from the APP is what's gone, whereas in the APP, the vocals were one of the instruments, leading to some amazing compositions over the years, in \\"Woolfson Sings the Alan Parsons Project That Never Was\\" that magic mix is missing.    I also would have enjoyed more extensive liner notes as to where these songs would have fallen in the bigger APP landscape, that would let me compare them more to their siblings that did make it onto the albums since so often an APP theme, both in concept and musical style was key to their success.    For the die-hard collector it's a must have, but to the average listener, it will always feel like something is missing in this album.
0345495004|4.0|This is a very interesting account, a combination of what is known historically and what is plausible supposition based upon research.  It takes a truly gifted writer to make a success of something like this - it took Horan seven years to write the book, and it was time well spent, as the truth, more interesting than fiction, linked with the fiction is really melded seamlessly.  Horan doesn't spare Frank Lloyd Wright, whose arrogance, self-indulgence and disdain for those less talented comprise a character who is very difficult to warm to.  Sometimes you just can't imagine how it would be possible to love such a selfish boor - and, what's more, to leave one's children and relatives and have no regard at all for what would happen in their lives as a result. That's what keeps the pages turning right up to the end.<br /><br />You'll come away with a different view of FLW and you can't help but feel strongly that no matter what the degree of talent a person possesses, it doesn't excuse him for all the havoc he wreaks in the lives of those around him.  He does love Mamah, though, and there are moments of intense sweetness and caring - and there must have been enough of them to cement her attachment.<br /><br />It's great to read a really different book from time to time - it's difficult to find a unique story these days - one that doesn't really ask you to make a judgment.  This love affair just was, and it was at a time in history when there were very strong feelings about women who showed any tendencies to stray from the established path.  It took a ton of courage to follow one's heart in those days, as women were meant to sacrifice their own hopes and dreams in favor of just about everyone else.  So, as you read this book, you'll find yourself saluting Mamah's chutzpah and, at the same time, wondering how on earth she could bring herself to do the things she did.  And, you'll hate Frank one minute, and shake your head the next, wondering how he became the kind of person he was.<br /><br />I'll remember Loving Frank, and put it on the shelf of those I plan to read again in my old, old age.I'll remember Loving Frank, and put it on the shelf of those I plan to read again in my old, old age.
0785126708|3.0|Sometimes writers get lazy and think that just because they want a certain outcome, the reader is not supposed to notice that it doesn't make any sense.    This book is FILLED with examples of nonsense writing.  Take, for example, the first \\"fight\\" (never shown) of the Hulk beating Black Bolt.  Right!  Here's a guy who blows holes through walls with a whisper and can destroy a city with a word.  He can turn the Hulk's brain to jelly any time he wants.  Of course, NOW we know that this Black Bolt was probably a Skrull and that's why he didn't have BB's sonic powers.  But a little THOUGHT on the writer's part could have overcome the discrepancy.  For example: sound doesn't travel in a vacuum, so Black Bolt can't blow a hole in the Hulk's spaceship.  The Hulk tells BB, \\"Surrender yourself and let me beat the snot out of you or we'll bomb your people from space and they'll all die.\\"      Would that this was the only example.    - The Hulk breaks Dr. Strange's hands.  Why would the Sorcerer Supreme allow an angry monster to get that close to him without some kind of protection?    - Iron Man is head of the Avengers and SHIELD and has close ties to the US government.  A guy that smart would be like a general, using his troops to protect his homeland.  - The Fantastic Four would fight literally to the death to prevent Reed Richard's being captured by the Hulk.  And if he was captured, Susan Storm would just look at the guy who captured her husband and say, \\"You're dead meat,\\" right before she pops a force field in Hulk's brain AND his heart.    As I said, a little thought could deal with these discrepancies.  But the problem was: the Writer was too busy trying to Make A Point, namely that Hulk isn't the real monster, everyone else is.  (Sorry, bub, but your rage, though sometimes justifiable, has put countless innocents at risk for years. That makes YOU the monster, not the ones trying to protect citizens.)
006097625X|5.0|This book not only helped legitimize a misunderstood art form for a new generation, it also changed my perception on how I philosophically view the world.  I've read this book many times now and have shared it with many of my non-comic exposed friends.

Whether you are a fan of comics or not, this book should have value for everyone.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I honestly can't believe I wasted ten dollars and two hours of a beautiful Sunday afternoon to see this movie. The scripts are chopped up like rotten sushi with a dull knife and then pasted together with super glue, with a couple gunshots thrown in for good luck. Harrison Ford is obviously too old for this, and no-talent pubescent clown Shia LaBeouf just throws in a couple punches for the ladies. And it's still unclear what time period we're actually in. All the characters that made the first three movies good are dead. If you can have an alien spaceship take off from a canyon in the middle of nowhere after killing another knowledge-phychopath, and then having them all float to the center of the room in extreme graphics worthy of Michael Bay and his crew, then why not just reanimate the dead? Bring 'em back! Maybe it'll boost this review up another half a star!

He writes, \\"This book employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems contribute.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|Michael Jackson was a genius and much more talented than the boobs running around today that cannot even write thier own music so they have to steal his songs and remake them into thier own, ruining them in the process. MJ was not just a singer he was an entertainer and a showman the like of which has not been seen since Elvis or Al Jolson. He did not just get up on stage with a guitar and strum music and sing. You got every penny's worth when you went to one of his concerts. I was lucky enough to see him and his brothers in 1981 at the Hartford Civic Center in CT. As far as I am concerned, you have in order for the past 40 years, The Beatles, Elvis, Michael Jackson, Elton John, and thats about it as far as I am concerned for the true entertainers of the 20th century, as far back as I can remember. They dont make them like MJ anymore and now we have teens flipping out over The Jones brothers and Hannah Montana, lord give me strength.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|A truly inspirational movie on so many levels!     Love story, deep spiritual overtones that compare the main character IMO as a modern day Jesus Christ with a modern day theme that all people can relate too! The actors were authentic, and brown and beautiful! from the yongest of actors to the eldest.    A beautiful and hope filled story that makes me want to make changes in my life and in the way I look at the world,  especially as an American.    I cannot say enough about this movie!!!!

1400063736|3.0|This book took me awhile to get through.  For me, it wasn't the type of story that I wanted to read every spare moment I had, or one that I would stay up extra late for just to read what happens next.  I have no doubt that the author is an excellent writer, there were many times when he would write what a character was thinking or feeling and it would stop me and I would think, wow, that is so perceptive.  He could write a chapter on a solitary character in a room, and you would go through all the emotions she was having at that time as she went through past events in her mind.  I do applaud his writing skills and style even though the story did not grip me like I hoped it would.<br /><br /> Each chapter was pretty much a different story of a different character during the same time frame.  Some characters were more interesting than others and some were delved into more deeply.  You are catching snippets of peoples lives in a story and to me that didn't get me too emotionally involved in the story.  I can easily cry while reading a book, but this one didn't have that issue at all.  Which is kind of nice if you aren't looking for an emotionally draining book.<br /><br />  Basically, I read for fun and entertainment.  So, yeah, I guess I am a little shallow.  I put this book on the fence for me.  While I was reading it, I enjoyed it, but if the book had mysteriously disappeared during the night, I probably wouldn't have sought out another copy to see how it ended.  I don't regret reading it or think it was a waste of time.  After I picked it out based on its description I knew it wasn't really my style of book, but it still sounded interesting.  So if you think it sounds like something you would like, go for it, the brief summary given for it is accurate.

1933771690|3.0|Dr Lanza does present some interesting perspectives on the role of life and consciousness in the origin and nature of the Universe. He goes on to ascribe six principles to his Biocentrism hypothesis, where the role of the conscious observer is central to the very existence of the Universe itself; and that time and space, or physical objects themselves do not have an independent existence or reality without an observer.  In fact, he concludes that life creates the Universe.  It is a refreshing review of biology as being more central to the origin and evolution of the Universe over the more typical emphasis of physics and mathematics as the primary language of cosmology.  Biology is intuitively more understandable than the application of advanced mathematics to describe the inner workings of the Universe. Dr Lanza provides an excellent biological emphasis for Cosmology to help individuals grasp the role of the observer in the understanding of the Universe, which is the foundation of his Biocentrism hypothesis.    The observer's role in the creation of the Universe stems from a \\"quantum weirdness\\" that describes how the act of observation effects the outcome of a quantum measurement.  Most of this hypothesis is based on the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics that posits the observer as the key element in determining the result of a quantum measurement.  The experimental result of any quantum measurement remains undetermined (in a state of superposition) until a conscious observer looks at the quantum system.  At the extreme view, no object exists until someone looks at it; not even the sun, moon, stars or the Universe itself.  Unfortunately, this is by no means a new hypothesis: the eminent cosmologist John Wheeler had made a similar acertion more than 6 decades ago, that only the presence of a conscious observer brings the Universe into existence.  Dr Lanza asserts that it is biology that gives meaning to time and space; indeed that space-time does not exist without the perception by a biological observer.  In other words, there is no existence beyond the self, which boils down to the philosophy of Solipsism.  However, again, there is nothing novel or new in this position.  He offers no clues as to what degree of consciousness an observer must possess to bring spacetime or a quantum measurement into reality. Does a dog, cat, insect, amoeba and quantum physicist equally qualify as an observer? Or, if only human consciousness qualifies, then at what point in time did the Universe come into being?  Was Australopithecus sufficiently self aware to bring the Universe into creation by possessing tool making capability; or was it Homo Erectus, with the power to control fire, the evolutionary triggering point?  None of these issues are discussed, much less even introduced into the argument for Biocentrism.  Biocentrism emerges fully formed based on a human conscious observer, without regard to the consideration that human evolution and consciousness is a process that occurred over millions of years.    The Biocentric model, as Dr Lanza describes, hangs solely on human consciousness, but that is pure hubris in a Universe 13.7 Billion years old with trillions of stars with orbiting planets and moons, which may also support other intelligent life who gazed back at the universe as conscious observers long before earthly pre-hominids descended from trees.  I was disappointed that these more expansive biological views of a Universe that was presumably designed to be observed was limited to that of only the Earthly human observer.  Consider, for example, in quantum mechanics, a set of entangled photos may be created to produce a diffraction pattern when not observed and a bimodal distribution pattern when observed no matter how far they are separated.  If such a pair of entangled photons were produced from across the universe, then theoretically, if no diffraction pattern was measured when they arrive and measured by a conscious earthly observer, then they must have been previously observed by some other conscious entity.  Therefore, it should be theoretically possible to detect extraterrestrial life in this manner.  Now, that would have been a novel concept to bring to light in a Biocentric model of the Universe!    Dr Lanza often refers to consciousness as a DVR that contains information but only exists when the DVR is played back.  However, a DVR can only play the past it cannot be played into the future and quantum information appears to be non-local such that either information comes from the future or there is supraluminal transmission of information.  As an aside, it is rather self-indulgent to devote several chapters on Dr Lanza's associations with several Nobel Prize winning scientists.  As an undergraduate at UC San Diego, Francis Crick was one of my professors, as a medical student at UC San Francisco I performed research on oncogenes under J Michael Bishop (Nobel Prize Medicine 1989); and had dinner with James D Watson in Cold Spring Harbor when I presented at the Human Evolution conference held there in 1998.  Therefore, it is certainly not unheard of for physician scientists to have multiple associations with prominent scientists, including Nobel Prize winners.    For readers interested in the origin and evolution of the Universe and the role of observers from a quantum mechanical viewpoint, there are several books that may be placed on the reading list, including John Gribbin's Schrödinger's Kittens or John Barrows Cosmological Anthropological Principle both are a more expansive extension of a Biocentric hypothesis.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|If you like Guy Ritchie as a director than you will like this movie! This is realy one of his typical movies with lots of action in it and plenty of violence and nonsense as well.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|The director's cut runs about 25 minutes longer, and incorporates more elements from the comics, adds more violence, as well as more shots of Dr. Manhatten's schlong.  Some of the previous scenes are reworked with additional dialogue.  Information has been supported by sites such as AICN etc.    Overall, the storyline and conversations are better fleshed out, and this version is truer to the comics.  The largest additional addition is that of Hollis Mason's death, which is spectacularly directed to the score of the Intermezzo from the opera Cavalleria Rusticana (think Godfather III).    (1) Rorschach gets additional dialogue, some straight from the comics.    (2) When Rorschach searches the Comedian's apartment shortly after the opening scene, he encounters two cops still stationed there.  He fights briefly with them before jumping back out the window.    (3) Conversation between Dan and Rorschach (beans scene) is extended.    (4) All flashbacks extended, with the exception of Sally's.    (5) Dr. Manhatten discussing the symbol on his forehead.  Additional questions in the face to face with Dr. Manhatten.  Dan and Hollis watch Dr. Manhatten go crazy on their TV set.    (6) Laurie getting interrogated by the military as they try to determine Dr. M's whereabouts (on Mars).  Alessandro Juliani's (Lt. Gaeta from Battlestar Galactica) scene has been reinserted.  He plays one of the scientists who bursts in during the interrogation of Laurie to tell the military that they've located Dr. M on Mars.    (7) Probably the biggest addition is the depiction of Hollis Mason's death at the hands of the knot heads.  Interestingly, the death is done from poor Hollis' POV, where he imagines himself fighting the gangsters of the 1940s.  He delivers left and right hooks to Captain Evil, before being done in by \\"Moloch\\".  The score for the death scene is very fitting.    (8) Dan taking revenge on an isolated knot head at a bar, post Hollis' death.  It's a brutal revenge.    (9) The shootout by hired hitman Roy Chess is much more brutal- e.g. more blood and gore, fingers blown off.    (10) Conversation between Dr. Long and Rorschach is extended.    (11) Longer jail-break scene with arguments between Rorschach and Laurie.  Prison guards open fire on Dan's ship.    (12) Longer conversation between Dr. M and L on Mars.    (13) Riot scene is longer with more conversation between the Comedian and the rioters.    (14) Agent Forbes (Fulvio Cecere) has a larger role as the government agent in charge of handling all the Watchmen.    This is THE version to get.  It feels complete.
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell is generally hailed as one of the great seers of this age, but I've always found that most of his books never really point out the way to go.  He seems to have solved this problem in spades with his newest text, as Gladwell points out that success comes from work, and LOTS of it.  Neither money nor inherent advantages are enough on their own to ensure greatness--that comes from effort.<br /><br />At the same time, Gladwell notes that being in the right place or being the right person at the right time can assist the effectiveness of the effort.  Examples gleaned from such diverse anecdotes as hockey, slavery, Bill Gates, and one of the smartest men in the world show that true greatness is a combination of effort and fortune.  We can (and should) look to try to make up for barriers of success created by random, controllable factors; however, nothing can make up for time and sweat.  Gladwell's text is a fascinating read, and its insight makes it one of the best works of the year.
B00297FEUS|4.0|Like many fans, I was looking forward to the remastered Stay Hungry and like many fans, I was shocked at how poor disc 1 sounded.  Apparently, the problem lies with Rhino Records.  Since I don't see the information posted here on Amazon yet, I figured I would pass it on.  Rhino has agreed to replace the disc.  [...] I think it is good that the record company is admitting an error, and that they are willing to provide a resolution.  I think they should have caught the mistake themselves, but at least they are making an attempt to rectify the situation.  As for disc 2, the demos are cool to hear.  Very raw and embryonic.  The new song, 30, is cool too.  Not bad at all for a bunch of SMF's careening toward their 60's.
B001HN697M|4.0|If you liked the other two movies than you should like this movie also! It gives more backstory on Lucius and Sonya, Vicktor's daughter. Good action/fight scenes between the vampires and the lycans overall. And even the story kind of made sense as well. As far as I could tell there were not many blatant contradictions in the plot of this movie.
B001NTFQRY|2.0|For Vangelis and/or Amazon to market this as a release of \\"all\\" the music from Blade Runner is a fraudulent lie because there are many excellent pieces from the movie that are NOT on this set.  This is very irritating.  For those of you who call us \\"BR Purists\\"...doesn't it bother you that you were lied to so as to dupe you into buying something other than what you thought you were getting?  If this had been marketed as \\"New Music Inspired by Blade Runner\\" then I would have no complaint (except for those below).<br /><br />Now having said that there are some nice pieces in this set.  But...and now for my other complaint...the best of them are on disk 3 and they are practically ruined by these stupid and barely intelligible \\"voices\\" that are thrown in here and there (e.g., \\"Ridley signing off...Ridley signing off...Ridley signing off...\\").  I hate when artists do this.  They seemingly want to \\"spice up\\" there work with something unusual so they throw something in that really doesn't belong like nature sounds or spoken words.  A good example is the track \\"Up and Running\\".  It is a really cool piece of music but it is basically ruined by a looped sample from the track \\"One More Kiss Dear\\".  I mean what in hell was Vangelis thinking?  Does he really think we want to hear \\"One more kiss dear...dear...dear...dear...dear...dear...dear...dear...dear...dear...dear...  This brings up another point.  Artists of the world...are you listening...repetition almost always sucks!  It gets very irritating very quickly and especially when it involves human voices.  Don't ruin your otherwise good material with it.
0743289684|5.0|Infidel is an amazing book.  As it happens, I was born and raised as a Christian.  I had very few clear ideas about Islam.  Due to the influence of television, I had heard of female genital mutilation (a barbaric practice) and the burka, but had always wondered why anyone in their right minds would agree to such things, never mind agreeing to them in the name of faith.    This book gives one an insight into that world and helps us understand the religion and culture of Islam.  I can only hope that by uncovering the terrible repression of women in this society, perhaps one day we can actually uncover the faces of the women and open up their lives to equality.    Thank you to Ms. Ali for an amazing window into Isam.

B00006I53S|4.0|[[ASIN:B00006I53S Canon EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM Standard Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras]]  My family bought me the EOS 50D for my 50th birthday. Knowing I'd want instant gratification, they opted to make this purchase with the EF28-135mm kit lens. I have since shot around 5000 images with this lens, and being the ultimate critic have done a lot of situational testing shots (ok, I'm an amateur techie), juxtaposed in between 1000's of more important vacation, soccer, music concert, and wildlife shots.     I have to say that I'm fairly pleased with the results in general. I do see some softness in some shots, but always get acceptible results for \\"family photos\\". Stopping the lens down a bit to F7.1 or F8 helps, but I think some of the softness is just inherent with the glass being used in this lens. The zoom range is great (4.8X), and makes this lens good for general walkabout, but I find myself in a bind at times without wide angle capability due to what the 50D's APS does to 28mm.     As mentioned, the lens softness is to be expected from the glass Canon used in this lens. I've also shot about 5000 shots with \\"L\\" glass, so I have a good basis for comparison on the 50D. I've gone through several micro-focus adjustment exercises with my copy of the 28-135 and found that at 28mm no correction was needed, while at 135mm the lens was front-focusing around +1 setting. So I opted to set a -1 adjustment for this lens in the 50D's lens calibration memory. I also compared the best micro-focusing I could obtain with LiveView fully zoomed on tripod, to that of AF on the same test shots, and saw similar performance. This particular result leads me to my general softness comments.      Even so, I'm still pleased with the lens and shots taken in all sorts of light. (Note, the 50D does an excellent job with higher ISO settings, so I've captured some really good low light shots with the 28-135 as well as \\"L\\" lenses, benefitting from IS, and DIGIC IV assistance.)    I did notice the well publicised lens creep issue with this lens, which can be really annoying when you need to shoot several shots with one hand (holding on with other hand, holding branches out of the way, etc.) I tried the well publicised rubber band trick, and that worked exceptionally well, except I noticed after several weeks that the focus ring had become jammed and was very hard to turn. I diagnosed this to the fact that the rubber band keeps the focus ring from turning at all, as well as adding tension to the zoom ring. The lens tries to move the focus ring slightly when focusing, and over time can mis-align the internal workings with the focus ring. Forcing the focus about 90 degree's rotation seemed to realign the mechanism, and focus ring movement became smooth again. I think I'll look for a narrower rubber band, or live with the lens creep. I thought I'd broken the lens at first...    IS and USM are must-have's, in my opinion on any lens. I found at least 2 stops of benefit from the 28-135 IS, even more after I'd been jogging or climbing and was out of breath. And I know that the people sitting around me really appreciate the silence of USM AF.    No lens hood or case comes with this lens - that's typical for non-\\"L\\" lens.     The macro focus feature and capabilties of this lens are very good. Again, stop things down a bit, have good light, and you will be pleasantly surprised.     Why only 4 stars? Not because of its softness (most cheaper lenses have this limitation, especially above 12 megapixels). No, mostly because of the lens creep, new out of the box (I would expect this over time, not new), and because of the focus ring getting jambed (this is supposed to be a lens with no mechanical link to the focusing ring, so that you can manually focus after setting AF in AF mode, so why would it jamb???).    Would I recommend it to a friend? Absolutely. I've got many, many good shots to attribute to this lens, and I never leave home without it. Someday I'll be an all\\"L\\" glass guy, but until then, this is my mid-range lens and it does the job.
1592289444|3.0|What might be the kernel of truth behind this story, I wonder? I know it has been alleged to be plagiarised, but I can't confirm this from my own reading. The thought it brought back to me was the remark with which Herodotus often concludes his retelling of various travellers' tales `To me he does not speak persuasively.' Let me say right away that if by some chance this tale of incredible heroism and endurance is true - indeed if 2% of it is true - it is so far outwith my own experience or observation that I would be incapable of believing it without good corroboration. This is not apparently forthcoming, so I am left with the scepticism that nature has implanted in me and nurture has, well, nurtured. There is a certain amount that I can believe without difficulty, mainly regarding the Soviet interrogation of political prisoners. Whether or not it happened to the author as he says I would not be knowing. This kind of thing is well attested in general, and to write a realistic description requires no more than common knowledge and ordinary literary skill.<br /><br />It makes quite a good story, indeed rather too good a story. The early chapter about the interrogation is harrowing, but the later sequences, for all their grim detail, did not harrow me much at all, and I'm sure that this was because I knew by that stage that I didn't believe what I was being told. I mean, was there some pressing reason why they could not have made the escape to China? I'm sure British India was preferable as a destination, but it was an awful lot further away, taking the intrepid escapees through more adventures than the shorter route would have provided. The sheer improbability of the assistance provided by the commandant's wife has been noted, but just as unlikely, surely, is the way the fugitives are not pursued when their tracks would have been clear and their progress slow. This camp had sled dogs after all. Then again I knew the girl was going to have to die because the narrative was not going to be able to accommodate her. And at the end, to crown it all, they encounter Mr and Mrs Yeti.<br /><br />Help Thou mine unbelief, said a prayer I used to know. If I am wrong in this conclusion then obviously I owe the profoundest of apologies to the author's shade. As I say, it can be recommended as a story for a long flight of a more comfortable kind, and if anyone needs his or her cold war passions warmed over a little I'm sure it will help with a bit of nostalgic indignation.going to be able to accommodate her.

B0007PAMR4|2.0|Dune was an incredible story and incredible movie -- although albeit only the most diehard fans could follow it on first viewing.  Others learned to love this master piece of sci fi done with no holds barred on the excellent filming, acting, directing, and music.  Truly David Lynch was masterful.  Ok, now let's get to the 'Extended Version' .  This was just god-awful, it is obvious why David Lynch refused to have his name associated with the ridiculous mess with added footage and where  good footage was replaced with bad.  This version could be the basis for an entire course for movie Editors.  It clearly makes one appreciate what good editing can do for a film, and how bad editing can destroy it -as it did for this Extended version of Dune.  No wonder they had to use a fake director's name like 'Smithe'.
B0027G783W|3.0|I was one of those music fans who has given up on Moby years ago. Although I found Last Night to be pretty good, I still couldn't find myself to be head over heels like I was when I first heard Play at my local Tower Records.  The back story for Wait For Me sounds promising I have to admit. But it's overall a let down I have to admit. You'd think that Moby cooked up something really interesting after feeling inspired by David Lynch's words right? You'd think that since most of his mellow songs in the past were pretty brilliant that he'd make now an exceptional melancholic record right? Well I'd have to say wrong!  I find this record pretty much predictable. I'll admit that there are good songs on it but this is no Play. And what I mean by that is that this is no Play in the sense of how extraodinary that record was artistically on every level.   I guess like Andy Warhol once said that everybody's famous for 15 minutes. Perhaps Moby's 15 mins are up!

0375707972|3.0|This was a very interesting book, but really not what I expected it to be. Admittedly, I actually saw the movie first. But, after watching it, I had hoped that there would be more to these very interesting characters in the book. Unfortunately, the background detail that I wanted, the thoughts and more detail was not present in this novel. The film was actually a very traditional adaptation - in fact, I was almost a little disappointed at just how good of an adaptation the movie was from the book! There were no surprises in the book, and it was a very fast read. The book was very interesting, but something was lacking from both the film and the book - a better sense of the characters, details... just that certain something... without it, both felt a little flat.
1400063736|4.0|This is my first encounter with Colum McCann, though it won't be my last. A beautifully constructed novel (or novel-in-stories, if you're picky) that reveals the anxieties of many parts of the social spectrum. New York in the 70s seems like it could be a grimy, one note setting, but McCann's use of Philippe Petit as the linking event and overarching metaphor ties things together quite well. Don't expect every story to include someone staring up at Petit as he majestically walks across a cable between the Twin Towers. His presence is felt but not always literally.<br /><br />If I had to cite a gripe (and all reviews normally do, so why not) it would be that the sentence structure is a bit repetitive. It seems like the sentences are all on the short side and/or the same syllabic length. Once i noticed it I couldn't un-notice it. Not a deal breaker, but something that did pull me out of the text from time to time.<br /><br />Overall, a great read that kept me reading yet didn't fly by too fast.
0312370849|4.0|I really liked the book.  It's interesting that even though it was difficult to read at times, I couldn't put it down.  The characters were well developed and I felt liked a learned another piece of history.
B001TWT0A4|5.0|This is a review of the 2009 2-disc Centennial Edition.  If you're a fan of this movie (as I am), you probably already own the previous release (as I do), so the real question is: should you upgrade?  The answer is unconditionally YES!  The image quality of the new transfer is miles beyond the earlier version, and with an upconverting DVD player, it really looks fantastic.  The bonus disk is enjoyable as well.  Kudos to Paramount for doing a first rate job on this one.  Although the movie itself may not qualify for classic status, it's great entertainment and, for my money, a better picture than its previous incarnation as \\"Rio Bravo.\\"  The easy camaraderie between John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, and the fun the director has with James Caan's character equals one good time!

B00005JMJ4|5.0|The relationship between Murray and Scarjo is classic in the Hepburn/Tracy, Bogart/Bacall tradition. The tension is palpable early and often, and thankfully does not descend into pulp novel trash. Murray is terrific, but is actually upstaged by the range and depth of Scarjo. The karaoke scene is worth the price of admission.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Ok, I finally had to weigh in on Before Sunset.  Along with Before Sunrise, it is an outstanding film and probably the stronger of the two for the genuine honesty that is expressed throughout.  You really can believe that two people would actually talk and feel the way these characters do.      Here's my only beef with the story... I had a tough time swallowing Celine's excuse for making no attempt to contact Jesse at the train station where they were supposed to have met after the first film.  Sure, I know her grandmother died and they didn't have each other's phone numbers, etc., but isn't this the same grandmother Celine described in the first film as having lost the love of her life and accepting her \\"fate\\".      I can't believe that her parents, assuming she confided in them, wouldn't have helped her work something out to see Jesse and maybe even have him come along to Budapest with her late to the funeral.  At the very least she could have called the train station and paid a messenger of some sort to look for him and get a message to him.  She appeared the most eager, until Jesse's short speech at the end of the first film, to actually connect again.  If they were as in love as they appeared to be, which the second film confirms, I can't imagine Celine not doing everything she could to try and make contact with him.  If not in person, at least with a message.  My wife even commented that she would have made the effort to find me given similar circumstances.      Yes, yes, I know it's just a movie and they had to come up with some type of situation to explain why there was no connection on that day nine years ago.  I probably could have bought it more if Celine had tried to get a message to him at the station and the messenger was unable to get it to him or missed him somehow.  That would have added some great dialogue to the script and given Jesse at least the knowledge that she had tried, as he had.  It still would have been tragic, but would have made bettersense with how in love they had been.    Other than that this is a great film.  It's just that when a movie comes across as so realistic and honest, the one major detail on which the whole story hinges could have been made more believable without taking anything away from the rest of the story just as it is.    Should they do another movie with a messy, but happy ending?  Of course they should.    If I had my way they would end the next movie arm in arm, looking at each other smiling, walking down a Parisian street at sunset with the James Taylor version of \\"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\\" playing in the background as the shot freezes and the credits roll.      I know, I know, a bit \\"hokey\\", but hey... without the romantics of this world it would be a dark and dreary place indeed.

You realize you are seeing the holocaust from a completely different perspective than you ever have and then it becomes apparent that this is a very powerful and effective way to convey the horror and absurdity of war and the way that individual acts can still matter in a sea of military and political uniformity.  This is certainly not a children's book nor is it's importance or appeal to be diminished with the label of \\"young adult\\" literature.  It is literature plain and simple and a rewarding, powerful, enlightening and entertaining read for anyone old enough to appreciate and  understand it.

Yes, the premise seems morbid.  Sacrifice two children from each district and send them to the Capitol to fight to be the last one standing.  With odds like that stacked against them, the future quickly became bleak for twenty-four of the districts' citizens.<br /><br />However, woven into this tense, quick-moving story of survival is a truly honorable story of trying to do the right thing in the face of so much adversity.  There are two romances which are developed and questioned throughout the novel.  I don't think that most readers will regret picking this book up.  I didn't expect to like it, but found myself drawn to the characters and sucked into their lives.  It's a thrilling read with twists and turns.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' style is a seemingly simple, yet intricate way of weaving a story and it develops throughout the book, never dropping off or leaving loose ends.  I'm very impressed and looking forward to the next book which is due out in September.
0802714544|1.0|I felt like I'd wasted  my time reading this novel once it was over. The suspense throughout the book is fantastic but, well i can't ruin it for you. I don't see how this is one of the highest rated spy novels.
B0017U7PT6|5.0|Considering the poor reviews this movie received,  I can only hypothesize that for these people,  this movie came too many years after their childish innocence has dimmed.  This movie is a beautiful piece of work. Instead of the usual  scenario of portraying early man as half wild survivors dominated by fear and superstition, it is an intuitively  rich and artful look at the qualities that define our humanness... Without love, trust and character we have nothing. This beautifully acted, beautifully filmed movie is a love story from beginning to end and should be absolutely part of any home movie collection.
B000089QEN|5.0|I bought this movie to encourage me to read the dauntingly thick novel by William M. Thackeray.  Not long into the book written in the typical Victorian over-winded details & drawn-out descriptions & explanations, I was pleasantly surprised at the enthralling nature of the book.  The original story in itself became so gripping that I had to stop the movie so that it wouldn't ruin the ending.<br /><br />This movie was as true to the book as any movie could achieve.  Obviously, this 5-hrs movie cannot possibly cover every detail of that illustrious book, however, it touches on all the necessary & crucial points that I believe Thackeray wanted the reader to ponder.  For example, the character study of Becky Sharp, the governess who used her talents, wit & cunning to attain social status & to feed the cost of making her appearance in compliance to that status, was such in the novel that kept the reader guessing at the nature of her character.  Her pretenses & ulterior motives at the cost of others her superior or inferior can make her out to be quite vile & reprehensible.  But then, towards the end, when you think her the worst of vipers, she does something for Amelia (whom she offended early on) that was so sweet & almost redeemable, you want to forgive her.  The movie was able to capture these feelings & thoughts that go on while you're reading the text.  The book also keeps the reader guessing at just how far Becky stooped to get what she wanted.  Was she sleeping around?  With whom?  When?  And the movie preserved this \\"question\\" & perpetuates this mystery even at its conclusion.  In the book, there was also the suggestion that she had a hand in Jos Sedley's death (Amelia's bumbling brother), which was never explicitly explained, but the movie ended with this woman walking away hand on arm with Mr. Sedley while wearing her usual malicious grin that suggests poor Mr. Sedley to be the unsuspecting lamb being led to the slaughter.<br /><br />This movie also casted actors & actresses that fit each character perfectly.  Each character was exactly how I would like each person to look.  Amelia Sedley has a gentle, pale face & quietness that fits her.  Jos Sedley her overweight, dopey, nearly cross-eyed brother was comical to behold.  George Osborne was tall w/ angular jaws & was handsome which fit the book character well.  Major Dobbin's actor portrayed perfectly that serious, contemplative honest man whom the reader & viewer cannot help but love.  Rawley, Becky's husband was tall in appearace which the book stressed upon as well, with a handsome, cocky face, who was able to play Rawley the rake, then Rawley the socialite, Rawley the good husband, the good father, & the repentent Rawley, whereby the viewer/reader mourns him for all that he could have been had not his wife been so selfish & cold.  Finally, the actress that played Becky was both beautiful & wicked at the same time.  Even as the character Becky was pretending to be upset, the actress did an excellent job portraying someone acting/deceiving the other character(s).  And her eyes seemed very alert & calculating even as her face exhibited (false) kindness or attention.  The  other Vanity Fair movie with Reese Witherspoon was so poorly casted that I could barely watch it.  And part of the problem was the selection of the cast.  Reese's face is far to innocent & guileless to play the serpert, Becky Sharp.  And really, do 19th Century gentlemen gel their hair into spikes?  Surfer types in Victorian suites just doesn't work.<br /><br />In conclusion, a great movie to visualize a great book.  I urge any Victorian literature enthusiast to read the book too. It's a book that's loaded with social and moral issues that leaves you thinking.  And please forego the Vanity Fair movie starring Reese Witherspoon, you'll thank me for it.
0375846735|5.0|Spoiler warning:  I listened to the audio version of His Dark Materials and slowly but securily got hooked. It is brilliantly done, with Philip Pullman himself as the narrator and a truckload of actors doing the voices of all the characters in the book. I can recommend it to anyone!    Skipping the religious (or anti-religious) message and what people think about this, it is a wonderful saga about a young and strong girl and boy coming of age. Their trips are dangerous, hard gripping, painful (friends perish along the way) and wonderous in the creatures they meet and befriend.    The Amber spyglass I wanted to race through towards the end, just to find out how Will and Lyra would save the world (that that would happen was sure once you heard about 'the prophecy'). And how great it was that they did and how, the power of love.    But the last hour is pure anguish and bitterness as you realize and experience that what these courageous and full-of-life kids deserve is taken away from them. Who has felt the heartache of a lost love suffers with them...    Call me weak, but I would have prefered a Hollywood-ending over this bitterness. Nonetheless, one of the most beautiful fantasy books I have ever listened to or read.

B002AR9YPI|5.0|The hype surrounding the release of this album was huge, and it did not fall short of expectations. Grizzly Bear is at the peak of their music creativity. This and Yellow House are two of the standout albums of the past 5 years.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I enjoy Josh Groban's music and think he is talented beyond his youthful age. He has a mature, passionate voice that takes you emotionally where you want to be when you listen to his deft voice.

0307346617|2.0|\\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War\\"<br /><br />I'm not really a zombie kind of guy although I will confess to really liking George A Romero's Dawn of The Dead. I was a teenager when I first saw it and was really impressed by the sheer horror of the realism. I don't just mean the realistic ways in which Tom savini found to render gore but also the way Romero showed just enough of a breakdown in society to let my imagination run wild. It was in fact this aspect of the film that really left its mark on me. As far as the zombie sub-genre is concerned, in addition to Romero's Dawn of The Dead there are few examples of this genre that I could seriously say I have really enjoyed.<br /><br />All fictional horror whether filmed, written or rendered in a video game is rife with subtext whether the intention to include this subtext was the result of a conscious decision or not, after all when you strip away all the trappings of horror we are speaking of matters of survival, of life and death itself, indeed one can almost imagine feeling a tingling in the amygdala just sitting in a dark theater awaiting the start of the latest, greatest scary flick. Also, just look at how certain role playing horror games are classified, with one of those rare instances in which a Japanese phrase is awkwardly translated into English but actually proves more apt than any already existent English equivalent: Survival Horror.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead was not just merely an exhibition of zombies eating flesh as society crumbled around the survivors; it was in fact one of the most astute meditations on mindless American consumerism. The protagonists in this film logically decide to fortify and hold up in a shopping mall for the obvious reason of availing themselves of the many provisions and supplies available there. By visual example and also via exposition Romero exhibits a mall that first must be cleared of zombies who, having retained a faint, distant memory of their former lives return to the mall that once held a such prominent place in their lives. This would seem to suggest that mindless consumerism has so gripped our culture that the simple act of shopping has, by sheer repetition and reinforced by feelings of instant gratification, been retroactively hard wired into our brains as an actual instinct and this indeed is driven home by the fact that the zombies waddle through the mall lured like fish by the glitz and glare of shiny products in an apparent parody of real world shoppers that is sadly much less a parody than an accurate depiction.<br /><br />Consumerism is but one of the many metaphors that can be illustrated by the zombie genre and the promise of exploring a few possible metaphors was running through my mind as I read the blurbs on the  back cover of World War Z. I had already perused the books at my local Borders for over a half an hour and this book was the only one that really seemed interesting to my mood that day. The possibility that I chose a good book was even reinforced by the clerk at checkout who spoke very highly of it.<br /><br />\\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War\\" essentially, is a collection of personal anecdotes of survival as told to the fictitious author who cobbled them together to paint a \\"compelling\\" picture of survival painted against the backdrop of global politics. While Max Brooks does display an authentic feel and flavor for the various settings around the globe in which these testimonies take place I must say he falls far short in the \\"compelling\\" department. It would seem that in his attempt to perhaps try something new rather than resort to yet another exercise in dwelling on various zombie metaphors or creating new ones Mr. Brooks became too bogged down in the physical logistics of the various survival scenarios at the expense of drama, suspense or meaningful character development, in fact the characters all seem to be of nearly identical quality in spite of the many differences intheir cultures or national origin.<br /><br />This is the part where I confess that I had to force myself to keep reading but finally gave up after having only read it three quarters of the way through. I could not help feeling that there would be no meaningful payoff as the preceding pages betrayed not a hint that the succeeding pages would offer any redemption. Ironically I believe that this book might have benefitted from actually being longer if only Mr. Brooks had spent more effort fleshing out his characters and yes, pondering upon the allegorical richness inherent in the subject matter because regardless of how tiresome or quaint this approach may seem it is still vastly better than anecdotes that read slightly more interesting than dry testimony in some official report..

B0026J8LHM|5.0|For the past month, I've been counting down the days to the release of Dream Theater's 10th studio album, Black Clouds & Silver Linings. This Tuesday the CD was released and I have been listening to it nonstop for the past few days. As Dream Theater is my favorite band, I have very high expectations for their music. Despite my high expectations, this album does not disappoint in any way. The album has six tracks ranging from Wither (5:25) to The Count of Tuscany (19:16). As someone who loves long, well-written tracks, I am quite delighted to have 4 tracks longer than 12 minutes.     A Nightmare To Remember  The album begins with a peal of thunder and the distant sound of haunting piano melodies. Soon the whole band comes in with a slow and epic opening and then breaks the music down for a more progressive groove. The lyrics tell a very emotion-filled story of agony and pain. After a while, the dark and heavy mood of the music lightens significantly as James Labrie recounts the man's experience. One part of the song has some very beautiful layered vocal harmonies--some of the most memorable that I have heard in any of Dream Theater's work. All the transitions are seamless and smooth, the story builds very well, there is lots of musical variety from section to section and there is exceptional use of the various melodic themes and motifs. One section even uses a blastbeat, which is quite unexpected given Portnoy's usual drumming style.     A Rite of Passage  As the album's single, I listened to this track a lot before the album was released. Singles are often hit-or-miss and so I wasn't sure what Rite of Passage would sound like in the context of the album. Having listened to the entire album quite a number of times, I am quite happy with how this fits in the rest of the album. This track has a very deliberate pace and excellent use of stereo sound placement. Both John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess pull out all the stops on their respective solos. Petrucci uses the entirerange of the guitar and lays down some insanely complicated note flurries. Rudess has fun experimenting with different sounds and uses a really unusually tasty patch for the final part of his solo.     Wither  This track feels like the most unique track on the album. In some ways, the music and lyrics both remind me of a couple tracks on Falling Into Infinity. Wither is definitely one of the most pop-rock flavored songs they have written in quite a while. And yet, rather than sounding generic and ordinary, the execution is actually quite incredible! The mixing definitely brings the bass and keys to the front of the mix and lets the guitar sit in the background a bit more than some of the other tracks. John and Mike sing a few notes of really tasty vocal harmonies during the chorus, which is one of my favorite things about the song. While the song starts with a very mellow and minimalistic sound, it builds and adds some amazing layers, climaxing with a short, yet powerful, guitar solo. The string parts add more depth and power to the song as it grows in intensity. James Labrie really shines with his expressive singing, which clearly stands out throughout the entire song. Despite being a very short track compared to the rest, I have to say that Wither is definitely one of the strongest selections of the album.     The Shattered Fortress  Beginning with a driving rhythm guitar line, The Shattered Fortress shifts the album into high-gear and delivers a powerful and rocking track from start to finish. It concludes the Twelve-Step suite that Mike Portnoy has been writing for the last 7 years, which follows the story of his rehabilitation from acoholism. This album and the last four each have one track with 2-3 movements of the suite. Both musically and lyrically, this track concludes the suite with style, heart-felt emotion and incredible musical composition. As the final track, The Shattered Fortress recapitulates and exands on parts from each of the previous tracks, including both musical and lyrical references to The Glass Prison, This Dying Soul, The Root of All Evil and Repentance. With nearly all of the references, The Shattered Fortress changes the melodies and lyrics in such a ways that new meaning is added and even the melodies are modified slightly to give things a new feel. The resulting conglomeration is something that simultaneously feels new and familiar. A brilliant conlusion to a heavy and powerful suite.    The Best of Times  Beginning with a very mellow piano part and featuring Jerry Goodman on the violin, this track is really pretty and has an overall happy feel to it. This song was written by Mike Portnoy in memory of his father, who died at the beginning of this year. This song is melodically driven and the melody switches between the guitar and the keyboard, resulting in a very nice blend of sounds. Jordan's string parts are very written and performed, and I really enjoying hearing such a different sort of sound compared to his usual keyboard parts. The guitar solo near the end of the track is more slow and expressive than most of Petrucci's solos, although he certainly is unafraid to show off his virtuosity with some classical-inspired licks and some impressive sweep arpeggios and flawless trills.     The Count of Tuscany  Weighing in at 19:16, this track is quite a progressive masterpiece. There are a wide range of different sections ranging in sound from mellow guitar arpeggios to complicated progressive riffs. Some parts of the songs are driving and powerful, while others are more expansive and deliberate. On the progressive side, Mike Portnoy lays down some complicated grooves over odd time signatures. John Myung has the opportunity to show off his bass skills with a tricky melodic bass groove in the middle of the song. One section of the piece is very spacious and open, creating a nice period of rest and beauty with some lovely sustained notes on the guitar. The lyrics tell a story of an experience Johnhad, and as such it is very interesting to see how the story progresses and ends. The music follows the lyrics closely in the mood they convey and the emotions they express. The energy builds up somewhat as the song finishes, but doesn't reach for a high level of intensity, and the album ends with peaceful outdoor nature sounds.     Summary  Taking into account all factors, Black Clouds & Silver Linings is an incredible album. It is brimming full of creativity, with a emphasis on emotion-filled lyrics and compelling storytelling. Though some bands sound very similar from album to album, Dream Theater has crafted a unique sound with Black Clouds & Silver Linings, with music and lyrics that are quite distinct from any of their previous albums and yet are creative and fresh in their own way. Starting out very dark and heavy, this album definitely takes the listener on a musical journey, eventually ending with a happier mood and a very peaceful album outro. During the course of the six tracks, each member of the band has a chance to shine and display their own individual creativity and musical virtuosity. The production is absolutely flawless, as there is never the slightest faux-pas or section where an instrument is too buried in the mix. Each track has it's own defining moments and all of long tracks bring such an energy that they never feel tedious or repetitious. As a whole, Black Clouds & Silver Linings is a musical delight from beginning to end. I am thoroughly satisfied and look forward to enjoying this amazing album for years to come.
0545123267|5.0|I adore this book.<br /><br />Shiver is told through the two main characters, Sam and Grace, and I loved them both. The first-person narration moves between them seamlessly and is never jarring. Spending time with Sam and Grace is enjoyable; they are believable, likeable characters with flaws and quirks and all the things that make people people. The supporting characters are equally well-drawn, if not always equally likeable.<br /><br />Moreover, the plot is original. Sam is a werewolf, and in the world of the novel, werewolves are human in the heat of summer and wolves in the cold of winter. As the werewolves age, however, their human-time decreases until they remain wolves until death. And Sam feels his last summer coming on just as he and Grace get to know one another.<br /><br />Sam and Grace's star-crossed romance is at times cute and steamy, but always genuine. There are some PG-13 moments, but these are handled tastefully; I never felt that Shiver was dirty or overly descriptive.<br /><br />And the words, oh the words! The language is more than descriptive; it's poetic. When I wasn't busy being absorbed by the plot, I was drinking in Stiefvater's descriptions; I felt the Minnesota winter of the novel. I frequently reread sentences and lingered over well-worded paragraphs. And on top of that, Maggie Stiefvater is funny! I laughed many times, and you probably will too.<br /><br />Finally, the ending is abrupt but satisfying. I was left with a smile...and a craving for the sequel (Linger, which is due in Fall 2010). I highly recommend curling up next to the air conditioner with this one.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Flynn must surely have experienced the lives she paints in her second novel. Each character is fully, painfully, creepily developed. Realistic and horrifying imagery - should be a movie.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is a great series although the books are better. Amazon did a terrific job of sending my package to me.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is Flynn's first novel and it kinda shows. It's a bit derivative. VC Andrews, Peyton Place... But Flynn really puts a modern face on the small town lives she writes. Her characters aren't quite fully developed, a bit of a lack of motivation. But the plot is so squirrelly that one doesn't really notice until it's over. A real page-turner, I just couldn't put it down.
B000008HPE|5.0|Do you like Huey Lewis and the News? Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humour...In '87, Huey released this, \\"Fore,\\" their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|For many wags and cynics in Hollywood, the days of the epic \\"sword and sandals\\" flick was over but like the Western, if it's done right like it here--you can have a winner!! Russell Crowe and director Ridley Scott  have made a film almost comparable to Kubrick's \\"Spartacus\\" in depicting a man's quest for freedom--how universal can you get?  Supported by a fine cast which includes Oscar nominee Joaquin Phoenix in a break-through role, Connie Nielsen, the late Richard Harris and Oliver Reed plus \\"I Claudius\\" Derek Jacobi, \\"Gladiator\\" will dazzle and entrance you.  I will never understand why a critic like Roger Ebert would give this absorbing film such a negative review--I'm sure his late colleague Gene Siskel would've give this a thumbs up.  I've seen this film several times in the theater and on video--and I can't wait for the Blu-ray edition to come out.  Well to update things a little, I've just bought the Blu-ray edition of this fine film from Frys and despite the negative reviews of the Blu-ray, I still found the film watchable and definitely an upgrade from the Standard def version.  There are a lot worse transfers in Blu-ray (The Italian Job, Clockwork Orange) than this film.  I do intend to keep it unless there is a better Blu-ray transfer of this classic.
B00186K7EE|2.0|I WISH I WOULD PAY $400.00 FOR THIS DVD!  ANYWAY GRAB HISTORY VOL.'S 1 & 2 AND BE HAPPY!
B00000IREA|5.0|I saw this on it's first theatrical run as a teenager, and it has been my favorite film ever since.  This DVD is a very nice 16 by 9 transfer of this fun movie!  And in my opinion, the cheesy special affects actually make this movie more endearing.  Jane has nothing to be ashamed of here, as she is quite beautiful and very funny. The print that was used needs some restorative work, but it looks great on an HD set, and the sound quality is good as well, considering it is monophonic.  It would be great if they did a special edition of this some day while some of the cast members can still participate. But that probably won't happen until another Barbarella movie gets made.  Highly, highly recommended!
6305558167|5.0|When this movie came out, I went eight times. Every time it comes out in a new format, I get it.  I will keep watching this beautiful story for the rest of my life. This telling of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table and their quest for the Holy Grail speaks to a primal part of your soul. Flawless acting, impeccable screenplay and stunning cinematography make up one of the best movies ever made.
0312360266|1.0|\\"Marked\\" is the first book of the \\"House of night\\" vampire series for young adults.  Not to be punny, but it sucks. I won't be reading any more of them, and since I bought the first four at the same time, i have to decide how to get rid of them.  Maybe I'll burn them in a cleansing ritual.<br /><br />I would compare this first book to the Harry Potter series.  Vampyres in this world are a publically-known species that excell in the arts...most actors and musicians are vampyres, like Shania Twain and Brad Pitt. The main character is a teen girl who is \\"marked\\" to become a vampyre. She must move to the \\"house of night\\" boarding high school for vampyres or she will die. Her family is upset, like Harry's family... They dont want a vampyre as a daughter; the rigid Christianesque stepdad in particular. We quickly learn how special she is (a la Harry; while all vampyres have a blue tattoo-like cresent moon on their forehead, hers is special too) ... her powers develop too rapidly, etc. She is taken under the wing of the schoolmistress because she's so special (a la Dumbledorf). Her roomate is a weirdo (a la Ron Weasley), and before you know it a cat familiar has chosen her.  And then we meet the villan of the series, Aphrodite (a la the Draco kid, but here Aphrodite is a much larger character). Rounding out the friend-gang are a gay guy vampyre (a la Hermione?) and two girls that act like they are twins. While the plot isn't that stellar and the writing is vapid (the adult author says that she had her teen daughter co-author so that the speaking would be realistically teen-speak enough), my main objection is how native american and wiccan rituals are described in detail and lifted up as wonderful while Christianesque religion is ridiculed at every turn. While Harry Potter is explicitly about witchcraft, at least it is vague or even just fantasy wand waving and latinized words. I'm not interested in reading about wicca under the name of vampyres.
0783219695|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1996 while vacationing in FLorida at my grandparents' winter home. I hadn't before had any particular interest in it, but once I watched it I was hooked. I was delighted therefore when my science teacher at that time announced that we would be watching it over a period of a few days in class. There were of course worksheets to go along with each viewing, assignments to see what details, sometimes having nothing at all to do with science, we could manage to remember. One such question asked for the name of both the artist and song playing at the moment when Jack Swigert answered the phone to receive the news that he would be on the Apollo 13 mission.    It wasn't until a few years later that my folks purchased me a copy for Christmas. At the time however, DVD's hadn't quite started to come into fashion, so it was still on VHS, complete with audio descriptions for blind folks like myself. These were extremely helpful, this being the visual film that it is. You were still left with a vivid picture of the scene and what the Apollo 13 spacecraft looked like.    Today, however, I managed to find this two-disk special edition at a local book, movie and gaming store and, after having a birthday, decided to treat myself. I'll say this much. You know the movie's good when one of the very astronauts from that mission, Jim Lovell along with his wife Marilyn, have their own commentary track, during which they discuss what a fine job Ron Howard did with the movie. And yes folks, Mrs. Lovel did in fact lose her wedding ring down a shower drain, though thankfully she did manage to retrieve it..    All that aside, I was really impressed with the film, even knowing almost nothing about the actual events myself. I knew it was based on a true story but that was about as far as it went. And let me tell you, the musical score only adds to the tention, particularly during certain moments which I won't reveal. All I can say is it was an amazing story, particularlygiven the limitations of technology and resources back in 1970, not to mention the extreme time deficit the astronauts and Mission Control were faced with. Even one simple mistake could have been fatal. The film's musical score captured the feeling perfectly and the cast probably couldn't have been more well-chosen. If you haven't seen this movie yet I wholeheartedly recommend it.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is a genre-breaking tale of love, circumstance, & isolation. I'll agree - the subtitles should be per the original; but really, one does not even need the subtitles at all to comprehend the emotions & motives involved. The two young leads give astonishingly grounded & sublime performances - the portrayal of Eli is truly a tour de force - not to be missed!    I watched this at 2:00am the other night via netflix instant viewing, and was truly blown away, despite the lower rez & funky dialogue drops. This is not for dead-heads; the movie moves at the speed of life. Look carefully for the hidden symbology & allusions. Best film I've seen in years.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|I first saw this movie at my mom's parents' back when I was about seven. It wasn't until my mom bought us a copy after we returned home that I became quite literally obsessed with the movie. Like many kids I dreamed of flying away on an alien spaceship, perhaps even to E.T's home planet. We have far too many movies in which aliens come to Earth with the sole purpose of enslaving if not annihilating us. E.T. and his fellows came to Earth, presumably as botanists, to collect samples of our soil and plant life for study. Frightened into flight by the FBI, these explorers accidentally leave one of their number behind, where he is later found and befriended by Eliot, a young, lonely boy from a broken home. As time passes, Eliot begins to form a psychic bond with the alien, at one point going so far as to disrupt a science class by trying to free a collection of frogs slated for disection. In the meantime, E.T. learns to talk with the aid of Eliot's younger sister Gertie and begins building a communication device to try to call his people so that he can return home. Things become more desperate however when E.T. becomes deathly ill, due no doubt to the separation from his own species and possibly to the polluted atmosphere of Earth, not to mention the untimely and unwanted appearance of the FBI agents who, unbeknownced to the family, have been running surveillance on their house since the alien's arrival.    One of the things that stand out most for me about this film is its musical score. Who could forget E.T's classic theme? The Atari 2600's rendition of said theme was, to put it simply, horrible, as was the game itself. The film's score is perfectly suited to it however, and it alone is powerful enough to evoke waves of memories anytime I hear it. It certainly did when my high school's band played a portion of it, that portion used during E.T's last flight, during an assembly. However I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with a lot of people who have reviewed this film. Though I might have liked to see a sequel, it's probably just as well that one was never made. As much as I like Spielberg, he probably wouldn't have done the original justice if he had tried to do a sequel. Sometimes you just don't do that. And in any case the story of the film didn't really leave room for adding on, so attempting to do so would probably have been an unqualified disaster.
B001KVZ6F2|1.0|I purchased this DVD because I so love Clint, but...I was really disappointed ,the acting was so bad, characters unknown, and down-right embarrassing! And, then I recall another movie Clint was in: Bronco Billy, and that sucked also....i do not recommend wasting you time or money on this movie!
B0015F1VY8|3.0|I was surprisingly bored out of my mind watching this.  It also bummed me out to see the Great Queen acting like a lovesick little girl and cow-towing to the sexy pirate character, played by Clive Owen.  I guess it was worth the rental to see Clive Owen walking around in tight breeches.
B000O176Q6|1.0|Yes, Yes .. we all know this is a great movie... but here is the kicker, the DVD version I have is better quality (after being upstepped) than this Blu-ray version. And I am not complaining about the fact that they did not have a super clean version of it before they transfered it to Blu-ray. They definately could have spent some time remastering this amazing movie, but they didn't.... fine, we get a lot of this on Blu-ray. But what I have never gotten, are digital blocks that can be seen quite often through the movie. It looks like it needs to be anti-aliased, I have never seen anything like it. Granted I am viewing it on a 61 inch 1080p DLP.. but I have never seen any of the other 80 Blu's that I have look like this. It almost looks like it is a MPG. I even tried to exchange it, for another but I had the video manager open it up and test it before I walked out the door with it and it had the same small digital block quality issue. The Studios need to take a little more time and effort to properly prepare the films for Blu-ray. This is unacceptable.
B002DKGWSO|5.0|This film is one of the best remakes I've seen. Also Wes Craven was very involved in the making of this so you know he was able to polish things up that he wanted to do originally. Although this can't have the same impact as the original did because of the times, this is still a great movie.
B000001E7V|3.0|3 1/2    Although my involvement in this trip-hop classic has trailed off a bit over the years, many tracks, especially in the latter half, remain undeniably intoxicating and prove there was such a time when the artist was producing visionary material.
076535618X|4.0|This last installment of the \\"Old Man's War\\" trilogy has John Perry retired and, along with his wife and daughter, responsible for \\"The Last Colony\\". The story develops nicely with twists and turns that keep you wondering what could possibly happen next, then it happens, and it all makes perfect sense. I found it exciting, fun to read, and difficult to put down. I've become a fan of Mr. Scalzi and can't wait for his next book.
B0029358GM|3.0|The last exciting album Wilco made was \\"A Ghost is Born\\". The last two efforts have somehow gone further and further into middle-of-the-road tedium. Some of the songs on this \\"Camel\\" release are just so banal I don't even have the inclination to play them again. I think they used the camel because they realized it was going to be the only thing bringing any life into the album! Other reviewers have pointed towards this being the resurgence of \\"A.M.\\"-type material--if \\"A.M.\\" had been this uninteresting and unforgettable, Wilco would have been stroked off my play-list long ago. Overall, what I feared might happen, happens here: \\"Blue Sky\\" repeated, even though no-one wanted that. Shame.

Pretty amazing over what I saw on cable the first time through.<br /><br />The only downside to this I found was the episodes do go by quick and youre left wanting more out of your collection.

0385341008|3.0|I read this book because of all the great reviews.  It wasn't a bad book -it covered an interesting, but sad era and some of the characters were entertaining, with a nice story line, but I found it hard to read in epistolary form - all those letters, all those characters became confusing.  And the end seemed a little rushed.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I have owned every American itteration of this movie and I love it. I'm a gigantic fan of FFVII and the movie pleases me most because it touches me with the characters and the feeling behind the story.<br /><br />This movie has taken much flak, which I would like to say I fully understand if taken from the perspective of one without working knowledge of the videogame, and this version does so much to fix many of these issues. If you don't like videogames or have never played FFVII then I doubt you'll like this movie very much. I leant it to a friend who is a bigger movie buff than me(who loves some of the worst films of all-time) thinking he would at least appreciatte the action sequences and animation. He called it garbage, lol. I watched again after I leant it to him and the story really is disjointed at best if you know nothing of the game.<br /><br />That said, this version should have been the initial release. It's criminal how many vital scenes were cut and/or shortened. The effect of these scenes being editing for the US audience actually makes a somewhat large impact on the potential to understand the story. Now that FF: Crisis Core is out and we all know the origins of FFVII the scenes with flashes of Zack are needed even more. This is now a trilogy of events and small tidbits that need to be fleshed out in a two hour period. Much of the additional content is also extended battle sections that(in one case with Rude and Reno) actually explains how the scene gets from one point to another where the original version left a magnificient gap.<br /><br />The most important thing to realize with this, other than what I've said about not playing the game, is that it's a movie about a videogame guys. People \\"flying around\\" and \\"surviving what no one on earth could\\" doesn't matter. The laws of our world don't apply in the world of FFVII folks, sorry, so just let it go. I've seen so much worse things done in films that try to appear realistic and yet a movie about a game series gets slammed for doing things we couldn't in real life. That's why it's animated.<br /><br />As far as the actual movie goes...it's just jaw-dropping if you look at it in a way such as I do. I've come to love it more and more with each viewing and it's starting to grow on me even more as I write this. It is simply beautiful. The animation is the best you will see outside of Disney Pixar and the japanese crew/director really understand how to use camerawork to improve the feel and aesthetics of the scenes. So many times I find myself just looking at the hair on the characters heads and being impressed. The score is also somethign for everyone. It is so well done and reminds me of something like the first Star Wars movies in that it has that quality that adds to the overall tone and direction of the scenes. A great example is the final bout with Sephiroth. There is a part *SPOILER ALERT*(I guess) where the music starts to change tempo, Cloud enters a stance and prepares for what he knows is going be one heck of an attack on the part of Sephiroth and the Shin-ra headquarters starts to come down upon him, literally. The music then rushes in and I just can't explain the feeling you get watching it if you invest yourself in the experience.<br /><br />For anyone who has always wanted to watch this, but didn't want to buy it yet, this is the ultimate and finite version. For anyone who watched the original and disliked it due to the lack of coherence in the story I strongly urge you to reconsider and at least borrow/rent it and give it one more chance. I feel it's worth every penny and minute I spent waiting for it to come to the States.d for doing things we couldn't in real life. That's why it's animated.

B001PPGAIA|2.0|First, I am not a Kidman fan. There is a big difference between being a movie star and an actor.  This film proves it. She is attractive, used to be married to Tom Cruise, so she is famous, but is totally outclassed by the material in this film. The film had some okay moments, but never when she was on screen. I laughed towards the end when a window explodes in her face, then in the next scene where she appears, there's not a scratch on her face! They'll do lots of crazy things in movies for the sake of \\"realism,\\" but they wouldn't want to have Kidman look bad.    Jackman was good, the boy was great, but I'd like to see a movie about the King George character. he was fascinating.    Even the special effects were poor. The end made no sense. Not recommended.
B000Q66PXE|1.0|The series is 5 star but the DVD was defective as per comments on it's return - spontaneously reverted to English subtitles (overly LARGE and distracting subtitles at that).  Has interfered with our enjoyment of the series as it was a birthday gift.  Return policy fair,  but has been delayed due to need for back order.  Dianne Davis
B000GAKDQA|5.0|I remembered this movie being funny when I watched it as a child, but it was a whole different experience as an adult, even funnier. I love this movie. Two thumbs up.
159308370X|3.0|The Woman in White is a Victorian mystery that is considered to be one of the best mysteries ever written. Written in 1859, it takes the form of an early detective novel with an amateur sleuth. The plot (man marries woman and schemes to get her money), albeit predictable by today's standards, is plausible, entertaining and, at times, slightly suspenseful. I attribute this slightness to the Victorian language itself. I'm not a fan of that style of speaking and  found myself frustrated at times and thinking just get on with it all ready, stop dragging things out. The story is told from the viewpoints of several characters - much like a legal deposition where each character relates what he/she knows about certain events.     The characters were interesting and memorable; however, I was disappointed in the characterization/treatment of women - weak and inferior. Was this an accurate portrayal for the times? I don't know. I have read other Victorian novels and didn't come away with the same feeling. Because of his portrayal of women, Mr. Collins didn't do justice to Marion Halcombe, one of the more memorable characters in the novel. A greater role would have been appreciated more by today's society but, in 1859, who knows. Creating a lead woman character who 'out thinks' a man may have been taboo. The other memorable character was Count Fosco, the mastermind behind everything evil in the world. I am being a bit facetious; however, the character was so full of himself that I couldn't help but inflate his imaginary ego a little more. His character was fully developed - I didn't like him and found him frustrating - once again this could be attributed to the Victorian language.    Overall, I did like the novel; however, the above issues prevent me from giving it more than three stars. I recommend to those who enjoy Victorian literature and those who would like to read one of the first mystery novels. This is a long book and not a quick read - you will be in it for the long haul - which you will enjoy.
B001W63DX2|4.0|Don't get me wrong here, I love the documentary, however, Sam Dunn did not achieve what he did with \\"Headbangers Journey.\\"  I met Sam in the parking lot of Izod Center for the first US show on this tour and from talking to him, I was excited about the effort, but to me, he missed the mark.  First off, too much time wasted on concert footage, all of which is supplied on the concert DVD.  Second, the band interviews were weak and minimal, though the sharing of opinions of one another was interesting and seeing Adrian and his wife play tennis was mildly entertaining (we've already seen Dave and Nicko play golf on Rock in Rio, so that was a dupe).  There was nothing new learned about the band on this DVD.  I feel that the documentaries in Death on the Road, Matter of Life Limited CD and even the short Day in the Life and Meet the Band from Rock in Rio was more informative.  Third, they show Dio, Kerry King, Scott Ian, Vinnie Appice, and who do they talk to?  A short blurb from Lars Ulrich and Tom Morello.  Fourth, were are the fan interviews?  One or two short clips from overseas (again, Death on the Road was better, as was Headbangers Journey).<br /><br />To me, the most interesting aspect of the film as seeing the plane with Bruce at the controls and even that footage was minimal, which is the second reason to purchase this DVD.  The main reason is the concert footage.  In my opinion, this is the best Maiden concert video, just behind Rock and Rio and way above the Death on the Road concert.  The concert footage is why I gave 4 stars.  It would have been 5 if the documentary had been better.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|I consider the first season of Veronica Mars to be nearly perfect, and the second season does very little to disappoint. It is another season-long mystery slowly solved over the 20 something episodes, with smaller mysteries and reveals strewn throughout the season. This recipe worked great for the first season, and works just as good here. While the ending seemed just a tad overdramatic (not much more than the first, though, come to think of it), there is very little to dislike about it. If you enjoyed the first season in any way, you can't go wrong with watching the second as well.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I'm an amateur, as you may read from my other reviews.  I purchased this speedlight as something I can use in cases where my built-in flash just isn't enough.  I also hate the glare and the harsh shadows built-in flash creates.  I wanted something in a decent price range that would perform well.    I attended a wedding recently and used this speedlight at the reception.  The results were 100 times better than I had expected.  The reception was in a converted barn/banquet hall with white walls and high arched ceilings.  Some of the reviews said that you can't expect this light to bounce off walls or ceilings more than 10' away, but I found that I was able to bounce the light off the ceilings and the walls and still come out with a very well-lit exposure.  I bounced the flash at 45 degrees off the ceiling from 50' feet away and had a very good picture of the cake cutting.    Some reviews said that the flash didn't go very far either, so I tried it outside at night.  With a direct flash, I was able to illuminate (albeit no well) an object about 80' away.  For each of these tests, I had the camera on full-auto mode.  The flash adjusts itself according the camera's settings (which I find very convenient).  It feels sturdy when its attached and clips in without a problem.  Its also very lightweight.    The only thing that I can find wrong is this:  I have a fisheye attachment for my 18-55mm kit lens that I like to use for macro photos--this flash unit doesn't have enough clearance to use with that attachment.  There is a huge barrel shadow in the bottom of each frame, even at the longer end of the zoom.  For the money, its a very good little addition to my system.  I'm sure that I'll spring for the SB 600 or 800 eventually, but this will be useful for a long time.
B000A59PMO|5.0|The first season of Veronica Mars is a nearly flawless piece of work. A season long murder mystery fed piece by piece over 20 something episodes sounds like a little much, but it is pulled off wonderfully. There is, of course, going to be filler when that many episodes are involved, but each and every one goes into giving a clearer understanding of who Veronica is and the life she is suddenly trying to adapt to. Enrico Colantoni is downright awesome as Keith Mars, and the series is worth watching just to see him and Kristen Bell interact as father and daughter. Wonderful television all around.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I was at the third of the three Madison Square Garden shows that this live CD was culled from, and it sounds just as great as I remember it. Clapton is always better when teamed with someone of equal talent ( The Cream Reunion at the Garden was a good example; I thought it was terrific, even if Eric, in his recent memoir, disagrees). Winwood has never sounded better. The song selection covers a lot of territory, without going for the obvious \\"Hits\\". Buy it and enjoy it- I am!
B000NA2BEU|2.0|The first two seasons of Veronica Mars were fantastic television. Then, the CW destroyed it. It's common knowledge that they wanted Rob Thomas to change up the formula of the show, and take away the season-long mystery, which was really the best part of the show. Add in a few annoying cookie-cutter California teen characters and you have a horrible 90210 melodrama that just happens to bear the Veronica Mars name. \\"Liek omg is Logan and Veronica going to make up lol?\\" becomes the basis for the whole show. The final episode of the series, however, is a wonderful return to quality, and is really the only thing I can recommend watching out of this season. Stick to the first two, and just pretend that this didn't happen.
B000UEYH7I|4.0|Mr. Pollan is a great writer, interesting.  I especially was engrossed with the first two sections dealing with corn and grass.  I had never encountered the word 'rumen' (grass eater) before reading Omnivore's Dilemma, for instance.  It never occurred to me that all cows eat (naturally) is grass.  The reason I gave only four stars is twofold:  First, the author seemed so well studied and sourced that it seemed puzzling that his natural way to hunt a pig was with a rifle (with scope).  It may be natural but only since recent history invented ballistics.  Pork would not likely be on the menu during the pre-ballistics eras; I'm pretty sure a wild pig would be a bit more difficult to round up using bow & arrow, spear, or club.  So, I stumbled on that part.  Second, Mr. Pollan seemed too focused on garnering accolades for his ability to cook and organize a meal.  This siphoned much energy from his point: making the reader really think about where his food came from.  I would recommend Omnivore's Dilemma but be prepared to have the book fizzle in the last chapter (unless you are also a gourmet chef); it's like Mr. Pollan got sidetracked and forgot what he was writing about.  This reader anticipated a bit of a scolding for not knowing or caring where our food comes from, but instead was schooled on preparing and cooking it.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Batman Begins is exactly what Batman should be. Realistic, gritty, and the story of how a man decides to dedicate his entire being to stop from happening to others what once happened to him. I applaud the choice of Nolan to use Ra's as the villain, instead of just going with the usual Penguin or Catwoman or something that could easily be done. Ra's is Batman's greatest foe, and was done great justice in this film.<br /><br />I choose this film over The Dark Knight for one reason, really. The Dark Knight was a little TOO realistic. Batman is a comic book character, after all, and Gotham city is a fictional city, filled with fantastic villains as well as the normal real life problems that plague everyone else. In Batman Begins, the city of Gotham feels like it could be a real city, but it also gives you a view of twisted places like The Narrows that remind you of the fantastical portion of the story. The Dark Knight, on the other hand, just looks like it takes place in Chicago. I didn't get that fantasy feeling from it at all. I guess it is more just a personal preference, but I feel like Batman Begins had the perfect balance of reality and fantasy, without catering to either one more than it should.<br /><br />Both Nolan Batman movies are exactly what Batman should be, but I just feel that this one got it MORE right the first time.

B00005N7Z1|5.0|\\"RoboCop\\" has the distinction of being a leftist shoot'em-up, which might be why the film attained instant cult status when it hit theaters in 1987. It has lots of bloody action, cool-looking technology, and skewers the ideals of Reagan Republicans. Kind of like \\"Rambo\\" for liberals. Detroit, Michigan of the near future is overrun with crime, and the city has hired Omni Consumer Products (OCP), a private enterprise, to manage its police force. OCP's vice president Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) has high hopes for a problematic ED-209 enforcement droid to augment the police force. But up-and-comer Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) has a better idea: A cyborg that incorporates the corpse of a deceased cop, retaining his instincts, increasing his firepower, and programming his directives. When Officer Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is murdered on the job, he is transformed into RoboCop.<br /><br />\\"RoboCop\\" is one of those liberal movies that even conservatives admit they love. It's a violent, bring'em-to-justice action movie but also an anti-privatization tract. Elements within OCP are corrupt, working unscrupulously to create a need for their product in order to sell it. The company is at odds with the Detroit police force, which is threatening to strike. And RoboCop is just an enhanced version of a corporate drone, stripped of his own identity and programmed so that he may become \\"product\\". OCP is planning a huge industrial complex called Delta City that will provide 2 million much-needed jobs, but the script even manages to spin that unfavorably. One may or may not agree with its sentiments, but the sheer quantity of socio-political commentary that screenwriters Edward Neumeier, Michael Miner, and director Paul Verhoeven were able to pack into the film amazes me.<br /><br />Black comedy, gory action, and RoboCop's sympathetic nature make it all watchable. RoboCop's monotone statements remind me of a mechanized Dirty Harry. They evoke both sly laughter and vengeful approval. But RoboCop is victimized by forces he cannot control and that he struggles to understand. His simple mind is compelled to cope with dirty politics and unscrupulous profiteering. The audience sympathizes with that. Leeza Gibbons makes a semi-cameo as a newscaster whose reports allude to many hot political topics of the 1980s, as do fake commercials that interrupt the news. In fact, there are so many references to then-current events -nuclear arms race, toxic waste, SDI, the Jarvik heart, urban violence- that it feels like a trip back in time to my high school government class. \\"RoboCop\\" is simultaneously over-the-top and sly, and it's still fun.<br /><br />The DVD (MGM/Orion 2001): I'm reviewing a bare bones edition of the film, whose only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer (1 1/2 min).

B00186K7EE|5.0|Beware before you buy. There are no USA (Region 1) Moonwalker DVD's officially released through Sony/Time Warner. The DVD versions of the movie were only released to Australia, Europe, Japan and South Korea. Most likely if you plan to get a DVD English version, it will be a converted or burned copy. The true original version released to the US, was only available as a VHS. I am not sure whether or not Time Warner will release US (Region) DVD's to the America, but I hope they do, considering the greatest performer ever, has passed away. If you just want to own a copy of the DVD, and don't really care whether or not it is \\"authentic\\", you can find plenty on Ebay for a reasonable price, anywhere from 20-50 dollars. People who are claiming they have the US DVD version of Moonwalker available for $300 or more dollars are trying to rip you off, with a burned or VHS converted disc.
B00260HH3K|3.0|Evolution was a good standalone action movie. I am a James Marsters fan from Buffy/Angel and I got a couple of other movies he was in to round out the collection.<br /><br />Quite a few parts of the plot stayed the same.<br />Although they should have made Goku's Oozaru form gigantic and actually destroy some buildings in the city or something before he reverted.<br /><br />Also the girls should have been less aggressive.<br />I did expect a young asian or asian looking actor to play Goku but Chatwick did well in the role.<br />And of course the great Chow Yun-Fat did exceptionally well in his role.<br /><br />I think the modernization of the film caused the plot holes.<br />they mixed Goku and Gohan's roles by letting Goku go to formal high school. Also where was the OX King? Having him in as Chi chi's father would have made it a bit better.<br /><br />By itself it was a pretty good action movie.<br />However in my collection I'd put it with the martial arts films instead of the dragonball ones.
B00004VVND|3.0|It was a long time since I saw Westworld for the first time. I remember finding it exciting with a lot of tention, thanks to the great performance of Yul Brynner as the menacing robot. It's still a nice movie, a bit dated today, but funny and near the end with some striking scenes. I don't find it that scary anymore, but the performance of Brynner is convincing.
B0000062GK|5.0|You can tell from my review title that I am a big Satch fan. I have a very hard time picking my favorite Satriani CD, because I love all 12 of my Satch CD's, but if I had to pick my favorite, this would be it. I've heard some people say that satch is a shredder, that gets my goat. He can play blazingly fast, but he's a lot more than a shredder. Anybody that can listen to his music, and say he's another shredder is deaf as a door nail. The man can come up with some amazingly beautiful music, and when he kicks it in high gear, there is still purpose behind the music, not like shredders that just go fast for fast sake. The man's a Genius in my book.

0805079831|1.0|This book is more of a political mouthpiece than something to be taken seriously. Klein's claims in the book are so outrageous that I think even the most staunch liberal would have a hard time believing it. The most \\"shocking\\" thing in her book is when she goes on to blame Milton Friedman for corporatism, and various problems within the global economy, while ignoring anything that Friedman himself has actually said, or that he was totally against the Iraqi war.     Let's review some facts, which I think Mrs. Klein seems to have left from her book. Who said this great quote that seems to agree with the author about war: \\"War is a friend of the state.... In time of war, government will take powers and do things that it would not ordinarily do.\\"...why it was Milton Friedman, on the Iraqi war, warning of the government imperialism.     How about this one? \\"Business corporations in general are not defenders of free enterprise. On the contrary, they are one of the chief sources of danger.... Every businessman is in favor of freedom for everybody else, but when it comes to himself that's a different.\\" That was Milton Friedman again...    I'm surprised the author didn't propose bringing back the draft, which Friedman was opposed to, or better yet say he was for the draft. This book is a shock doctrine indeed, in that it's a shock people would actually believe the garbage spewing from Naomi Klein's finger tips.    If you are serious about economics, don't bother to read this book, it's more of a comedic piece on political bias than an ode to any sort of economic reasoning.
159102594X|4.0|In this darkly humorous debut novel, Joe Abercrombie introduces us to what might, in less sure hands, be the stock set of fantasy characters: a mysterious wizard, a trouble berserker, a conscience-ridden torturer, a wronged woman and a naive nobleman, all in a country with wars on its northern and southern borders and rot from within. But Abercrombie's characters are far better than the cardboard cut-outs that plague most modern fantasy.<br /><br />The plotting and setting are interesting, but not exceptional. The characters, by contrast, are vivid, earthy and all too human. Logen Ninefingers, barbarian and berserker, called Bloody-Nine, who understands that you have to be realistic. Glotka, former Champion, captured by enemies who ruined his body, now a tortured torturer. Jezal, a frivolous nobleman of sorts, untested and undirected. The Named Men, Dogman, Tul Duru, Black Dow, Three Trees and the rest, still alive in North despite the usurper kind Bethod's effort to send them back to mud.<br /><br />There are no happy endings. This is, if anything, fantasy noir, where disappointment and disaster are far more common than success and happiness. But \\"The Blade Itself\\" is a fine read, and a great start for a trilogy.  And the characters will stick in your mind.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|If, as I've heard rumored, Gran Torino turns out to mark Clint Eastwood's final film role, he'll at least have gone out with another memorable performance to add to his long list.  Portraying the unlikely friendship that develops between a disaffected 70-something Korean War vet and the son and daughter of a Hmong family that lives next door, the movie is a surprisingly affecting and at times even funny story of personal redemption and cultural collision.  With a backdrop of urban decay and gang violence, it also makes for an interesting portrait of the continuing decline of the American city, even if its ultimate focus is more personal.  Much like The Wrestler, another of the past year's best films, Gran Torino provides a look at the kind of people and areas many of us don't see in our daily lives, let alone in movies, and portrays its characters sympathetically without neglecting their flaws.<br /><br />The film is largely carried by Eastwood, whose well-established tough-guy identity gets a new twist in the form of Walt Kowalski, a retired Ford worker who stubbornly clings to his house and his old-school ways in a Detroit neighborhood that's rapidly being taken over by immigrants and a larger world that no longer seems to be his own.  In a way, Walt represents the flip side of Eastwood's iconic characters and persona: he's The Man With No Name turned into a dinosaur, Dirty Harry rendered irrelevant by changing times.  We first see Walt snarling his way through his beloved wife's funeral, angered by the various signs of modernity he sees around him and the lack of respect shown by his descendents.  As the movie goes on we get a better idea of the reaons for Walt's anger: his sons have grown into suburban yuppies with overprivileged brats for children, and his middle-class neighborhood has come to be dominated by minorities, especially Hmong immigrants whom he describes using a variety of disparaging epithets.  This is clearly a guy who's not too familiar with the concept of political correctness and who feels no need to discard the prejudices he's taken for granted his whole adult life.<br /><br />It would be easy, especially at first, to dismiss Walt as a simple crank and bigot, and while that description wouldn't necessarily be inaccurate it wouldn't tell the whole story either.  In his own way, Walt is an idealist, one who believes in certain values--patriotism, self-sacrifice, hard work, proper lawn care--that he believes (rightly or not) aren't shared by his new neighbors.  As we see through a series of conversations with the well-meaning local priest, Walt has fallen victim in his old age to a combination of cynicism, alienation, and racial hatred, born of his harrowing experiences in Korea and a mounting disgruntlement at a world that's relentlessly changing around him.  The film does do a pretty good job (largely through Walt's growled declarations to himself) of allowing the viewer to see the world through the eyes of an aging man who's surrounded by the unfamiliar and having a hard time adjusting to it.  Charged at age 78 with largely carrying the film, Eastwood has the difficult task of turning Walt from a caricature to fully fleshed-out character over the course of two hours, a feat that few others could pull off but that's helped immensely by his natural gravity and his own gritty, stark direction.<br /><br />While Walt may seem like a giant ball of hate at first, he does eventually start to warm up to his teenaged Hmong neighbor Sue (Ahney Her) and later to her brother Thao (Bee Vang), even after Thao tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation.  The bond that gradually emerges between Walt and Thao may be unlikely at first based on Walt's obvious hostility toward other races, but it eventually comes to seem perfectly natural because they're both committed to maintaining their integrity in a world that doesn't seem to have much room for it.  Thao is trying to make his own wayin an immigrant society of limited horizons, with few options for the future beyond taking a menial job or joining his cousin's gang, when Walt sees enough potential in him to try to help him overcome the limitations of his surroundings.  Vang has to turn Thao into a real, conflicted person rather than just an idealized symbol of his people, and while he's not as good as Eastwood he still does an admirable job of keeping up with his legendary costar.  Scenes of Walt developing a comfort level with his Hmong neighbors carry an almost sociological fascination, along with the irony of a cranky old racist getting absorbed into the world of Asian immigrants while his relationships with his own family become increasingly strained.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of a few flaws, Gran Torino manages to be a largely excellent movie.  The opening scenes of Walt expressing his seemingly all-consuming bitterness and hatred can get a bit tiresome, and the ending is a little over-the-top and dramatic compared to what preceded it, but there's still more than enough quality material to make this film worth watching.  The slower, more contemplative middle section is actually the most interesting part of the movie, as we see the challenges faced by both the aging Walt and the coming-of-age Thao in their daily lives, as well as the slow, awkward process of Walt letting his guard down enough to become a mentor to Thao.  Those looking for a change of pace from the never-ending stream of remakes and TV and comic-book adaptations coming out of Hollywood could certainly do a lot worse.ety of limited horizons, with few options for the future beyond taking a menial job or joining his cousin's gang, when Walt sees enough potential in him to try to help him overcome the limitations of his surroundings.

1416914307|4.0|Great ending to the trilogy!  City of Glass was my favorite of the three...<br /><br />About the series:<br />Negatives: 1)Too many details. I found myself skimming the two page descriptions of the surroundings because it was boring to read that much about how a room looked. 2)The sibling issue made the second book not very enjoyable to read. You're cheering for the same people that gross you out together. It just wasn't right for her to do that to us!<br /><br />Positive: The story was pretty amazing, as were the characters. The world, the beings, the plot, the romance and friendship were all fantastic; you really grow to love the characters and their relationships. It makes up for the negatives that I came up with. I tore through the Mortal Instrument books and found myself daydreaming about the book throughout the day. Loved it!
0440238153|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is the third book in the His Dark Materials series.  The story continues with finding out what happened to Lyra and how Will plans on saving her.  It also follows the stories of Lord Asriel, Mrs. Coutler, Mary Malone, and many others.  Will and Lyra lean they must travel to the land of the dead and to get there they must give somthing up.  It is very heart breaking, I had a hard time reading this part.  Great action sequence with the war between Lord Asriel and the Authority.  I enjoyed reading about Mary Malone and the Mulefa.  But best of all were Will and Lyra.  I loved their story!  I cried my eyes out when I finished the book.  I felt like there was so much left open at then end of this book.  It made me want more.  Philip Pullman is an amazing writer!    On another note, I know how sensitive some people are on the whole religion topic.  As for me, I am on the same boat with Philip Pullman, which may have caused me to enjoy it even more.  But, if you are not like me, and are very religious and take things way too seriously DO NOT read this series.  There is a good posibilty you will be offended by certain things in this story.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I purchased this set a few months ago and I love it!  Having read tons of reviews prior to buying this product, I was worried that some disks might be scratched or something.  The very minute I received the product, I sat down and tested every disk to make sure they're good.  I didn't find anything wrong with them.      Although the disks are not set up by seasons, it's really simple to find the episodes you want to watch because you can easily find them in the booklet that comes with it.  The only complaint I have is regarding the delivery.  The product was shipped really fast.  However, the UPS people didn't even ring our bell or anything to give us the package.  They left it sitting outside our porch in the dark.  I saw the package at like 9pm when I went outside to take my sisters somewhere.  I would've been so pissed off if the package was stolen or have gotten damaged with the snow (I ordered it in December).  But, other than that, I'm happy with the purchase.  If you're a F.R.I.E.N.D.S. fan, this is a MUST HAVE!  I've purchased other collections before but this is by far, my FAVORITE!!!

B0002WS3S2|5.0|Daevid Allen, originally with SOFT MACHINE in 1967-68, formed GONG when he got stuck in France after a Soft Machine Gig.  GONG has a strange mythology evolved from one of Daevid's strangest LSD trips, revolving around PHP (pot head pixies), and the OCTAVE DOC (who knows?), which results in a psychedelic trilogy of GONG albums, that tell the story of ZERO THE HERO. So, RADIO GNOME INVISIBLE Part 1 is the FLYING TEAPOT album, \\"Angel's Egg\\" is part two, and YOU is part three.  Do you need to listen to all three albums, to get the plot or musical leitmotifs? Haha, are you SERIOUS? Tho there is a small thread of coherantcy within the RADIO GONG Trilogy,  what you REALLY want the YOU  album for, is the incredible, etherial, cosmic music that the album contains. It brings together the SPACE WHISPER of Gilli Smyth, the slide guitar effects, and freaky theories of Daevid Allen, the lead guitar playing of STEVE HILLAGE, Mike Howlett on bass, Malherbe's beautiful and spacey Flute and Sax playing, along with a synth player, a percussionist, etc.  to get these 10 minute astral journeys in the music, which are as close as music can come to turning into a spiritual UFO.  That sound, is much closer to what you might hear in the KOSMISCHE music that was coming out of Berlin at the time. (GONG, tho a French band, had at least half their members from Britian, and  ALWAYS sang in English.)  What would have been the first side of YOU, had many short songs, four of which were less than 3 minutes long, most of them only two minutes long. BUT, you do have a couple of spaced out semi-instrumental songs like MASTER BUILDER and A SPRINKLING OF CLOUDS on the \\"first side\\".  The intelligiblity of the lyrics is too heavy to understand, so the booklet that comes with the CD, has many written bits to connect the songs' concepts together.  This album truly shines, on the second side of the album, which was only made up of two songs, ISLE OF EVERYWHERE and YOU NEVER BLOW YOUR TRIP FOREVER, both over 10 minutes long.  I can never get enough of these long, etheric songs. Its not that I dont like Daevid Allen's lyrics, or Gilli's space whispers. ITs just that those LSD inspired concepts, really DO date some of this material.  It's cute, its funny, its deep in its own allagorical way, but its DEFINATELY hippie dippie.  But the long instrumental parts are NOT dated.  It has bits of new age sound, jazz sound, and a bit of rock still struggling to break thru here and there. At the end of YOU, we bid farewell to ZERO THE HERO, ie Daevid Allen, and GONG loses about half their musicians, as the drummer takes over to create SHAMAL. (The next great GONG album is the first solo album by Hillage, FISH RISING, since most of the GONG gang play on it.)<br /><br />For those who have NO idea what the GONG sound is, this is a great place to start.  If you are more inclined to enjoy a more tightly constructed album, with narrative lyrics, etc, then you might enjoy \\"CAMBERT ELECTRIQUE\\" as a first purchase, or \\"FLYING TEAPOT\\".  Many people connect this band with the CANTERBURY sound, since Daevid Allen was in SOFT MACHINE for its entire developemental period.  However, Daevid Allen lost control of GONG, and he and Gilli quit the band during the recording of the first album of the trilogy.  He returned to the band, but not truly as leader.  GONG in its 73-74 heyday, simply contained too many top notch musicians, who had too many good ideas, to remain in one single configuration.  GONG is a hybrid in many ways, and perhaps that is the secret to its mysterious hold it has on those who discover the magic of its music from this period.  Anybody into TRANCE music, freak folk rock, or maybe even the etheric sound of King Crimson around 1974, or the ENO/Fripp sound, would DEFINATELY enjoy this album.  Anyone who wants to take a vacation to the International Space Station, but only wants to stay for 20-40 minutes, would also love the album.  YOU is one of my all time favorite albums, certainly my favorite by GONG. It always sounds new, no matter HOW often you play it.favorite by GONG.

B0026J8LHM|2.0|I'm as hardcore fan of Dream Theater as my money and my sanity lets me, and thanks to them I became a fan of some of their favorite bands: Rush, King Crimson, Porcupine Tree, ELP, and many more. That's why I don't really like this new CD.<br /><br />I resemble some of the interviews of Pink Floyd when they were starting to break up when \\"The Wall\\" came out and the grip of the band was solely in Roger Waters hands. I feel this is happening in Dream Theater: the band is heavily influenced in the opinion of one person: Mike Portnoy. Don't get me wrong, I know all albums somehow are \\"directed\\" by MP and most of the sound that represents DT comes from his vision of what the band \\"should sound like\\", he even says it in several interviews, his vision is the main purpouse of the band, and that is the main problem right there: There's only one voice in DT right now, Mike Portnoy.<br /><br />I see Black Clouds & Silver Linings as solely a Mike Portnoy album, not a Dream Theater album.<br /><br />The simpleness of the riffs, the total exclusion of significant \\"proggresive\\" sound (see: Liquid Tension Experiment, sudden changes in rhythm, intention, beat, speed), the obvious inclusion of TWO songs that are basically made to release as singles (A Rite of Passage and Wither), the monotonous and decadent beat of most of the songs(almost black metal-ish), the monopolization of MP and JP writing of lyrics, and the \\"necessity of a theme\\" (in this case, a bleak sound), all this makes the album almost unbearable to hear to me. I expected a progressive, technical, up-and-down album filled with different songs. Songs to remind us all that Dream Theater is an \\"musical\\" band, a band that doesn't care what people think of their music... not even fans (Never Enough comes at mind), a band that set the bar by representing and pay tribute to their own inspiration bands thus making not only them, DT, the creators of their legacy, but also the bands that preceded them.<br /><br />The \\"new\\" era of DT showed us how creative albums are made: Albums like Scenes Form a Memory showed us what a real Progressive Metal concept album was. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence showed us that the band had power and flexibility without the boundaries of a record label pushing them. Train of Thought showed us that Heavy Metal can be also progressive. Octavarium showed us that a band should pay tribute to their inspiration by making music as inspirational as them.<br /><br />Both Systematic Chaos and BCaSL show us that the band is rapidly decaying not only because of age, but because of bad direction. Even though I like Systematic Chaos, there's one or two songs that show some signs of this: Repentance and Prophets of War. This songs are exactly copy-pasted in BCaSL: Repetitive, boring and \\"heavy\\" just for the sake of being \\"heavy\\" (poser behaviour)<br /><br />Dream Theater in this new album shows us that \\"Progressive Metal\\" is a very fluid concept for Mike Portnoy, the de-evolution cause of his \\"vision\\" is making the band crumble into a power-ballad band.

1582701709|3.0|Obviously this book has received huge attention and is helpful to people.  Being familiar with positive thinking and the law of attraction, however, I found this book to be more of an outline.  It also helps one find other authors that appeal to them for further reading.  There are many more detailed books that are more helpful, from book by Wayne Dyer to Deepak Chopra to Abraham-Hicks and Dr. Norman Vincent Peale.  In addition to that, true seekers who want to keep themselves ahead of the curve on staying in this law of attraction zone, continued reading is a must.  I also recommend reading about people who have mastered this philosophy in their lives.  A recent book that's entertaining and helpful in this regard is about an active modern American centenarian.  It's called Elsa's Own Blue Zone and there is also a website by that name to learn more about her. She lives this way daily.
B00186K7EE|1.0|If you look on the UK site, Moonwalker is still distributed in other countries.  Personally, I think it is ridiculous that US distribution stopped. Obviously, we haven't forgotten or stopped loving the King of Pop with three of his albums skyrocketing to the top ten in less than week.  With that said, whoever owns the rights to Moonwalker, Ghosts, and any other books or videos not in circulation, would be fools not to start distributing immediately! Get the presses going!  We lost our \\"King of Pop!\\"  Fans are going to keep trying to recreate the feeling of MJ's magic for many years to come.
0440241901|3.0|Undoubtedly, we all know that Sophie Kinsella follows a certain formula in her books and I totally love it. However some of her books I like more than the others.<br /><br />\\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" is one of those that I don't really care for. First of all, I dislike the main character - Emma. She is a good friend and all that, but she is portrayed as way too silly in my opinion, an airhead almost. She has too little ambition and wit. The story itself reminds me of Meg Cabot's \\"Queen of Babble.\\" The plot is too thin, a little boring in the middle and almost anti-climatic.<br /><br />However, this book is a satisfying mindless summer read. There are some good funny moments and fans of Kinsella will enjoy it.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Coming into this novel, I was not sure what to expect.  I had no experience with the character of Jack Reacher or the author.  After reading the novel, I would gladly pick up another in the Reacher series.    The novel is the definition of a summer beach read.  The writing is not very complex.  The characters are somewhat one-dimensional and their motivations lack background and detail.  The villain in the novel is the villain and plays the villain like a James Bond movie.  In fact, the books feels like a James Bond movie without the gadgets, but is much grittier.    The plot, while pretty straightforward, is entertaining.  I found myself eager to pick up my Kindle DX and continue reading well into the night.    The cons, and what kept this from being a 5 star book, are also what makes it a beach read.  The characters are simple, the plot is simple, and the writing is simple.  The book is entertaining, but is very straighforward and doesn't encourage the reader to contemplate or reflect on the characters or events.      Also, I found some minor formatting problems in the Kindle edition where dialog was not separated by a line break.  One quotation ends and the next would begin on the same line.  Not a knock against the book (I didn't take points off for this), but something that Kindle readers should be aware of.    In sum, the book is an entertaining read and I recommend it.  If you are looking for something with a little more meat on the bones, you may want to consider looking elsewhere.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|Despite what some reviewers have said - I think there's nothing wrong with taking the ORIGINAL recordings as they were on the LPs and recreating it in its entirely on a single set collection.  The concerts were originally spread across multiple albums, which was a pain.  So it's good to to have them all together.  If you had to have ONE Allman Brothers recording, this is the one to have.  Along with the Rolling Stones \\"Get Your Ya Yas\\" and Cream's \\"Wheels of Fire\\" - this has to stand as one of best live recordings of the 20th century.  After that, buy the 2CD \\"Gold\\" Anthology OR get ALL the first 5 albums (this is #3). (Note: you can acutally get the first two albums on a single disc called \\"Beginings\\" which may be cheaper than buying 'the Allman Brothers Band' and 'Idelwild South' separately - but you miss out on the nude pics in the first LP, ha, ha...)  There is another version of the Fillmore Concerts, a remixed version (missing \\"Midnight Rider\\") and you can toss a coin as to which one you prefer - they are both worthy.  This version has a slightly more raw sound and the guitars are up in the mix a bit.  Me, I love the screaming at the end when they were yellling \\"Whipping Post\\" - and wish I'd been there.  Duane Allman was a *genius* player.
B00192IV0O|3.0|It's been a strange journey for the Black Eyed Peas. Originally a hip-hop trio with an intelligent, multi-cultural vibe, they now make music that sounds like it was produced by Daft Punk.<br /><br />This is not such a bad thing. But let's call a spade a spade: This is a party album. It's not meant to be timeless. It's meant to be listened to while drinking vodka and Red Bull, or while working out at the gym. It's about energy and moving your body and having a good time. When it doesn't try to be anything more than that, it works. But when the album tries to go deep on tracks like \\"One Tribe\\" or \\"Generation Now\\", it just reinforces how superficial this whole outing is.

B00260HH3K|5.0|I've been a diehard DB, DBZ, and DBGT fan ever since I was six and I waited for this movie to come out ever since 2002. It was absolutely amazing! Justin Chatwin and James Marsters brought Goku and King Piccolo/Lord Piccolo to life on the big screen! All of the characters looked almost exactly like they did in the cartoon: Goku has spikey hair and wears the orange costume, Lord Piccolo is green, wears a robe, and has antenna-like lines on his head, Bulma has a blue sripe of hair on her head and has her capsule bike, Yamcha has the same hair that he had in the cartoon and has a flying truck as a vehicle, Grandpa Gohan has a power pole and grayish hair, Chi Chi looks the same as she did in the cartoon, Master Roshi wears a Haiwaian shirt, and Mai also looks the same as she did in the cartoon. The people who made the movie couldn't make the animal characters, such as Oolong the pig, Puar the shapeshifting cat, and all of the dinosaurs, due to issues that they probably had with time or problems with computer animation, but the movie is still amazing! They were able to put Lord Piccolo's henchmen in the movie, (they renamed them the Fu Lum henchmen) although they don't look the same and they aren't named the same way (Piano, Tambourine, Drum, and Cymbal aren't in the movie) but they look like they're mutated (some of them have three eyes, crab-like claws, etc.) and they can regenerate. Mai still has the airship from the cartoon, Master Roshi has the jar that he tried to put King Piccolo/Lord Piccolo in in the cartoon, and the Dragon Balls are in the movie too. The special effects are incredible! They were able to have Goku and Lord Piccolo fly around in the air just like in the cartoon and the energy blasts/energy beams are incredible too! It seems like the creators of the movie took them straight from the cartoon and put them on the movie screen, especially with the Kamehameha Wave! The comedic tone of the cartoon is maintained in the movie too, like when Goku fights Master Roshi when he says, \\"I am Master Roshi the Invincible! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\\" or when Goku, Bulma, Yamcha, and Master Roshi are looking for another Dragon Ball and Yamcha accidently sits on an erupting geyser, and in many other parts of the movie. Also, the special effects for when Goku transforms into the Oozaru giant Saiyan monkey are amazing, too! I loved this movie and I can't wait to get it on DVD when it comes out on July 28 of this year! The creators of it did an incredibly amazing job with it an and I hope they make two or three more sequels to it! Maybe they can put Frieza or Cell or Babidi and Majin Buu in the sequels, if they make them?!
0785126708|5.0|What defines this series is a quote from Dr. Strange \\"he's never been angrier, so he's never been stronger.\\"    Hulk has always been a strange character to define because his level of power and standing the Marvel Universe varies by cannon and is directly relative to his level of anger and/or emotional turmoil.  In this series he's more powerful than he has ever been and likely ever will be again.  So it's a great excuse to have one guy beat the hell out of all of the major players in the marvel universe.    With that said I did enjoy the base storyline because it has elements simplicity as well as the shades of grey that make good guy vs good guy interesting.

0441013597|5.0|Dune is one of my favorite books ever.  I first read it when I was 11 years old and have probably re-read it at least 15 times over the years.  Re-reading Dune is like hooking up with an old friend.  From the very first I was fascinated with the universe created by Frank Herbert.  The characters are vivid, the story is complex - filled with politics, intrigue, betrayal and redemption - a vast story set in a rich universe.<br /><br />I've always been fond of superhero stories and Paul Atreides is an archetypal classic.  Guided by an unusual childhood education, trained by skilled and experienced mentors, he is thrust into circumstances beyond his control over which he ultimately prevails.  Paul has learned many skills of body control, martial and social arts - but he is also the product of a multi-generational breeding program designed to produce a being more powerful than any in the universe.  To the chagrin of the Bene Gesserit, the chaperones of the breeding program, Paul shows up a generation too early and throws off their plans.  Paul's powers along with his acceptance by and ultimate leadership of the Fremen desert people carry him to victory over the enemies that killed his father and stole his birthright.<br /><br />There are many images and characters from this book that I still carry with me - Sandworms, ornithopters, stilsuits, Paul, Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Stilgar, the quotations at the beginning of each chapter, mentats, the Bene Gesserit, Ix, Leto, Jessica, Alia, The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Baron Harkonnen, the gom jabbar, the Sardauker, the fremen, melange, the planet Arrakis, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />What a fantastic story.  I think it's been a few years since i have read it - time to read it again!

0307341569|4.0|My Thoughts: The last 1/4 of the book was nerve wracking and the story came together beautifully. I always feel like I should've seen it coming (the truth) but as usual I was shocked and then amazed at how Flynn was able to make all of the pieces fall into place. This book is not for the faint of heart, there's some graphic language and scenes, but she stays true to the tone of the book. If you read and loved Sharp Objects then you're in for another satisfying read. If you enjoy books that have an undertone of dread, evil lurking behind the pages, and characters that you just can't quite figure out if they're the good guy or the bad guy, then I believe you will like this book.
B001W63DX2|5.0|I have been an Iron Maiden fan since these songs first came out in the 80's; so nothing on this DVD is new to me, and that made me hesitate for a second or two before buying.  This is a back stage pass, so to speak, of a monumental tour.  I won't reprint the details of the tour but suffice it to say it is incredible.         What is truly amazing to me are the reactions of the fans in places like India and especially South America.  One young man truly captures the power of music to an oppressed and very poor population.  It must be an incredible feeling for the band to be a part of this.  In other parts of the world, Iron Maiden is experiencing a \\"new awakening\\".  More and more and younger and younger fans are just now starting to discover this terrific band.  There is a great quote from Nicko McBrain were he says the band keeps getting older, but the kids in the front row keep getting younger!       The interviews with the band are not as much as what I was hoping for, but they are good enough; and it is easy to see how even the road crew loves this group.  The sheer power of this band is immense, and it fills me with a warm fuzzy feeling to see that they are still playing just as loud as they used to do back in the late 70's and early 80's.    This DVD is well worth delving into.  If you are a fan of Iron Maiden, then you are not reading this review anyway.  If you are simply interested or a newcomer to Maiden, then, by all means, \\"Up the Irons\\" and buy.       Oh, did I mention there is an entire 2nd DVD with concert footage?
B0011HF6GE|1.0|bon hiver is precious. and yes it is easy to believe this is the work of one man. it definitely sounds like a man playing with himself. it takes real genius to do the one man thing and not have it fall very flat. there is no genius here. self delusion and alot of fanboy drips sighing. the same bunch that in another time would have drooled over paul macartny's solo dreariness . it really is of equal quality. just plain bad writing. surely no one in their right mind would seriously write a title like \\"for emma, forever ago\\"     jeeze!  \\"FOREVER AGO\\"!!!!! that is high school sophomore drivel!!    if you want a one man band, try hasil adkins.

B001TH16DS|5.0|Season one of The Original Series is, in my opinion, the best of the three.  It contains so many great, iconic episodes: \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before,\\" \\"The Corbomite Maneuver,\\" \\"Balance of Terror,\\" and of course the two most iconic episodes \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" and \\"Space Seed.\\"  Season two and to a lesser extent season three certainly had some great episodes, but this first season outshines them all for the shear quality of the writing and originality.    Having watched all the episodes of Star Trek when they aired on television I was much more interested in the reworked versions. I have to admit that I was blown away at the new visual effects and improved quality of the picture and sound.  In some cases the new visual effects were greatly different from the original but in most cases just a few small tweaks were made to improve flight and battle scenes.  For me, the real improvement was in the quality of the prints.  When you watch the Original Series on television you can tell the prints are old and well worn, but with this Blu Ray version all those spots and hiccups are gone without ruining the overall quality of what you're watching.
055380684X|5.0|This book by Daniel Coyle addresses the fundamentally important topic of how we can become better skilled in any field of endeavor (intellectual, artistic, athletic, etc.).  The ideas presented in the book are similar to other recent books on the subject, such as [[ASIN:0316017922 Outliers: The Story of Success]] by Malcom Gladwell and especially [[ASIN:1591842247 Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else]] by Geoff Colvin (which I think is actually better than Coyle's book).<br /><br />The book is written in a journalistic style and has lots of stories whose ideas tend to be somewhat repetitive, so the book could be greatly compressed.  However, the stories are at least entertaining, and the book is still a relatively quick read, so I guess I didn't really mind the stories too much, although I still prefer a more systematic and streamlined presentation.  Here are the key points from the book:<br /><br />1. Becoming really good at something is a matter of skill, which is a matter of practice.  Inborn talent might help, and a basic minimum level of talent might even be a prerequisite, but practice is the more important factor.<br /><br />2. Becoming really good almost always requires a LOT of practice.  Some researchers suggest 10,000 hours of practice as a general benchmark to attain expert level of skill (which takes about a decade at 20 hours per week).<br /><br />3. Practicing up to several hours per day is effective.  When you try to practice more than that each day, returns diminish.<br /><br />4. Effective practice needs to be \\"deep\\" in the sense of involving a high level of focus and working at or slightly beyond the limits of your current ability.  In other words, you have to continually stretch yourself.  One way to do this is to spend part of your practice time in situations similar to, but more difficult than, the actual performance situation (eg, using flight simulators to practice flying in extreme weather and with aircraft failures).  By contrast, practicing what you're already good at won't help much; you'll just stay that good without getting better, or you will improve very slowly.<br /><br />5. During practice, you should aim for perfection and should be very alert to errors.  Further practice should then work to correct those errors, going in slow motion and breaking the task into modules if necessary, and then speeding up and connecting the modules as the errors diminish.<br /><br />6. Coaching can be a huge help.  A skilled coach will know how to connect personally with you, spot errors, and offer targeted advice to help correct those errors, all on an individualized basis (by contrast, \\"one size fits all\\" coaching will be suboptimal and maybe even detrimental).<br /><br />7. Deep practice isn't easy, and therefore often isn't fun, so you need strong motivation to do it.  Many sources can provide such motivation, such as compelling role models.  Committment to long-term goals can be an especially powerful motivator.  And practicing in a dilapidated environment can also highlight the difference between where you are and where you would like to eventually be, thus fueling motivation.<br /><br />8. If you stop practicing, your skill declines (exponential decay?).  In other words, \\"use it or lose it\\" is true.  But if you continue practicing effectively, your skill can continue increasing, even into the later years of your life (especially for non-athletic pursuits).<br /><br />In his book, Gladwell adds (I think correctly) that luck can also be a large factor in achieving outlier-level success.  Such an emphasis on luck might be viewed as contradicting Coyle's (and Colvin's) thesis, but I don't think that's the case, especially since luck is itself a factor in discovering the right way to practice, finding a good coach, becoming inspired, etc.<br /><br />Coyle makes a big deal about neuron myelination as being the biological basis of his ideas, but I think the role of myelination is superfluous because (a) there's surely a lot more going on than just myelination, (b) we don't really need to know the biological mechanism(s) to apply the principles in practice, and (c) in this case, knowledge of the purported mechanism doesn't add much value anyway.<br /><br />Overall, I do think this is a good book on a very important and practical topic, so I certainly recommend it, but be sure to check out the books by Colvin and Gladwell also.f myelination is superfluous because (a) there's surely a lot more going on than just myelination, (b) we don't really need to know the biological mechanism(s) to apply the principles in practice, and (c) in this case, knowledge of the purported mechanism doesn't add much value anyway.<br /><br />Overall, I do think this is a good book on a very important and practical topic, so I certainly recommend it, but be sure to check out the books by Colvin and Gladwell also.

B000VDDWE2|4.0|Overall, this is a fun film.  I realize that the politics of global warming get people going on both sides, but viewed strictly as an action/sci-fi film, I found it very entertaining.  Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhaal are quite serviceable in the leads, and Emmy Rossum is cute as a button (why hasn't she had a more successful career?).  There are a few story glitches:  [SPOILER ALERT] At one point, we are told that Texas and the Southwest U.S. are spared from the devastating ice and snow.  Why, then, are people shown streaming over the Rio Grande (during perfectly fine weather!) and why does the U.S. president end up in Mexico City (instead of, say, Houston)?  Also, with all the attention on Dennis Quaid making it back to New York to rescue Jake, what about the families of the other people trapped in the library?  None of Jake's friends seem the least concerned about the fates of their parents or siblings.  The especial effects are good, with the exception of the wolves on the ship, who seem too obviously cgi.    The Blu-Ray transfer is ok, but not great.  Some scenes are very crisp, but many seem at about good DVD level.  Like other reviewers, I also had some trouble with the sound, with some of the dialog being a little difficult to make out.  There are no extras beyond a few deleted scenes.  The most interesting deleted (or alternate) scene involves the wolves chasing Jake all the way back to the room in the library with the fireplace.  That the wolves were dropped from the release print is another indication that the cgi on them just didn't work out.    All in all, a decent flick, particularly if you get it, as I did, as part of Amazon's combo with the Terminator and I, Robot.
0780619951|5.0|This is a remarkable film. Let's begin at the beginning...<br />The opening, ground-breaking title-sequence is by designer, Kyle Cooper, the spiritual progeny of the late great Saul Bass (genius who liberated the title sequence from its boring status quo, and told stories with the titles before the movie even began in Psycho, Vertigo, etc.) The motion typography of Cooper brilliantly hints of things to come as we see type morph and mutate against a backdrop of biological imagery in a frenzied, twitchy manner, foreshadowing the characters we'll discover on Moreau's isle...<br />The film updates the story, which has as its original premise, vivisection, to a more modern DNA explanation. And the leap in filmmaking since its predecessor (the AIP version starring Burt Lancaster and Michael York) is amazing. The effects update the Planet of the Apes (1968) state of the art to Stan Winston's advanced mechanical creature effects. The scenes surrounding the animal revolt are truly frightening as sound, special effects, and excellent direction combine to great effect.<br /><br />But what really mesmerizes is the \\"strange brew\\" of talent - a bold stroke on the part of Frankenheimer, as he combines the forces of the Brando and Kilmer characters, each as eccentric as the other, to play against the dramatic \\"straight man\\" (our sympathetic center) played by David Thewlis. Thewlis is great as we watch his what-on-earth-is-going-on, get-me-out-of-here expressions grow with the progressive revelation of the island's bizarre secrets.<br /><br />I'll admit, there are some truly bizarre elements in the film - Moreau's dwarf \\"pet\\" who joins him at the piano, for one. The elements coalesce into a concoction that won't suit all tastes, but for those who appreciate bold, out-of-the-box strokes of originality, even if they don't all work perfectly, there is much to enjoy here.<br /><br />I return to the Island often.
0312370849|5.0|I abolsutely loved this book.  I read it in record time and could not put it down.  The story hooks you right from the beginning and keeps it until the end.
B00297FEUS|4.0|I bought this disc for the extras that are included...and believe me, there are PLENTY.  There are SEVENTEEN previously unreleased tracks on here, one of which is the brand-new tune \\"30,\\" which is pretty cool.  How many bands put 17 unreleased songs on an album?  Most would put one or two.  There are almost twice as many unreleased songs on here as there are on the original album.  So that's why I bought this.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, the unreleased songs are definitely demo quality, which was a little disappointing.  Still, even to a casual TS fan like me, it's pretty cool to get that many \\"new\\" songs to listen to.<br /><br />But here's the real bonus:  buy the album at an independent record store (not a big chain store) and there's a FREE DVD included, which is a live show from 1984, just prior to the release of Stay Hungry.  The DVD is worth the price of the album.  Didn't get the DVD?  You bought it at the wrong place, guys.  Kudos, by the way, to Twisted Sister, who gave a little extra to the small, independent stores--as opposed to all these albums (from GnR, AC/DC, Bruce Springsteen, etc)that are released only at Best Buy or WalMart.
B000W44IZW|4.0|I really enjoy the beginning of the movie (Enzo and Jacques as children) that was shot in B&W; the cinematography is stunning throughout but there's something special about the B&W.  Jean Reno was perfect in his portrayal of Enzo.    I didn't have any problem with the import (Korean) version like some reviewers reported.
0345495004|3.0|I'm sorry to say this book disappointed me a little. The main character Mamah Borthwick, the woman with whom Frank Lloyd Wright had a long extra-marital affair, is interesting enough, as are the times, however she seemed so blind to her own motives that I became frustrated with her.  Frank himself is portrayed as such an unlikeable man (albeit with undeniable genius) that I couldn't see why Mamah would pay such an enormous price to be with him, virtually abandoning her children, destroying her reputation, and causing such harm to her husband and her sister. Genius alone didn't seem credible, nor did her assertion that she'd finally found someone she could talk to, someone who understood her.  It smacked of the cliche.<br /><br />The threads of Ayn Rand's objectivism run through the fabric of this novel, and the end result is that the characters, in this author's opinion, seem adolescent and narcissistic, but even worse, in terms of fictional characters, they are blind to their own flaws.  There are moments when they do take tiny peeks into their own souls, such as when Mamah discovers Wright's slipshod money management and the callous way in which he accumulates things \\"of great beauty\\" but never pays, leaving others to suffer for his pleasure. However, these seem rather tacked on, as though an editor suggested they ought to be there, rather than coming organically from the author's own experience of the characters.<br /><br />Finally, AND THERE IS A SPOILER HERE - I found the point of view flawed.  The book is told in free indirect discourse, from Mamah's POV, which works well for almost the entire narrative -- right up until the point Mamah dies.  Then it becomes...ahem...inconvenient, for obvious reasons, and the point of view shifts for the last two chapters to focus on Frank.  I found this jarring and unsatisfying.  In reading the author notes at the end I learned that Horan wrote the book twice, and the first time there were four points of view.  She states it wasn't a very good book.  Well, perhaps four was too many points of view but, in my opinion, she didn't quite solve the problem in the final version.  Pity, because Horan shows much promise.<br /><br />Having said all that, there are some moments of lovely writing and insight, such as when, near the end of the book, Mamah describes Wright as someone who, \\"had come to mistake his gift for the whole of his character.\\"<br /><br />As first novels go, it's pretty good, but I suspect some experience will serve her well. I look forward to seeing what she does in a few years.y good book.  Well, perhaps four was too many points of view but, in my opinion, she didn't quite solve the problem in the final version.

B0002ZEOBO|1.0|First, this is N*O*T a review about the music or performances.  Mike was a classic who could mesmerize, and I assume you are already a fan.<br /><br />Over the last 10 to 15 years there has been an arms race in the world of pop/rock to create the loudest cds possible.  The businessmen want to have music that sounds louder then the competition when it first starts playing to get the listeners attention.  They do this by increasing the average (rms) volume to be as close to possible to the maximum (peak) volume.  In the old days (like 1992), music was mastered so that it retained much of it's dynamic range, which is the difference between the loudest and the quietest parts.  A drum hit would be twice (or more) as loud as the surrounding music, when a singer (like Cobain) would scream his voice would rise above the music and shake the listener, crescendos would be louder then the soft parts, and overall the music communicated emotions fantastically.  It's like with speech, if you listen to someone who talks in a single volume, you get bored and no emotion is transmitted.  So what this arms race for loudness does is it reduces the amount of dynamic range and makes all the sounds the same volume; the part of the song that is whispered becomes as loud as the crescendo with screaming.  This has three major effects.  First, it drains the potency and emotion out of music.  Second, it causes ear fatigue.  When you turn the music up a bit to listen to it, your ears will become tired and you'll want to change the music or turn it down or stop listening.  Thats why when you put on some MJ disks made in the 80's or early 90's, you can listen longer, you get more involved, and you can listen louder.  If Invincible leaves you cold, this might be the reason.  And thridly, it causes distortion and clipping, which prior to the loudness war were absolute no-no's in mastering/mixing/recording.  So, the cd portion of this set is mastered very loud, with little in the way of dynamics.  It is done cynically and without regard to sound quality.  If you want to hear the best sounding MJ, get the disks made pre-1998.  Today the word 'remaster' almost always means inferior super loud disks with no dynamic range.  I would avoid buying anything that says 'remastered'.<br /><br />If you want more info on this depressing trend, look up 'loudness war' on wikipedia, or google 'pleasurizemusic' and/or 'turnmeup'.<br /><br />Oh, and the video bit doesn't suffer from this problem as DVD's have standards that prevent this abuse from occurring.  That's why when you watch the concert, your ears don't become tired and the music is more involving.is done cynically and without regard to sound quality.

0316017922|5.0|Thought-provoking and exciting.  De-bunks many of the paradigms of success.  All parents of young children should read this book to get a new perspective on factors that truly affect their children's development.  I rank this book way up there on the influence scale, on a par with \\"The Naked Ape\\", \\"The Third Wave\\", and other books that shape thinking in a profound way.  A must-read.
0307269981|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed this book. It is completely different from anything I have read before, and it keeps me guessing. I did not read \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" (although I will now), but this second book in the trilogy stands on its own. The story moves around quite a bit, but once you get involved, things start to become clear.<br />I have never encountered a protagonist anything like Lisbeth Salander, a very strange young woman, which makes her interesting.<br />This book is translated from Swedish, and there are some unfamiliar references, such as Maundy Thursday, and characters names which take a little getting used to.<br />This book is multi faceted, it covers Lisbeth's travels, her \\"work\\", her lifestyle, as well as venturing into the publishing, sex trade, and criminal worlds.<br />I found the book hard to put down, I was really interested in how things would play out, but I would guess that not everyone would enjoy this book as much as I have.<br />If you are interested in reading a completely different type of exciting book, this is it. If you like more familiar, formulaic types of books, you may not enjoy this. I do highly recommend it, though.<br />I know that the author passed away at a young age after finishing the trilogy, what a shame.

It sucks that the bad copies made it out to the public in the first place but kudos for their fast action after catching the mistake.    [...]    \\"IMPORTANT NOTE: Some customers may have purchased a copy of the Twisted Sister - Stay Hungry 25th Anniversary Edition with lower than normal audio levels on Disc 1.

For those of you that directed your anger at the band, they had nothing to do with this issue so you might want to re-think who to be mad at.  Just swap your defective copy and hopefully all will be well.  Peace.    PS - Disc 2 is excellent and worth the price of admission in my opinion!  It's great to hear the demo versions and outtakes.  Keep in mind that they aren't complete songs as they were just demos from the \\"Stay Hungry\\" sessions but they are very cool just the same.  And the new song, \\"30\\", is great!
B00005QGAV|5.0|This is his fourth studio album under Epic Records originally released in November 1991. Although artistically it may not be quite as consistent as \\"Thriller\\" or even \\"Bad\\" it's still a terrific album that stands well on its own. The two biggest hits were \\"Black Or White\\" and \\"Remember The Time\\". But there were several other hits here as well: \\"In The Closet\\", \\"Heal The World\\", \\"Jam\\", \\"Will You Be There\\" (later featured in the film \\"Free Willy\\"), \\"Who Is It\\" and \\"Give In To Me\\". Some noteworthy album cuts include \\"Gone Too Soon\\", \\"Keep The Faith\\" and the title track.    This album was one of four re-released in 2001 just ahead of \\"Invincible\\".  Because of the album's extensive length however, it's the only one not to include any bonus material.    If you've been a die hard fan of MJ, you probably have this album already like me. But if you're a new one, this is definitely essential. The artist may be gone, but the music lives on.    TT 76:59

B00278U1W0|3.0|This is classic Eric Clapton, phenomenal as always.  However I was very disappointed to discover that my PS3/Onkyo Tx-SR805 combination was not able to play this in full Multichannel surround sound.  I wish the creators of this DVD had considered us mid-range audiophiles.    The DVD audio setup has two options: Stereo (2-channel) and DTS surround.  Well, the PS3 decodes the audio into linear PCM, which isn't horrible, but it isn't as good as full multi-channel.  I found a decent explanation of these limitations here:    [...]    \\"...the PLAYSTATION®3 internally transcodes all audio and soundtracks encoded in any of the next-generation bitstream audio compression formats into uncompressed linear PCM. In other words the PS3 does not and cannot pass-through any audio or soundtrack encoded with Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD High Resolution Audio, and DTS-HD Master Audio; it's a limitation of the Silicon Image HDMI Transmitter chip (SiI9132) used by Sony in their PS3. Therefore, for those using the Sony PS3 (or any one of the majority of other high-definition disc players with the same limitation) as their only high-definition disc source, a receiver such as the Onkyo TX-SR805 will never have the opportunity to receive and decode the next-generation bitstream audio compression formats used on a growing number of Blu-ray discs.\\"

B00005LC1H|5.0|If I have to pick the most distinguishing characteristic for Fawlty Towers, it would be that it is the funniest comedy I have seen. You can watch it many times over the years and every time you will have tears from laughing, and for days after you will be wearing a smile, with an occasional burst of laughter, to the dismay of those around you.  The show has been crafted with great attention to detail in the writing, the scenes, the filming, and does not resort to vulgarity or profanity. But beyond that, it is one of those rare, magic accomplishments that happens once in a great while, and cannot be duplicated.  Much has been written about the show, some of which I find surprising. For example, it has nothing in common with the Three Stooges. The occasional poke, or slap is in entirely different context. It usually is the culmination of a long string of frustrations.

1582701709|1.0|I am suspicious of any self-help book that has a back jacket photo of an over-made up female.  Clearly she doesn't like herself, so what do I have to learn from her?<br /><br />It gets worse.  She gives as examples of those who knew \\"the secret\\" Beethoven and Einstein.  Everyone knows they were very creative.  Fewer know they were miserable people who made those around them miserable, too. We don't get self-help books to be miserable. We get them to be happy. If you want to get this title so you can be more like Beethoven it's because you know nothing about him but, \\"Duh duh duh DUHHHHHHHH.\\"<br /><br />A previous reviewer noted that by calling it \\"The Secret,\\" it was made exclusive, scarce, and therefore desirable no matter what the content. Another noted that the author wants you to believe positive thinking works after a while, but negative thinking works immediately. This is a combination of loophole, (\\"If it doesn't work it's because YOU didn't try hard enough,\\") and victim-blaming (\\"YOU attracted that rotten job.\\") that makes me ill. Women, of course, are made to feel responsible for nurturing just about everything so this fits perfectly for those most vulnerable.<br /><br />Add to that a cutesy, pretty layout and you've got a perfect combo for making a sad woman feel even more responsible for her sadness.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|No over blown review from me.  Lifelong Nick Cave fan.  Not to impressed with the Seeds last two albums, a little to mellow for my tastes.  This album ROCKS with a capital R!  An excellent return to form.  Easily one of my favorites of 2008!
0743455967|5.0|Published in 2000, the first part of On Writing is autobiographical, although the whole book is sprinkled liberally with facts from King's own life, pertaining to his childhood, long marriage to novelist Tabitha, struggles with drugs and alcohol, near-fatal accident, and career as a writer. The second half of the book is entitled On Writing and centers on how to write fiction (although much of it applies to other kinds of writing as well). With over 300 million copies of his novels sold, and many stories adapted for film and television, I think King is well qualified to write about writing.<br /><br />Although King says that there's no magic formula for becoming a good writer, he offers solid, down-to-earth advice in an entertaining way. His friendly style and honesty drew me in as I discovered that On Writing is filled with practical advice. One thing King says, which shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone who aspires to write, is to \\"read a lot and write a lot\\". By this King means four to six hours daily. That's a large portion of the day (or night, if you're more nocturnal). But a serious writer needs to have discipline and work at the craft.<br /><br />King's book reinforced what I learned in school by emphasizing the basics. From the book, here are some ideas about what good writing is:<br /><br />  * Active and purposeful<br />  * Adverse to adverbs<br />  * Free of clich&eacute;s and hackneyed phrases<br />  * Clear and concise (cut out extraneous words)<br />  * Courageous (take some risks)<br />  * Follows grammatical rules, but breaks a few rules once in a while<br />  * Honest, plain, and direct<br />  * Offers the right amount of description<br /><br />(Mr. King, if I've left anything crucial off this list, please let me know.)<br /><br />Read this book if you're serious about your writing. It may even count towards the daily requirement of four to six hours of reading and writing!<br /><br />(From my book blog, Suko's Notebook.)

0802798225|5.0|I bought this book yesterday and finished it in 4 hours. It's one of my favorites now :). I recommend this book for all the young adult readers. It was amazing to see how the two main characters Alex and Brittany seem to develop a relationship with each other. They go through a lot and have some understanding of how they relate to one another, which is their life outside of school. I feel like I'm in high school again and wish that I can be with a bad boy like him :). Anyways, it's been a long time since I've found a really good, romantic, and funny book. I TRULY LOVE this novel! so go purchase a copy
B001QITO52|5.0|Setting aside Waters exit from the band and Gilmours song writing abilities, I have come to thoroughly enjoy this album. Granted, it took me longer to get a feel for this one then say 'Dark side of the Moon' or 'Wish You Were Here'.   It really is underrated and under appreciated. I encourage all Pink Floyd fans and newcomers to give this a try without comparing it too much to Floyds past. Gilmour and crew deserve a chance.     AMLOR manages to capture the essence of Pink Floyd nicely without Waters involvement. In fact, I'd say the remaining band members have managed to recapture some of there creative essence featured in their earlier material that was lost as the turmoil in the band grew.

B00005QGAT|5.0|I would recommend this album to any m.j. fan.  It has superb arrangements and great songs and of course great vocals.  My favorite songs are Off the Wall, Rock with You and I Can't Help It. This is basically a disco album.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|As I write this review, it has been a week since Michael Jackson, perhaps the biggest legend in modern pop music, has passed away.  Though he only released six proper studio albums: Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, History, and Invincible, nearly all of those were milestones in pop and R&B music.  Thriller, of course, remains his crowning achievement.  As one can clearly see, though Jackson may be gone, the music certainly didn't die along with him.  Thriller is still a glaring testament to the integrity of 80s pop music.  Without this album, there might be no Madonna, Justin Timberlake, or a whole crop of dance artists.  Sure some 'artists' like Paris Hilton and Souja Boy may have ravaged the genre but luckily, those who are truly talented have allowed Jackson's music to live on even after his passing.  And we have Thriller which represents what Jackson was all about.    Thriller was released after 'Off The Wall\\", Michael Jackson's first solo release and possibly the finest disco album ever released.  It's known that the reason his albums were released far in between was so he could take advantage of the trends of the time:  \\"Off The Wall\\" was disco, \\"Thriller\\" was 80s dance pop, \\"Bad\\" was late 80s dance pop, \\"Dangerous\\" had an almost hip-hop theme to it.  More importantly is the fact that these album represent the best these genres have to offer.  Thriller for example starts out with, \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\", its a dance pop tune but with a strong message.  There is substance to it which is in direct contrast to what a lot dance pop was like at the time.  Whether you like to jam to the beat or you want life-enriching lyrics this is music you will definitely enjoy.    The peak of Thriller, of course, is its holy trinity of dance singles: Billie Jean, Beat It, and the title track.  Each one set the boundaries, not just musically, but visually as each one had a ground breaking MTV video accompanying it.  He was also one of the first black artist featuredon the channel.  The influence this album had on modern pop culture is staggering.  These songs and their videos seemed like they have always been there, in much the same way Michael has always seemed to have been there for the younger generations.    Several years later, Jackson released \\"Bad\\".  It was a good album in its own right, but nothing could match the brilliance of \\"Thriller\\".  In fact to the day he died, Jackson would never see glory quite like this amazing release.    PS: This new release is good but I personally don't bother with the remixed tracks featuring Fergie, and Akon.  I'm not a huge fan of either artist.  But if you like them, then you have an incentive for purchasing this edition of the album.
0767812166|4.0|You don't have to be a movie buff or a sci-fi fan to love this movie. The acting is excellent (oh heck, maybe there's not much acting going on but Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen are great anyway) and this film has a nice balance of drama and humor. I e-mailed Sony Pictures Entertainment to ask for a widescreen DVD release, and of course I got back a \\"form\\" response, but I feel better for trying - a full screen DVD is better than no DVD at all.
0060899220|5.0|When I started reading this, I was sort of annoyed because I kept hearing Anthony B's voice/over voice he uses in his show, No Reservations. However, I stuck with it and am so glad I did. This has so much information about the underworld of the restaurant biz that I was astounded--that goes on and that too? Anyway, this is a great read, whether or not you are in the business and if you're wanting to become a chef, it's a MUST! I am ready to dive into his next work--[[ASIN:1596913606 The Nasty Bits: Collected Varietal Cuts, Usable Trim, Scraps, and Bones]].
B001MYIXAC|2.0|Stiff acting,awful dialogue destroy this DVD. Maybe the original subtitles could save it. But this edition is awful.
B000F9RB9Y|1.0|I agree with some other reviewers--for a blu-ray edition the picture is awful. I watched the upconverted standard DVD edition on the same blu-ray equipment and LCD TV and the picture is as good if not better. My question is, what is the reference point for the 300+ people who gave this DVD a 5-star rating?
B000001EYO|2.0|All these reviews by wanna-be hipsters, and not one - ONE - of you noticed the most OBVIOUS omission in the album. Mucha Muchacha from Esquivel. One of (the many) best scenes in the film, poolside with Bunny and the nihilist - \\"I'm just going to go find a cash machine\\" - uses that song.     I guess Esquivel's estate must be hella expensive for these low-rent bozos.    I DID NOT WATCH MY BUDDIES DIE FACE DOWN IN THE MUCK IN NAM SO THIS COMPANY COULD PASS OFF...
B000WS4QJG|5.0|ok, so call me a dork!  But... i'm a 50ish year old grandmom who always thought MJ was terrific.  I bought all his \\"records\\", played them constantly while my kids were growing up.  While my husband always brought home the \\"sofisticated\\" sounds, I loved to steal away in my room or later in my car to blast the latest MJ tunes.  His music always put a spring in my step and energy to my day!  He'll be missed.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I have watched the show from the beginning, so, because it's a favorite, I decided on this, just to have it around to pop in occassionally whenever I have the need for a little \\"sex\\". Going into detail would be a little redundent but suffice it to say, this is a great show for women. It's about sex, sure, but it's also about empowerment and making choices, sometimes the right and sometimes the wrong (Adian!). It's a must have for fans of the show. Also, the movie was great, too---[[ASIN:B001DDBCUU Sex and the City - The Movie (Special Edition)]].
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Great beach read.  First book I've read by Kate Morton and I'd like to read her other books now.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|America and the world in the 1980s -- a perfect encapsulation.  Beautiful, fun music from a true artist.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I have not read any of Burke's novels so I was not sure what I was getting.  The overall result, I want to read his works.  That's about as high a praise as I can give because it is seldom that such is the case.<br /><br />Yes the movie is more slow paced than the usual action genre so prevalent in today's market but every once in a while we need to see something more on the screen than spectacular car chases.  Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding in this as he is in virtually everything he does.  The only time I had a problem with his casting was when he takes on a man far bigger, younger and stronger than he and manages to kick his butt.  Jones is completely out of breath at the end of the sequence and the \\"this is a movie\\" feel of the scene was patently evident.  Otherwise, casting is superb throughout.<br /><br />My absolute favorite moment was when Lee's character was interviewing a poor water man from the back bayous who had discovered a corpse in a drum.  The man's accent and speech was absolutely perfect.  It took me right back home to the deep South as very few other movies have.<br /><br />A bit of a predictable plot as you slowly begin to eliminate the possibles but this story is not so much about plot as people.  Good flick.
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|I liked it! It came in a timely fashion and was well worth the money!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Both this, the 2008 BBC version, and the 1988 film, of Little Dorrit are really good, and each has its strengths and weaknesses.    The 1988 version was filmed for the big screen (shown in theaters as two separate movies), so it doesn't have the see-their-pores closeups of the 2008 version.  This gives the newer version an intimate feel, but loses some of the epic scope.    The newer version has far more sumptuous scenery, but the Marshalsea (Debtors' Prison) is not as cramped or squalid.  The newer version's prison apparently was a thinly rehabbed church or college, and hardly looks punitive at all.    The two Amy (Little) Dorrits are certainly different.  The earlier one is mousy and stoic the entire way through (actually closer to the book), whereas the newer one is spunky and feisty and constantly chafing at restraints--more admirable, but less like Dickens.    The two William Dorrits are also very different.  Alec Guinness, in the earlier one, plays him as a grandiloquent narcissist, blithely sponging and never doubting his entitlement.  Tom Courtenay, in the later, plays him as a nervous, constantly self-doubting wreck.  Guinness's interpretation is more fun to watch, and has much more dramatic punch when, in the banquet scene, William cracks up and becomes human.    The later version is more literal, and leaves nothing out.  The earlier one left out Rigaud/Lagnier/Blandois, and really this is not much of a loss.  The newer movie leaves him in, handles him better than the book (this is the one real flaw in the book: melodramatic claptrap), but still he is not worth the trouble.  The earlier one also leaves out Tattycoram and Miss Wade--interesting characters, but ones we like today more than Dickens did.    Both versions are really excellent, though quite different.    See both.
B001GCUNWG|5.0|This movie is still cute and fun even with the third installment. My husband and I saw it in 3D at the theater just for fun and also to screen it before taking our grandkids. We think it is the kind of movie you can enjoy with your children at the theater. We will buy the DVD because we know our grandkids will want to watch it over and over again like the previous two movies. The 3D is interesting but not necessarily worth the extra cost. Just have fun and enjoy it like a child does. Yes, Scrat and his acorn stole the show again.
0765342294|5.0|There are already plenty of accurate reviews of this book up so I won't elaborate too much. All I'll say is that all aspects of this book, from the political intrigue and dialog to the combat and associated ethical dilemmas are executed absolutely flawlessly, what more could you ask of a novel?
B001FB4W16|5.0|Beyond looking good (which most Blu-Ray seem to), this disc *sounds* great too. Lots of really good music in this really good tv series, and the surround effect makes it sound fantastic.  We can't wait for the opening credits in each episode.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater is really a cut above.  These guys are real musicians---formally trained, very skillful, musicians.  If you're a big fan of ridiculously creative time signatures (7/4 in one of the tracks!), tempos, big musical ideas, and so on, you're not going to be disappointed.  This particular album is really convoluted.  One really has to listen to the songs five or ten times before you realize what masterpieces they are.  I find myself thinking some of the tracks are a little overzealous---the title track for instance just doesn't grab me with any of its what..20 minutes?..of sound.  Just a bit ambitious.    But the first track, as well as \\"Panic Attack\\", are easy for me to appreciate.    If you're new to Dream Theater, this isn't a bad place to start.  To me, the general sound and style and concept reminds me very much of some combination of Fates Warning, a modern incarnation of Jethro Tull, with a healthy dose of Rush and Styx.  I can imagine almost any of those four bands playing any of these tracks.    At least that's my opinion.  I am sure that someone will take mortal offense/exception to this comparison, but whatever.    I recommend it.  Buying this album caused me to buy the new one, which, if the snippits are at all representative, we're in for something pretty good.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|ok but Ididn't like the container it came in. Ithought it would be in seperate containers for every year, but the content is good.
B000J0UD94|4.0|Director Ridley Scott, as he tends to do in many of his pictures, gives us some magnificent scenery and colors. The photography is just beautiful, and I'd love to see it in on a nice Blu-Ray transfer. Heck, I've never seen it on a Region One DVD.  What is the problem here?    Also excellent is the soundtrack, one of the best ones I've ever heard.    The main characters are played by Gerald Depardieu and Armand Assante, and their English is not to understand, which is why I'd like a nice DVD with subtitles. . At 150 minutes, this film dragged in spots....yet the visuals and music are just too good to pass up, but this movie needs to get some respect here and presented with a transfer worthy of it.
0517548232|5.0|This is probably the best volume that an economics neophyte could read.  Hazlitt explains how economies work first by exposing the glaring flaws in all the most common economic instruments meddling governments employ (industry-propping subsidies, rent control, protective tariffs, etc.), and then by systematically illustrating how healthy economic organs should function -- and he does it all with cool, clear, completely un-tortured logic.  Of course, there is, as you've probably figured out, an obvious free market bias to this book . . . but that's because a free market economy is the only right economy!  Not to say that you shouldn't seek understanding of other systems, if only to become more well-acquainted with economic fallacies.
159102594X|4.0|The Blade Itself is the first book of Joe Abercrombie's First Law Trilogy.  This is a gritty and violent fantasy novel set in a fairly realistic universe.    Story:  A Fantasy World is at War.  Rival nations are torn apart by bloody battles against their enemies and from political struggles within.  This book builds a gritty world and establishes the main characters:  A very practical Barbarian, A Mage with a hidden agenda, A psychotic Ranger with a bit of demonic blood, A chatty Explorer, A pompous Soldier, and a very grim Inquisitor who is on par with Heath Ledger's Joker.  This book reads like a script written by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) or Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.)  It's dark, morbid, and insane.    Writing Style:  The story is told through well written scenes with very interesting characters, but there really isn't a strong plot holding this book together.  There's good dialogue, dark humor, action, interesting plot twists, and memorable characters, but it's missing an epic feel.      The World:  It's a medieval fantasy world where there is some magic, and purely human races.  There are a few mages who channel magic energy and supernatural beings that eat human flesh.  But, there are no dragons, elves, dwarves, hobbits...  There are barbarian tribes and raiders in the north, a desert empire in the south, and civilized kingdom stuck right in the middle.        Action:  The action scenes in this book are gory and very well written.  You feel every swing of the axe, bone jarring punch, or deadly blast of magic.  There are duels, ambushes, bloody skirmishes, and a few magic spells that turn people into bloody pulp.     Maturity Level:  This book is dark, has foul language, torture, violence, and gore.  It's definitely not for kids!    Overall:  Most of the scenes are fun to read, and the characters are great, but the lack of a solid plot prevents it from being a page turner.  This book basically sets up the other two books while creating some very unique and likeable characters.  It could be the grittiest fantasy novel ever written.    Pick it up if you want violent action, dark characters, politics, and grim humor.      Avoid it if you need an iron clad plot, lots of magic, dragons, fantasy races, or heroes that don't get drenched in blood after an axe fight.
1416955070|4.0|This book was something I picked up because I had a lot of free time. I liked it for the most part. There are some really cheesy parts in this book and the author's style is not amazing. She is not very grammatically correct. I loved that it was action packed. It went action to action with no fluff at all. It pulls in so many fantasy creatures and you can just get lost in the story. The story doesn't end until the end of the third book... so, if you want to know what happens get all 3. Also, if you are a religious person you may find it somewhat offensive in parts that you may or may not want to just overlook and enjoy the rest of the story.
1439138311|3.0|Spare, beautiful writing gives this novel three stars.  But the story itself is so lacking in depth, with unrealized characters. Eilis, the protaganist, offers so much potential for the author to plumb the history of the immigrant -- their myriad reasons for coming here, the struggles to make it, the ties to their home country.      Instead, life basically happens to this girl, with no real effort or participation of her own.  She doesn't desire to come to America but it's conveniently planned out for her (including a job and home for when she arrives), she doesn't fall in love but rather comes to accept the love of another.  I kept waiting for her to grow into and express her own intentions, to make her own decisions, but alas, even the ending is simply an acceptance of circumstances.     There were several tangential characters (sister Rose, the department store manager, the professor) who pique interest. I would have enjoyed learning more about them, and their stories could have elevated this passive, unfulfilling journey.
1594489505|5.0|I read this book after reading \\"The Kite Runner\\" and absolutely loved it.

B002EVDEXI|5.0|I feel this movie is just as good as the first two Underworld movies. The acting was very good, all the original characters were in it (except for Beckinsale), the story was good, and the visuals were good. Don't skip it, see this.

0375507256|5.0|An atlas guiding us through a journey of human's unsatisfying conquest that ultimately ends in destruction; the story is ambitious to frame a time span of over 500 years, and is brilliant in painting the pictures within it...<br /><br />As I read I become angry at the world Mitchell portrays because of how close it hits to home. From greed and murder, to adultery, to conspiracies of suicide, and suicide itself, to the current state of 21st century energy crisis, I want to intervene for their sake, but like clouds, I can only watch at an arms length, voiceless, and watch the inevitable self-destruction of Mitchell's civilization.<br /><br />Each story's characters have a sense of egotistical importance that we sometimes feel about our own life, and is quick to throw it to the side while capturing this exact feeling in the next story, leaving the previous one as just a stepping stone.  It's a humbling journey.<br /><br />\\"[Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies, an' tho' a cloud's shape nor hue nor size don't stay the same, it's still a cloud an' so is a soul.

B00005JPUN|4.0|One more invasion in the history of the cinema ? Banal. But this one is not  that banal because it really updates the fear. Not invaded by some kind of ugly green monster, please. Nor an egg laying alien. Let's be more modern and be invaded by something that is invisible and yet kind of ugly. Or rather gross, like some expectoration from a throat invaded by a serious infection. Gooey, gluey, inducing vomiting more than attraction. At the same time, beyond the bla bla about the DNA and its reprogramming when the subject is falling asleep, there is another myth: peace. To transform the most brutal and ferocious surviving animal species on earth and probably in the whole universe if not cosmos into a peaceful, peace loving and peace seeking bunch of automata. That's a dream for sure. Why not after all, to finally be able to love everyone and to forget and forgive all the evil the others have done to us, even if we have done to them maybe things that were worse. The peace you can only find during a funeral, provided no one has drunk himself or herself into a tantrum. That kind of future is frightening because you do not control yourself any more and also because there would be no fun in life any more, since fun is adventure, cops and robbers, wars, torturing chambers, dungeons, and a few dragons for fun on top of it all to crown the ice-cream with a nice cherry, you know the cherry you have forcefully taken from your neighbor yesterday night in the garden, though you just can't remember neither the sex, nor the age, nor the name or identity of that neighbor who just was there next to you when you had a sudden desire to eat a cherry and break it in. We can't really take that kind of fun away from all of us. Some of us need that fun, and I may say that maybe most of us need it. The film plays on that very well, till there is no escape what-so-ever, and there the film becomes a quick shortcut to a palatable end, after getting a glimpse of George W. Bush on TV. The poor woman and her son will manage to kill a few regenerated human beings who are no longer human, then she or they will kill a couple of dozens more ,and finally escape in a chopper that was handily flying by, and then on the following frame everything is back to normal, a vaccine has been found and the millions of weirdo sickly mutants have been brought back to normal. It is so nice to go back to school, to have pancakes that are not burnt, etc. The suspense is OK, the story is nothing phenomenal, Nicole Kidman wears and carries or even bears her name well, oscillating between the frenzy of a kid and the determination of an adult, but with a touch of French looking erratic psychosis. It is probably not worse than the old \\"Body snatchers\\" and the more recent remake of \\"The War of the Worlds\\". Just entertaining, though not that much inspiring.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDan and her son will manage to kill a few regenerated human beings who are no longer human, then she or they will kill a couple of dozens more ,and finally escape in a chopper that was handily flying by, and then on the following frame everything is back to normal, a vaccine has been found and the millions of weirdo sickly mutants have been brought back to normal.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|A haunting, majestic tale told by intricately decorated and adorned actors with atheletic builds tastefully showcased in form fitting attire. These men and women take on the roles of some of the most lasting and wonderful characters ever to be introduced into the realms of film or stage. Such delightfully memorable cats such as Mr. Mistoffelees, Munkustrap, Macavity, Jellylorum and of course, the Rum Tum Tigger will remain with you for the rest of your days, prancing about in your head!!    But that is not all that this intriguing tale has to offer! The sweeping, heart-wrenching songs will have you crying out with joy and weeping with terrible sorrow. They are timeless classics that you will listen to time and time again!!   The dancing is the other main attraction that will have you gaping with wonder at the fantastical feats that these able bodied characters are capable of! There are playful leaps and joyous bounds, tragically sad interpretive dances, and seductive gyrations. The Rum Tum Tigger dance will leave you breathless, but keep in mind that it is definetly not intended for children.     There are countless reasons to watch this epic tale of redemption and rebirth. It is hard to even absorb the whole perfection of it on first veiwing, and multiple showings will undoubtedly occur within your home.

B001DF68MA|2.0|We liked the idea of our child sitting in the front, so we read the bike specs and bought the Wee Ride.  But what the description should say is not for ANY mountain bike.  Because of the handle bar location, it is impossible (unless you have a really, really, really small child) for the child to ride in this seat and sit up and look up at the same time.  This product seems to be good for a regular bike, but not a mountain bike or road bike.  We just feel extremely frustrated, diappointed, misled and out shipping money.
0374531269|5.0|Before I started reading this book I didn't like reading because I used to think that it was boring but, I had to read this book because it was required for my class.  I remember that after I read the first chapter I didn't want to put the book down because Ishmael made this book interesting and it wasn't boring.  I thought that it was actually funny that a boy from Africa would listen to rap he loved to listen to rap.  But I think that he did a good job by telling us his story about life and the soldier boys.  I think that his childhood was really hard and also tormenting to see so many people die.  And Ishmael and his friends just trying to survive and not get caught to become a soldier boy.  Its sad that all those things happened in Africa and that some many kids got involved in becoming soldier boys and that they were so young.  But at that young age they were tough to use a gun and kill people like if it was nothing.  And I understand how Ishmael now that he is older still a little tormented by all those things that he lived with.  But at the same time he was lucky that he was able to come to the U.S. and get adopted by someone from the U.S. and was able to go to College and write his life story. I would suggest this book to anyone to read!!!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Playing for change is a powerful CD full of great music that might never have reached the public without the brilliant idea of one person stopping to listen to a street musician and imagining music brought from around the world in an effort to inspire change.  I listen to this on days when I need a lift, a reminder that change is possible.  Excellent music.
B000XA5K48|3.0|\\"Shot them up\\" is a smart parody, a funny evasion movie that must be seen only under these circumstances. The laughable plot simply is an artifice that works as huge back up for (How would we say?) the imaginative, amusing and certainly original sequences, car chases, aerial maneuvers and bizarre devices to face a devilish criminal web of conflicts and interests between a Senator and a bunch of ruthless gangsters. Clive Owen embodies the accurate blend of three well known personages of action since the seventies until the nineties: James Bond, Rambo and the officer Mac Lane, spiced with a touch of \\"Sin city.\\"<br /><br />At last instance , the movie seems to extracted from a script from Cohen brothers Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez, , due the rampant audacious and the febrile kinetic energy displayed all the way through.<br /><br />Violence and black humor in great doses, but besides, maternal love around a baby who seems to be quiet with the rock music works out as a mesmerizing feast for all those who seek to mesmerize themselves around the special effects universe.<br /><br />But please; don't try to find out a minimal sense in this surrealistic movie. It's just another way to escape from the quotidian reality in which we are immersed and nothing, nothing else.

B000E6ET1G|4.0|I used to have some of the \\"Nuggets\\" collections a long time ago, but over time I got rid of them because I didn't listen to them too much anymore.  Then I happened to be somewhere that had the radio on to a station that played \\"Liar Liar\\" by the Castaways, & right afterward, \\"Ain't Got Nothin' Yet\\" by the Blues Magoos, and suddenly I had to have these songs again.  Besides those two, the standout tracks, to me, are also \\"Lies\\" by the Knickerbockers, \\"7 and 7 Is\\" by Love, and \\"Incense & Peppermints\\" by the Strawberry Alarm Clock.  This is not to say that the tracks by the Seeds, Standells, or 13th Floor Elevators are bad but I happen to own those on CD's by those bands, the standout stuff here is the \\"one hit wonder\\" sort of stuff.   Then, there's \\"Louie Louie\\", which I could live safely for the rest of my life without ever hearing again, and \\"Wooly Bully\\", by Sam The Sham & the Pharoahs, which doesn't exactly fit this collection, in my mind, but hey, what do I know.   The biggest reason to own any of these \\"Nuggets\\" CD's is songs by bands that you're never likely to find a full-length album by.  4 out of 5.
B001TODOCM|4.0|The action begins when the main character, Lucas Corso, a literary mercenary, helps his only friend, Flavio Lapont, by authenticating a manuscript written by Dumas himself. This task becomes complicated by the fact that he is simultaneously hired by a client to determine whether or not the book `The Nine Doors of the Kingdom of Shadows\\" is a forgery.  With this Corso's life is thrust into a mystery as the Dumas manuscript, \\"The Three Musketeers,\\" and the satanic significance of \\"The Nine Doors\\" merge. Beyond that, there are plenty of good reviews of this book available, so I won't waste your time with too many details, I simply wanted to offer a word of advice: the book is heavy handed in its inferences and references to the work of Dumas, so if you want a more satisfying read you might want to bone up on \\"The Three Musketeers\\" then sit back and enjoy the interesting mix of history and fantasy, with a touch of the devil, and a peek into the literary world and its quirky antiquarian book dealers.

0316017922|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell has become famous for his ability to take something that people assume is true and recast the facts in a different light. Often, this results in looking at the world in new and different ways. Gladwell doesn't disappoint, and, this newest installment is, to me, his most intriguing. He grapples with baffling phenomena, like why some people in certain pockets of our country outlive everyone else, even in surrounding areas, while eating whatever they want and living what is considered an unhealthy lifestyle. Or the REAL reason Asians do better than everyone else in math and on standardized tests. Or, my favorite, why some people experience unprecedented success in business though clearly handicapped by race, upbringing, or other important factors. Buy the Outliers, and read it for a truly awakening experience. Gladwell is still a master at shifting paradigms.
B0029NY9YO|1.0|This movie looked amazing from the trailers but turned out to be unbearable! It was just plain boring. I was actually angry at how bad this movie was. Even the actors seemed bored with this material. The dialogue in this movie will put you to sleep. This movie should have been much shorter. There are these scenes that run on and on forever! Like this one scene where Dr. Manhattan is on Mars and you basically just hear him yapping about nothing for 20 minutes. I no this is a dark comic. I was not expecting the X-men. However, i was expecting to be a little bit entertained.
0060005696|4.0|The Author, Barry Schwartz, divides up the choices we make into 8 sections:<br />1- Deciding and Choosing<br />2- When only the best will do<br />3-Choice and happiness<br />4- Missed Opportunities<br />5- If Only...? The Problem with Regret<br />6- Why Decisions Disappoint: The Problem of Adaptation<br />7- Why Everything Suffers from Comparison<br />8- Whose Fault is it? Choice, Disappointment, and Depression<br /><br />The first area was good, deciding and choosing; it analyzed how and why one chooses one thing over another. It summarized it well.<br /><br />The second, third and fourth area delve much deeper into why people aren't satisfied, how being a perfectionist (my word) can be detrimental in your choices and how the pursuit to have the best aren't always the best goals. Personally I found this area kind of dry, just because there was little I could relate to. I think I'm a pretty satisfied person, just recently, my mom wanted to know what I wanted for my birthday coming up. I have finally learned that if I don't write little things down throughout the year, I won't have much to suggest, if anything.<br /><br />The sections about regret and disappointment were also interesting to skim through but again, I didn't find it much different than most other psychology books, some was common sense, and other parts were rehashing things that have been already been written about. The sections on comparison and the impact of bad decisions was the most analytical, and to me the most boring.<br /><br />All in all I was expecting a more cultural view from both the title and the praises of the book, but found something much different than my expectations once I cracked opened the book. It started out well, but I lost interest in it easily. However, if psychology or analytical books are of interest to you, this might be your cup of tea.<br /><br />I'm a pretty simple person in thought, and reading books that analyze things without a context, either personal or cultural, just leaves me wanting for something better to do.<br /><br />Dawn C.<br />[...]ust leaves me wanting for something better to do.<br /><br />Dawn C.<br />[...]

0385340990|5.0|I have heard about this book from everyone it seems and it has come highly recommended from all. For good reason I should add. Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows did a tremendous job in co-authoring this novel.<br /><br />This book is comprised exclusively of letters, which begin in 1946.  Thirty something author Juliet Ashton has been writing a column under a pseudonymn and has been feeling apathetic about her success, which has been tremendous, when she receives a letter from one of the founding members (Dawsey Adams) of a literary society in Guernsey, an island in the English Channel that was occupied by Nazi forces during World War II. Juliet sees this as a way to break out of her coverage of the sunny side of a really awful war and jumps on the opportunity to break out of her previously sunny coverage of the War. As a result, Juliet begins corresponding with Dawsey and other members of the literary society as a means to research her next project.  During these letter writing campaigns, she comes to know and love the writers and the island of Guernsey and admires how the islanders used literature and reading to bond and forget the stresses and troubles of occupation, even though it was only for a few hours.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was utterly charming and I finished it wanting to go to Guernsey to see what the fuss was all about! The authors did a masterful job in writing the letters in the voices of different characters and weaving them together to tell an amazing story of perserverance and survival, while never losing the voices of the characters describing the events. It was absolutely astounding to read and to partake in.  I found myself growing fond of the characters as I got through the book (with a few exceptions of course, but to explain more would be to give away plotlines that are best discovered by the reader!!). This book is deceptively easy to read.  You'll be tempted to fly through it unless you remind yourself to slow down and savor it.  But don't be deceived because it covers some pretty somber material - occupation by the Nazis and concentration camps and sending island children away to be spared the occupation are no easy subjects to write about, let alone read about and they come up often enough in this novel. The writing flowed very well, even though the letters were usually no longer then a few pages.  It didn't feel jerky at all and the plot seemed to move along well.  The characters were wonderful and developed very well.  Each seemed to have revelations that were reasonable for them given their personalities and their circumstances. It is also obvious that the authors have a tremendous love of people, history and literature. That love was conveyed in this novel.  I would highly recommend this hopeful, beautiful and memorable novel to anyone and everyone.  It's one that you will remember, love and cherish throughout your entire life.But don't be deceived because it covers some pretty somber material - occupation by the Nazis and concentration camps and sending island children away to be spared the occupation are no easy subjects to write about, let alone read about and they come up often enough in this novel.

0711225176|5.0|I purchased this book for my husband who is an admirer of Alfonzo Mucha's work.     The book is loaded with works created by the artist and also incorporates a biography. It is a great looking hard cover and a more personal touch that a family member put the piece together.     If you liked the turn of the 20th century fashion and the styles of females captured in the wake of liberation often depicted in Art Nouveau style, Mucha's florals and scroll-work might appeal to you. Mucha is definitely one of those artists that stands alone and this book with its colourful replications are a welcome addition.
B0029358GM|2.0|I've not ever been a big fan, Jay Farrar made Tweedy work harder at a song and that's why Uncle Tupelo still holds up better than Wilco albums (And I would suspect next week when Son Volt comes out with their album it will be a great set of alt-country songs...) But...<br /><br />Wilco (the song) comes across comically like Tweedy represented as some musical Plastic Jesus up in front of his adoring followers.  And next week I would suspect there won't be any little diddy with Feist on a Son Volt album.<br /><br />All and all, the redeeming introspection and seriously attempted song structures of their previous album, Sky Blue Sky, are missing on this one and slips back into what inevitably leaves me cold in Jeff Tweedy's song writing-Cleverness. (Which is always a substitute for substance in any art form)<br /><br />Sadly he will say this is a tribute album to his fans-which unto itself is a patronizing stance. (Come on, think about it)<br /><br />Someday he just might create an album as great as his fans and himself think he is now. (I doubt it though)

B00204AA0O|5.0|This is a great mix of the more pop-oriented Regina Spektor--who came to the fore on her last album, Begin To Hope--and the anti-folk troubadour she began as, in dinky New York City bars \\"way,\\" back when.    On songs like, The Calculation, Folding Chair, Two Birds and Dance Anthem of the 80s, you have the now familiar happy, sing-song type of sounds, which Miss Regina is so good at doing.    While at the same time, on songs like, Genius Next Door, Human of the Year, Man Of A Thousand Faces and Blue Lips . . . we hear the surrealistic, literary mini-epics, which she was so well known for in her earlier days and on her first two albums.     It's no surprise that some of these songs were written even before the Soviet Kitsch album.    Human of the Year is the vocal high point for me, Miss Regina's voice soars throughout--while, Man Of A Thousand Faces, the album's coda, may be the most powerful musical moment.    Mix in the french horn/choral arrangement on, Eet, the contemplative ballad, Laughing With, the Eastern European techno funk of, Machine, the classical arrangements of, The Wallet, the march band, tuba, bass-drum thumpings of, Two Birds, the human beat-box on, Dance Anthem   . . . and you have quite the eclectic collection of songs and sounds.    This album almost feels like Regina Spektor's version of(or, I should say attempt at), The Beatles' White Album. No, it's nowhere near that good, but still quite the impressive effort.
1567184855|5.0|Dr. Michael Newton, in The Journey of Souls, provides a fascinating and complete worldview, presented with a remarkable level of objectivity and supporting data.<br /><br />Michael Newton is a former atheist, who used hypnotic regression therapy in his Psychological counseling practice to help patients recall the sources of trauma. Some, when asked to recall the source, would relate past life experiences. A very few were able to relate events from between lives. Newton has compiled the messages so related, and found they provide a self-consistent worldview.<br /><br />He is admirably careful in the book. Rather than relating HIS interpretations, about 90% of the worldview he describes comes directly from the transcripts of what his subjects related while under hypnosis. He quotes from 29 different sessions in the book. While hypnosis is a process notorious for the suggestibility of its subjects, and Newton does ask a few leading questions, the transcripts actually include many more instances of his challenging the worldview than leading it on, and rather than accept his challenges as valid, the subjects argue and try to refute them. So while hypnosis IS a weak research tool, and cannot be pursued without both interviewer and subject bias, I considered his method to be as objective as the media allowed, and to fairly well answer the objections that any skeptics might have about the material. Without a leading interviewer, and with material from dozens of subjects converging, I consider this is a very credible source of evidence about the universe.<br /><br />(As an aside, I actually consider it TOO objective and evidential. Dr. Newton in many of these interviews was putting his own desire for information above the therapeutic needs of his clients.)<br /><br />What Newton describes in these transcripts is a process of continual learning. Souls are created in the spirit world in an insensitive state, with little ability to connect with others through caring and love. They enter lives in order to learn maturation lessons, and these lessons are learned in environments of adversity. In many lives people fail to learn their lessons and must repeat similar circumstances. Karma is often referred to as valid, but there is no formal law of Karma. Instead, abusing others in past lives is a sign of a maturation failing, not of a debt to be repaid, and it is often useful to suffer similar abuse in order to overcome the failing. Sometimes suffering at the hands of those who were previously abused is the most effective way to mature.<br /><br />Between lives, souls study their decisions form past lives, and how to make better decisions in future lives. They do this under the guidance of more advanced human souls, who are always described as very wise.<br /><br />These advanced souls plan out lives for the subjects, in mutual consultation with the other major participants in that life. Lives are planned out with way-points for major events, and backup waypoints should the souls miss the primary ones. Free will exists, despite this highly scripted future, and it is possible to live a life completely different from plan. This, however, is experienced at the time and seen in retrospect as a wasted and pointless life.<br /><br />Other bits revealed about the universe: There are other planets where this same process takes place, but little cross-experiencing between planets. Similarly, humans can live as animals, but this is done very rarely - the human brain seems to provide a necessary level of complexity for soul evolution (animals also have souls, but they are not really discussed). Human past-lives are reported back only to 200,000 yrs ago (there are earlier lives reported, on earth, in cities, but these are not modern humans, and are not consistent with either paleontology or archaeology - so he is apparently getting Atlantis lives for a previous human species). Souls can live several lives concurrently, but generally do not. Some bits of a soul are always present in the spirit world. Some of the more advances souls practice manipulating the physical - and some report modifying plant and simple animal genetics, while others report creating toy-sized star systems. The strong implication is that advanced souls who matured on another world genetically modified homo-erectus in order to create modern humans. The ultimate purpose of this maturation process is to re-merge with the omnipotent Source.<br /><br />Newton recognizes some of the theological flaws in this worldview (as some of them are probed by his questions in the transcripts). Since souls are created from a near-perfect and near-omnipotent Source, it makes little sense for them to start out so imperfect. Why start out imperfect and only slowly approach perfection when perfection was already at hand?<br /><br />Also, humans are capable of learning a great deal very rapidly. We have mastered the process of educating ourselves well, and it requires:<br /><br />- Knowing to goal of what one is to learn<br /><br />- Having lessons broken down into small, manageable steps<br /><br />- Examples provided, then practice by the learner<br /><br />- Immediate feedback on what was successful/unsuccessful, and why<br /><br />The excruciatingly slow process of soul maturation Newton describes (even the most advanced souls interviewed are far from mature, and have lived hundreds of lives) is traceable to violating every one of the learning principles above. The mindwipe of all past memories includes a wipe of the purpose of a life. Life lessons are in massive steps. The example/practice process is described between lives, but abandoned once one is actually in a life/learning environment. And while guides are claimed to be with us always, their &quot;feedback&quot; is either not perceived or remarkably ineffective. So if our purpose in this universe is emotional/moral maturation, the &quot;wise souls&quot; and the Source in Newton's worldview seem to be remarkably clueless and inefficient in running it.<br /><br />There are numerous other examples in his book of apparently unwise/ineffective/clueless behavior from the spirit guides. Some of these highlight the problem his worldview has with mindwipes. If mindwipes are supposed to be good for us (so claimed in the book), why does partially reversing them, as Newton does in his practice, seem to benefit his clients? And if they don't, why aren't all such memories blocked (he says most are)? If targeted partial reversals are good for us, why don't the guides provide such partial reversals for all of us? Neither Newton nor his subjects answer these questions.<br /><br />One typical example provides further problems. A patient suffered untreatable pain in her thighs, and regression revealed a life where a childhood carriage accident left both thighs crippled for life, and regression provided a complete cure. Strangely, the patient actually saw the life positively, as the crippling lead to an introspective life of caring and being cared for, so the present life disability was not due to any conscious spiritual trauma. This just multiplies the problems for Newton's worldview. Why would a trauma-free injury cause an &quot;unconscious&quot; spiritual disability? How could the extensive counseling by numerous &quot;wise&quot; guides leave this spiritual trauma unresolved, while Newton was able to cure it immediately without effort? And why did the guides block all other memories of that life, but let the feeling of disability slip through the block? This example makes the spirit guides look like bumbling incompetents.<br /><br />Another example is similarly disturbing to the claims of wisdom by the guides. A subject was counseled into a life as a giant Viking warrior who never fell ill, and the subject's goal in life was to revel in the perfection of his physical strength. The Viking used this physical perfection to live a life of murder, abuse, and plunder, with no compunction shownby the soul or guides. However, with other clients, we see them spend many lives struggling to overcome their inclinations to abuse, and their anger/emotional injury over having suffered abuse in past lives. The guides have counseled the CREATION of the abusive behavior which causes all the psychological problems which are the subject of hundreds of subsequent life lessons.<br /><br />Newton discusses this point obliquely in a discussion of the Problem of Evil. He notes that his worldview solves this challenge for monotheism since evil in the world has a long-term good. But he also admits the Oversoul of the universe described in his material is morally imperfect, since it uses pain, anguish, and psychological harm integrally in the maturation process for souls.<br /><br />Abandoning Benevolence is one way out for monotheisms from the Problem of Evil, so Newton's worldview does pass this test. Although I think his Oversoul can be described more strongly than &quot;imperfect&quot;. The immaturity at creation, the inefficient &quot;teaching&quot; process, and the deliberately introduced setbacks are not credibly the result of &quot;imperfection&quot; in an omnipotent being, but are much more credibly seen as deliberate choices to draw out the process of soul maturation for as long as possible. The reason for this is never given, even to Newton's most advanced souls, so it can reasonably be inferred it is a reason which not in the best interest of souls. A deity which puts souls through trauma for its own welfare, can at best be described as morally neutral, rather than &quot;imperfect&quot;. This concession resolves the &quot;incompetence&quot; problems highlighted earlier, but makes Newton's model much less attractive than he implies.<br /><br />Newton's model deals less successfully with some of the other tests theist metaphysics must pass. If there is only one spiritual reality, and only one spiritual force in the universe, and only one set of coordinated guides (plus a smattering of unerased memories of this reality), then all spiritual messages over the last 200,000 years should be basically congruent. But they are not. The jealousy/arbitrariness of the Abrahamic God, the fickle European Pantheons, the bloody Gods of the Aztec/Maya, the ritual-focus of the Zoroastrians and Hindus, the practical-world focus of Confucism, and the efforts of Sikh and Buddhists to escape rebirth, all reflect VERY different assumptions about spiritual realities. He has not way to explain the failure of the convergence test.<br /><br />Also according to Newton's model, channeling of spirit guides should provide basically the same information that his regression techniques provide. But even within the modern North American New Age movement this is not so. The bizarre Seth universe, in which with every act of imagination we spawn a new reality in which the imagined event occurs, the self-aggrandizing &quot;guides&quot; who related Joe Fisher's version of Life Between Life, and the multiple varieties of spiritual realms and fauna of Ben Swett's guided revelations are each dramatically at odds with Newton on many major issues.<br /><br />Even other users of past life regression techniques end up with different results than Newton, which brings the accuracy of what he reports into question. Edith Fiore, William Baldwin, and Louise Ireland-Frey all have found ghosts, attachments, and evil entities to be significant features of our spiritual universe, in contradiction to Newton., who declares they are not. Again, his model provides no explanation for the variant results.<br /><br />From my own spiritual background, I question two of Newton's unstated assumptions:<br /><br />That if a subject relates a past life memory, it is THAT SUBJECT's past life memory<br /><br />That the between-life memories and guide's messages related by many subjects must necessarily reflect the experiences and observations of many souls<br />For 1, the presence of spiritual attachments can potentially lead to memories or fantasies of attached souls being mistaken for the subject's memories. For 2, a possessing entity or set of entities residing in Newton's office could explain the consistency between the experiences related. There two points are not exhaustive of the alternatives Newton has not considered.<br /><br />Like Newton, I have found that we live many lives, suffer mindwipes, advance slowly, have human soul guides, and have scripted lives with free will. Unlike Newton, I have found that mindwipe is an effect of the evil opposition (not a poorly rationalized benefit), that we screw up in life due to demonic influence countering the Godly influence of our guides (not because God wishes to create adversity), and that &quot;spiritual insights&quot; one gets from &quot;guides&quot; or &quot;past lives&quot; are not always trustworthy. The only way to trust these messages is to apply a moral test to them - is the message and methodology always higher and better than what I can come up with on my own? If not - well - find some other Guide to listen to.<br /><br />In my judgment, Newton's messages, and the spirit world he has tapped in to, seem to be more positive than not, but are not fully Godly. The worldview seems to be an effort by the residents of one of the lesser realms of Ben Swett's moral spectrum to rationalize their experiences, when for some reason they cannot see the actions of the Dark forces, and have not embraced the loving-kindness that lets them gain the benefit of the Light. Newton is on the right track when he questions the moral imperfections he sees in the Source, but he does not have a methodology which allows him to tune to a higher spiritual Truth.
0307460444|3.0|I am not usually a big fan of Martha Stewart, but I am a big fan of cupcakes. A few friends had bought this book and said it was worth it. It's just OK. The pics are beautiful. A friend of mine has made 3 recipes so far and thrown out all three. She said they were terrible. I am now afraid to waste ingredients on making any of the cupcakes. My friend is a long time experienced baker too. She did say that the frosting recipes and techniques make the book worth it but not the recipes that she made.  Also just because you make something in a muffin/cupcake tin with a wrapper doesn't make it a cupcake. Blueberry and cornbread is a muffin NOT a cupcake. SO I think that she should have had a chapter dedicated to the recipes that were treats made in the pans but weren't exactly cupcakes but more like muffins a muffin chapter. And not call them cupcakes. There is a difference between a cupcake and a muffin and it's not just the frosting.

0307269981|5.0|There's not much I can add to the wave of positive reader reviews for this, the second Blomkvist/Salander mystery (originally published in Europe in 2006), except to say that it more than lives up to the brilliance of its predecessor, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  Swedish author Stieg Larsson (who died prematurely five years ago) once again proves that he was a master at both plot and characterization.  The story, which picks up where \\"Tattoo\\" left off, is smart, compelling and full of surprises, much like its titular heroine, the remarkable Lisbeth Salander.  Salander is without question the most original, fully rounded female character to grace a mystery series since Clarice Starling; for brains, balls and beauty (OK, so maybe not the latter), she's practically peerless.  So, too, is Larsson's instinct for suspenseful storytelling.  How genuinely sad that a writer of his gifts never got to see his novels published; how lucky for worldwide mystery fans that he wrote them in the first place.  Personally, I'm so impatient for the American release of the third and last book, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" (in 2010?) that I may purchase it from amazon.co.uk when it comes out in England this October.  Even though I don't have Salander's millions - you'll have to read the books to see how she pulled that off - it would be worth the overseas shipping costs.

And, of course, Mr. Clayton who is one of the greatest composers as well as bass players. No, this DVD is more than a performance. It is a tribute to great jazz players. Maybe the Oscar Peterson Munich concert equals it in importance... Buy this and you will be playing it 10 years from now
B000Y5JFN4|2.0|No surprise Marti DeBergi wasn't able to get a job after this. He could teach Michael Moore a thing or two about selective editing, turning one of England's most influential rock bands into a troupe of inept buffoons. DeBergi clearly knows nothing about music, and its sad watching him struggle to understand Nigel's technical explanantion of his (then) cutting edge amps. The only reason to recommend this is for the music, which even DeBergi's editors couldn't ruin. Its a shame that this turd has so badly tarnished Tap's reputation, and even caused now-defunct Megaphone records to keep their brilliant catalog out of print.
B00026ZG10|4.0|This was one of the funniest movies. It probably helps that I like Arnold. I think the story line was great although it may have gotten a bit cheesy towards the end. Still very worth watching.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This album is hard to criticize. It sounds droning, yet edgy; slow, yet catchy. The album is not the typical Radiohead at all, but it's a little gem. It's true that Amnesiac and Kid A were recorded at the same time, but they are from two distinctly different worlds.
B001TKKAJG|3.0|I guess that I am in the middle of these 2 guys, I don't think that it is a horrible recording, but there is nothing really earth shattering about it in it's presentation, I know these songs well, if my memory serves me well, as the disc gets further along ,The quality seems to pick up a bit.Definitely not worth 30 bucks and I hate the digipak packaging,ok for CDs, but not for hi end stuff. I'm going to hold onto it. There is some mild clipping occsionally, Think the person tried to go over the top, but it did not work
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Thriller is undoubtedly the best album of all time.  Michael Jackson proved himself as the best individual performer to ever grace pop culture and his title of \\"King of Pop\\" was well deserved.  If you have never heard this album or you don't even own it, what are you waiting for?  If there is one album you must own from ANY artist it is Michael Jackson's Thriller!<br /><br />From the haunting Vincent Price narration of Thriller, the Van Halen guitar riff of Beat It, and the smooth, rhythmic beat of Billie Jean, Thriller is an album that can appeal to all music lovers!  the entire album has aged like fine wine, only getting better over the years and is a true gift to the world.<br /><br />I highly recommend the 25th anniversary edition for the remastered versions of the original songs.  I ignore the new versions where Michael is with some of today's artists, but some young folk may find that interesting, but as far as I'm concerned if you don't instantly fall in love with those original, classic songs from the King of Pop than there is something seriously wrong with you!
B001E40IIU|5.0|There are many great Amazon reviews about the printed book (see below), so I won't repeat them.  My review just points out that listening to the content as opposed to reading it, can make it easier to visualize and remember what you've heard.  The real test of this book is how sticky its teachings are, and I hope these ideas stick with me a long time, because they are concise, pure, and right on.    I returned this to the library already, but I think it had 7 disks = about 8 hours of listening, which was great for a road trip to LA and back.  Wonderful narration.    For a nice review of the content, see:  http://www.amazon.com/review/RYOKBDKMXDONC/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm
0385751060|5.0|Bruno is a 9-year-old boy, living a privileged and a protected life in Berlin during WWII. His dad is a Nazi commandant in the process of being transferred to Auschwitz.  The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a \\"young adult\\" book told in the form of a fable. A friend of mine in London recommended it to me. Before I started reading it, I had heard nothing about it. The jacket offers no explanation. (Since the book came out in 2006, many people have heard of it, though. It is now being used in English classes and school reading clubs.  It has also been made into a \\"major motion picture.\\") From the window of his new bedroom, Bruno can see the fence that surrounds the camp. There are no kids to play with on his side of the fence, so Bruno (wide-eyed innocent that he is), makes friends with Shmuel, a boy who shares Bruno's birthdate but not his religion. Their friendship is forged in conversations that occur almost entirely through the fence itself. Because of its fable-like telling, the story requires the reader to suspend disbelief as Bruno observes but doesn't quite understand the atrocities going on around him. While these atrocities are merely hinted at, the book builds toward a powerful ending designed to inspire discussion -- and further reading.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Remember how great things were before we got stuck with this really urgent, no-time-to-think-about-it trillion-dollar bailout of the financial system? I'm talking about 2007 -- the good old days, when credit was cheap, housing prices were going through the roof, all those hotshot bankers were buying up all that great real estate in Greenwich? Sure, there was a war on. But if we all kept shopping, our President told us everything would be fine. The free market would take care of everything. Sure, there were 47 million Americans without healthcare. But that was a massive, unthinkably huge, untouchable $100 billion problem. We may have been rich back then, but we weren't made of money. We had to keep our priorities straight! Compassion was best left to the Canadians, eh? Socialism? Keep it in Cuba. Those poor, uninsured folks would just have to work harder and try not to get sick. We were too busy flipping condos -- it was the quickest way to fulfill the American Dream. Apart from the war, the healthcare crisis, a little torture, some wiretapping, a tsunami, all that genocide over in Darfur, Hurricane Katrina, that bridge they wanted to build in Alaska, and all those people harping on about global warming, times were great. John McCain and Phil Gramm had shown real leadership in helping us deregulate the financial markets. Al Gore and Michael Moore could make all the sick, inconvenient movies they wanted to. This was America -- land of free markets and free speech. But forget the speech part.  Just listen to the market. What could possibly go wrong? With the right investment advice, we could make money forever!
B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA is truly the Genius of the Clan, my all time favorite from the group. The GZA is the most sophisticaed and complex clan member of the group, he is the top 3 lyricst of the group (GZA, Inspectah Deck, Masta Killa). Liquid Swords is a \\"Classic\\" album that creates an atmosphere which not a lot of albums can do. This is one of RZA's best productions on a whole album, right next to \\"Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...\\" this album is one that will give you shivers while you are listening, its almost like a motion picture for your ears (if you have a good imagination).<br /><br />I Admit that this album took me a while to love. Honestly this is not an album you will appreciate until you listen to it at least 2 or 3 time fully. While this is a classic album , there is no mainstream appeal whatsoever (which is a VERY GOOD THING). I love that this album is considered a mainstream album but at the same time it could pass as an underground album. GZA's lyrics take time to fully understand, I would recommend looking up the lyrics while your listening so you can fully understand what the hell GZA is talking about. I have listen to the album at least 9 or 10 times and I've listened to the whole album, not just single songs. This album is a top 10 of all time for me. FOr all you mainstream lovers that adore Lil Wayne and the likes of him, look somewhere else because this album is too intellectual for people to comprehend and you won't enjoy it. As for the REAL Hip Hop listeners such as myself, its worth every penny, you will not get dissapointed.<br /><br />Top 5 Tracks<br />-------------------------------------------<br />1) Duel of the Iron Mic<br />2) Cold World<br />3) Hell's Wind Staff / Killah Hills 10304<br />4) Gold<br />5) Liquid Swords

1423107233|5.0|[[VIDEOID:36119921]]The Archive Series: Story is a huge and thick hardcover book. Although the title has the word \\"story\\" in it, readers looking for the Disney storytelling process will be sorely disappointed. John Lasseter's foreword is pretty much all the text in the book.<br /><br />This book is about storyboards.<br /><br />Over hundreds of storyboard panels are included in the book, for movies and shorter episodes. Some of the titles include The Three Little Pigs, Snow White (1937), Dumbo (1941), Alice in Wonderland (1951), The Jungle Book (1967), Beauty and the Beast(1991) and a whole lot more, including lesser known ones. The latest one is the 2002 Lilo & Stitch. This book is an archive of storyboards created for traditional animation.<br /><br />There are about 1 to 6 storyboards on each page. There are no captions although a few of them have scene descriptions and scribbles. This archive picks random storyboard sequences from each animation. Unfortunately, most of the storyboard sequences are not complete. Many times I have followed through interesting sequences only to be cut off with a new title on the next page. It's really a minor quibble given the hundreds of thousands of storyboards to choose for the book.<br /><br />This whole book is an example of masterful application of storyboard techniques, like cutting scenes, composing, moving the (camera) view and stuff like that. But you must already know some basics to see them -- this is not an instructional book. There are also plenty of styles of art to look at. It's valuable resource for anyone into storyboards.<br /><br />This is a highly quality book that's pretty much worth the money, but a more appropriate title would be \\"The Archive Series: Storyboards\\".<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I have watched episodes 1-10 at this time.  I enjoyed them very much.  I would say that they are an R rating for the sex and the blood.  The movies follow the first book (Dead until Dark) in the Sookie Stakehouse series by Charlaine Harris very well.
1594565201|4.0|First published in 1920 (though written a few years earlier), \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" isn't just Agatha Christie's first detective novel, but the book that introduced the world to Hercule Poirot. The result of a bet in which Christie vowed to write a mystery in which the reader would be presented with the same clues as the detective, \\"Styles\\" was to be the first in a long line of detective novels (about eighty) that spanned several decades, and kick-started Christie's reputation as the Queen of Crime. Though not Christie's best, and not necessarily the novel for a newcomer to start with, \\"Styles\\" is classic Christie. Narrated in first-person by Hastings (acting as a reader-proxy), the story includes what would become the staple ingredients of mystery: a country manor, an upper-class family, an exchange of wills, an array of suspects, red herrings, and the final twist in the tale.<br /><br />Captain Arthur Hasting is staying with his old school-friend John Cavendish and his extended family during the war. Mrs Inglethorp is the family matriarch, a somewhat domineering figure who controls the family fortune and the lives of those who live in the house. However, tragedy strikes when she dies in suspicious circumstances, and Hasting suggests bringing in a retired Belgian detective that he knows is lodging nearby in a refugee house. Hercule Poirot enters the scene, and at once takes control.<br /><br />Poirot is facetious, methodical and secretive, driving Hastings to despair many a time (it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship) as he carefully investigates the household and the strange circumstances that surround Mrs Inglethorp's death. Christie's love/hate relationship with her most famous detective is captured clearly in Hasting's voice: at the same time he's admiring of the little man, he can't help but be frustrated at his infuriating mannerisms and arrogance.<br /><br />Christie's prose is not as sophisticated as it would become in later books, being instead quite blunt and straightforward, but her gift at foreshadowing and hidden agendas is as strong here as it is in later years. Having read many of her later books, I was expecting to be able to figure out the culprit in what I assumed would be a \\"less polished\\" story. I didn't. \\"Styles\\" is just as ingenious as those that follow it.nd straightforward, but her gift at foreshadowing and hidden agendas is as strong here as it is in later years.

1596680296|5.0|Everyone who knits socks has a favorite knitting pattern and a favorite sock book.  This is my absolute favorite book for knitting socks.  The patterns are diverse and easy to read.  The sizes run the gamut from infants to large men.  The illustrations are clear and easy to follow and the patterns are for the beginning sock knitter to the more advanced.<br /><br />When I purchase a knitting book I ask myself three questions:<br /><br />1) Are there patterns in this book that I will want to knit?<br /><br />2) Are the patterns clearly written?<br /><br />3) Will the book be a good resource?<br /><br />The answer to all three questions is a resounding 'YES'.  The book is published by Interweave Press, a very reputable knitting press that also publishes my favorite knitting magazine.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who already knits socks and anyone who wants to start knitting socks.
B0011NVC98|1.0|The hero's son is the dragon, he sleeps with grendels mother who is supposed to be a hideous cave troll but somehow is Angolina Jolee.    I just wish Professor Tolkien was still around to tear into just what an abomination this whole hollyweird project is.    It is an outrage to great literature and a big middle finger to those who are Christians who loved the heroism of the original poem.    The strength of the original like tolkiens lord of the the rings is a pagan/christian synthesis.  This completely gets the material all wrong.    The monsters are supposed to be the offspring of Kane who slew his brother abel and commited the first spilling of blood and murder on this earth.   Also a Kinslaying which was even considered evil by the germanic tribes even though it happened all the time.    There is no way the dragon the leviathan of hell would be the hero's son unless it was because of his sin.    I wish the original poem as wonderfully translated by Seamus Heaney was made and adapted into a film.  It could have been as good as Lord of the Rings.  Instead We get this garbage.  And so far no movie based on beowulf has been true to the text even in the sprit of being an adaptation.  You cannot literally film a book but the film could have kept the nature of the poem and what the poet intended instead of some hack writer and directors hijacking his story to use as a war cry to the religious write whom hollywood hates.    This is an anti heroic piece and treats the material in a laughable manner.    If you don't believe dragons and heroes make the stuff of good tales why bother making a film on it?    This guy who stick to writing a screenplay based on his own comicbook the sandman and should stay away from destroying sacred literature of the western tradition.    The Only other film I know of which is so far removed from its source and is such a piece of garbage is troy, the iliad deserves better and so does beowulf.    This film does not even work as an action filmor as a piece of cgi fluff.  The cgi is incredibly bad and fake.  And the action and dialogue render this movie as nothing more than a cacophony of sound and little substance.  All noise and fury.   No Meaning, no power.    There is nothing of the power in this movie as the original rendered in the old english alliterative verse.  Nothing of the Epic hero who comes to a tragic end.    As For the Director Bob Z.  He will never make another film as fun and imaginative as Back to the future.  And the last decent film he made was cast away, and the last really good film he made was forrest gump.    That Snow Train movie and Beowulf both unworthy of the directors past greatness.  I mean i know back to the future II and III were not exactly stellar but they were not complete and utter disgraces like beowulf either.
0375703764|3.0|Parts of Danielewski's story are very intriguing, and he pulls off an eeriness that's hard to come by in any kind of entertainment media these days.  However, these amazing bits and pieces are just that: bits and pieces crammed among lavish words and funny looking paragraphs, meant to make you think that you're an eclectic reader.  The book definitely made me think about lots of things, but ultimately the 709 page rock became a waste of time.  I'm one to commit to a book once I start it, and HoL seemed very promising, yet also challenging.  It ended up being this...thing...that I carried around with me for 2.5 months, leaving me too weary to get frustrated with it.  This book goes beyond entertainment and becomes an ordeal.  If you're looking for something fun to read, House of Leaves may be it, but only if you're willing to put yourself through mazes of footnotes to really get a glimpse of anything significant in this story.  If there's any character I can relate to in this book, it's Johnny Truant: I've become obsessed with looking for some kind of meaning in this cage of a book, and I can't wait to pawn it off onto the next sucker who walks by and says, \\"Hm. That's kind of interesting.\\"  I'm glad to be done with it.  Good riddance.

A lot of stars in the pic right before they broke out like Jason Statham, Ed Norton and Charlize Theron.  All were in many movies before, but it wasn't long after this movie that most became household names.  Watching this movie, you can understand their trajectory.    Nice heist movie and it supposedly has as sequel coming.. .

B0013N7AD8|3.0|First of all, let me tell you that I like to watch these movies from time to time, even the last two, which (with all due respect to the people involved in their production) were two bombs. So to put it in perspective, let's compare it to another high profile catalog movie franchise, namelly the \\"Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection\\". Although a lot of people are complaining about the use of DNR (digital noise reduction) on some of the Star Trek titles, the fact is, those movies have NEVER looked so good. Speaking of the films themselves, only the fifth is generally considered bad. So there you have a box with five great films and a bad one for $69.49, which means each film for $11.58 (if you only buy it for the good films, then it would be $13.90 per film). Now, here we have the Batman films, which have been released in special edition DVDs a relatively short time ago (so the improvement in quality is not as noticeable as with the Star Trek films) which contains two great films and two bombs for $83.49, meaning each film for $20.87 (if you only buy it for the good films, it would mean $41.74 per film).  I imagine that most of the people who ever intended to purchase these films heve already purchased the SE DVDs. Of course, the Blu-ray editions are an overall improvement and I do intend to buy them, but NOT at this price. So, Warner Video, I realize you only care about numbers, so here are some numbers for you to consider:    Batman Anthology  Amazon.com Sales Rank: #5,319 in Movies & TV    Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection  Amazon.com Sales Rank: #179 in Movies & TV    I believe that clearly makes my point, doesn't it?
B000002N25|5.0|Mark has always been ecclectic, even his hits such as Sultan's Of Swing or Tunnel of Love (as Dire Straits) do not quite fit into any one mold, and are different from standard rock fare.    On this record he showcases his influences and loves more - country, rock, jazz, and he does it all with great proficiency and with solid songs.  He has a vast catclog, including some memorable performances with other artists, but if you have missed this one, you should get it.    Another record which shows how wonderful a talent he is.
B0029358GM|5.0|I think it's a five star listen.  I have all of Wilco's albums so I'm familar with their past work.  If you're a Wilco fan it's a buy.  If you've never listened to Wilco give it a go.
B000002LCB|5.0|I loved the movie and the soundtrack to Princess Bride, and until I saw this movie, I never really knew much about Mark Knopfler other than a song or two on raido from time-to-time, but hearing this changed it all (and I went and started listening to his other records.)    But this still hold a very special place in my heart...Storybook Love is beautiful.
B001L51RQE|4.0|This show was very good, and these guys are obviously very talented.  I loved how tight Stewart's drumming is and always has been......Andy jams as always,...but Sting....Sting, in my opinion comes across as pretentious.  He sings all of these golden hits in a lackadaisical fashion almost like he thinks he's doing the audience a favor.  Would he rather be singing Desert Rose?   I went to the show in Dallas which my wife and I took my young sons, (who have mastered \\"Message in a Bottle\\" on guitar hero....heh heh....)  I own a bunch of concert DVDs so I tend to be critical of them.    I saw the Synchronicity tour when I was like 14 or 15 and stood on the 22nd row,...which was incredible.
0440241030|2.0|I don't understand all of the positive reviews.  I'm a HUGE Lee Child / Jack Reacher fan, but Hard Way felt like it was written by another author entirely.  Very disappointed in this book.  But, hey, everybody's due for a bad one in a 13 novel (and going) series.  I highly recommend skipping this one.  At the very least, PLEASE don't make this your first Lee Child book.
B000005J08|4.0|Rightfully praised as one of spazz-core's top albums, this heavyweight multi-genre freakout can often become pigeonholed and stereotyped as sheer anti-musical id-droppings over skewered patterns, but that summation would belie a fascinating compositional eclecticism residing just underneath all the scattershot menace.
B00005QGAT|1.0|Once upon a time, MJ was on the cusp of creating something musically significant. But he veared back off into the realm of intensely boring. This album is fluff, and although he skirted interesting musical ideas he never followed through. I once thought that maybe his next album would be significant, but no. Now he's dead, so how about we let the dead rest in peace and never mention him again?
B000JMKNV0|3.0|If I didn't know this was Lehane, I would have thought it was a decent book. Having read Run,Baby,Run; this is a HUGE dropoff in quality. The plot is very simple, predictable, and fast paced. The only real positives are the decent character development and the cheap thrills. If you haven't read any other Lehane, don't start here because it is not a good representative of his work. If you have read his other work, don't waste your time with this one. Everyone has their bad books (or series, cough cough James Patterson) so lets hope this is it. Unfortunately, this is being made into a movie when it should have went straight to the paperback rack.

B0029358GM|5.0|I'll be quick.  Every summer an album bubbles to the top in terms of playtime and ultimatley dleivering as the soundtrack for my summer.  Summer 2008 it was The National, Boxer.  2009 it is Wilco (the album)...  I love the depth & concision of this record.   In the day of the single song downloads OR the 90 minute meandering CD, this one stands out as clocking in at an eloquently concise 43 minutes - delivering the necessary range and depth but departing leaving the listener wanting more.  Just right for side one and side two of the vinyl pressing (remember side 1 and 2?).  Tweedy's songs are deeply personal and are complimented by equally personal playing from the band.   The chemistry, comfort and confidence here are undeniable. Thanks Guys!    Just praying they schedule some Northwest dates as they never dissapoint live.  Enjoy!!
1400034779|4.0|The only thing I didn't like was that it had to end.    I learned that you don't have to write elloquently to write a book.  This book was so simple and yet so enjoyable that it makes me wonder if I really could write a book too.    Because each mystery/case is so short and precise, it doesn't need all the suspense other books use. I think the suspense in this book is about finding out what the next problem will be and how clever she is to solve it.    One question asked in book club was if women are more perceptive than men. I don't feel that all women are more perceptive than all men. It depends on personality. However, I would venture to generalize that many women seem to be more sensitive to other people's feelings than most men are.

B0026BD2GK|5.0|The two CD set of SANTANA: THE WOODSTOCK EXPERIENCE is truly evidence of a super group being launched into stardom. It includes the live Woodstock CD that runs almost 46-minutes and a replica CD of their debut album [[ASIN:B0000062FJ Santana]]--minus the bonus tracks which are on the live CD.<br /><br />Although Santana was relatively unknown when they took the stage in the daytime at Woodstock, they soon won the crowd over with their blistering instrumentals like \\"Waiting,\\" \\"Savor,\\" \\"Jingo,\\" \\"Fried Neck Bones And Some Home Fries,\\" and the astronomical \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" (seen on [[ASIN:B001V9LRV0 Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition with Amazon Exclusive Bonus Disc)]], which blew me away and that's why I bought this set).<br /><br />Unless you have no pulse (or no rhythm), you can't help but move your feet and/or bob your head to Santana's incredible live set at Woodstock. The songs \\"Evil Ways,\\" \\"You Just Don't Care,\\" and \\"Persuasion\\" feature vocals, and I like those songs a lot, but they don't compare to the music itself. Infectious beats that are driving and full of life; a perfect blend of Latin, Rhythm & Blues, Rock, Soul and even a little Gospel that's what Santana's music sounds like to me.<br /><br />You can hear the audience go from polite applause to raucous, absolute cheering screams of appreciation and acknowledgment as the group continues on with their songs. By the end of their set, Santana blew the audience away and this CD is a testament to it.<br /><br />Like the other CD sets of in the Woodstock Experience ([[ASIN:B0026BD2GU Sly & The Family Stone: The Woodstock Experience (2CD)]] and [[ASIN:B0026BD2H4 Janis Joplin:The Woodstock Experience (2 CD)]])--I own and recommend both--Santana's comes with two CDs--live Woodstock set and Santana--which come in cardboard jackets and sleeves with liner notes, and housed inside a larger cardboard package. It also comes with a mini-fold out poster featuring the band onstage on one-side and the audience on the other.<br /><br />Get this CD set and you'll see why Santana's Woodstock performance is legendary.

0316010669|4.0|Are you interested in how the mind works? Do you ever wonder why people do what they do? Do you like reading short case studies of interesting historical events? Do you have to make quick decisions under pressure? Are you interested in music, art, politics, or psychology? If your answer is yes to any of the above, this book is for you!    This book was recommended to me by one of my professors in my MSW program. I have been wanting to read it since then and just barely picked it up from the library. Because I had high expectations, I was worried that I would be let down. I am happy to report that I was not!    This book is well organized as the author takes you through various case studies and research experiments. The logic was easy of me to follow and his style of writing kept me entertained. More than once I stopped in the middle of a chapter to write down a term, person, or website to look up online. This is a book I could enjoy reading over and over again. Indeed, for me to fully grasp the concepts, I plan to re-read it when I have more time to ponder the ideas and someone to discuss it with. This would make an excellent choice for a book club.
0440241901|2.0|I will admit that the book was funny at times. However, I could never really get over how unrealistic it was to be able enjoy it. I know it's chick-lit and that some lack of realism is expected, but this was too much for me. I enjoyed The Undomestic Goddess and Remember Me? much more than this one. Those two had some unrealistic elements in them as well, but at least they were about much more than just a silly (unrealistic) romantic relationship (barf). The Undomestic Goddess even addressed one of the  questions that I think most women face after college...whereas this one really was just all silliness.    Not only were the situations unrealistic, but so were the characters. Although the main character was funny at times, she was also immature- which made her seem annoying and childish. And the ending was especially annoying and far-fetched. Also, the romantic relationships were more compelling in the other two novels mentioned above, whereas in this one, I felt that the obstacles the couple faced (besides being unrealistic) were too serious to be dismissed with comedy
159448385X|5.0|I loved this book so much! I read it before I read The Kite Runner and without knowing what it was about. There were times when I was so sad I didn't want to keep reading. But of course I did. This book made me think of how blessed we are to live in the United States and have freedoms and rights as women.
B00005JM1F|4.0|In the vein of the Revenge of the Nerds, but with the mid-lufe crisis twist, Old School is a good watch.  I have the DVD with the additional \\"Bonus Features\\", and would strongly recommend that you watch the deleted scenes as well.  They really add to the movie, and it was unfortunate they were removed in many cases/<br /><br />The movie itself is good for a few laughs, and Will Ferrell is his typical self, and generally carries the movie with a combination of slapstick and satire.  Luke Wilson does an admirable job of playing the straight guy, and his ascerbic wit comes through in this movie.  It may be my favorite Luke Wilson flick - though the list isn't that long.<br /><br />It's not a classic like Animal House, but is good for quite a few laughs, especially if you are, like me, a middle aged married guy who every once in awhile looks at your college years as the \\"best years of my life\\".  It may help you question that, as well as hit home on occasion.
0061122416|2.0|Some of my favorite quotes from the book:  \\"Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date trees.\\" (pg. 91)    \\"It's the simple things in lie that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are able to understand them.\\" (pg. 15)    \\"The hand of God is firm, but infinitely generous.\\" (preface, pg. vi)    A quote I did not agree with:  \\"We only accept a truth after we have first wholeheartedly rejected it.\\" (preface, pg. vi)
1400062071|3.0|Although Elizabeth Strout is a very good writer (hence, the three-star rating), I finished this book feeling as if I had wasted precious time reading it. With some of my fellow reviewers, I find the rave reviews somewhat mystifying. The neat and tidy ending felt contrived and unrealistic, calling into question the integrity of the book as a whole. Have you ever left a highly praised movie feeling disappointed and let down? Well, that's exactly how I felt when I closed this book for the final time. Ms. Strout has reminded me that a well written book does not necessarily mean a good book.
044024238X|4.0|I think \\"Undomestic Goddess\\" is my favorite of all Sophie Kinsella's books I've read so far. Although totally predictable, this book was a pleasure to read.<br /><br />The main reason I enjoyed this book so much is probably because I can totally relate to Samantha. She is a lawyer and workaholic. She thinks that she will be happy after reaching the next step on the career ladder and all her hard work and sacrifices will pay off. Only while working so hard towards her goal, she fails to enjoy her life. A series of events finally forces her to stop and take a long hard look at her life and evaluate what is really important.<br /><br />Of course, predictably there is romance and happily ever after, but aside from that I think this book has a great life message.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|It's a shame the first song on this cd is so crap (sorry Paolo). I got this album about a year ago, had a listen, hated the first track and kinda ditched it. With great reviews for the new cd I thought, 'Hey, I've heard of that guy. I think i bought his first one...', so I dragged it out (after a lot of searching, I think it was holding up a wonky bookcase), put it on and Whammo! Golly Gosh! Had I been missing out! What a treat. what a voice. great songs. Great album. it has been on high rotation for the last month and i can't get enough. lesson learned. Don't judge a cd by it's crap cover (the guys a babe, what's with the pyseudo-retro silhouette nonsense?) or crap first song, although, really, it's hard not too. So put it on, skip straight to Track 2 and don't stop 'til u get enough.
0596009208|5.0|So I have been diving thru all the java books and online videos I can find.  The one thing I seem to find it that alot of books focus on getting you to start writing code and alot of the code you just don't understand fully (Well at least I didn't). They really don't explain what and how things are working. I started looking more at Java text books and that really spent too much time on theory and high level coding ideas.  I watched some great Videos on line, but they started with test driven development, but I really needed the basics in simple to understand english.<br /><br />What I needed is a ground up java class in a book. What I stumbled upon was Head First Java,  After just a few days I am about half way thru this book.  It is the first programming book that you can actually read.  You don't have to read it next to a computer.<br /><br />The book teaches you the basics and the meaning behind them, it challenges you with different learning styles.  The code that is in the book is easy to read and are fun relevant things you might want to try.  No boring hello world, how about creating a battleship game?
B0015DYIH2|1.0|How on earth did Meyer conceive this finale for her saga? The story was so far fetched and removed from the rest of the series it felt like an entirely different book, or even like a bad fanfiction created by an avid fan while waiting for the last book to come out!     The plot also seemed crowded. By the end of the book I had to make a real effort to remember how it began (not to mention how the series began). Although it might have been that the book so painful to read, I found myself bored through most of it and just skimming through some parts.     Even the romance was lacking. Granted, I was always a Team Jacob fan, so all the Edward/Bella scenes did nothing for me. The twisted turn Jacob's character took was very disappointing. Towards the end I found his character became so flat I no longer cared for him.    And they plan to make this into a movie? I already see the critics ripping apart the story. Not to mention moviegoers thinking \\"what the heck?\\"    You really have to be a loyal fan to stick by this book. It's so disappointing that I can no longer count this saga among my favorites.
0385341008|5.0|I read a borrowed copy of this book but I liked it so much that I purchased a copy to keep to read again.  The story is told in a unique style and the characters are developed so well that you feel they are your friends. I recommend this book to men and women.  It is a great story about human spirit.

In additon, the music is great.  The set includes a DVD and a CD.
B000MV8ZD6|5.0|Ok, this is not quite as good as The Beyond, but I prefer Fulci's wacky The House By The Cemetery. Not alot of the plot makes sense, the kid's dubbing is terrible,  and the bat is very much a rubber one. But if you are a fan of Italian Horror, then none of this matters, of course. Here Fulci really goes for broke in a way that modern film makers are often afraid to. Plenty of gore, fantastic composition, camera angles, and creepy music more than make up for \\"Just exactly what the hell is going on?\\" See it, it will stick with you.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|What a disappointment.  What a travesty.  They've taken my beloved Star Trek and turned it into Star Wars.  Slick, fast, empty.  A changeling.  (pun intended - how many here will get it?)  The only redeeming factor is Leonard Nimoy as (old) Spock, but even that just adds to the sadness felt by (true, not newby) fans who, while watching him in that role, realize that the Star Trek they knew and loved is no more.  In fact, Vulcan is no more.  Which means the comic book mentality of Star Wars is free to triumph over the deeper philosophical Star Trek that doesn't hold the   attention of today's ADD mentality younger generation.     The plot is absurd.  Why would Star Fleet give command of the flagship to a an officer fresh out of the Academy, and a stowaway at that?  A Spock-Uhura romance?  A 17-year old helmsman??  With the elimination of the original timeline, Star Wars lover Abrams is free to wreck and/or destroy everything true fans love about Star Trek.  Enjoy, newbies.  I'm going to spend my money on the Blu-Ray boxed set of original Star Trek movies.  There is only one James T. Kirk and Chris Pine is not him.
0762434279|3.0|This book will really hit the nail on the head about how the poor and middle class spend their money. You will certainly chuckle whenever you meet someone of that status after reading this because their lifestyle is very similar to what's written on the book. There are however some things about it that made me decide to give it 3 instead of 5 stars. Actually if I can... I actually want to give it 3 1/2 stars and these are the reasons why.    1. The book can get really repetitious that it's possible to just write down what Robert wants to get across in just a piece of paper. What made it into a book was because of those stories his telling that I can't say if 100% of them are all true.    2. It is more of a motivational rather than an educational book. There were certainly a lot of times when he could have expound more on an interesting subject but instead he decide to tell it by... again using stories or his own experience that you almost want to ask the book \\"BUT HOW/WHY IS IT POSSIBLE?\\".    I love the book and it certainly has change me on how to spend my money but as someone who has also read Cashflow Quadrant I recommend that you buy other books that can give more information about a particular subject rather than solely relying on the Rich Dad series.

B0018BF1KY|5.0|You could pick any five of Rory's albums and have a killer set of CD's. I bought this for the hard to find Duece and Jinx CD's. I already had the other three and they are great with Top Priority being my favorite.... until I heard Duece! You can't lose with this collection - a great start for new Rory fans! Instead of figuring out which one to buy you get five great albums at an unbeliveable low price.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Just watched this movie on DVD.. and wow! what a movie!! Having known not much about Korean cinema, I had no idea such a movie could come from Korea. This movie is a class apart. Yes it is shocking and disturbing, but you can't leave it for a moment and at the end it might well just leave you numb. There is a lot of action (and yes, blood too), but all that would be meaningless without the intriguing plot. What a story it is! A man is kidnapped and kept locked up in a room for 15 years, then released so he can find out the identity of his torturer and his motive. Despite of all the action in the movie, it is much more of a psychological story than an action movie. Excellent direction, script, acting and music. My highest recommendation. Don't miss it.
B00000IHC7|5.0|How Rory Gallagher slipped under my radar I will never know. The man is so unjustly underated and it baffles me why so many other music lovers have never heard his music. He was so much more that just a great front man - how can he not be in the top ten guitarists / writers / performers of all time? I guess he was his own man and perhaps that puts him above comparison. If I could go back in time I'd head straight for the 70's and find a spot front and center at one if his concerts!      Oh!, The disc is fantastic. Follow Me, Philby, Hell Cat, classic Rory!
B00005OC0G|2.0|I had commented here on Mutter's version of the Beethoven with Karajan and said I couldn't wait for her new take on it. I had loved the slow movement of the HVK Beethoven but thought the first movement was a little straightforward, stolid and slow. I blamed Karajan's domination of a 16 year old. I tried to convince people Mutter's conception of this piece would undoubtedly be different nowadays.   I had said all that after being dazzled by her extraordinary live Brahms concerto of a few years ago with Masur conducting.   And so here the new version is, with Masur, again, conducting. And, well, I was wrong. The new version is different, certainly, but all that's changed seems to be how many mannerisms she can spill all over the same basic dullish interpretation of the first movement.   It's very pretty in its way - beautiful tone - but there's really no reason for this version to exist except to help catalouge the evolution of Mutter's pushing and pulling at the musical line over the years.   The second and third movements are not that much different in style from the Karajan either, except that Karajan is a much more individual conductor than Masur, which works for me. Others may prefer Masur's less Romantic style.   I'm a huge fan of Mutter. I've seen her in concert several times and love what she does with certain kinds of music. I don't even mind mannered playing if it's poetic. For example, she has a pure Mutterism in which, in certain extremely soft passages, she can go from an utterly beautiful tone to a barely audible scrape that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.   In the Beethoven the mannerisms do nothing to add to the music. If you want Mutter's Beethoven, buy the Karajan. The Larghetto is about the most beautiful I know. But there are many other violinists with better versions of the whole concerto.

B00000269M|5.0|Crass as this may seem MJ's recent passing has lead me to review some of his albums on here.I actually thought I had early in my years on Amazon but this is as good a time as any to start.This album was critical for Michael in a lot of different ways. First off obviously it had to follow up [[ASIN:B000WS4QJG Thriller]],a really good album made that due to it's record breaking sales was made to seem inhumanely perfect. In short,the standards for this album were'nt set very high-not even by the artist himself so it seems. He was convinced afront that if he didn't change,he wouldn't be able to outdo his earlier feat. So he set about with Quincy Jones on making what basically amounted to music that was generally tougher minded.It has all the basic elements of the previous album but everything is a lot more dramatic and diliberate.Does it work in the end?You bet!! The heavy funk of the title track alone,with an excellent solo by jazz organist Jimmy Smith of course grabbed the most attention right off. Being how his commerciality is a huge part of Michaels artistry he really puts a huge amount of energy into what ended up being the hits here.\\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\",with it's edgy sexual shuffle is the prime example of that,with some unusually swaggering singing from MJ. The other hits were \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\"...more or less a latinish pop ballad that Michael and Siedah Garrett sang the pants off of.It has recently been pointed out to me that there's an unexpected mix of funk and.....operatic classical chordal patterns to the edgy \\"Smooth Criminal\\",another of the tougher hits from this collection.\\"Man In The Mirror\\"....is a song I've always loved and respected.As I've grown older I have to admit it's been one of the more imitated styles of message songs and that can make it sound slightly corny musically by todays standards.But whatever you think about the arrangment the yearning,consciencious song more than makes up for what energy it may lack in the musical department for some.\\"Another Part Of Me\\" is one of the better uptempo songs on here,even if it was a minor hit only for him (who know MJ in the 80's would ever have a MINOR hit) and wasn't actually recorded spesifically for this album but rather for the Disney World based 3-D film 'Captain Eo',starring Michael and which few people who never visited Disney World have ever seen say for that MTV airing of it in 1995 or so.It's on some of the non hit material that you really hear the toughness in sound Mike was going for.\\"Speed Demon\\" sadly tends to serve as this albums whipping boy.It's aggresive funk-rock approch is not as hit worthy as most of his music in terms of how the pop world approches this kind of music but it was definately something that seemed to be written based on his dancing style than for the purposes of getting on the radio.\\"Liberian Girl\\" was never officially a hit but was such a great,sexy groove that it became very popular and even got it's own music video as well.It's definately a highlite of this album,for me anyway.\\"Just Good Friends\\" is the \\"forgotton\\" song here,a duet with Stevie Wonder that.......well lets just say little screams \\"late 80's urban contemporary/R&B/funk dance crossover song\\" louder than this. But again the toughness of Quincy's production and Bruce Swediens excellent Acousonic recording process keeps it from being what I once heard referred to as \\"tinky tinky dance\\",someones description of a very dated and poppy style of 80's electro funk-disco.\\"Dirty Diana\\" is a good tune and an okay hit.I admit it's not my favorite on the album;Michael drove a rock kind of tune home more directly with \\"Beat It\\" from the previous album but this was okay in a big arena kind of way;the addition of audience noise was a good effect.On the CD of this album you also get \\"Leave Me Alone\\",a tense dancey-funk tune that introduced itself as one of his first direct rantings about his own negative press. Overall this album puts Michael in a possition where being commercial and an artist of some not musically and otherwise began to become a complication rather than a clear career choice. But no matter how you look at it the album was good enough and successful enough to end up becomming a success even at this point.And how many obvious pop albums of recent years can you say that about?a possition where being commercial and an artist of some not musically and otherwise began to become a complication rather than a clear career choice.

B001RQ0SJO|4.0|Natasha Khan, the one-woman band behind Bat for Lashes, released a truly original and mesmerizing debut album \\"Fur and Gold\\" (2006 release in her home UK home market, released in 2007 in the US). Since then we've had not nearly enough exposure to Bat for Lashes in the US. While de debut almost almost immediately garnered critical acclaim here as well (with virtually no airplay), she rarely played live in the US. Now, finally, comes the eagerly awaited sophomore album.<br /><br />Before the album came out, I had read somewhere that \\"Two Suns\\" (11 tracks; 45 min.) was supposed to be a concept album of sorts, about Khan's \\"spiritual self\\" and her \\"destructive, self-absorbed, blonde femme fatale\\" alter-ego Pearl. That certainly caught my attention. The album starts off with 3 very strong tracks: the dramatic opener \\"Glass\\", which is followed by \\"Sleep Alone\\" and the piano-heavy \\"Moon and Moon\\", which sounds like an new-and-improved Tori Amos. In fact, pianos are far more prevalent on this than on the debut album. \\"Piece of Mind\\" is going back to the Bjork-influence that also came thought on the debut album. \\"Pearl's Dream\\" has all the features of a good dance song, except that it really isn't one somehow. My favorite song on here is \\"Two Planets\\", with its mysterious soundscape.<br /><br />As you listen to the songs, one really doesn't get the feeling that this is a concept album. Of course it doesn't help that there are no liner notes to speak of (and the ones that are there are in impossibly small print) and, worse, no lyrics to the songs to follow along the 'story line'. Not that the album doesn't sound good, far from it, but it does lack the element of surprise from the debut album. If you wonder where you can hear Bat for Lashes, check out internet-only WOXY (Bam! The Future of Rock and Roll), which brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none. Even though I go to a lot of shows and about 3 music festivals a year, I still haven't had a chance to see Bat for Lashes in concert. I hear the live show is even better than the studio recordings, and I can only hope to get a chance to see it with my own eyes sometime soon.ncert.

0066620996|5.0|Although I'm just in the first few chapters of this book, I've found it very useful. Mr. Collins and his teams have a very interesting approach to what makes a good and a great company. I've seen so many big companies that at the most can be considered good (although I wouldn't mind calling them mediocre - even though I'm talking of companies that every year makes millions of dollars). This Big company generally are satisfied by making good profits and boy are they good. But they're not great, not as good they could be. This book is a definitely eye opener, and every CEO and all top management should grab a copy,

B00297FEUI|3.0|Having watched the film (which was as good as the first) I was disappointed that the score doesn't quite live up to the fantastic score for the first film.  It is almost fifteen minutes shorter than the first score and while the music is very good, the tracks don't quite grab you as the fantastic pieces of orchestration that many of those from the first film did.   They are still very good though, but the first score stands above them as being superior.
0749399570|4.0|My Aunt who is Philipino liked this book and kept bugging me to read it. I heard it was depressing and was afraid I would dislike it.I ended up  getting it on tape. I love Amy Tan's quiet,clear girlish voice.She pronounces all the Chinese words so you understand what she is saying.The food these ladies cook when they are together sounded mouthwatering.(wished they would have included recipes)  There are sad parts in it, but its mostly about Mothers and daughters and the weird relationships we tend to have with the other generation. I could really relate to the main character and her relationship with her mother even though I am not chinese.You love your mom to peices and they love you ,but sometimes the two of you don't speak the same language.Or your personalities are so diverse that what make sense to you seems foriegn to them.   The only person who didn't make any sense to me is Waverly.She seems embarrased of her mother because she isn't a yuppy lawyer like her. I could understand worrying about her clueless fiance offending her mother.But:How could you not want your mother to be proud of you and brag on what a good daughter you are? That's what mother's are supposed to do!Yes Waverly's Mom can be a little over the top but she is always there rooting for her daughter!
0440236738|5.0|Whenever I read a book of this genre, I always try to figure out how it's going to end.  Many times I have found that the story is predictable and it ends exactly how I think it will.  Not so for this book!!  With every turn of the page, I found myself questioning what I really know and what is really going on (as the protagonist does throughout the book).  This story reminded me of the \\"cliff hangers\\" my grandfather used to tell me about that he watched as a kid.  The ending of each chapter forced me to keep going, if not for curiousities sake, but also for my own sanity!  To make a long review short, READ THIS BOOK!!!  It will not disappoint you!!
0679731725|3.0|It is hard not to be dissapointed in \\"The Remains of the Day\\" after reading beforehand the latest Ishiguro's novel, \\"Never Let me Go.\\" I have to say the former is nowhere close to the latter when it comes to the gravity of the tragedy and morale of the story. The book is about Stevens, a dedicated butler in World War I and II England who loves his job and aspires to fulfill a greater purpose by serving a distinguished politician Lord Darlington and his guests. What he means is by serving them, he indirectly contributes, regardless of how small the contribution is, to the decisions they made that had a global impact for the good of humanity. \\"A great butler can only be, surely, one who can point to his years of service and say that he has applied his talents to serving a great gentleman - and through the latter, to serving humanity\\" (p.117).  Though there is no doubt about his sincerity and the excellence of his work, there is a sense of failure upon finding out that Lord Darlington was on the wrong side of the political aisle, and had committed a fatal mistake as evident from the series of events that led him to being called one of Hitler's pawns. Another sense of failure comes from the fact he might have missed out on one of the best things in life; namely, getting married and raising a family. Though the story only alludes to it, there seems to be a clear romantic interest from Miss Kenton, the former housekeeper in the same household he works at, but the two never pursue it. I have not seen the movie where Anthony Hopkins played Stevens and Emma Thomspon played Miss Kenton. Though it was nominated for eight Academy Awards, it doesn't appeal to me very much. I like the story of \\"The Remains of the Day\\" but I don't think it would linger in my memory for a long time, unlike \\"Never Let Me Go.\\"
1576754227|4.0|I had actually finished reading \\"Eat That Frog!\\" a few weeks earlier, when I decided to re-read David Allen's \\"Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity.\\" Both books aim to help readers overcome stress in their lives through practicing better personal productivity techniques.    One of things I liked about \\"Eat That Frog!\\" -- which was also the same reason I think a lot of people disliked the book -- was that it really sums up principles of success that most people probably know already. The only difference is that the author, Brian Tracy, condenses those principles into 21 concise chapters designed to drill those points in.    The book argues that the key to success is to overcome procrastination by concentrating single-mindedly on your most important task, and to get that task done both quickly and well. This can only be done by acknowledging the very things you most dread doing that day, and doing them FIRST -- thereby, overcoming procrastination and helping you feel positively empowered.    In other words, all things being equal, if having to eat a live frog is the worst thing you have to do in a given day, it's usually better to eat that frog before you do anything else. The \\"frog\\" in this case is a metaphor for the most important (and often most unpleasant / dreaded) task facing you that day. The 21 chapters contained in this book more or less elaborate on this guiding principle, and include additional rules and principles for success as well.    And indeed, the insights provided in \\"Eat That Frog!\\" are valuable, and worth reading -- especially considering the book is so short (only 117 pages). However, it's not really meant to be a time-management or work-life organization manual, so if you're struggling in these areas, I would highly recommend you read \\"Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity\\" by David Allen.    Both books in a way serve to complement each other, and I like the fact that neither delve into more esoteric and almost quasi-spiritual theories as to why we procrastinate or become disorganized (such as is the case with other self-help authors like Stephen Covey and Neil Fiore).    Instead, in both \\"Eat That Frog!\\" and \\"Getting Things Done\\" you'll get practical hands-on advice and techniques that you can actually use on the ground. But in the final analysis, I have found \\"Getting Things Done\\" to be more helpful when it comes to time-management and self-organization.
B0026NWBY2|3.0|Without a doubt George Harrison was great and was the first graduate of the Lennon/ McCartney school of songwriting.In his entire career,I feel ,he made a handful of really fine albums.All things must pass, Material World, 33 & 1/3, CloudNine and Brainwashed.He was a fine rhythm player, a tatsty slide player and a passionate vocalist who made great use out of a limited tenor / alto range.It's too bad his spirituality did'nt give him the discipline too stop smoking or stop pursuing Ringo's first wife.<br /><br />Doug Cash

B00021R7CG|4.0|Hmm. I have to start by saying that it's been a long time since I saw this film, but would really love to see it again. As other reviewers have mentioned, it may be low budget made for TV fare, but the cast is pretty impressive and although some of the dialog is rather stilted, it is well acted and the overall effect is tense and they get a good mix of \\"action\\" and tension build. This is a good film.    The film wastes little time in getting down to the action which is good, the main weak link for me is the love interest between Booth and DeMornay, which to be honest is not required. The same tensions between the by the book aircraft commander and his co-pilot would have worked just as well if they had not been romantically involved or indeed if they had been 2 men (or women). The B52 crew goes a little nuts, but it is impossible to predict the reaction of people in this situation if their families had just been killed. There is genuine tension in the scenes involving the crew.     For me, the standout performance is the ever-dependable Martin Landau, as the tortured President trying to make sense of the situation and divine the intentions of his opposite number. Obviously he learned much during his command position on Moon Base Alpha.     Its nice to see some of the reviewers that were involved in the US air force give this film the thumbs up as well, I also crewed battlefield nuclear weapons and found the command and control sequences of the film also quite realistic, as I understood them to be at the time.     So all in all, highly recommended Cold War techno-thriller type film that would keep the Tom Clancy brigade occupied for a couple of hours.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|The other reviews are eloquent enough. I will say that while there is no substitute for being at the incredible concert in Minneapolis, Cohen's Live in London is a great live album that far and away surpasses the very respectable Field Commander Cohen.  These versions of Suzanne and Take This Waltz - the whole album really- are truly sacred.
B0009LNRLE|2.0|Be warned: sonically speaking this new upgrade is no different that the version of this that was available many years ago. I felt royally screwed after getting rid of the old versions and spending quite a bit of cash to upgrade all the albums only to find that they sound EXACTLY the same! This is a great album but if you own the older version there is no reason whatsoever to \\"upgrade\\" to this version.
0375831002|5.0|Hmmm...The Book Thief already has 522 5 star reviews, what more is there to add?  I'm not sure I can add much, but let me say that if there were 10 stars available that's what I would give it!    What makes The Book Thief different, in my mind, are two things.  First, the narration by Death is truly a wonderful twist and unique perspective.  Second is the interesting perspective of Leisel, the German girl growing up during WWII and the Holocaust.  This isn't the Diary of Anne Frank because she herself is not Jewish nor is she in hiding or at risk for being killed by her own countrymen for who she is (though she is if it is found out she is hiding a Jew).  However, this is different than a story told by 'just' a girl living through it, as it has directly affected her since her parents were 'taken away' because her father was a Communist.  She has also experienced the death of her young brother. These two factors give the book a fascinating and unique perspective which is utilized to its fullest by the author's masterful writing.    In an interview I read the author said, when asked about his writing style, that he thought it would be wonderful if there were a little twist, a little play of words, a unique descriptive phrase for the reader on each page.  He has clearly accomplished that.    Though I haven't read Kurt Vonnegut Jr for many years, I detect a hint of his style here...    In short, one of the best books I have ever read...a definite 5 stars and highly recommended.  In fact, I thought it was an important enough book that I bought a hardcover copy to have in the house even though I originally purchased and read it on my Kindle!
B0009LNRL4|2.0|Be warned: sonically speaking this new upgrade is no different that the version of this that was available many years ago. And the bonus tracks are of very recent vintage NOT from when this album was recorded. So if you like drum machines and samplers etc (which is what the bonus tracks use to a very noticable degree) go ahead and buy it. But otherwise you might feel royally screwed like I did after getting rid of the old versions and spending quite a bit of cash to upgrade all the albums only to find that they sound EXACTLY the same!
B0000UJDLM|3.0|4 stars movie. 2 stars letter boxed. I bought this to replace my earlier edition to have it play 16:9 on load but it is still letterboxed. Image doesn't want to spend the money to give us an enhanced remastered DVD but they will change the cover to trick us. True, not a masterpiece but fun to watch. 5.1 sound and letterboxed, Incongruous.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Not every movie has to be a film masterpiece, if every film was how boring would that be ? Legally Blonde is an unbeilevable tale of Elle Woods, a sorority head who has lost her boyfriend Warner because she isn't of his class. Not willing to give up the fight, she takes the LSATS and gets into Harvard Law where she gets introduced to a harsh, new, academic world were things are not handed to her. Adding insult to injury, Warner has moved on with Vivien a snobbish wealthy girl who tries to humiliate Elle by inviting her to a costume party where she is the only one wearing a costume !    This is where Elle begins to transform when she comes to realize that she's never going to be good enough for Warner and decides to become the best lawyer possible. This transformation is furthered when she staunchly defends the innocence of Brooke Windham-Taylor- a fellow Delta New amid murder charges and a law professor/defense attorney that beileves that she is gulty. The cementing action is when Callahan hits on her in his office and Elle showing self respect and discipline rebuffs him, than ironically ends up taking over the case after Emmit (whose always beileved in Elle.)tells the truth to Mrs. Windham, then everything comes full circle as Elle wins the case because of her background as a Delta New!    Actually presents a pretty good lesson for girls or anyone really beyond the far fetched plot and cutesy humor that anything is possible as long as you put your mind to it.
B000VLMTHK|5.0|this is a great album, one of my favorites. it did not take long at all to receive this item and it was in great condition.
B0000084J7|5.0|This is an incredible album, and gets better with repeated listenings.  Personally, I make quiet time in the dark and watch out windows while listening to this - so, it takes patience to adapt your ear to it, even as a fan, but it's well worth it in spades when you settle in to it.  Great piece of work - we need more like this from Hollis.  He's a genius.
B002BCNK1Q|1.0|Not sure why people like this movie. It's one giant stereotype/cliche with really bad acting and bad script.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm 56 years old and this program represents film art for the current generation of more youthful viewers.<br /><br />To me, the Firefly Series is sort of a three-way cross between [[ASIN:B000RZIGVS Star Trek: The Next Generation - Complete Series]], (from a story standpoint); [[ASIN:B001P7YD8W Doctor Who: The E-Space Trilogy - Full Circle/State of Decay/Warriors' Gate (Episodes 112-114)]], (for its \\"soap opera-ish\\" approach to film), and; [[ASIN:B00008972G C.S.I. Crime Scene Investigation - The Complete First Season]], (from the perspective of \\"production\\".)<br /><br />I'm a traditionalist, always preferring older movies and TV series over the newer productions, but I heard so much about Firefly that I thought I'd give it a shot; however, I couldn't deal with the abrupt scene changes and camera sweeps, a film production technique that emerged from the 90s.<br /><br />But, in summary, it's still easy to see that this is quality programming, supported by terrific writers. So, in the end, just because I didn't personally enjoy Firefly does not mean that others won't appreciate a good show when they see it... thus my five-star rating.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this film, which I rented, but plan to buy. They didn't fall for the old plot of young, up and coming chief, is jealous of newcomer and plots to get the better of him.  It was much more realistic as a worthy competitor finds an equal and befriends him to vanquish the enemy, not getting soppy with romance, just the hunt.  Very Beowulf meets Alien.  I particularly enjoyed the end monolog and wish they had used the alternate beginning.
B000EGDC0A|5.0|This is a fantastic album of Goldfrapp...probably it's the best!!! She's a wonderful and sexy voice!!! My favourite songs are \\"Ooh La La La\\", \\"Slide in\\" and \\"Satin Chic\\"!!!
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Ray Lamontange is an amazing song writer, both lyrically, musically and vocally. I haven't had the pleasure of seeing this man live, but trust me that the first chance I get, I'll be there. This album is yet another masterpiece from a guy who's doing his best to do Van Morrison proud in the singer songwriter sense of that phrase. He's so measured and his vocals are so incredibly warm and tender that if you are sensible to music, you WILL respond. Definitely one of my picks for best albums of 2008 and definitely an album that should be owned by millions on sheer beauty alone. Ray reminds us that life in its entirety is full of soul and that we must do our best to treat it with the respect and love it deserves. Standout tracks... you could say the entire album, because there is not one weak song on it.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|Great revamped performances by Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Crosby, Stills and Nash and many more. The improved audio brings the ultimate hippie experience to life and Joe Cocker's performance of A Little Help From My Friends is truly electrifying. Awesome DVD!
B00066N8JS|5.0|As defined by the dictionary, seminal means:  1. pertaining to, containing, or consisting of semen. 2. Botany. of or pertaining to seed.   3. having possibilities of future development. 4. highly original and influencing the development of future events: a seminal artist; seminal ideas.        The Downward Spiral is seminal on all those levels, because listening to closer and not wanting to do stuff like an animal is pretty impossible. In the seed sense of the word, you could hear the greatness in Pretty Hate Machine, but it wasn't until this album that we could truly grasp how great Trent Reznor could be at his best and most self hating and lascivious. Third off, the possibilities with every NIN outing are endless and though you know the mojo behind the magic, you can't helped being wowed by the tricks. Lastly, this album is seminal because it is groundbreaking, terribly beautiful and completely influential. Buy this album or regret missing on one of the best albums ever. as a bonus, you get an extra disc chock full of remixes and unreleased tracks that are worth your dollar.
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes in three volumes is a great set for anyone who wants to read them in chronological sequence. A wonderful read and ample sized make this a great buy.
B0029358GM|4.0|I'm on my fourth listen to Wilco (the album) and I already think it hangs together better than Sky Blue Sky, which I liked very much. The mood is lighter, the melodies stronger and the band rocks a little more here as well. My personal favorites so far are One Wing, You and I (lovely duet with Feist), You Never Know (dig that ethereal \\"I don't caaaaarrrre anymore\\" hook in the chorus!)and Sonny Feeling (another great hook).     In short, this album hasn't taken much time to grow on me and I'm sure I'll still find buried treasures in repeated listens. Can't wait to see them in Lowell next week!
B001JDSGPI|2.0|A slow read indeed. While one can appreciate the amount of research that went into writing this tale, it's easy to overlook that because it's so damned boring. The legends of Arthur as told through the women involved and the magical lands they come from is an interesting idea and had potential to be an interesting story. But Zimmer-Bradley's writing is dull, repetitive and flat. The characters lack dimensionality and the A to B mode of story telling does not serve her well. If you are really into the Arthurian legends you may want to check it out, otherwise I'd recommend passing this one by.
0060723513|2.0|This work of fiction is interesting and irritating.<br /><br />It is interesting because it contains some profound messages of wisdom.  It is irritating because of the way those messages are presented as profound truths only available to the author after spending some time in an unspecified Australian desert with some unidentified Indigenous Australians.<br /><br />Much wisdom is to be gained from Indigenous Australians.  I expect that a lot of self-knowledge can be obtained  from surviving a period of weeks in a desert.  I imagine that some fundamental truths about self might be useful to others.<br /><br />What irritates me is the notion that a mature, responsible adult could head off into a desert with strangers without (at least) letting someone else know.  Few of the `facts' as presented in the book really make much sense.  But then, in a work of fiction depicting spiritual learning perhaps they don't need to.<br /><br />A friend of mine is reading this book, and asked me (as an Australian) whether I had read it or heard of it.  My friend understood it to be a work of non-fiction.  Within Australia it is clearly marketed as fiction.  Having read it, and some of the media coverage it received, I cannot see how it can be regarded as non-fiction.  The book itself has been regarded as deeply offensive by some Indigenous Australians.<br /><br />None of this means that you shouldn't read it.  However, if you prefer your accounts of epiphanies to be accompanied by at least some factual evidence, you may be disappointed.  If you are interested in reading this novel, I suggest that you look at a selection  of the reviews posted here.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B001DJ69E8|5.0|An amazing album with amazing tracks.  On one hand, the album is one of the most epic pieces of music I have ever heard.  Each track takes you on a journey like you've never gone on before with powerful choral melodies and enchanting orchestration.  If you're into movie trailer music or even rock music then this album is a must for you.    On the other hand, the album is a bit too short with each track only about 3 or 4 minutes long.  Still though the album is very epic and is extremely powerful.  It is a must for any music lover of any genre.    The reason I still give it 5 stars is because (as I've already said) it is very emotionally powerful.  And if this album isn't enough then I would suggest ALSO buying Epicon from Globus, which has some of the same songs longer and more powerful.  There is no doubt that the two albums should be bought together.
0385340575|5.0|\\"Gone Tomorrow\\" was well worth the wait, though the seller sent it to me immediately and in prefect condition. Jack is back and as usual getting caught up in serious drama he complicates by just being Jack. Lots of action in this one, Lee Child does not disappoint.
1427206031|3.0|I listened to the audiobook version of \\"Paths of Glory.\\"<br /><br />This is my first Archer book. I used to work in a bookstore and we would sell quite a few of his books so I was looking forwards to experiencing both a rousing adventure and an Archer book. But, based on this work, I doubt I will be looking for more by Archer.<br /><br />This audibook runs 11 hours on 9 CDs. It could use some serious editing. The climbing and personal life details of the book are, for the most part, interesting. Some of the particulars of his academic career slow the book. However, the in-depth re-creation of meetings of the Royal Geographic Society (with the accompanying interjections of \\"Here, here!\\" and \\"God Save the King!\\") reminded me of being in most of the meetings I've had to suffer through throughout my career - I kept wondering if I could have just skipped the meeting and received the abbreviated memo version instead.<br /><br />The last CD is solid. The extra attention to detail is dropped in favor of a quicker form of narration: a summary letter from Mallory to his wife.  The ending is satisfying even if the reader is quite aware of the way it has to end.<br /><br />So, in sum, the book is too long for its own good. At least two hours could have been edited from it without hurting the story - in fact, it would have helped.
B0006B2A42|3.0|If you have read the book, then watch the movie until the 140th minute and stop. You will thank me for it.    Until then, the movie is a taut thriller, and Rock Hudson really towers and carries the movie thru.
1595141979|2.0|Please do not get me wrong I thought this book was amazing. The writing was incredible and the story telling and character developments were extraordinary. However, I was so let down by the ending of the story that I could not allow myself to give it anything above a two star rating.     I read this series all at once and I could not help but feel drawn in by the romance that was shared between Rose and Demitri. In every book I was impatiently waiting for them to give in to what they were both feeling and ignore the rules of their unique society. I was beyond delighted when this finally occurred in the book \\"Shadow Kiss\\". After days of becoming attached to the characters and their possible relationship I was so let down in the end. It became almost painful to read and left me very upset and slightly depressed.     Richelle Mead managed to redeem herself a little by finally allowing Rose to stand up to her friend Lissa. Not that Lissa is a bad character but it was very depressing to watch Rose sacrifice any ounce of happiness to please her best friend. I couldn't have been more proud when she finally decided to do something for herself.     The author is truly gifted and this series is certainly worth anyone's time. It is just my hope that you are not looking for or expecting a happy ending. If you are wishing for a fairy tale like finish then I assure you this book will let you down.    I am excited to see where the story leads us in the next book and it is my desire that Rose finds some happiness in the end.
1433502445|5.0|[[ASIN:1433502410 The ESV Study Bible]]    Wonderful reference and study Bible. Won't need any other if you have this one. Mine is the leather and rather large to haul around, but great for home study.
1439157383|4.0|I loved the story, but frankly was a bit disappointed that they felt the need to stick the \\"f\\" word in so much, and some of the graphic sex.  I don't think it makes it anymore believable, and don't believe that people like reading books with that in it.  When I was done, I wished I had blackened out that word, and some of the graphic parts, as I'd recommend the book, but wouldn't want anyone else to have to read that stuff either.  I'm not a prude, I just find that word and some of the graphics un-necessary and offensive.  Other than that it was a very good book.  I wonder if the original writing had that in there, or if it was just added in the movie version?
B00013F38K|4.0|The series Kung Fu has been in my mind since I watched it as a boy in the 1970's. It has never been re-run here to my knowledge, and so I am so happy to be able to purchase the entire series to share with my own children. For me the stories are also new so we all have the joy of walking with Caine and reflecting on lifes lessons with wise counsel.  While I hear the criticisms of shortening and cropping, and one of my discs arrived with a scratch on it, for me the messages in the stories are the most important part. I purchased all three seasons as at the time it was the cheaper option and content according to other reviewers was the same. Thanks for the memories David.
B0020EK4QY|4.0|I couldn't wait until this came out in Blu-Ray.  A real upgrade that is well worth the purchase.  Color and lossless sound are excellent, considering the age of the movie.  A 12 year old movie can't be upgraded to compare with the movies of today, but a great improvement for this movie.<br /><br />If you love this action movie and have lossless audio, owning this is a must.

Most of the time you're right in the middle of the action...I'm kind of a Christmas nut anyhow, so it was right up my alley to watch this during one of our hotter weather periods. Well done.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I must admit that this is the first album I bought in more than 10 years, and I am not much of a music lover. I bought this because I felt a part of my growing-up was lost. I will miss MJ, a man of unbelievable talent. The songs are the most wonderful songs I ever heard. I am so glad that I bought this.     Rest in peace, MJ. You have endured too much pain and suffering. Not all are your fault. I don't blame you. Who am I to judge? I just admire your music and everything that you've contributed to this world. You will be missed!
B00005PJ8O|5.0|I had seen this movie before and knew it to be a great one. Through a conversation with a friend I realized this was a movie I wanted to own and did not have.    While the movie itself probably glorifies Patton, George C Scott is unforgettable as Patton and the whole movie takes on its' own movement and life.    Highly recommended!
0810993139|5.0|My youngest son loved this book.  Although he was reticent about it because he thought it was below his reading level, he thought it was very funny and made him feel more comfortable with his then thirteen year old awkwardness.  He gave it to his younger cousin to read, which is a good recommendation.

B002AT4K9Q|4.0|After three high-octane rides on the street racing scene, the fourth film in the \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" series features a departure from the flashy, overblown colors, obvious CGI-enhancement, and at times over-the-top stunts of the previous two films. With \\"Fast & Furious\\" the series returns to its roots with a grittier, more realistic leaning tone and reunites the primary players from the original film's cast of gearheads for more high speed mayhem.    \\"Fast & Furious\\" finds Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) continuing his lawless ways in the Dominican Republic alongside his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and a new crew of velocity addicted miscreants. When the law begins to close in on Dom and his crew, difficult choices are made, plans are put into motion, and a life is lost. All of this forces Dom to return to his native Los Angeles on a quest for answers and to ultimately deal with those responsible. While back in town, Dom is reunited, albeit begrudgingly, with his former friend Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker), who once again finds he is torn between doing what he desires most or following the letter of the law he's sworn to uphold.    With the slightly weaker feel of the previous two films in the series, I was kind of unsure of how good this fourth attempt would prove to be, regardless of the fact that many of the original film's cast members were reprising their roles eight years later. After seeing \\"Fast & Furious\\" over the weekend, I can honestly say that any misgivings I had regarding the film were easily blown away by the sheer entertainment value and superiority exuded by this film over anything included in the previous two films.    Besides the original film's primary cast returning to the series that made them stars, the writer and director duo of Chris Morgan and Justin Lin (\\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\") make their return to the series with a much more polished final product than what had been featured in their previous effort. The screenplay is a much more complex work than one may expect from this type of movie. Screenwriter Chris Morgan ups the stakes for all the players, delivering several twists along the way, and some very sharply written dialogue, all of which makes for a thoroughly entertaining ride from start to finish. The story really seems to focus on resolving storylines begun in the first movie, and creating a stronger link between all of the other movies in the series, especially \\"Tokyo Drift\\" (which has always felt a little bit like an outcast in the franchise). As a fan of the series, I believe that this film's more mature storyline and well-written dialogue showcases the time and effort that Chris Morgan put into this film, and the work definitely pays off by rewarding longtime fans of the franchise by interconnecting each of the films, while not alienating any newcomers.    Director Justin Lin shows an even steadier hand when it came to helming his second effort in the series. Even though Justin proved quite capable in capturing the high speeds and general fast-paced nature of the series with \\"Tokyo Drift\\", his work here is stronger even if it is with a little less flashiness. By approaching the film more in the vein of the original's look and tone, Lin imbues \\"Fast & Furious\\" with a grittier nature that cements its close ties to the aforementioned, along with having the slight feel of an urban crime drama (albeit without the same level of intensity inherent in most of those films). If there are to be any more films in this series, then I believe that the powers-that-be may have found a valuable asset in this director, and one that they should use whenever possible to maintain consistency between the installments (something this series has previously lacked).    As I've mentioned a couple of times already, the cast for this film features many returning members from the original film. Let's begin with one of the biggest breakout stars of the original, Vin Diesel (\\"A Man Apart\\").In his reprisal as Dom Toretto, Vin gives one of the best performances of his career, if not his best yet (easily rivaling his work in \\"A Man Apart\\" or \\"Find Me Guilty\\"). In this film, Diesel is given more opportunity to explore Dom, whether it is his passion for the various facets of his life, personal loss, the issue of trust, or merely the unbridled fury that we had only heard mention of in the first film. Here we are presented with a much more layered and developed anti-hero than had been previously established, and one who is more weathered and world-weary from all of the experiences he has endured whether good or bad. If there are still some detractors of Vin's work out there, then the combination of his movies mentioned above should help convince them to the contrary, so long as they ignore his misfire with the dismal \\"Babylon A.D.\\".    Alongside Vin is Paul Walker as the other main lead for this installment. This film also marks Walker's second reprisal as the lead in this series, as Paul was the only main cast member to return for the initial sequel \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\". To be fair, Vin has also appeared in the series three times, although his second appearance was just a cameo in the final moments of \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\". But I digress, now back to Paul Walker's performance as one-time ex-law man turned outlaw turned active FBI agent Brian O'Connor. It's a rather convoluted series of events that comprise O'Connor's storyline through the series, but it works. In the first film, Paul gave a fairly solid, if not flawed performance, which he proceeded to follow-up with a decidedly more surfer-esque, flat and stilted performance, replete with more \\"Yo's\\", \\"Bro's\\", and \\"Check it's\\" than one would care to count. Paul's third stint in the series, much like Vin's return, makes for his best performance of the series, not to mention his entire career. I used to think that he was one of those actors that merely skated by on his looks and onscreen charm, with very little acting talent holding it all together. With his performance here he is much more reserved and believable, even intense at times, to the point that one wonders if there may be hope for Paul's career as a serious actor yet. Gone are the various surfer boy idioms, replaced by a much more mature character who is still trying desperately to atone for past mistakes.    The final two returning characters are the two important female roles of Mia and Letty (Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez respectively). Both of these characters suffered from very little development in their first outing, a problem that has now been rectified by this film. The character of Mia is given a very emotional arc to go through over the course of the film as she is forced to deal with the return of her former lover and betrayer of her family, Brian O'Connor. Jordana proves with her more developed role and character arc that she has the acting chops necessary to handle more of the story should the occasion call for it, something that future writers of the series may want to take note of should her character make any more return appearances. Michelle Rodriguez has proven in numerous movies and on TV's \\"Lost\\" that she is a very capable actress, but in this series she has yet to really be all that important or necessary for that matter. In the first film she was merely Dom's girlfriend and not all that interesting beyond that; however, in this story her character is central to the film's main plotline. I have to admit that while I wasn't all that enthralled by Michelle's character in the original film, she definitely proved more interesting in this one, and was much more enjoyable to watch as she really seemed to be having a good time in the role.    Lastly, we have one key newcomer to the franchise. Actor John Ortiz (\\"Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem\\") plays a man named Campos whose job is to find and recruit drivers to smuggle drugs for a very powerful Mexican cartel. I haven'tseen John in any kind of tough guy roles, mostly because I haven't seen too many movies he's appeared in, but I have to say he was very convincing in the role. He portrayed the character with a subtle hint of menace, never really overdoing it just keeping an obvious air about him that this guy is not one to be trifled with. While he wasn't given an incredible amount of screen time, what he is given John makes the most of. John delivers a strong antagonist that could have ended up being just another stock character, but became something a little more developed thanks to his work in the role.    \\"Fast & Furious\\" is by far the best of the sequels in the series, and easily rivals the original film, possibly even surpasses it. This is all due to a much tighter and more developed story, the best acting in the entire series, and a much more grounded sense of reality than the previous two films boasted. If you've been a fan of the series or have simply become disappointed by the direction it's taken in the previous sequels, then this is the movie to see as it undoubtedly kicks the franchise back into high gear.    As a side note, it's important to know that \\"Fast & Furious\\" occurs prior to the events shown in the third film, \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\".    \\"Fast & Furious\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sexuality.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|The action and scenery in Up are breathtaking, particularly as so much of the action takes place in high places: a floating house; a dirigible; dogs in planes; and thousand foot waterfalls.  The attention to detail, color, and perspective, especially in 3D, is stunning.  The premise, of an old balloon salesman escaping reality via thousands of balloons attached to his home, is clever, and the story is energized and given comic relief by a little boy who's accidentally along for the ride.<br /><br />But the real scene-stealers are the emotional moments that serve as bookends to the movie.  The first is a montage spanning the courtship, marriage, and gorgeous relationship between main character Karl and his lifelong love, Ellie.  It is one of the most beautiful moments I've ever seen in a movie- film or CGI; it comes out of the blue and gives your heartstrings an unexpected yank, much like the \\"When She Love Me\\" (Sarah Mclachlan) scene in Toy Story 2.  The other, between Karl and the 8 year old thorn in his side, Russell, ties the film up in a tidy package (and would be a spoiler to reveal).  Both are superbly done, and the theater was full of silently crying adults squeezing unaware kids on their laps, or leaning over to kiss them in adjacent seats.<br /><br />A consequence of that kind of true life emotional drama is making the fantastic action scenes more unrealistic by comparison.  Imagine how much more cartoonish events in The Incredibles or Flushed Away would seem if sandwiched between scenes of Beaches or Love Story.  And some of Up's action might be unsettling to young kids, especially the menacing guard dogs that appear throughout the film.  Kids also may be puzzled by them, as the pooches speak though a device on their collars that translates their thought into sound; the concept wasn't that intuitive for the 6 and under set.  These are observations, not complaints, and they don't detract from the movie's considerable sweetness and excitement.
006135323X|5.0|I first viewed a presentation of his on TED and was intrigued with what he had to say. So it's not surprising that I quickly found his in-depth research groundbreaking. Although many aspects of his research are unconsciously a part of our daily lives and are shamefully obvious and even overlooked because of how mundane they are, the way he tied them together and explained his insights were shockingly revealing of how truly predictable and simple we actually are. The book has strong evidence and interesting arguments, but it deserves no more than a healthy skim or light read. However you want to look at it, just read it to at least get the essence from the book and apply it to your actions and decisions in your life! I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!

1400064287|5.0|The exact moment I realized there was something odd about this book was early one morning when I discovered myself in my bathroom, clutching the book in one hand and trying to open my toothpaste with the other. The book was literally sticking to my hand, giving new meaning to the phrase, \\"I just couldn't put it down!\\"    If you are a writer, buy this book.    My own skills as a copy writer have improved dramatically since I read it. And I notice how lousy most writing is, having the lens in place that these guys offer.     So, as they say, \\"run, don't walk... \\" It's that helpful. To writers, that is.

0066620996|4.0|I read this book years ago, actually wrote an Executive Summary of it, and I still find it is helpful in my business life.    The main concept I want to mention in this review is Collins' comment that you have to let go of what made you good if you want to be great. Yikes. Most of us have fear around that, especially in this economy. But, for those of us who DO want to be great - in whatever way - it's a super support to have Collins' book as a guide.    Oh, I just read a new book, actually comes out on July 8 but is available on Amazon already, [[ASIN:0071624570 What's Your Body Telling You? Listening To Your Body's Signals to Stop Anxiety, Erase Self-Doubt and Achieve True Wellness]]. Steve is a buddy of mine, in fact I helped in the early stages of this book. It's also very practical and you get to use your body as a research center.
B000WQWPKA|4.0|Independently Exciting Sci Fi!<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich, who has pumped out exciting sci-fi like Stargate and not so great sci-fi such as 10,000 B.C., combined a 4th of July holiday with an alien invasion story.<br /><br />The plot attempts to gain our sympathy with broken relationships, healing and desire as well as attracting our fanboy side with lots of explosions and air fights.  The aliens themselves are almost inconsequential.<br /><br />The film has plot inaccuracies and just plain silliness: uploading a computer virus to an alien craft that has Windows -- how cool is that? Or an unknown force field technology that somehow shows up on Earth's radar screens.<br /><br />But despite the quibbles on the hackneyed dialogue and inaccurate science, there is a lot to say about Bill Pullman's acting. He is an ineffective president who not only rises to the occasion, but takes command and even goes into battle himself.<br /><br />The drunk test pilot who sacrifices himself and regains his children's respect.<br /><br />The old Black & White Day the Earth Stood Still plays momentarily on a TV screen in homage.<br /><br />It's quite the action fest.<br /><br />Recommended to all Americans.
B0018SWA56|5.0|I have already read her first book and  then I decided to buy \\"Something Blue\\". Two days later I finished it.  I absolutely love Emily Giffon books.  She is an incredible author that always leaves me wanting more of her books.  This book is an easy read that makes you not ever want to put the book down.  I found myself trying to find time to read because I loved the book so much.  I would defiantly read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first and then \\"Something Blue\\" Those are the two of her books that follow the same story line.  I'm now on to ready \\"Baby Proof\\" and \\"Love the one your with\\".  I can't wait for her to come out with her next book in 2010 called \\"Heart of the matter\\".
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I just bought this product from QVC for $27.95 plus shipping as it was on a discounted price, but mine doesn't have the bendable handle. I guess they were coming out with the new model and were trying to get rid of the older model.  I have to say I was expecting this product to be a great disappointed but was pleasantly surprised how well it has worked for me.   I've only had it for about 1-1/2 weeks but I'v been using it daily and the charge usually lasts about 3 cleaning sessions which mainly consists of tile and hardwood floors.   I have a central vac and it's a bit of a chore to haul the hose and all the parts into the house from the garage every day, so this handy tool to have around for intermittent cleaning.  It beats trying to sweep up short dog hairs with a broom and dustpan.  You do have to go slowly over the floors a few times to pick up the small hairs and particles but when I clean out the dust pan, there is definitely a lot of dog hair being picked up.  I also liked the design where the dust pan snaps on and off the bottom.  I had bought the Shark sweeper that was much more expensive from Costco and it worked great for 30 days until the spring on the hands-off dust pan became loose and the lid would no longer stay on the dust pan so all the dirt that was swept up would basically droop off the bottom when I released the dust pan.  Luckily, Costco takes returns with no questions asked.  I actually think the swivel has a better design and the battery is easier to manage because you don't have to wait until the charge is completely gone to recharge it like the Shark sweeper.  I just saw the information on the swivel sweeper for 2 for $39.99 and I'm thinking of getting more of these.  they make great gifts.

I was about to place my order when I thought-hold on-where's the second disc?? There is just so much missing without the second disc and while this cd is great on its own, there are many wonderful tracks that aren't on it.<br />Why can the record labels not get their act together? Still, Van pulls out all the stops here and if you are new to his music, you sure wont be disappointed.

B0011U8NZ2|4.0|The sound quality is top notch - if you turn it up loud and close your eyes,  you'd think you were front row listening to the Doors.  The only thing is that Jim's not too into this one - which loses a star for me.  He finally says something to the crowd right before the end of the show (except for his \\"bird calls\\" earlier in the set - which tends to drag out)<br /><br />I'm not saying it isn't good - it is!  And I'm glad that the surviving Doors have brought these un-cut performances to life.  It's just I have a little issue with the track listings on the back of the CD.  \\"Break On Through\\" clocks in at 54 seconds and \\"Push Push\\" clocks in at 24 seconds - both of these are basically Jim singing a few verses of each near the end of \\"When The Music's Over\\".  It's typical that the Doors label these tracks and do not state the time.  A must for die-hards though... the casual fan may want to check out the edited \\"In Concert\\" or \\"Absolutely Live\\".
0143038583|5.0|I borrowed this book, read many parts of it out loud to my husband, then, at his insistence, bought our own copy so we could have more time with it.  Pollan isn't a hard-driving idealogue, and presents our food choices (and growing choices) as true dilemmas.  He explores how we plant, grow, harvest and eat, and thoroughly inserts himself into all aspects of our food culture.  I learned more than I thought possible from this book, and - as a hobby farmer - will reread it and check out its references for years to come.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|I just couldn't wait to watch it, I don't know, when I saw couple of episodes on TV I was like \\"nothing special\\", but when I decided to give it a shot and start from the beggining....LOL I just fell in love with it. So after 2 seasons I was completly addicted to it. Season 3 is as funny as previous ones, lots of my favourite characters (of course Logan and Veronica:)) I also liked the previev episode of season 4..but I don't know if the season 4 was actually made or if the series was already cancelled:(( What a schame it would be, really great thing to watch:))  I enjoy getting new dvd's to my collection like Veronica enjoys the thought about getting a PONY:)))I think this caracter is very funny-I WONT MORE VERONICA MARS PLEASE !!!!

B00186K7EE|3.0|Until someone, associated with the marketing of his products gets some common sense and decides to re-release a remastered version of this DVD, just you tube it for now.  It has some great rare stuff on it (some definitely cheesy).  I'd buy an \\"official\\" version, but something leads me to think that none of the copies available here are \\"official.\\"  If there is a VHS version out there, I would consider buying that at a $10 price or lower.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|This set contains parts 1 & 2 in slimcase design, a feature I like because they're space savers.   I remember going to see the first \\"Ghostbusters\\" & flipping for it (I went to the theatre FOUR times!). This \\"special effects\\" comedy was really something else, and it still holds up pretty well today (who can forget one of the great movie sight gags involving a giant Staypuft Marshmallow Man??).  It had a funny & loose script, terrific special FX, a great cast (even Sigourney Weaver showed she had a flair for comedy) and a good director at the helm (Ivan Reitman, who previously worked with Murray & Ramis on \\"Stripes\\"). All you have to do is watch it again to figure out why GB became the biggest grossing comedy of all time (that is, until \\"Home Alone\\" ousted it from its throne).   GB2 came close but failed to top the original. Picking up five years later, weird supernatural occurrences (which seem to involve Dana Barrett's baby) prompt her to seek out the guys (who are now poor after New York City sued the GBs for damages from their previous film) for help. After narrowly escaping a \\"hangman's trial\\" by a ruthless judge by battling some pesky spirits (whom the judge had given the chair earlier), the boys are back in business. There are some good comedy scenes here, such as the \\"river of slime\\", the Titanic finally \\"arriving\\", and the \\"calvary\\" in the form of a slime-powered Statue of Liberty. Winston's (Ernie Hudson) role is expanded in this one, and look out for the actor who nearly steals the picture as the nerdy foreigner whose services are used by the creepy villain Viggo.   The remasters are nicely done, and the booklet of information behind the making of the GB duo is a fun read. A \\"making of\\" featurette on the original is among the DVD extras, along with two episodes from the animated series.

Cheers for a good sophmore album, but \\"Marla\\", \\"Little Brother\\", \\"Lullabye\\", and \\"On a neck, on a spit\\" outdo anything on this album.  Absolutely no contest.      Yellow House is life-changing.  Veckatimest just confirms that a life has been changed.
0671449028|5.0|this is the first book I bought by Sandra Boynton, and I was hooked. Not only did my son enjoy her books even as a baby, but I really love reading her books to him.<br />This book is just so silly, catchy and fun to read, much like all her books.
0316168815|4.0|The Lovely Bones is one of those books it seems like everyone but me read years ago, and I'm glad I finally got around to it. It's not the only book I've ever read to be narrated by a character already dead, but this story, of a family dealing with the loss of a daughter raped and murdered at 14, is a rich one, and unique enough to be unpredictable. The characters are quite well-drawn, and Sebold resists the urge to tie off all loose ends.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book has a few weaknesses, particularly toward the end. Like many other reviewers, I found Susie's return from the dead to be ridiculous and a terrible choice on many levels, the most important being that it is completely out of place in a book that is otherwise realistic (well, it's being narrated from heaven of course, but as long as Susie can't actually contact the living, who can say whether that's realistic or not?). And a few of the characters, particularly Ruth and Ray, who are not family members, seemed more profoundly impacted by Susie's death in the long run than is altogether believable. Still, if you'd like a good family drama, you could do far worse than pick this one up.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I loved this movie to the point that I've seen it a dozen times and probably will see it a dozen more. It is definitely a \\"Chick Flix\\" so guys beware!

1439157383|3.0|Ambitiously plotted, Picoult writes this story from the first person point of view of seven different characters and pulls it off well. The book is a tear-jerker - she takes you deep into the heart of watching a child or sibling suffer with catastrophic illness, and the confusion of seemingly impossible choices. It's compelling and you ache deeply for the characters even as you confront your own fear that this too, could happen to your family. There is one aspect though that I feel Picoult didn't create enough space for the characters to grapple with - the existential questions about God and life and the hereafter that are almost inevitably raised by such tragedy. Apart from some musing about fairness and fate, those questions almost entirely missing from the story, and I think it robs the story of one extra level of depth. (Lisa McKay, Author of [[ASIN:0802489826 My Hands Came Away Red]])
0156027321|4.0|I passed this book by for years (I think it came out in 2002), because the description on the jacket didn't interest me. But, as it turned out, the story of a zookeeper and his family becomes a Story (with a capital \\"S\\") not just an interesting tale of a boy who negotiates life on a boat with a tiger, or a book in defense of zoos.  Since it's hard to do the book justice without including a few spoilers, suffice it to say that the novel is more than meets the eye, asking a few enduring questions about the extent to which personal reality is to some extent fiction, since our own imagination plays a role in how we interpret the events in our lives.  Do we prefer an interpretation that is \\"dry, yeastless, factuality\\" or one that is life-affirming, finding purpose and a higher order, even in the most hostile of circumstances? It also asks one of the most decisive questions for each of us: Are we related to the infinite or not?
B00005N5S5|3.0|The DVD is new but it's not special edition, therefore it's falls advertising. Hope this review helps everyone.
B000002549|5.0|I admittedly had my doubts before coming into this album. I had wondered if Barbra's voice was capable of handling classical material written for classically-trained vocalists, but as she so often did in the early-mid 70's Barbra took this material and made it her own. Her voice is angelic, soothing, and the arrangements are simply gorgeous.<br /><br />Excellent album. One of her very best achievements.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|The DVD looks clean and it seems there are some additional scenes I don't remember seeing....well either way the DVD was brand new as advertised.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Black Sabbath is best with Ozzy as the front man, but what are they to do when Ozzy thumbs his nose at them?  Without Ozzy, Bill Ward won't participate either, and that's unfortunate, also.  Tony and Geezer's only options are to go back to solo CDs or go with the second incarnation in the band's history as Black Sabbath.      As for their solo efforts, I actually like Tony AND Geezer's solo albums better than Ozzy's, but that's another discussion.  At this time, they chose to go the route of Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules, and Dehumanizer, all three of which were stellar albums.  And now, renaming themselves Heaven and Hell, they added The Devil You Know to that list.    Renaming the band Heaven and Hell really was the the right thing to do, since I agree with Ozzy that the group name, Black Sabbath, should be reserved for the original Fab Four.    But none of that matters once the music is playing.  The tracks are instant classics.  Maybe not along the lines of Iron Man, Paranoid, Sweet Leaf, and Snowblind, but certainly up there with Die Young, Slipping Away, and Sins of the Father.  Indeed, I was hoping for and would have preferred another Fab Four CD, but when Ozzy snubbed them, I was happy that Dio didn't.    My favorite songs on the CD include Double the Pain, Bible Black, and Eating the Cannibals, but all ten tracks can be rated as excellent.  If you appreciated the Dio years, then you will not be disappointed with this new music.  I wasn't, and I am grateful Dio, unlike Ozzy, was willing to come aboard.     Here is to hoping, Ozzy and Tony can get along again instead of going back to their feuding ways and FINALLY make a new studio CD with the original Fabulous Foursome:  Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill.  But in the meantime, it's great that Tony and Geezer aren't wasting their time waiting for it to happen.

B001CDLATE|5.0|Ron Fricke was the cinematographer on \\"Koyanniqatsi,\\" a ground-breaking non-narrative documentary. \\"Baraka\\" follows the general idea, being a film that eschews narration or story but bombards the viewer with thought-provoking visuals and sounds from our world. Technically, this Blu-ray disc is one of the finest I've seen. The 2.20:1 image is overflowing with fine detail and breathtaking colour. The  dts HD Master Audio soundtrack is equally impressive. This truly is a reference-quality disc that showcases a magnificent film - what more could you ask for?
1439138311|5.0|So far, this is the best book I have read this year. The beautiful prose takes you into the mind of a young Irish girl who imigrates to Brooklyn in the 1950's so that you almost feel like you are Eilis herself. You could say that it's a small book in its focus, and by that I mean that the story involves the way Eilis makes her way and finds herself in Brooklyn, but on a larger scale the book looks at what the definitions of home and identity are. Even though the action is quiet and personal, the book had me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't put it down. I feel like I will be thinking of Eilis and Brooklyn for a long time to come.
B001ECQ6E2|4.0|Quo Vadis is a rollicking sword & sandals epic from 1951, complete with campy performances, huge crowd scenes and pious moralizing. It's great fun, and is brought to Blu-ray in a beautiful restored transfer. Kudos to Warner Bros. for providing the original mono soundtrack and not a souped-up 5.1 version; the sound is actually very good for the film's age, and highlights Miklos Rosza's beautiful score.
B001FB4W16|5.0|love this show...love the blu ray...i can watch this series again and again.. worth owning
B000MCIBE8|3.0|As one who did not listen to the un-re-mastered original, I am stuck reviewing this album as is.  There is a certain cleanliness to the recording that almost bored me.  My favorite song, \\"The End,\\" is nearly perfect, but in an unsatisfying way.  Only Jim Morrison's screams resist the digital wand.  I don't know why this album was remixed or why anyone would waste their time doing such a thing, but the normalized quality to the sound simply didn't work for me.  Morrison is too often drowned out by the rest of the band.  This could not have been how the music was intended to sound.    One of my favorite albums of the late 1960s, Safe as Milk by Captain Beefheart, is clearly left to its analog self.  The left and right channels pan sharply, the guitar is often tinny and weak, the bass and drums pound too hard, and it's all as it should be within the scope of the available technology.    I cannot recommend this version of this classic album.  I will likely seek out the original recording sometime soon.

0143038419|5.0|I simply can't understand why anyone would ever give this book less than a 5 review.      Perfectly written, it truly expresses the inner world of so many women - the self talk, the uncertainties, the need for inner peace and love.      Personally, I could relate to Gilbert's experiences on so many levels.  I, too, have been through a divorce, and had trouble coming out the other side.  I, too, have been searching for that inner peace and self-love but have been hampered by negative self talk.  I, too, love to eat pasta!!  ;-)    I would however like to counteract something someone else mentioned in their review - I think to have introduced the molestation accusations about Gilbert's Guru would have clouded her novel, which is, after all, a novel, and only semi-autobiographical - it is fictional in part.  I think to have taken such artistic license with this issue was perfectly understandable, though a footnote or something might have been appropriate mentioning this fact.    This book uplifted my soul, made me promise myself to focus more on my own self-exploration and meditation, both of which I have neglected for the few years since the births of my children, and gave me the courage of my convictions that there is more to life than just the here and now and that love is the answer to all questions.    Thank you Elizabeth.. I am now going to read all your other books!
B0027WNRIG|5.0|I have loved this album (and Def Leppard) for 26 years and the only complaint I ever had about it was that the sound quality sounded kind of \\"tinny\\"...sigh!..But now, after this many years of dreaming, Def Leppard have been kind enough to remaster Pyromania...the Rock and Roll \\"Gold Standard\\"....The sound quality is superb and I am having a grand time picking up things that Steve,Rick,Sav,Phil and Joe did, but I had missed...I LOVE IT!!! I can't wait for High N Dry and On Through the Night to get remasterd...please?    Now, for the second cd, the \\"live\\" show from LA in 1983....OH GOD!! WOW!!!  This cd kicks some very serious butt...The energy from the band is outstanding...Steve and Phil and their double barreled guitars blew me away...and Rick and Sav are a tight knit duo also, like thunder and lightning...Joe's energy also is dynamic, and he sounds as good as ever...Songs to REALLY listen to? SWITCH 625, FOOLIN', ANOTHER HIT AND RUN, ROCK BRIGADE and BRINGIN' ON THE HEARTBREAK...Oh my God! I've never heard them sound better! The entire show is fantastic...If you read this review and you like Def Leppard....you won't be sorry for buying this \\"Deluxe\\" Edition of Pyromania! I'm happy I did!!!!! Thank you!
B000286RNY|5.0|With an English language version, or the original Chinese with English subtitles, you can watch it in the manner you prefer.

B00003CXA6|3.0|I just finished watching this movie for the third time since its release. I still  haven't found Ted Turner in the ranks of Confederates but Alfred Hitchcock look-a-likes abounded. I don't think there were very many Civil War troops who were candidates for lap band surgery.    On the bright side, this is a story that needed telling but four hours worth? Turner's bias shows  in portraying the Confederates as noble defenders of liberty with strong  personalities. Union troops were mere androids (Chamberlain's 20th Maine the exception). Kudos to Jeff Daniels for a fine job portraying Col. Chamberlain. Cut the campfire prattle and the remaining 2 1/2 hours would be a pretty good and accurate film.    In September, I'll be in Gettysburg for my fifth visit. I make a point  of  paying respects to those buried there - especially the unknowns. This time, I think I'll add an apology for the shoddy treatment of Union soldiers by Mr. Fonda.
630460291X|5.0|This is a great movie, Kevin Costner does a great job. Like most of his movies, it has action, drama, comedy, and romance all in one.
B00288KNLS|3.0|This movie is overrated. It is not very original. I don't know why people keep saying it is. Tell me, what exactly is original about it?     It is basically another Alice in Wonderland story. James and the Giant Peach is similar but much more creative. Pan's Labyrinth was also similar (Alice in Wonderland) but was 100 times better.. Even MirrorMask was better.    The gimmicky 3D visuals in Coraline were nice but if you take them away you are left with a mediocre film with a boring, cliche plot that is barely worth watching. Eye candy doesn't make up for lack of character development, lack of any theme or purpose, lack of depth, substance, soul, or humanity.    Watch Pan's Labyrinth then watch Coraline and you will understand what I mean.

0141023465|4.0|The most amazing thing about this book is the author - who died before the book was published.

Each character is someone I grew to love.  You really feel at home with this book.<br />3. You will learn more about WWII and the lives of those who lived through the ghastliness of war.<br />4. It's a book that you can safely (no, eagerly) recommend to your mother-in-law and maybe even get credit for having done something right.<br />5. Number 4 alone should be enough...<br /><br />Happy reading....it's a real joy.
B001YAG5DQ|5.0|This record has 4.5 stars average now, and would probably be 5 star, except for the fact someone flew off the handle and compared this to Britney Spears.  Ummm, yeah.    I have heard very few albums with as drumming and percussion (not to mention different kinds of drums), that goes along so well with the singer (in this case a very talented female).    I thought zero songs were boring.  None at all.  There is no heavy guitar on the record.    I heard Kate Bush, and shades of Massive Attack's Mezzanine record here.    Any fans of alternative music, and/or Kate Bush or Tori Amos check this out.  Anyone who lieks a rich blend of many different instruments, check it out too!    I'll leave a track-by-track description for others with a bit more time on their hands.    Very glad Gary from Snow Patrol recommended this!    Also, I understand Thom Yorke from Radiohead highly recommended this record.

B0007TKNKG|4.0|OVER THE TOP    There have been many movies about sports but I don't know of to many about arm wrestling, this one is. This is your classic 80's movie with an over the top [meant to say that] pop rock soundtrack and cheesy lines, man I love em. Also this is your typical Sly Stallone film with an inspirational message and all about over coming the odds. I know what you are thinking that is every Sly flick, but hey it is Sly. When we watched this again the other night after many years we called every thing in the film, all things 80's that is.     The film follows Lincoln Hawk [Sly] has he is on a mission to make amends with the son he left behind many moons ago. The boy's mother is on her death bed and wants him to get to know his son before she goes. Of course the kid wants nothing to do with his estranged father and tries at all costs to get away. But as their journey counties he begins to get along with him that is until his mother dies before they get to see her. So they drift apart once more as the boy's grandfather has hired people to get the boy back with him. On top of all that Sly needs to win an arm wrestling tournament to get some money to buy his own rig.    Sly is Sly and acts as such which for this type of movie is great, don't see how you could go wrong with the Sly. Robert Loggia is great as the grandfather in the way of the father and son, he does an excellent job. Susan Blakely is great for the small amount of time she is on screen but unfortunately her character dies but that kick starts the movie kinda. David Mendenhall is surprisingly good in this film since most child actors are not all that great and of course Terry Funk is always fun no matter what.    Director Menahem Golan does a great job I think with an arm wrestling movie even if it is \\"over the top\\"; sorry I had to say that again. The four writers for the film including Sly himself make things interesting but it is your typical 80's action b dialogue, got to love it. Still this is a verypredictable film as any one who remembers anything from the 80's can call everything in this without having seen it before. The first thing I said when we started this was that there had to be a song that actually uses \\"over the top\\" as lyrics in the chorus, yup there it is in the end. The first thing my brother called was that at some point the title of the film would be used as lines in the film, yep there they are.     This is a fun \\"over the top\\" 80's type flick that any Sly fan will enjoy, plus it has Terry Funk in it man. How could anything with the Funker in it be bad, I can't think of any. This is a fun weekend flick and pretty much a rental unless you want the Sly collection; I got it cheap so it was cool.
0131479415|5.0|This book has very good explanations and examples about how to bridge the gap between classic project management and agile project management. For those of us project managers that have few experience managing teams and projects in the agile way, I consider this is a must read book. Most of the books are very focused at the agile practices, and how the team should apply these new practices, but don't address issues very important like budgeting, top management reporting, etc. that seem to be at odds with the agile software development. But Mike has found a way to bridge both worlds, giving you tools to keep track of your projects and be able to communicate status to top management in an effective way.    I have not tried all his recommendations yet, but the ones I have already tried are working as expected.    Definitely it is an excellent book for project managers that are used to manage projects in the classic way and are facing the challenge of change their mindset to the agile way.
0061122416|4.0|Yes, yes, yes, we all know that what we're looking for is looking for us and it's always where we are so when the book ended exactly that way I felt a little let down. It had been such a lovely dreamy fanciful journey that the ending was altogher too anti-climatic to make me happy. But like a life well lived, the best part being the journey itself, the best part of the book was the reading of it. I believed in omens before reading the book and I still believe in omens and felt that Coelho did a great job writing about such a subtle subject.I gave it four stars for the simple direct uncomplicated unpretencious thought provoking writing. Except for the ending, it was an altogether enjoyable read.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I loved this book alot. It's about Percy Jackson a demigod  the son of one of the three most powerful Greek God, Poisoden (I don't think I spelled it right.) This time Percy and Annebeth another demigod, Grover a satyr, and Tyson a cyclops must venture into the labyrinth created by the amazing inventor Dadaleus (I don't think i spelled this one right too.) Will they survive in this mind twisting maze read the book to find out.

0385341008|3.0|I have the same problem with \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" as I do with movies that everybody goes to see and tells you are the \\"greatest ever.\\" By the time you get to the theater belatedly, not even \\"Gone With the Wind\\" or \\"Casablanca\\" would be able to meet your expectations.<br />  So, it is with me and this book. Everybody was reading it before me, and raving about it, everybody was telling me it was \\"just the best.\\"<br />  Well, right before I picked this book up, I read \\"The Book Thief\\" (which I personally think is \\"just the best\\") and I read \\"What is the What?\\" about the Lost Boys of the Sudan, and then I (belatedly) caught up with Toni Morrison's classic \\"Beloved,\\" which did live up to all the hype I've heard over these many years. So \\"Guernsey,\\" for me, was a very pleasant read, but it paled in comparison to the three other books I'd just read. I found the other three haunted me for their treatment of serious issues and horrific times. \\"Guernsey\\" deals with World War II and its aftermath, but in a much lighter tone. I did learn about the occupation of the Channel Islands during the war, a matter which had somehow never really registered with me. I always appreciate reading books about how war and the decisions of leaders end up affecting so many innocent people. (Corelli's Mandolin, War and Peace, Cold Mountain, A Very Long Engagement, A Widow of the South...I could list these books all day...)<br />  As with most things in life, I now find myself running across references to Guernsey--an introduction I read to \\"Les Miserables\\" points out in the first paragraph that Victor Hugo wrote it while in exile there, and when I skimmed the book jacket of an Elizabeth George mystery, it mentioned that the action takes place on that island. I will now be especially attuned to any reference to the Channel Islands.<br />  One thing I did like is the letter format. It reminded me of \\"84 Charing Cross,\\" which is a favorite book of mine, and a far better one about books and the post war period in Britain. \\"Guernsey's\\" characters are interesting enough, but not deeply enough drawn, and you can see the foreshadowing from miles away as far as the \\"plot.\\" Still, I would recommend it, as a really nice summer read, and because I appreciate the fact that one of the authors (Mary Ann Shaffer) fulfilled a lifelong ambition to write a book before she died. I think that should be an inspiration to all of us would-be anythings--it's never too late.bout books and the post war period in Britain. \\"Guernsey's\\" characters are interesting enough, but not deeply enough drawn, and you can see the foreshadowing from miles away as far as the \\"plot.\\" Still, I would recommend it, as a really nice summer read, and because I appreciate the fact that one of the authors (Mary Ann Shaffer) fulfilled a lifelong ambition to write a book before she died.

B000050HTO|4.0|This guy was a legend in the 60s and he is still working today! I liked some of his songs then, and I love the songs on this set even more now. My only disappointment is the set doesn't have \\"Talking WWIII Blues\\" so now I'll have to get an album with that song on it.
B00004U8P9|5.0|What more can be said?  This is the quintessential cult classic and I've watched it dozens of times.  The voice overs are a little dated in some places, but the music, the campiness and the youth of its stars will live on forever and I'm glad that while I can't recapture youth, I can always throw this DVD in the machine and \\"Do the Time Warp Again\\".  A must for any serious musical movie collector.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|I bought this album right when it came out and Just Dance was making a slash on the radio.  I know from the moment I heard Just Dance that I had to have her album.  I usually dont buy the album from a new artist after hearing their debut single, but I'm glad I did.  This album is amazing from top to bottom!  Just Dance, LoveGame, Poker Face, The Fame, Starstruck, Boys Boys Boys, Paper Gangsta, I Like It Rough, all of those are easily top 10 hits on Billboard..... dont waste another minute, download the best album of the year right now!!!!

B000FBFN0Q|2.0|After so much hype I was really disappointed in this book.  It had some entertaining parts, but the main character was so self absorbed and immature I found her more annoying than likeable. Even the relationship between her and Luke was based on nothing, her attraction was his money, but really what did he see in her except possibly the attractive package.
B001NFNFF8|5.0|I have been waiting for another James Lee Burke book made into a movie. Alex Baldwin made one but none since. I am very happy Tommy Lee Jones took this project. I hope Jones continues with succeeding movies of Burke books. I think James Lee Burke rates right up there with Ernest Hemingway. The movie was first class and done in the local of all the Burke books.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michaels delivered a great workout DVD with the 30 Day Shred program.  I didn't have any trouble picking up the moves like is common with other workout DVDs.  There are three individual levels with this program and you are supposed to spend a few weeks on each level.  Naturally, each level is a bit tougher than the one before.  Jillian uses a combination of 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs in each section, with three sections in each workout. Each workout begins and ends with a cool down.  Even though the workouts are simple to follow you still get a great workout.  After several weeks of doing the workouts I could really tell a difference in my strength and endurance levels.  Jillian also provides good advice and encouragement throughout the workout.      Only suggestion is to make sure you're committed to doing the program as suggested.  Since you will be doing the same level for a few weeks at a time it can get a bit repetitive.  If you stick with it and workout hard you'll see the results.      One complaint about this program is that Jillian tells you to use the DVD every day and everything I've ever seen says that you shouldn't do strength training on back to back days because strength training creates tiny tears in your muscle (which is what builds muscle) and those need a bit of time to repair before going at it again or you won't see the results you want.  I'm certainly not a fitness expert, so I'm not sure how that applies here.
B0028T6XXY|5.0|We've had the chance to see Michael live twice. He is, hands down, the best entertainer alive. This set is not the full concert; which I would be surprised if he ever released--why would he take from his live performances still \\"early\\" in his career? The DVD does a great job at giving a little extra background to Buble's life and set-up for a concert. He adds his witty charm and humor throughout the film. The DVD is more of a documentry of Michael, about 50% interview, 50% Madison Square Gardens concert.    If you are a fan of Buble, and again, if you have seen him live, you will truly enjoy this set as we did.

Refugees must take a long and torturers rout Through Casa Blanca on their way to America; there \\"Everybody comes to Rick's.\\"  Rick's is a nightclub and a way station for a chance to get to America. Rick is played by Humphrey Bogart.<br /><br />Here we also stay for a while to watch a drama unfold. There are overlapping stories. One of a young couple trying to get to America and the girl wondering if a girl should have to do something naughty was wondering what would happen if her husband, \\"a boy in many ways\\", would find out? A second rate crook (Peter Lorre) obtains something of value at the expense of two German curriers. A Police Captain (Claude Rains) is shocked to find there is gambling going on at Rick's as he stuffs his pocket with his gambling earnings. Many other stories surround the main theme of a love triangle that started in Paris and now can mean so much to individuals or the effort for freedom.<br /><br />Will the Nazi's win their prize?<br />Will Capt. Renault get the young girl?<br />Will Rick get away with Ilsa?<br /><br />This film has become quite a classic. There are many quotes and misquotes attributed to the film. You will find your self kibitzing.

B001FBSMF8|4.0|This is my first internet review of anything, ever, but I feel compelled to write something.  Some background: I have a deep appreciation for Timbaland as a producer, and an even deeper appreciation for Chris Cornell as a vocalist.  That voice could melt steel!  I wanted very much for this collaboration to work, and it is certainly an enjoyable CD.  I give it 4 stars.  If you know what to expect from Timbaland as a producer (and appreciate it), are willing to give Chris Cornell some leeway, and can listen with an open mind, then you will like it.  Why not 5 stars?  Chris Cornell's voice is better served by less, not more, production.  As enjoyable as this CD is, it's not the best showcase for his voice.  He needs to do a stripped down album of acoustic stuff, a la his track \\"Seasons\\" on the soundtrack from the movie Singles.  Oh, and if only he would do a cover version of \\"American Woman\\"....
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I love Smallville and have watched it from the beginning.  I think season 8 was outstanding.  I was happy to see Lana go but sad about Lex leaving.  I loved the whole Doomsday story and actually cried when I thought he died (even though I knew they couldn't kill him off for real).  Alot of people are trashing this season but I don't understand why.  It was alot of fun and very exciting.  I hope they renew it for a 10th season.  I think people are comparing the series too much to the comics.  So what if it doesn't follow the Superman story?  It's supposed to be fun and entertaining and that's what it is.  I liked when they brought Supergirl into the picture. She was great and was a neat twist to the show.  I hope they bring her back for a guest appearance during the final season (which hopefully won't be until season 10 at least!!)    Anyway, Smallville is the only show I watch faithfully.  The last series I watched was Buffy the Vampire Slayer so once Smallville is gone I will just have my DVDs....  I can't wait for season 9!!!!
031606792X|4.0|I enjoyed the entire \\"Twilight\\" series.  While Meyers doesn't have the wrap-up skill of JK Rowlings (I figured out the ending of the 4th book after reading the third) the book was entertaining and managed to hold my attention completely.  I've read each of them twice, due to my terrible habit of speed reading on a first go-through, and found them to be quite engaging.  The characters are consistent:  no out-of-character freakouts or personality change.  I recommend the entire series to anyone who wants to escape from the mundane and let your imagination soar.

B0026OE2O8|5.0|If you thought \\"Planet Earth\\" looked good on Blu, well.... this is probably TWICE as good. I'm not kidding -- the imagery and high-def-juicyness are out of control on this movie. For 2 hours I sat there, jaw on the floor, finally realizing Blu-Ray's potential in all of its glory.  If you have a decent TV and a Blu-Ray player, you MUST MUST MUST own this movie.  The stunning cinematography will BLOW. YOUR. MInD.
076790592X|5.0|Maybe I am just getting sentimental in my old age but I am beginning to love these \\"death with dignity\\" stories, I hope that does not make me some kind of ghoul.      When I first listened to this book I just thought that it would answer a few questions about how to die with pride but I also found that for a book that is so short it manages to teach you a lot of things about how to live your life.  The simple platitudes that we hear every day like \\"you should value you're family\\" and \\"money isn't important\\" take on a whole new meaning when one is dying.      Overall-When it comes time for me to meet my end I hope I manage to do it with half as much guts and honesty as this old professor.

0316017922|5.0|I might be a bit biased since I do like Malcolm Gladwell's book, but this seem to be his best so far. The stories and research expose new ways of thinking about success and failure. Practice  does seem to be more important than talent. A focus on learning year round does explain the success of some children and the failure of others.<br /><br />The answers might see to be common sense in nature, but they do expose elements that are seldom considered. This is a fun and informative read.<br /><br />Elisa Robyn, author of Pirate Wisdom
0143038583|5.0|This book is wonderful.  It is an investigative masterpiece on the agricultural and food industries.  Pollan provides us with a view of those worlds that we are rarely exposed to, yet we all should see.   He begins by following a corn seed from its planting to its final destination in a fast food meal.  Secondly, he looks at the world of organic food, free range food, and all natural foods.  We learn that we should not trust food labels, but we also learn a lot about the philosophy of agriculture and how we are all linked in a circle of life where you cannot change one link without affecting all the others.  Lastly, Pollan comes to grips with the responsibility of eating and shows the reader that we need to think more about the food we eat, the way we eat it, and the consequences of the whole process.  This was a unique and excellent book, I recommend it to all my friends.  We need to take the power back as individuals and demand that we know what we are consuming, instead of letting industry blindly poison us for the sake of making the almighty dollar.

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I admit I was among those skeptical upon hearing about the return of Donna Noble.  And, as usual, the wonderful writing of Russel T. Davies and company dispelled my worries immediately.  The dynamic between Donna and the Doctor is a fresh change from the previous two companions and more often than not hilarious.  This series is full of oddities and unanswered questions, particularly The Doctor's Daughter, Midnight, and Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead, but that's far from a detraction.  If anything, these episodes are the spice that keeps the show from ever growing stale.  Conversely, the end of this series is redoubtably one of the high points of the entire show thus far, culminating in a climax that encompasses characters from the first three seasons and even the Doctor Who Spin-offs.  If nothing else, this season is worth it for the finale.
031606792X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these four books and BD was a great end to a great set!  I do think it leaves a lot of possibilities of more stories for all the characters that Meyers created with this series.  I hope she does more....it truly is a different twist on an old subject that has been around for ages!!
0553381687|5.0|After over 1,500 reviews, I cannot say much more than what has already been said about this novel. However, I felt compelled to do a review as I believe it to be one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones does not rely on elves, halflings, orcs, or goblins- in fact you will not find any of those common fantasy creatures here. instead, it creates compelling characters with detailed backgrounds that are given their own chapters to tell their story. You will have to use the appendix in the back of the book to get all of the houses and characters sorted out. Once you do, however, you will realize that there are a \\"core\\" group of characters whose names come up again and again and the story revolves around them. After 80-100 pages you will no longer need to use it. (Mind you the book is over 800 pages long!)<br />This book weaves a tale that is epic fantasy to rival that of even Tolkkien. It also contains other elements that blend in so smoothly you won't even realize you are also reading a story of romance, history, coming-of-age, sorrow, war, and mystery.<br />In my opinion, you know it is a good book when you find yourself actually yelling out loud at times! I cannot say that any other book has provoked that reaction from me (and I have read hundreds) There were two scenes specifically that brought that about, but won't spoil it for any potential readers out there!<br /><br />So overall, a powerful novel that weaves a tale unlike any other. A plot that will keep you guessing and wanting more. Although it is over 800 pages, it flies by because the characters propel the plot forward full speed. Once you get past all of the names, houses, and locations, you will find yourself immersed in a world that is a true delight to discover. If you even remotely enjoy fantasy novels, this book is definitely for you. You won't regret the purchase. Happy reading!

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|Suffice it to say, this is how this film should've been all along.  The story has been made more coherent and appealing.  The original film did little justice to the characters of the legendary FFVII, wherease this one successful tethers them emotionally to the audience.  For more depth, see any of the other reviews on this site.  If you weren't satisfied with the original release of Advent Children, this completed film is worth a second chance.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|At 60 I lived through both Clapton & Winwood's careers. I met Van & played with him at his house upstate New York and saw them both multiple times during their careers. Eric mentored Steve on guitar as Steve stepped away from his B3.  The two were destined to be & MSG was a proving ground for him.  Together is where they were meant to be and they compliment each other so well. Steve looks at Eric as a younger brother would, smiling at Eric during the show and you can see he is in awe at Eric's handiwork. They blend together so well.  If you like both of their discographies then you will love the DVD. Van hasn't changed vocally and will not disappoint. It' a fine collaboration and at Eric during two hour concert you'll love.
B000JLSM00|5.0|I won't review the movie itself, because plenty of other people have already done so. I'm just here to say that the Blu-Ray transfer is amazing. For a movie made over 50 years ago, it has and will probably never look better. And for $8, it is a steal. It's great for showing off what Blu-Ray can really do for an older film. For such an incredibly low price, lower than the standard DVD, I can't think of any reason for you not to buy this movie...unless you just don't like the movie itself...

The Doomsday Key is one of his best ever.  I found myself immersed in the story and involved with all of the characters.  The reader is also excellent, which can make or break an audio book.<br /><br />If you are looking for a thrill ride, this is the book for you.  It is Action packed, and you don't want to stop listening.

Apparently on the DVD of The State (another MTV show) there is an ad promoting Daria coming to DVD in 2010.   courtesy of tvshowsondvd    I can't wait!  I love this show.  It's smart, funny, EDGY, addresses and laughs at so much teenage angst.
0689878451|5.0|I am a teacher, and had ordered this item to create a lesson for my middle-schoolers about finding many sources of information before reaching conclusions.  We looked at a decision by a district in California to use this book as part of their anti-harassment curriculum. We examined news stories, editorials, the school district's website information page, and finally, the book itself. The story is sweet, and, I believe, portrays non-traditional families in a way that is healthy and appropriate for primary-level children, because it doesn't discuss sexuality; the focus is on families.  The fact that it is based upon a true story lends credence to the message: that families with two daddies can raise a happy child, just like families with a daddy and a mommy.  I have now shared the book with my daughter, to read to her son, who is a toddler.  I recommend it!
B001Q8MMGU|5.0|I urge anyone who hasn't seen this movie to watch it! This movie is all kinds of stuff all in one movie, romance, drama, action, violence (not too much), just a little of everything. I think once you watch it, you will agree that we all need a Maude in our lives. She lives every single minute to the fullest. It is a hard movie to describe because the words in explaining it cause people to be judgemental. Her Love Of Life is contagious! She teaches others to live. This is a bitersweet movie. Before, when someone would ask me my all time favorite movie, it was \\"Somewhere In Time\\" with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymore, and it is a wonderful movie, but now my all time favorite is Harold and Maude. I got it on amazon used for less than 4 bucks! Can't beat that! You know, usually the book is better than the movie, but that isn't so in this movie. The movie is wayyyy better than the book. I hope you all watch it. I actually first watched it online. I don't know how I did it, it didn't cost me anything, but I can't figure out how I did it. I am so glad I did though. Now I own it and probably have watched it 4 times. It's one of those movies that get better when you watch them the second time because you catch things that you missed before. I would LOVE to know how you all feel about the movie if you watch it. You can send me email at itsmerg58@aol.com
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I liked this series. It was a little nerdy at points and the author has a weird style of writing. The story was good though. There was no fluff and all action. The story does not end at the end of this book so plan on getting the last one, too.
B000FA57NK|1.0|Item arrived with NO DVD.  I needed this to teach a college course and I had to pay for premium shipping for the replacement DVD which is not HD.  Very disappointed in the deal.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout to throw in with your routine on the days when you don't have as much time.  It's three 20 minute workouts that get progressively harder.  Each one is definitely a workout in itself but I never feel like 20 minutes is enough so I do at least two of them.  I feel like she works the entire body in each one and you will be winded and sweaty after only one!
B000002LSV|1.0|item as not yet arrived, seller has shipped 2nd copy on 7/27/09, waiting on arrival
1416914307|4.0|I liked this series. In this book some of the romantic pairs are a little awkward but it works out in the end. Otherwise it was a pretty good series. The action never ends. I liked this book and the story but the writer's style could improve. Still worth reading. Recommended if you read the first two... and yes it finally ends after this one. It doesn't leave you hanging like the others.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Unbelievable, fantastic, best movie of 2008.  WALL-E provides non-stop entertainment with the right touch of sentimentality.
0515142247|5.0|People always ask me for a good book for a guy.  They know most men are not readers prefering something more movement oriented.  However, in this great book they is so much nonstop action carried out for the good, that as you read along, your heart is racing to keep pace with the story.  The female lead is smart, skilled and the tiny romance is handled well.  Most of all, back in the good \\"Tom Clancy\\" days there was so much detailed information that you knew at least half of it was true.  Same sense here.  Tremendous examples of the usefulness of basic math skills, recognition that something--even if it's terrible--can be learned from books as well as a thread of connection for the lead character with the beauty of classic American Blues.  Just couldn't be better.
0792164903|4.0|From the costumes to the scenery, just a very eye pleasing beautiful movie. Walken alone is unnerving enough as the headless horseman to carry the whole movie creepiness level up to a 10 even if it is in the last part of the film.<br /><br />A joy to watch.
B00005QCVT|5.0|I have watched this movie many times and never tire of it. There is only two movies that I can say \\"PERFECT\\" #1 Blade Runner #2 Requiem For A Dream. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a huge treat. Not for kids at all.
B00007KQKM|5.0|Sean Bean and animal magnetism go together like peanut butter and jelly... Put the actor in a film based on a novel that until 1960's was considered a \\"shortcut to Hell\\" and was illegal to print and/or read, and you are bound to come up with an interesting result...<br /><br />Most of us know the basic story: Constance is married to Lord Chatterley, an impotent paraplegic and a WWI hero. They used to be intelectually compatible... but, is that enough to allow Constance to silence her young body and live out the rest of her life entombed in the Challerley mansion? Can Lord Chatterley combat his jealousy in order to fulfill his desire for an heir? Well, enter Mellors, the gamekeeper...<br /><br />While young Sean Bean and Joely Richardson (lately of the \\"Nip and Tuck\\" fame) create great sexual chemistry on screen, their innocence and a degree of naivete prevent this adaptation from turning into a sordid tale of an affair. Yes, the writing and the direction are a bit choppey and do not raise to the same level of mastery as the novel. Yes, you do wish the director would have abandoned his desire to act (he cast himself as Constance's father). Still, the charisma of the two leads makes this adaptation a fantastic watch and a great companion to the book. And just like the leads in real life, the series has aged well and remains relevant to a 21st century viewer. Ejoy!<br /><br />PS: The set contains an interesting \\"the making of\\" featurette.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I was curious about this movie being a Pride and Prejudice fanatic.  I was quite surprise it had a new twist to the whole thing.  I decided to watch the movie with curiosity as to the characters playing.  I liked it a lot. It's like a combination of Bridgette Jones and Pride and Prejudice. I think the character of Jemima was so funny !!! It definitely had some funny, witty moments that caught my attention.  I grew to like the Mr. Darcy character although I still prefer Colin firth and Matthew Macfadyen. I didn't think I would grow so fond of this movie but I can understand why a movie site gave it an 8.1/10.00.  A new twist and a refreshing new idea.
B001O8D47S|1.0|I was shocked, this movie was beyond bad. The plot and acting were unbearable. I am still in shock. Please do not waste your time on this movie, it is NOT worth it.
0345495004|4.0|I enjoyed Loving Frank.  It was a beautifully written, well done piece of historical fiction.  What I didn't like was the central characters.  Mamah Cheney gives up her life literally as we find out for Frank Lloyd Wright and the \\"priveledge\\" of being his mistress.  She selfishly leaves her young children subjecting her family and sister to ridicule and social ostracisim while she is galavanting across Europe with Frank enjoying the Tuscan sun and literary conversations with her new found feminist friends. It's hard to like a woman or man \\"who follows their heart\\" but at the expense of innocent people like their children or spouses.  It's interesting to note the genius of FLW and how this gives him some kind of \\"free pass\\" with Mamah and others who just accept his eccentricities and ego mania.  It's also interesting to note that Mameh never achieves her independence and intellectual potential that the reader is led to believe is her primary motivation for loving Frank.  In the end she is nothing short of a housewife contending with a cranky overbearing mother in law at Franks dream home Taliesan and that makes the true ending of this novel even more difficult for the reader to bear.  Loving Frank is a  nice piece of historical fiction with interesting characters and beautiful writing even if the characters are not wholly likeable.
6305718954|4.0|When STIGMATA first came out, I avoided it. I figured that it would be another hokey, religious / supernatural mega-dud like END OF DAYS. Years later, I finally watched it, and was pleasantly surprised. Patricia Arquette is both tough and vulnerable as Frankie Paige. She is bewildered by what's happening to her, without losing her modern cynicism. Gabriel Byrne (Gothic, Spider) makes a believable, world-weary Father Kiernan, who goes from skeptic to believer in due course. Jonathan Pryce is subtly eeevil as the pompous Cardinal Houseman. If you like religious horror / thrillers that aren't (overly) dependent on cgi or insulting to your intelligence, then STIGMATA should be a hit...    P.S.- I prefer the  director's darker, more powerful alternate ending over the \\"happily ever after\\" hollywood bilge...
B00004VW5A|5.0|There is no doubt that the 1992 boxed set \\"The King Of Rock 'N Roll: The Complete 50's Masters\\" by Elvis Presley is, without question, the greatest album that has ever been released. The extraordinary collection on 5 cassettes or 5 CDs represents the best and most creative period in American popular music. Elvis was, and always will be, the greatest entertainer in the history of entertainment. The 140 tracks contained within this set include his classic tracks from Sun Records, the 4 Gospel songs (\\"I Believe\\", \\"Peace In The Valley\\", \\"It Is No Secret\\", \\"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\\"), the 8 Christmas songs (\\"Santa Claus Is Back In Town\\", \\"White Christmas\\", \\"O Little Town Of Bethlehem\\", \\"Silent Night\\", \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\", \\"Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)\\", \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\", \\"Blue Christmas\\"), all the recordings from his 4 movies released during the 50's (\\"Love Me Tender\\", \\"Loving You\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", \\"King Creole\\"), and other outstanding studio recordings. The 5th tape/disc in this set, entitled \\"Rare And Rockin\\", features a wonderful selection of 26 tracks of rare titles, 14 of which were previously unissued, prior to the release of this set. It also features alternate takes of songs from his 4 films, and his live 1956 performance from the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. In addition to the great musical recordings, there is also a unique and previously unreleased press interview with Elvis that took place on the day he set sail for Germany to begin his 2-year stint in the Army. This set also features a wonderfully assembled book with a great assortment of photographs and terrific liner notes annotated by Colin Escott. As an added bonus, there is also a collector's sheet of stamps that are perfect replicas of Elvis's single, EP and album covers from the 1950's that were provided courtesy of Mr. Paul Dowling. All-in-all, this boxed set is not only the best Elvis album of all time, but is, as far as I am concerned, the greatest album ever released. You can't find a better collection of music than right here. This is one album that you will not be disappointed with. There are no filler tracks; every track in this album is a standout performance from Elvis. This set proves, once and for all, that he always will continue to be the undisputed King of Rock and Roll; bar none!
159562015X|2.0|I bought this book thinking that it will be a lot different from the first one, Now Discover Your Strengths. Content wise the new book does not have much to talk about. I guess the only improvement is on the speed of their online test, but frankly speaking I did not see the difference either.    I would strongly recommend the first two books, \\"Discover Your Sales Strengths\\" and \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\".
B0027G783W|2.0|I have all of Moby's previous albums, including his Voodoo Child stuff and I have to say I am disappointed with 'Wait for Me'.  This album sounds like part 'Play' redux (with little of the energy/soul of that album) and sort of an attempt to follow the coattails of David Lynch's collaboration with Danger Mouse/Sparklehorse, 'Dark Night of the Soul'.  The lyrical content seems intentionally down/depressing/dark, but the music is more of the same and more of the same, often annoyingly repetitive.  The beats are slow, stale, and really the album gets monotonous in places. Moby seems to forget he's not DJ'ing at a club on this album and just lets samples and string parts go on way too long or repeat too many times.     Where Dark Night of the Soul is creative and inventive, with genuine songs 'Wait for Me' forges little new territory for Moby.  The \\"gospel/soul singing samples over synth strings\\" schtick is OK, but there needs to be some change-up, some more attempt at song structure. And the one song that features Moby singing is atrocious.  He never had the greatest voice, but he made do.  This song just falls flat.    Incidentally, this is not the first time Moby has been inspired by David Lynch. He used 'Laura's Theme' from the Twin Peaks soundtrack on his successful track 'Go'.  So, it is rather difficult for me to believe he has suddenly found Lynch interesting. It's more likely he wishes he had hitched a ride on the 'Dark Night of the Soul' train.  (With apologies to Don Cornelius)    I like Moby's past music too much to give this one star, but I have to say, this one is a disappointment.
B000001GAJ|5.0|I fell in love with Mendelssohn's Concerto for Violin, Piano and String Orchestra ca. 20 years ago when they were playing it on the radio. My husband tried immediately to buy it for me but he couldn't get it anywhere. Recently I discovered that there existed this wonderful recording with Martha Argerich and Gidon Kremer, and I started looking for it via internet all over Germany. But I couldn't find it. I really must tell you that this excellent recording is no longer available in my country. At this point I remembered  Amazon.com. and I'm so grateful that I finally found at your store this CD which includes also the very nice Violin Concerto in D minor. Thank you so much for sending me this wonderful music! Ursula Krauß.
B000001F2E|4.0|Listened to this album back when it first came out and now my son likes Rush (he is into percussion and guitar). Bought it for him and those songs still hold up over time.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I loved watching these DVD's.  The acting is so bad, but the stories are sooooo good.  I may be 76, but I am still a true Trekkie at heart.    Nancy S.
B000GCG59W|5.0|I enjoyed this CD.  Even though I don't speak the language of the singer, I could sense what she was talking about by the emotion that came through in the way she sang the words and her body language.  The music fit the words, set up the mood of the CD, and added to the story she was telling.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is a wonderful play that gives quite a different take on the Wizard of Oz. The music is fun, and recreates the images of the play. I hope someone makes a movie of this.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|To those who appreciate seeing a film which was filmed in widescreen, actually presented in widescreen, forget this release of Logan's Run, the cover of which depicts a hand palming a red crystal. The 2004 release, with the \\"rainbow\\" cover, contains both the original widescreen and butchered pan-and-scan versions, all on one disc.
1878424505|5.0|I think the main reason why I like this book is the simplicity it was written with. As I read in a lot of reviews, some people prefer just to call it \\"common sense\\". I think is not commom sense, I say it is, like we use to call in Brazil, \\"good sense\\".<br />The point is: how far are we from all this \\"good sense\\"? How society in general fail to teach us what really matters? How we are lost in distractions, turning our backs to our true nature?<br />Don Miguel Ruiz shows us how shallow we are in such a simple way that it'll be felt like a slap in the face. I caught myself thinking: \\"How dare him, to be so simple?\\". And then you start re-thinking all your atittudes, and the deepest you allow yourself to go, the more surprising it is.<br />I've been studying philosophy and personal growth for the past seven years, and this book was one of the most enlightening ones I've ever read. It really helped me shifting the way I looked at things.<br />Some reviewers here say that the book shows \\"nothing new\\" or \\"nothing more than what my grandmother thaught me\\". They can be right, since everybody understand a message in different ways, and people have different levels of spirituality and growth. Don't let these reviews get in your way thought. I strongly encourage you to read this book and draw your own conclusions, like you should always do if you're following the path of personal growth.
B001DD63UO|5.0|Pink is  so very talented!  It's great to purchase an album that has so many great songs on it.  The words are unabashedly naughty and funny and underlying them I can understand the pain that inspired them.  Also, I'm glad that there is a choice of explicit and clean versions - even tho I'm old enough to hear the \\"bad words\\" I'd rather not!
B0026LYM5U|5.0|It's rare that a band survives the departure of a beloved front person with so much talent and charisma; however, the Gathering have done it in stunning fashion.  Silje Wergeland has revitalized the Gathering creatively, musically and emotionally.  Not just a replacement, but a new member who was heavily involved in the album, she is a fantastic addition to the band.  The West Pole is lush with rich, lyrical melodies and heavy atmospherics, as well as, a harder, edgier guitar sound than the recent Gathering albums.  This album has energy and emotion on all tracks, including the instrumental and the slower paced ones.  Although there will never be a replacement for Anneke, the Gathering have rediscovered themselves with the West Pole and charted a new direction.  The creativity of the music, the beautiful vocals and the wonderful lyrics once again have Gathering songs \\"spinning around in my head\\".
1439102813|5.0|For the past ten years, my family and I have traveled from Buffalo, NY to the Cape and received the recommendations of \\"Marcia\\" from Barnes and Nobles on ten books or so (send her a commission :), which we always follow and read all week on the beach. She recommended this one a few days ago and after visiting Harvard the day before with our son, it seemed a perfect read. I started reading it and immediately had to stop. I was afraid, for my parents, for myself...but I couldn't stop. It is so real and so raw, and so beautiful and informative at the same time. Thank you. Well done.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|The DVD played fine without any skips or errors. I have not seen this in over thirty years. It's a good old classic from Disney. My memory might be old but I seem to recall certain scenes seem to be shorter or not there. Oh well, engineers have to play too I guess. Now if Disney would get off their rear ends and release \\" Song of the South\\" That'd be a feat.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Even 25 years later, the humor in Tootsie still manages to impress.  Brilliant performances by everyone- Teri Garr is amazing.  Everyone must see this movie at least once. .!!
B001GJ2ZP2|5.0|Lady Gaga is purely amazing. As a musician myself, its great to see her taken her career in the direction she chooses. Shes unique, creative, and strange, but talented all the way! Go GA GA!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This CD is such a huge treat after so many years away from the studio.  It has a very fresh sound and, moreover, a very confident sound.  Rather than rest on her laurels or return to formula in any way, Donna put together a very diverse collection of songs that allowed her to express herself very differently than in the past.  The songs seem to be coming from within, rather than her gorgeous voice just mouthing words about someone or something outside her personal world.  While I love to hear her belt one out, some of my favorite tracks on here go in the opposite direction.  The title cut is a real stand-out, with Donna's intonations mirroring Ziggy Marley.  Her voice is virtually unrecognizable on \\"Slide Over Backwards\\", but what a great song!  \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" is a great anthem of empowerment.  \\"Fame (The Game)\\" is probably the track that I've worn out... I keep hitting the replay button over and over... it's got a great electronic hook, and the lyrics are very smart.  \\"Be Myself Again\\" is a great ballad and seems once again to be very autobiographical.  I could go on about each of the songs, but suffice it to say that they all work as individuals, and together comprise a collection that is one of Donna's very best to date.  I've always been a fan, and she's written and performed great material in the past, but this seems like the first time that every aspect of the package is coming from her.  Can't wait for the next one!
B001CDLATE|5.0|A few years ago I bought this movie on dvd and fell in love with it.  When I heard it was being released on Blu-Ray, I double-dipped and picked it up as well.  The video quality is superb and the Audio is pretty good as well.  I have enjoyed every moment of this disc.     The only note of cautions I would give is to be careful with fingerprints and smudges on the disc.  I had some skipping about 3/4 through and noticed some fingerprints on it (probably from a friend handling it).  I wiped them off and played like a pro.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and I bought it because I saw it on regular television and enjoyed it.
037571457X|3.0|IPURCHASED THISBOOK FOR MY GRANDAUGHTER SHE HAS TO READ IT FOR SCHOOLSO I REALLY DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE BOOK
0743455967|4.0|Very autobiographical introduction to the art of writing. Written by a contemporary master, this is very worthwhile for anyone interested in writing, or in how King does what he does. Like him, it's a bit quirky but worth every bit of effort reading it may demand.
0060920084|4.0|Thematic and organizational similarities to Steinbeck's Travels With Charley and William Least Heat Moon's Blue Highways are obvious, but Bryson takes The Lost Continent into territory scarcely traveled by Steinbeck and Least Heat Moon.  You see, Bryson laces humor liberally throughout his travel memoirs.  The other writers' travelogues about adventures and people encountered on American roadways had less humor.  That's not to say that Bryson's book surpasses those of the great, earlier writers in this genre; Bryson's approach is merely true to Bryson's chuckle-packed narrative style.  Therefore, since I find Bryson's humor and storytelling so irresistible, I feel this book is a great read.

055358894X|4.0|At first I thought that this was not going to be an enjoyable fantasy to read.  It was a little wordy and slow moving.  I was getting annoyed with his dialogue being broken up with \\"ah\\" and \\"...\\".  His characters had a bit too much of a good ole boy feel to them as they were trying to be to witty and clever.  But then, gradually, I was drawn into the story and Lynch's style if writing.  I am coming away from The Lies of Locke Lamora a fan.    What began drawing me in was the intricate and well thought of plot.  As you slowly moved through the lives of the Gentleman [...] you begin to see their interaction with one another, making their impact all the more believable and powerful.  What was really fascinating me was the unpredictability of the plot and, with that, you are always on the edge of your seat wondering where Lynch was going to take you.    His style of writing is also an asset that made for a colorful read.  I am a big fan of recursive writing, or telling a story by backtracking to fill in the holes that a character's history usually leaves.  Lynch uses this heavily as he has Interlude chapters to tell the history of a character, which would then lead straight in to the plot.  This could be a little disarming with some chapters because his Interlude chapters are always from different periods of time, from a few days before the main storyline to 10 years before.    In the end you have fun characters that are believable in their audacity, characters that you want to root for and  to jeer for.  And their unsavory lifestyle doesn't hurt the story, but instead adds a flare that stands Lynch apart from other typical fantasy.  I would recommend and I look forward to reading the next installment.    4 stars.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I think maybe its my favorite PT album.  The good news is I get forever to decide....
1416955070|1.0|What a waste of time. Reading this was tedious. There was such loose control of description that I couldn't finish it. I kept waiting for the awkward and nonsensical descriptions to end and the plot to pick-up but it never did. It came off sounding like a story that an 8th grader wrote to try to show off the words that they learned on their latest vocab test. I tried. Really I did. I love books. I couldn't finish it.
B001GM28HO|5.0|This album is so damn amazibg. I sing to it in the shower every morning. And dance to it too! Haha<br />Although i noticed iTunes sells a bonus song that is mot on the album.
0143034901|1.0|My credit card was debited but i have not received this book! Thankyou for your attention in this matter.
B0002PZVH0|4.0|I have the newly remastered version of this album, as well as the older CD version, and I cannot tell any difference between them.  I have tried (with high-end equipment), but both sound exactly the same to me!<br /><br />Despite buying what is essentially a duplicate of my older CD (my pain can be your gain), I can easily forgive the work itself, which in my opinion is a great ambient album.  It was my first real foray into the genre, and I went from here to other Eno, Harold Budd, Stars of the Lid and even Miles Davis.<br /><br />Most reviewers will sing the praise of track 1, but the fourth track is the standout in my opinion.  If you want to give ambient music a try, or even if you have experienced it before, you cannot go wrong with this album.<br /><br />If you are interested in more ambient discs, try Eno's Thursday Afternoon, The Pearl, or Ambient 2 (both with Harold Budd).  Ambient 4: On Land is much different that Ambient 1, and you will detect the difference immediately.  Ambient 3... well, check the reviews and see for yourself.<br /><br />Harold Budd is also a great ambient musician, and if you like Ambient 1, I would suggest also giving some of his albums a try.  In addition to The Pearl, and Ambient 2, which are mentioned above, look into The White Arcades and The Serpent (in Quicksilver) & Abandoned Cities.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, my interest in ambient brought me back to Jazz and Miles Davis.  The trumpeter's funkier records actually come across as proto-ambient to me.  Check out In a Silent Way, and Get Up With It for a taste.<br /><br />If you already have the older CD, I would strongly suggest getting it up used.  Do not, however, simply buy up all the new Eno remasters.  I think you will be disappointed by the lack of enhancement.
B000002U82|5.0|People. Here I sit defying my own mantra. My own raison d'etre. My own popcorn at the cinema verite. I never wanted to review this iconic album. Really I didn't. But forces beyond your known experiences and weakening tides of the earth have sung a different tune to the Seer of Seers, the Truth beyond Fiction, the Hobnail of all the Boots, your own beloved Metamorpho.<br /><br />Why you say? Because what could one add to the vast multitudes who have written before your enlightened friend? Me! That's who! And please realize that explaining this album is not what I'm about. No. Having an off-centre approach and having fun is really what it's all about. No doubt.<br /><br />This is one of those albums that stand out from the crowd because, upon your very first listening, it is such an impressional landmark in your mind, and so entirely unique that you just have to listen to it again- and again- and again to reveal yet another nugget of worth from it's vast expanse that your sub-concious mind (as stubborn as it may be) must be forced to give up to your concious mind eventually. It will happen. No need to stuggle. I will be there for support.<br /><br />I do not presuppose that I know everything that this album means to all people. Or what it conveys. It's always a subjective thing people, and I can't speak for he or she or them or it or he is me and we are all together that we belong to. Face it. Late 60's or early 70's psychedelia has taken a toll on all of us. That said, this album is the monumental one by Pink Floyd and one that is essential in your vast musical archive- even if you never listen to it. Hell, even owning it is like a musical pass to the great beyond and then some, providing, of course, that you symbiotically got something from it. And, don't make me responsible. Everyone hates to be responsible these days. What? You didn't notice? How rude.....<br /><br />To me, this album is so successful because the music and lyrics pertain to the journey of life. And themes that we can all relate to. Life's struggles, money, mental illness, comfort, time (or lack of it), energy spent, personal alliances or the differences between us, the value and worth of our own human experience, death, and the beginning and end of our own existence. Inescapable stuff for sure. And. so jarring.<br /><br />We revisit so much because we want to know that we didn't miss anything. But Pink Floyd, in this outing, gave you more than enough aural enlightenment that it will keep your brain cells and ears humming for years to come. Take my word. Seers never lie.<br /><br />The whole thing is hard to explain. It's like explaining why Metamorpho has a vast fan club at his beck and call 24/7. It's just one of those phenomenas that we all must marvel at.

1595141715|5.0|This book was amazing.  I fell in love with Clay, the boy who is listening to these tapes throughout the story.  If only Hannah lived...<br /><br />I think that this is a great book for parents of young adults to read, as well as their kids.  It reminded me of all of the drama that happened while I was in school at that age.  I just hope that kids will realize what their cruel actions can cause and maybe change themselves after reading this.  I couldn't tell you how much I cried, especially during Clay's part.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|Ok.....it is 2009 as I am writing this review....the Song Remains The Same was produced in 1973 and was released in 1976...so the critics noting the \\"bombastic\\", \\"excessives\\", or \\"egos\\" associated with this piece..(or the Jimmy Page guitar solo)..take a deep breath, and keep your perspective! Yes, there is an ample supply of fodder for \\"Spinal Tap\\" parody in this film, but this is also part of the intrinsic magic of this film.    In spite of the excesses, and the silly (but entertaining) excursions into the short \\"fantasy sequences\\"...this film ROCKS. Yeah, it was 1973, and there is some rock n' roll bloat, but there is also greatness, and sheer joy at the quality of the performances.     The Blu-ray of this film is very good. We are all fortunate that this movie was made because we have a record/time capsule of the rock scene circa 1973. Plus, one can have a greater appreciation for the humor of the rock parody \\"Spinal Tap\\"....watch one before or after the other...see how sophisticated we are in 2009...not!! (People will be laughing at 2009 in 30 years too.....)
B001TKS462|5.0|Companies of today are not what they used to be.  One can no longer expect to start and finish their career at the same place.  Mergers, acquisitions, individual's desire for professional growth, recession or any other reason is forcing us all to change many companies in our career.  But with changes comes the challange in redefining the way one leads the new company, new subordinates and their teams as well as how one re-establishes his/her long term career in a new environment.<br /><br />This book outlines very carefully all strategy aspects for the new leader in a new role.  How to establish the reputation and realistic goals for the fist 90 days in a new job; how to secure some early wins and successes; how to setup expectations fro teams and individuals workign under the new leadership; how to secure acceptable from the boss and build coalition with peers.<br /><br />Real professional situations presented ina book help explain how one must behave in a companies that may have different cultural, economic or geographical needs compared to leader's last role.  One also must learn that industry knowledge orprofessional expertise is no reason for a new leader to micromanage their new team - it can only lead to a disaster.<br /><br />This is very valuable book for a new leader in a new role with a new company or within different department in their existing company.  It is also a valuable reference book for established leader.  As each company goes through a various stages of a success cycle, one must always be prepared on how to adjust his/her own strategy to a new situation.
B001NP8PQW|4.0|Everything works here: sound quality; video quality; production values; and of course foremost, the performance. While I missed some of the more upbeat songs of some of their other (newer) albums, this disc is a definitive Cure performance. I would hope that additional live performances of other Cure albums could be made...it would be an awesome collection! Ah, the joy of melancholy....the melancholy in joy....!
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I just purchased this CD & I've ordered their other releases as a result.  I'm a woman of 52, but I still enjoy great music. Highly recommend their music if you like to rock, along with HURT that I'm listening to as I write this review.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Wow....it has been nearly 30 years since this was produced (1981)...it is hard to believe....the performance and the quality of the video is fantastic! Queen is King! What I really like about recorded performances of this era is that the sequencing of camera views is reasonable, and mimics what your eye would do if attending the concert. Unfortunately, with all of the technical wizardry of the present time, concert performances now tend toward numerous high speed camera views switched every few seconds..plus other annoying technical video effect crap......which is fine if you are cranked up on cocaine or crack or have the attention span of a fruit fly.......but if you are a normal person your head will be spinning after a short while. I prefer to dwell on a person or a view (preferably a close-up) for more than a 3 second blip. Happily, this concert has a good balance of camera shots that are not sequenced in a maddening fury. I guess I will have to avoid any concert films made after 1981 !!! (No, not really....for example the Soundstage series and the old MTV unplugged series offer both technical video excellence with some reasonable restraint in the video gimmickry department). Turn up the surround sound and the big screen HDTV and enjoy this masterpiece from Queen.
0452287022|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  It gave me new insight into the life and times of Vermeer and told a good story in the process.  I always like a book that tells a good story and teaches me something new!
044024238X|4.0|I really liked this non-shopaholic Kinsella book. To be honest.. after about Shopaholic Ties the Knot I was starting to get really bored and annoyed with the series. Confessions (first one) was really good but then they got progressively worse. After the 3rd book Becky was just plain annoying, irresponsible, and most of the time I just wanted to yell at her!  Samantha, the 'undomestic goddess' is not anywhere near as irritating. That being said, this book really surprised me! It was funny in a not-quite-so-annoying way.. haha i loved the part about the nimbus 2000, it had me laughing aloud and I finished it in no time! This was my first non shopaholic Kinsella book but I loved it! Going to read Remember me? & Can you keep a secret next..
0307341569|5.0|Gillian Flynn once again puts the creepy and dysfunctional and weaves another great story.  The characters are dark and strange but Ms. Flynn has a knack of driving the story regardless.  This is a real page turner and the author gives up nothing until the last couple of chapters.<br /><br />I had no idea where the or how the mystery was going to be solved and was shocked and happily surprised at the twists and turns it took.<br /><br />Loved the book and would highly recommend it.
068484267X|1.0|I am only giving this book one star as I was so disappointed in its content. It starts out slow and I would have put it down had I known the ending at the beginning. The author makes one feel something with real meaning is coming, but it never does. He does do an excellent job of describing the poor and the hard times they had which makes one want to cry and weep over the misery of that period. However, he puts so much sexual content in it that I don't think is necessary. Over half of the book I would say involves sexual overtones, and I am just don't think all that vivid description is necessary. I think the author has never really gotten over that aspect, and that is probably why it comes out so much in the book. Maybe this was his cartharsis, and if so, then I understand and hope it brought healing. I am glad so many enjoyed it, maybe I am the oddball.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|I ordered sex and the city.  Everything looks ok, but there are like two episodes I couldn't watch because the dvd has scratches on it
031606792X|1.0|I can not believe how bad this book is. The sex, the pregnancy, the imprinting and.....well, I do not know what else is in this book given it is so horrible that I could not finish it.    Ms. Meyer, I would give you credits for your creativity but I think you went too far this time.     For those who enjoy book 1-3, if you dont want to ruin your Twilight experience, stop at Eclipse, you are not missing out.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|The CD is rather dark, but if that doesn't bother you, go for it.  The music is the same great Neil folk rock.  I like to see who is playing the music!  Brings back the hippie days!
1439157383|1.0|My sister in law told me how this book made her cry and she could not stop reading it. So, out of curiosity, I purchased it and anticipated tears streaming down my cheeks.    Here I am, 350 pages, I have not got one single tear, nor have I felt the emotion to cry. ALL I got is anger.    The author tried wayyyyyy too hard to write those cheesy, sappy lines. The 13 year old Anna thinks like a 53, who has been through everything in life. Brian and Sara are the same. Almost everyone in this book thinks so philosophically that I can not stop rolling my eyes.     There is really nothing good about this book. Don't waste your time.
1416550542|4.0|I recommend. I can't say much about one aspect of this book that some may find shocking and disturbing without spoiling the story. This particular element didn't spoil the book for me. A very enjoyable read.
B00243FQFA|1.0|if they think we the Stargate fans are going to support the New show coming out soon, they better think before they act....<br /><br />the writing is terrible!! they clearly have lost steam... if the same writers are going to write the new show, then FOOEY!!!!!!<br /><br />clearly it's time for new talent to write the show... Atlantis and SG1 ARE awesome, and were awesome... meaning the later seasons really LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRED!!!! some episodes were LAME And clearly written to accommodate BUDGET restrictions which SHOULD NEVER have BEEN THERE!!! meaning they need to SPEND THE money to make GOOD, well rounded episodes...<br /><br />DO NOT CHEAP OUT ON THE FX AND STORY SCOPE!!!!!<br /><br />don't be discouraged though, buy the dvds, but LET it be known (by YOU, the fans) that you won't invest your heart in the new series if they are going to let it DIE Like<br />they DID WITH ATLANTIS!!!!!!!!!!!  Atlantis ENDED WAY too SOON!!!!!!<br /><br />NO no nononononon onon ononon NO NONO NONO NO NO NO NO ON ON NO!!!!!!!<br /><br />SENd the mesSAGE!!!!
1600242197|5.0|I gave this audio book to my husband and he really enjoyed not only the true story but the company he had while driving coast to coast in Florida.  He says he wants to get more books this way  The story was told really well and although it seems to be a masculine type of book, he was sure women would like it also.
B0026OE2O8|5.0|this dvd, if you like docomentary, its amazing, very good, everything, I was very happy with this dvd, special in blu-ray,.
0786838655|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I didn't know much about mythology so I thought I would be lost. I wasn't because he explains the mythology.  I could not put this book down.  It is filled with action and adventure, not a dull moment.  Starting book 2 hope it is good as well.
0156030209|5.0|Very deep use of colors to symbolize religion.  Interesting twist on humanity and religion.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I own every album except Binural & No Code. Also, I am wondering when/if they'll have 'Picture in a Frame' on a new album soon?<br /><br />This rock group still has it and always did. If you're more into the typical 'hype' of the music industry...Pearl Jam is definitely NOT FOR YOU!<br /><br />I love the messages in the songs- the feelings of being 'human' on this crazy messed-up planet.<br /><br />Honestly, I am never burnt out on their music...I don't believe I ever will. (Proudly, I have a Pearl Jam logo tattooed on my wrist along with: corduroy, i am mine, save you, & come back- 'do the evolution' is on the back of my neck!)
B001K3JF7K|4.0|Good background or quiet comtemplation music. She's always on key and has a unique presentation of familiar songs. Very nice music to relax to. She has a \\"velvety\\" voice.
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|This Star Trek should serve as a template for any director making a multi-million dollar science fiction film.  In addition to special effects, this film has character development, humor, human failings, a plot, some coherence, suspense and so on.  Imagine how many other science fiction movies, including the previous Star Treks could benefit from including these things.<br /><br />The cliches--and there are many--mostly have to do with the Star Trek franchise.  And that's fine.  Except for Spock's father (who, unlike Spock, went to Cambridge) this movie avoids the classically trained British actors and corny dialog.  Checkov probably should have gone to a language coach, though.<br /><br />I think this Star Trek benefitted from being so family friendly.  I, for one, did not miss the state-of-the-art depiction of torture or parasitic disease.  To each his own.<br /><br />So the universe is still dangerous (or it was, I suppose).  But there is also bravery, humility, love, and a little humor.  Even poor Captain Pike seems to have a new lease on life...for now.
B0013K4MPU|5.0|The first thing you'll notice about Michael Jackson's hit collection is how well produced and mixed his songs are. I rated all of them 5 stars with a few exceptions. The album spans his 80s disco influence through Thriller then segues to his mature R&B songs of the 90s like Man in the Mirror and Black & White.    Great addition to my record collection!
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Love Disney movies and love this story.  Have added this to my growing collection of Disney movies.

B001CTDH58|3.0|I did not notice when ordering this product that it was Blu-ray.  I contacted the seller and since I hadn't opened it allowed me to send I back. I could not watch this as I do not own a Blu-ray player.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Woody Allen is definitely one of the best directors of our time. To all honesty, I like not all his films but most of them, and those that I do like, I just love. And \\"Vicky..\\" is one of his best. And Penelope Cruz is wonderful here - as usually. But they both are renown filmmakers and I wouldn't write a review just to say what was already said many times by others. Who moved me to write the review was my personal discovery - Rebecca Hall(I never heard of her before). She is a real stunner! Her acting is so dynamic, multifaceted, true to life and limitless that I was surprised(that I never heard of her) and compelled(to write this comment). Thank you Woody Allen for bringing this gem to light!
0571202284|5.0|This is the book everybody seriously interested in animation of any kind must have. No doubt.
B001F290E4|4.0|A friend of mine was playing this album at his house and I didn't give it my undvided attention but I made sure I at least heard excerpts. The excerpts that I did hear influenced me to come home and listen to the entire album; I am delighted that I did. First of all, Seal picks some amazing classics to cover, so he is awarded cool points for that. I always enjoy hearing new renditions of old songs. I usually prefer the originals, and yes the originals outshine Seal's versions, but he definitely does a great job with these songs.<br /><br />At times, Seal's voice gets too raspy for my liking, but he is a skilled vocalist. \\"Free\\" by Deneice Williams is covered on this album. Seal's version is decent, but Deneice's version is in a league all its own. It was smart play for Seal to begin his album with \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\", especially since Barack Obama was elected president the same year this album came out and his word of choice is \\"change.\\" Anyway, Seal's rendition of this song is both soulful and enjoyable. \\"Here I Am (Come and Take Me\\" is a song that I had never heard before, but enjoyed it nonetheless. It's an uptempo number with good production. \\"People Get Ready\\" and \\"If You Don't Know Me by Now\\" are two songs that I have always liked, and Seal did a fine job with both tracks.<br /><br />I recommend this album to those who are lovers of Seal. These are not studio-made beats, but rather live music coupled with the grandeur of Seal's vocal instrument. Invest.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"I'm Still in love With You\\"<br />2. \\"Stand By Me\\"<br />3. \\"People Get Ready\\"<br />4. \\"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\\"<br />5. \\"It's Alright\\"

0316067598|5.0|As an author myself I always look for the professionalism in a book written by the person that experienced the book's content, and this book is as well written as anythig that Vince Flynn or Robert Ludlum has written...BUT...this story is all true. Every American should read this and then take a hard look at every man or woman wearing the uniform of an American Soldier, and they will probably see that person in a new light. We are one of only a few countries that are truly free, and it's that way because of men like Marcus Luttrell.     Rick Magers  [...]
B0004Z33EG|5.0|This movie makes you think, besides the Violence, It makes you think how many Veterans felt when they came back from Vietnam, when All these Hippies and Beatniks and radicals would taunt them and make them feel like murderers, When they were Heroes. Of course Condoning Violence is wrong. But this Movie with the Cops treating The Drifter John Rambo like he was nothing, It is sad, and makes you angry. \\"He Drew First Blood\\"- Rambo.  Great Action Packed Movie.
0061122416|5.0|This is a wonderful story especially for people that are caught in the rut of everyday life.   The Alchemist talks of God's love that is present in everyone and everything. This love must be cared for, worked on and remembered.    Moreover humans are part of the universe. We must learn to understand and blend with all the elements not only through books but also through our obervations of our beautiful animals,planet and universe.

B000000JO3|5.0|I burned a copy of Minor Threat to a co-worker after discussing all our fav punk bands,he mentioned Pennywise,Bad Relion,NOFX, Rancid ect.So I thought he would appreciate the direct rigged hardcore punk of Minor Threat,whom which influenced pretty much every punk band to follow.But to my surprise he disliked them,saying that it sounded as if they needed guitar lessons!?!the problem here is that punk nowadays isnt punk,its too polished, overproduced,hardly edgy,hardly anything to retaliate against ,maybe write about the gas prices who knows.Its become an outlet for tatooed posers and whiners,yeah we know \\"work sucks\\" but you live in the suburbs with your mom.Minor Threat kept it short and direct,its music to vent too. Like Black Flag,Subhumans,DRI and so on,ok life sucks get over it and change it!!

B001QBXFTA|5.0|In the world of  Chamber music, the Haydn String Quartets are a milestone.    This set, recorded by the Aolean Quartet and lead by Emanuel Hurwitz, one of the most important violinist to hail from the UK, approaches these masterpieces with a fresh honesty and articulate charm.  We get to hear one gem after another.  There is a fascinating profoundnes to this  \\"old school\\" approach to string playing. The music is paramount and placed ahead of the technique (of which there is plenty) and is a lesson to all, since it is quickly becoming a lost art.    PL
B001R0KH3M|4.0|This is the best concert I have ever seen, from the sound to songs you can't go wrong with this one.

091581112X|5.0|I've read other books from Orin and Sanaya, and this one makes another step. Actually, it is a real blast for me!    \\"Spiritual growth\\" describes in details things introduced in previous books and as mentioned is more advanced. Maybe it not requires having practise with e.g. \\"Living with joy\\" [[ASIN:0915811030 Living with Joy: Keys to Personal Power and Spiritual Transformation]] or \\"Personal power through awareness\\" [[ASIN:0915811049 Personal Power Through Awareness: A Guidebook for Sensitive People (Book II of the Earth Life Series)]], but I think it would be better for most to read first that books.    \\"Spiritual Growth\\" is a high dimensional art-work, which may be understood totally probably by advanced in self and counsciousness development process and I'm totally sure that I will learn a lot from this book yet for I still develop and learn from Orin.    So I recommend it to those who liked other Sanaya's books that feel they're prepared now to make another step and wish to have a better and deeper understanding.
B000069HKH|5.0|Once in a long time comes an album with so many perfect songs.  This is not one of \\"his best efforts since...\\"  This is it dear reader: one of the Boss's best albums ever! Don't read any more as words are nothing. Buy - listen - understand.  Good luck.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie shows you how much music can really move a person. August Rush follows a family that is brought together through music. August wishes to find his long lost parents and believes he can find them through the music that he hears in everyday objects and sounds. Years before his parents had also been brought together when both \\"heard the music\\" as they were playing in two seperate concerts. As this movie progresses music continues to play as an important role as August learns how to play a guitar simply by looking at another kid playing, finds out how to write music, and finally writes his own rhapsody. As August is improving his ability and sharing his talent, his parents are each on a journey to discover they're love of music again. The end of this movie is an emotional thrill and the final song will break your heart everytime. I thoroughly enjoyed this musical movie that shows that music can bring those we miss together.
1558908382|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious! It's actually one of my all-time favorite movies. If you ever get the chance, you should definitely watch it! It is extremely well-written and an all-in-all funny and uplifting movie.     As others commented earlier, the DVD quality itself isn't all that great, even if you don't like extras, the picture quality has been completely downgraded. In other words, if you get the chance, watch the movie, it's worth more than 5 stars...if you can buy another dvd version...I'd do it. This came out looking more like a basement production due to the picture quality, which somewhat distracted from how amazing this movie really it.
0064407667|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It's a gloomy book that makes you glad that you have a warm, comfy home...even when it's hot and sunny outside.  It contains the story of the Baudelaire orphans: Violet, an inventor; Klaus, a bookworm; and Sunny, who likes to bite things. Their parents have just died in a mysterious fire, and the children are being sent to their nearest relative, a certain Count Olaf, whom they have never met.   Count Olaf leads a troupe of actors, and, like in the plays he performs, all may not be as it seems in his large, lonely house. How, exactly, is Count Olaf related to them? And did he have anything to do with their parents' death? The orphans don't know, but one thing's for sure: strange things are happening, and their parents' demise may be only the first in a Series of Unfortunate Events...    DUN-DUN-DUUUUNNNN!!!!!!
B000002TYX|5.0|First of all Availability, value for money.  I was helped by the wide availability of titles and on the Amazon
0316113506|5.0|The book is very informative and inspiring. I am very happy to add it to my personal library. I plan to use it often.

B001UN1KVE|4.0|I tried to watch the Blu-ray disc of this but it would not play at all.  I think it might be a defective disc.  But the standard DVD version worked fine.  I played them both on my Blu-ray player.  It is as funny and cheesy as I remember it.  One of Mel Brooks's better later films.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I loved this story.  Besides being interesting in it's historical content, it is a wonderful love story that ends \\"just right\\".  The struggle between the employer and employee is true to today (although things are much better now).  Life was especially difficult back then for the poor.
1416550542|5.0|I just read the last page of The Forgotten Garden, then hugged the book to stay with it a little longer. It was wonderful from start to finish. Kate never let one single line lag. There is an interesting developement at every turn.     I am an avid reader and read many so so and many very good books. This one stands alone. I read her House at Riverton earlier and did enjoy it, but this one is magical. If you are a female and have a love of the wonderment of life, read this book.
0385737424|4.0|This book centers around Miranda, a likeable and smart sixth grader living in New York City. She lives with her mom in apartment building complex alongside her best friend Sal. There is a pivotal event which causes many repercussions in her life and seemingly ends her life-long friendship. Soon thereafter, she starts receiving cryptic messages on small pieces of paper that both baffle and startle her. I won't give away any more details though as I don't want to reveal the mystery.<br /><br />I will conclude by stating that the author's strength is in her depiction of the characters, and there are many of them including the \\"crazy\\" guy on the corner that Miranda tries to avoid on her way to and from school everyday. And Jimmy the \\"sandwich guy\\" who lets them work in his shoppe during their lunch hour and pays them with a cheese sandwich. And there's her mom who dreams of being a contestant on the $20,000 pyramid and her boyfriend \\"Mr. Perfect\\" who helps her achieve her dream. This is a fun summer read and I recommend it for kids, young and old, 8 years and up !
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection is excellent for any MJ fan. There's quite a bit of music on these four CDs; and there a DVD of a TV special from 1992 which I actually did not have until I got this box set. The quality of the sound on the CDs is excellent and the artwork is done very nicely.<br /><br />\\"I Want You Back;\\" \\"ABC;\\" and \\"I'll Be There\\" primarily feature Michael up front and The Jacksons doing their trademark \\"call and response\\" style of singing--Michael sings some words; then the rest come in; then Michael; then the rest come in, and so on. Wow, how this works very well! \\"Got to Be There\\" is quite moving and I like \\"Ben.\\" The early disco \\"Dancing Machine\\" proved that The Jacksons could easily adapt to new genres of music as they evolved; and \\"Ease On Down The Road\\" from \\"The Wiz\\" gets a very spirited arrangement. We get both a single version and a demo version of \\"Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground),\\" too--great! \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" benefits from Michael's touch; and there's another gem in \\"Off The Wall.\\" I love it! That beat still sounds so good for dancing.<br /><br />\\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" has an excellent beat that Michael Jackson makes magical; and Paul McCartney joins in for \\"The Girl Is Mine.\\" Similarly, \\"Thriller\\" was a huge, huge hit for Michael; and \\"Billie Jean\\" is timeless--it all holds its own very well. Michael's excellent diction enhances his performance all the more. \\"State Of Shock\\" is a tune from The Jacksons later on in their career together; and that percussion does an awful lot for this number. \\"We Are the World\\" brings back countless memories for me; this was released when I was in college and I really had Michael on a pedestal.<br /><br />\\"Bad\\" is also quite good; and those \\"layers\\" of Michael singing work very well to make this dynamic. \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is positively electric; and \\"Man in the Mirror\\" is most touching. \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is another song with an excellent beat; and Michael delivers this without letting go of s single superfluous note! \\"Cheater\\" also rocks! \\"Monkey Business\\" has great musical effects to enhance it a great deal; and \\"Remember the Time\\" is another classic by Michael that has him squarely front and center--which is quite all right by me! \\"Black or White\\" is another song I ran out to get just as soon as it was available on vinyl; Michael does an outstanding job on this and that's excellent. \\"Someone Put Your Hand Out\\" ends the third CD with Michael singing straight from his heart and I could never tire of hearing Michael Jackson do songs like this one.<br /><br />\\"You Are Not Alone\\" is perfect--this music is all THAT good. Michael never falters and I'm impressed. \\"Childhood\\" is the theme from the movie \\"Free Willy 2\\" and Michael does this with panache; great! \\"Blood on the Dance Floor\\" has a very strong beat with Michael throwing himself into this number to make it outstanding; and then we get a rather sensitive number entitled \\"Fall Again.\\" \\"In The Back\\" is more fine music with a fresh sound to it that Michael aces as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing; but of course we know it wasn't all that easy--Michael's talent always carried him through. \\"Butterflies\\" is quite memorable; and I also like \\"Beautiful Girl.\\"<br /><br />The fifth disc is that DVD with the 1992 HBO special. It's quite good and, if you don't have this on DVD already, this is worth the price of admission alone! You won't be disappointed as Michael performs songs including \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin';\\" \\"She's Out Of My Life;\\" \\"Thriller;\\" \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror.\\"<br /><br />This five disc set is extremely special for us Michael Jackson fans. I highly recommend this set of four CDs and one DVD for Michael Jackson fans.ting go of s single superfluous note! \\"Cheater\\" also rocks! \\"Monkey Business\\" has great musical effects to enhance it a great deal; and \\"Remember the Time\\" is another classic by Michael that has him squarely front and center--which is quite all right by me! \\"Black or White\\" is another song I ran out to get just as soon as it was available on vinyl; Michael does an outstanding job on this and that's excellent. \\"Someone Put Your Hand Out\\" ends the third CD with Michael singing straight from his heart and I could never tire of hearing Michael Jackson do songs like this one.    \\"You Are Not Alone\\" is perfect--this music is all THAT good.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|On first hearing about this new Woody Allen film - Vicky Cristina Barcelona, marked up as a comedy and listed as Woody Allen return to form, I was certain to see this on release date in the UK. But life once again had me side tracked and I've only managed to get around to it now. Even though I've heard good/bad opinions from friends it was still a film I was always going to view for myself; so rented this film to draw my own conclusion.    The whole film is interwoven and shaped so that different storylines are voiced together by a narrator who fills us; the viewer; with a bigger picture of what happening at all times. Vicky Cristina Barcelona, three characters are placed in the title, starting with two americans who have different attitudes to life and love. Victoria (Rebecca Hall) plays it straight laced; a no nonsense attitude; questioning everything; her sensible cerebral life is her. Currently working on a Master's degree in Catalan Culture she leaves a well-off fiance behind in New York and travels to Barcelona with Cristina to stay with friends for the summer. Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) free spirit; sexually adventurous; committed only to herself; knowing what she doesn't want in life rather than what she does. Cristina's art is photography. The third character Barcelona with amazing architecture, music, cuisine, a beautiful enriched festively soak up the sun atmospheric city.    Living in Barcelona; Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) plays the moody, seductive Picasso-ish artist who in turn sets out to seduce both girls alone or even both at the same time, a distraction part time, using what he needs to remain creative. Juan might even be looking for a re-placement of losted love as he clearly has not gotten over Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz) the passionate muse and fiery ex-wife who returns when mood suits.    Before long Victoria begins to question her own life; could she live on the other side like Cristina; Carefree. While Cristina questions commitment to any life with either one or two people in it. As for the artist and his ex-wife fire and passion holds the bond but realistically a third party is needed for them to remain harmonic. Could happiness be elusive?    One thing I did notice from the off: Woody Allen had chosen not to give himself an acting role but British actress Rebecca Hall; (Vicky) who does a great american accent for her part, seemed to be playing Woody's part in this film, the mannerisms are more than recognizable here. Other film trademarks are visible like encounters in the street also Cristina's artistic bent, like Annie Hall's so long ago, should be for photography. Also the fact Vicky and Cristina speak in that distinctive indulgent conversational babble which worked quiet well from both actress.     But there is no doubt the Spanish players have it; presence and forthright energy, Javier Bardem as the artist; alpha male; Penélope Cruz clearly stealing the show; everything she does and says seems to mean more, count for more, she certainly walks off with the film and an Oscar.    Summing up: What I loved mostly was the beauty of Barcelona on film, the photography was marvelous. Things I could relate too in this; Victoria taking in the local music played, this is certainly something I'd do; seek out and find wonderful acoustic guitar outside a Café or Bar. It deals quiet nicely with modern day relationships; in tune with our times this film is PG rated; which would not have been the case maybe ten years ago; dealing with sexual topic's on a PG shows life; moving forward. Overall perfectly watchable; evening in; glass of wine. Three and a half stars I'd give this; I wouldn't put this down as a return to form for Allen; comically speaking, but it's more than a likable film to watch; worth seeing.     Andrea Bowhill
B000VE439Y|3.0|As a HUGE fan of Monty Python and someone who has been watching the movies and shows since I was 6, I feel somewhat disappointed in this film. It felt like it was very slow and the funny was few and far between. I fully expect people to disagree with my OPINION. Of course there are certain parts that I love, but on the whole, it's just not my fave. So there.

B00005O3VC|5.0|This is a great movie filled with hilarious absurdities like the Knights who say Ni! and the Killer Rabbit and too many others to mention. I love this movie, it's an absolute classic. Should be watched over and over, preferably while partaking of the herb. Am I allowed to say that?
0891419195|5.0|This book should be required reading for everyone especially those who make the decisions about whether we wage war or not. I'm not into the logistics of troops and such. Rather the descriptions of daily living conditions and mindsets were haunting.
0439023483|5.0|I picked up The Hunger Games and didn't put it down (except to eat) for two days. I was so into the characters that when the book ended, I was actually upset. That doesn't happen to me all the time. I got this book because it was suggested by Stephen King and if it's good enough for Uncle Stevie, it's good enough for me. I told my mom about it and she got it from the library and she couldn't put it down either. She wouldn't even talk to me on the phone when she was reading it. For two days she wouldn't pick up the phone! So if you want to get lost in a book, pick up this one.

I'll be honest, I'm not some fancy Shakespeare buff, I'm just an average person who happens to enjoy great acting. And this film is full of great acting. The story of course is fantastic (I do love Shakespeare, when I can understand it) and the cast is exceptional. I love this movie and watch it again and again.

630587493X|5.0|Bicentennial Man is a neglected gem of a film. Though the story is as old as Ovid's Pygmalion, or better yet, The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi (1883), director Chris Columbus has taken a fresh look at the hoary tale, and in it, discovered a new world. Set in the not too distant future and spanning 200 years (hence the somewhat confusing title), it tells of the robot Andrew Martin (Robin Williams), purchased by 'Sir' Richard Martin (Sam Neill), to be a servant for his family. Sir notices that Andrew, though a machine, has the soul of an artist, and he nurtures and protects him, and also profits when Andrew proves adept at creating designer clocks.<br /><br />-----------------<br />Sir Martin: You're a unique robot, Andrew. I feel a responsibility to help you become -- whatever you're able to be.<br />==============================<br /><br />Though he has made both Sir and himself rich, he yearns for something more, and sets off on a quest to discover what he can become.<br /><br />He arrives back in San Francisco, and underneath the San Francisco Bay Bridge he finds his Geppetto, Rupert Burns (the ubiquitous Oliver Platt). Burns' father had worked at the factory that originally created Andrew, and his son now runs a vintage Harley Davidson/robot shop where he carries on his father's work. With Andrew's finances, and also his brilliant designs, they create synthetic organs, making men more machine-like, and they combine organic parts with Andrew, making him more and more human. The line between man and machine grows increasingly blurred.<br /><br />With the success of their new venture he arrives back at the Martin household to see what he at first thinks is the grown up Little Miss Amanda Martin (Embeth Davidtz), but it is actually Amanda's grand daughter, Portia Charney. Hallie Kate Eisenberg plays Little Miss Amanda Martin at age 7, and she is very cute, and familiar as a frequent guest on Jay Leno's Tonight Show. But Embeth Davidtz as Portia is really a revelation. She resembled an older and wiser Anne Hathaway, and I thought I had seen her before but couldn't place her. Looking at the list of films she's done, I haven't seen any of them, but that is about to change. How long has this been going on? As Ira Gershwin said:<br /><br />Oh, I feel that I could melt; into heaven I'm hurled<br />Now I know how Columbus felt, finding another world<br /><br />Andrew dislikes her at first, but then, as he becomes more and more human, he falls for her. His quest to become 'a real boy' accelerates accordingly. Embeth Davidtz is really stunning in a performance that takes her from young womanhood into old age.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Portia: I like you. I even understand you some of the time. But I'm not about to invest my emotions in a machine.<br />================================<br /><br />Kiersten Warren is also worthy of mention as Galatea, Rupert's female robot. She has been given a personality chip and can sing and dance; but she doesn't have that spark that drives Andrew. He finds her perky personality annoying, but she is a delight. The name Galatea refers to Pygmalion's statue that he falls in love with and wants to bring to life. Though Galatea was not the name of the statue in Ovid's original story, at some point it was added.<br /><br />It is strange to praise an actor for a performance when the effect is so dependent on special effects, but though embodied in robots the actors really showed their personalities. Both Williams and Warren did a fantastic job, but let's not forget the puppeteers, some of the finest I have seen in a film since Craig Schwartz performed \\"Ex Epistolis duorum amantium\\" based on the love letters of Abelard and Heloise.<br /><br />With all that Bicentennial Man had going for it, I am surprised that it wasn't more of a hit. I suppose the fates conspired against it.<br /><br />*((Gotta Put First Things First))*<br /><br />First, I think the title is confusing, and you'd expect the film to be set in 1976 with a patriotic theme. The name just doesn't say touching and heart felt robot sci fi film to me.<br /><br />Second, it was released around the same time as A.I., Artificial Intelligence. It had a similar theme as A.I. and that film didn't do as well as it should have either, considering that it was a proposed project of Stanley Kubrick finished by Steven Spielberg. Both films had production budgets of $100 million, but Bicentennial Man made less than $100 million back (But Bicentennial Man was released in 1999, while AI didn't come out until 2001, so the theory that AI saturated the robot movie market doesn't really hold up) (As a side note, Robin Williams has a voice cameo as Dr. Know in AI)).<br /><br />Third, Robin Williams was kind of experimenting with his screen persona around the time of Bicentennial Man. Trying to break out of his warm, tender, or funny characters, he was trying to get edgier, with the sinister children's show host Rainbow Randolph in Death To Smoochy, or the downright creepy Seymour Parrish in One Hour Photo. There was also a Robin Williams backlash in full swing from his treacly performances in two other, then-recent releases -- Patch Adams and Jakob the Liar. Did fear of seeing Robin as a creepy -- or even worse -- a treacly robot cause the audience to stay home in droves?<br /><br />Too bad, for they missed an excellent film, with gorgeous locations in and around San Francisco, or the San Francisco of the future. I know that Robin Williams lives in and loves San Francisco, but Chris Columbus was born in Pennsylvania and raised in Ohio, and has lived in England, Illinois, New York, and Los Angeles. He must have left his heart in San Francisco when he made Mrs. Doubtfire with Robin Williams in 1993, because he is now living in San Francisco.<br /><br />A great scene where Andrew and Portia dance at a formal ball could only happen in San Francisco. With full orchestra a jazz singer of the future performs two classic jazz standards, \\"Embraceable You\\" written by George and Ira Gershwin and \\"The Very Thought of You\\" by Ray Noble. It is rare that a director will allow two full performances of jazz to play out, given the short attention span of the modern audience. The singer reminded me of Paula West, who I used to enjoy at The Plush Room. Lo and behold, it was her! Though worthy of wider recognition, she is most well known in her home of San Francisco. I only wish they had let her do another Gershwin tune as well, \\"How Long Has This Been Going On?\\" As Ira Gershwin said:<br /><br />Oh, I feel that I could melt; into heaven I'm hurled<br />Now I know how Columbus felt, finding another world<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00133KFGW August Rush]] (2007) ....

6305736650|2.0|Casablanca was once described by a cineaste of note as 'the best bad film ever made'.  H L Mencken once quipped: \\"No one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.\\"  He may have been thinking of the growing box-office for this film.    What is the legitimacy of the 'expert's' (AFI, etc), director's, and the sheeple's glowing admiration?  Consider C Ptolemy's geocentric view of the solar system, and the ecclesiastic, scientific and public embrace across 1500 years for the lie. Questioning the dictum could eventuate in imprisonment, torture and death.  OK, that's ancient history.   The worship at the altar of the not-so-silver/noble screen...is this our new belief system? Religion? Our Restored Testament? Consider, on Amazon's comment sections, the bilious invective...the verbal inquisitions; virtual glossectomies, orchiectomies, and lobotomies decreed for heresy.    This was filmed rather extemporaneously, on a limited budget, and it shows. The people who made this knew it was kitsch.  There is nothing original in the final script. There is no drama, suspense, or character engaging enough to engage. If this antique egesta is golden, ancient coprolite should be priceless.     Stone-faced-no-affect Bogart? Could he play Hamlet? King Lear? Indiana Jones? Same guy, same expression in Sabrina, Big Sleep, Barefoot Contessa, Maltese Falcon, etc...He is AFI's #1 actor? With that recognition, he should smile once in a while. This is not a personal attack, as the man was wounded in WWI and attempted to enlist in WWII. A patriot deserving respect.  Bergman...again, always Bergman. Could she play Lady Macbeth? Perhaps. Tomb Raider's Lara Croft, even with CGI (that is a low blow)?  Neither Bogart nor Bergman, according to a new bio of Bergman, wanted to do the movie after reading the screenplay. Sharing a bottle of hooch, or shared second-hand smoke is as close to 'chemistry' as Bogart/Bergman get. Nothing happening in the test tube. Immiscible, cold compounds.    Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid were always good playing themselves. Is that acting?    Always hard to agree with Pauline Kael.

B00AEBB932|3.0|Shane's cinematographers make the same mistake their comrades made in two other westerns; \\"The Searchers\\" and \\"The Bravados\\" i.e,...scenes where there are moving autos in the background. Careless editing for what many consider masterpieces.<br /><br />Of the four principle characters, three are somewhat either miscast or irritating. Too bad William Holden didn't accept Heflin's role. It is easy to see why the kid quickly attaches himself to Alan Ladd (vis-a-vis his dad). Shane and the villain Ryker are the only two characters with a genuine screen presence. The character actors are more credible than either Heflin or Arthur. Additionally, the film would have been better had someone toned down that jimson-weed chewing kid.<br /><br />The majority of the population in the valley were, ostensibly, farmers. Yet we see no large irrigated fields, just small gardens. The winters in the Teton Valley are harsh. Perhaps they were all living off of tame deer...<br /><br />The film is quite derivative (black garbed shifty-eyed gunslinger, evil cattle baron, faithful mongrel, mysterious stranger, and unconsummated love triangle). No new ground, here. The film's finest moment comes at its conclusion: Shane riding into the mountains, gut-shot and facing a protracted death. That is an unusual denouement for a western hero.<br />The marginal farming milieu and the stoic character of the people who populated it is never convincing. Compare this film with \\"Heartland\\", another turn of the century Wyoming tale. Shane is a pleasant enough western, but certainly not the masterpiece  many praise it to be.<br /><br />The score is memorable; worth the price of the DVD. The telephoto cinematography spectacular. Sad to compare the Teton Valley of 60 years ago to today.

0307346617|5.0|Being a zombie films addict, I must say I was predisposed to enjoy the book, but it has been a real surprise...<br /><br />The book is a compedium of small stories, told 10 years after World War III, aka World War Z because it was not fought between humans, but between humanity and a world-scale zombie plague. With this curious but not nobel-winning plot you could expect anything, and the results are amazingly good.<br /><br />Brooks has taken a \\"realistic\\" approach, explaining as much as possible (taking into account we're talking about zombies ;) of the science of the plague, how it spreads around the world, how different countries, governments and cultures react to it, how each of the survivors is able to tell his/her history, etcetera.<br /><br />I really like the approach. You never get tired of a history you don't like because they are at most 10 pages long. In fact, sometimes you end with the desire of knowing more of particular histories or survivors, more about what happened.<br /><br />We have all sort of histories, from frozen zombies in the northen part of the globe, to military mistakes that end with heavy decimation of the US forces, doctors, rich and powerful people...<br /><br />The author touches a lot of cliches, from typical zombie movies ones, adaptations of \\"I Am Legend\\" (even the military call some survivors LMoE, Last Man on Earth, for their surviving skills), interesting (and some very clever) tactics to detect and avoid zombies (using trained dogs, placing tape on the perimeters of the bases so that if a tape is broken a zombie is inside,...).<br /><br />I enjoyed a lot the scientific approach to how to survive a global zombie plague, how would each government reach, what would happen if you were in the coast, in a city, in a small village, in the jungle, in a boat... Even how you could try to make money from the situation.<br /><br />Really a lot of situations and themes have been cleverly though and depicted in the short stories.<br /><br />The book hooks you until you finish it. It felt a bit short for my personal taste, and the finale was a bit too typical (very... \\"patriotic\\").<br /><br />Definetly a recommendation for reading as soon as possible ;)r my personal taste, and the finale was a bit too typical (very... \\"patriotic\\").

032147404X|3.0|Lots of basic information, presented in a likable style, with enough tips to please anyone.  You won't become a master of digital photography reading this book -- or from reading any of the two very similar followups -- but this book is a painless way to acquire a foundation without having to study very hard.  Kelby is the master at doing this, and sort of the Dan Brown of digital imaging.  If you don't have a lot of exposure to photography, this book will certainly satisfy your initial curiosity.

I found myself despising both of them for their selfishness, yet feeling sad at the tragedy that ensued as a result of their actions.  A writer who can rouse your emotions has done a good job!
0895260131|5.0|This book is an unflinching account of the real history of Muslim imperialism, which raged across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa and turned the conquered lands into slave-like client states. Countless once-thriving cultures of Christians, Jews and other faiths were wiped off the map.    Under the Muslim armies, the religions and cultures of the defeated states were suppressed and the people subject to brutal laws that controlled every aspect of life. Although a rare few caliphs were merciful to their subjects, and others let them scratch out a modest existence if they paid the jizya tax or converted to Islam, many had no compunctions about confiscating or destroying the property and fortunes of others. Followers of non-Muslim faiths were subjected to imprisonment or death. This carried on for centuries-- until the Crusaders rose up and broke the back of Muslim domination. If you've been taught that the Crusades began for no reason other than bloodlust and vanquished unsuspecting Muslim peaceniks, get ready to have your blinders removed. Spencer also does an excellent job of connecting the events of the past to the jihadists of today. The turmoil of the present day didn't come out of thin air, and it isn't going away for a while.    So the next time you hear the usual babble about jihadists as victims of Western oppression, you'll know to raise your eyebrows-- and tell people about this book. Oh, and for those who think Spencer is a knee-jerk anti-Muslim demagogue-- Spencer makes repeated pleas to Muslims who want to truly reach out to others and make a better life for themselves, to examine the Koran and rescue it from the people who live in an us-versus-them scenario. Don't make assumptions, learn for yourself. You will be thankful that you did.

B00007EDY5|4.0|I bought a few Impact EX100A flashes a month ago, but my Nikon did not have a PC sync connector.  I feel rather ripped off that Nikon did not have this connector, but this adapter works very well.  My only complaint is that that adapter takes up a hot shoe on the camera and does not have one of its own, so I had to buy another hot shoe adapter for my small flash.  I could not find a product that did both.  Overall, it works great.

B000AOEMXM|5.0|I was delighted to see the complete series of Enterprise offered at a discounted price when the new movie came out. It's unfortunate that the legions of Star Trek fans deserted Enterprise just as it was building up steam. With the telecast nights changing from season to season, the series never had a proper chance to find its audience. Plus, for some reason the hard-core trekers seemed miffed at the show. Some said it was because the theme song had words. Can you believe it? For me, Enterprise remains my favorite of all the Star Treks, with The Next Generation coming in a close second. What many ST fans often forget is TNG took a few seasons to build up a good following. Enterprise has it all: a dynamite cast, fine acting, great writing, fascinating characters, engrossing story arcs... It's a shame the producers abandoned it after the fantastic story lines of the final two seasons. Equally shameful was the last episode, which was totally inappropriate and a cop out. With the success of the new Star Trek movie, I have hopes that the old series will experience a resurgence in popularity and perhaps the Star Trek fan base will finally realize how good Enterprise was.
0452295548|5.0|A mind-blowing account of the author's experience before, during, and after a major hemorrhagic stroke due to an AVM. This book leads to the question, \\"who am I\\" or, \\"who is this 'I' I take myself to be?\\". Very thought-provoking for those with an open mind.<br /><br />What makes this book especially interesting is that the author is a brain researcher and describes and explains the way our brains work so anyone can understand.<br /><br />We clearly have far more control over our daily experience than we imagine. Read this book to find out how and why.<br /><br />With much insight, this book fascinates and, ultimately, inspires us to tend the gardens of our minds.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0385340990|5.0|The books' name is different and its' title will attract purchasers attention.  This is a chic lit book and an easy book to read as it is composed of only letters.  Juliet Ashton is a successful writer and journalist who has become bored with her London life and her success.  She is dating a handsome, rich American who she knows will try to dominate her if she marries him.  She's a self made woman who refuses to be a yes lady.  So she unceremoniouly dumps him.  She receives a letter from a man living on Guernsey and decides to write a book about Guersney and how the natives survived World War II because this book takes place not long after the war.  And away to Guernsey she goes.  Her best friend  the person she writes to the most and receives most of her mail from is Sidney, a gay man, and an older brother to her.<br /><br />The book is composed of characters writing and receiving mail to and from each other and there are many characters.  The reader meets the letter writers only through their letters.  Then the plot becomes darker as the islanders write of the terrors of German occupation, the brutality, the separation from family members, starvation and having to do with little.  Because of the depravation members of the literary society become closer and more caring of each other.  Many even learned they liked to read even the classics.  One lady, Isola, kept jumping from one interest to another.  She, apparently, didn't know what to be when she grew up.  Then there was heroine Elizabeth who Juliet met through the islanders talk about her and what a wonderful and caring person she was and how she would go to bat for others during this terrible time.  She was betrayed and sent to a German concentration camp where she died.  The act was done by an evil man for gifts from the Germans.  She left a little daughter, Kit, who the islanders adored, took care of and doted on.  Childless Juliet decided she wanted to adopt the child, live and work on Guernsey and get away from the mad rush of London.  The books ends with her writing to friend Sidney that he must come back to Guernsey to give her away.  She had planned to marry Dawsey, a quiet introverted man and the complete opposite of Juliet.

This anthropology lesson and the Nike shoe conspiracy are among the best parts of this book. The nutritonal secrets and the various races should have been organized without the lengthy transgressions into various subtopics. The main story struggles at times for a cohesive flow. Still enjoyable and entertaining ... but not 5 stars.

0812976525|4.0|Christopher Buckley's send-up of Washington lobbyists, politicians, Neo-Puritanism, and self-righteous crusading is side-splitting satire about the life of Nick Naylor, chief spokesman for the fictional Academy of Tobacco Studies, the cigarette industry's big lobby on Capitol Hill. Nick's job is to cast cigarette smoking in a positive light, or at least to obstruct those who would censure tobacco. In short, to save the tobacco industry from its enemies. He's a handsome, fast-talking guy who is a hit in television interviews. But Nick's job is in jeopardy from his disapproving boss. He wants cigarettes back in Hollywood movies. A liberal senator wants to label the packs with a skull and crossbones. A former tobacco spokesman, now dying from cancer, needs to be bribed. And Nick's life is threatened by a caller on Larry King. For starters. Such are the trials of a tobacco lobbyist.<br /><br />Nick Naylor is a Great Manipulator. He's good at what he does. Hilariously good. \\"Thank You for Smoking\\" is a politically incorrect peek at Washington power politics. Like all good satire, it is not so much an exaggeration as a distillation of reality. I enjoyed the book, especially the first half. But I think it runs out of steam before the end and becomes over-plotted. Jason Reitman's 2006 film simplified the story, and, I thought at the time, unwisely expanded the role of Nick's son in order to make him more sympathetic. But, in the end, I think the film was more hard-hitting, though necessarily more narrow. They're both very funny, and the book touches on some subjects the film does not. Its biggest flaw may be that we grow fond enough of Nick that we don't want to see him fail or suffer. It has some shortcomings, but Buckley packs a lot of insight and laughs into \\"Thank You for Smoking\\".
B00000J5Z6|3.0|Jazz pianist Monty Alexander is joined on this session by his regular rhythm section and by a Jamaican aggregation in an attempt to fuse together the reggae sounds of Bob Marley and the sounds of straight ahead piano jazz. Without vocals, the resulting music is sometimes a bit thin, sounding a bit too much like cocktail jazz in places--but even in those moments, it sounds like really good cocktail jazz (but it never sounds like really good reggae, alas--but if it did, it would no longer be very good cocktail jazz, much less really good jazz). The best cuts are the two in which trombonist Steve Turre joins in, \\"Running Away\\" and \\"I Shot the Sheriff.\\" A recording with more Turre would be really jammin', but when all is said and done, this recording is pretty good. On the sonic side, this CD apparently marks the debut of Telarc's use of the Sony DSD system for making recordings (bit-mapped down to standard 16-bit CD format, of course).
B00003CX9E|5.0|I bought this film thinking it was one of those droning classic films that make you wait two hours before realizing what the hell is going on... well, I was wrong! Citizen Kane was a funny satire and I enjoyed watching every second. I never realized how much of a heartthrob Orson Welles was, hubba hubba! It was an interesting film, and I'm sure you'll take a piece with you after it has finished, I'm sure I did.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|I enjoyed this film very much! Needless to say, I was very much excited to see that Eugene Hutz (Gogol Bordell0, band) was one of the main characters, next to Elijah, of course. When I read the description I thought the movie was going to be a little... \\"eh\\" but it ended up blowing me away. Eugene's character is absolutely hilarious and will have you cracking up every single second. Definite must see, just for the Eugene factor itself.
0321544080|5.0|This book won't make you a professional, world-class photographer. Let's just say that up front. Watching the NBA won't make you LeBron either, but that doesn't mean you can't learn moves to use at the gym. And that's the point of this book. McNally shows an outstanding shot, and then explains what he was thinking, what he was going through, how he managed to get it.    You'll probably never hang from the Empire State Building or get a private audience with James Brown, but you might go on vacation and stand on a ledge or be the only person with a camera at a friend's birthday. The principles turn out to be the same: get your angle, shoot a lot of different ways, look for interesting lighting.    No surprise, the images in this book are OUTSTANDING. If you collect photographs, buy it just for those.
B000021Y77|5.0|We all know that Germans make great stuff. (and I quote the guy from Shamwow who beat up a hooker. yes, I went there!) This film was nothing short of excellent. We watched it in my theater 7B class and I just HAD to own it on dvd. Next to films like The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari and Das Boot, this film is surely a great piece that should grace every collector and movie buff's dvd rack. Franka Potente (Bourne Identity) is just amazing in this film, one of her best roles in my opinion. The storyline will have you hooked from the very beginning, and the ending just blew me away! It was such a fun film to watch, you'll get in on the excitement as well!
B000TDGGVU|5.0|People need heuristics to help them make decisions. Schwartz makes this point, then explains what it means. He shows that the plethora of \\"good enough\\" products makes it difficult to make choices, because you're not deciding between good and bad but rather between just-as-good. As a result we become paralyzed by choice. Fair enough, but if you've ever gone to Walmart and stared at the aisles of seemingly-identical product you know this feeling.    He then talks about how some people who are willing to choose by picking good-enough can find themselves more satisfied than those who need the very best, because the latter category end up with analysis paralysis, are always second-guessing themselves, etc. It's this second aspect that really earns the book its good reviews because this isn't obvious just from standing in the store. Lower your standards and feel better about yourself - pretty counterintuitive, but Schwartz makes a compelling case that it's the right approach for personal happiness.    Schwartz writes well and clearly. His examples are known to people who have read studies on this area but that doesn't make them any less effective or worthwhile here, and they are well-used in his analysis.
0563214546|4.0|My wife has almost a library of cook books but refers most frequently to only a few. She had a copy of this book for years and used it a lot but recently misplaced it, so I bought her another copy. This is a very comprehensive book.

1591391105|5.0|This book presents essential knowledge for new managers to help them quickly lay a strong foundation for success.  It does so in a jargon-free manner and in a well-organized format.  The table of contents acts as an outline and overview.  Five core or fundamental propositions are presented in the introduction, explored in ten chapters, and revisited in the conclusion.<br /><br />Implementation of high-level principles is supported with practical advice.  I was especially impressed with the scope of the the book such as the wise inclusion of pitfalls such as family issues created by a move.  The information is consistently helpful, practical and based on experience and observation rather than being purely theoretical.  The book lends itself to quick reading and then extended study and use.<br /><br />I would recommend The First 90 Days for all new leaders, or even leaders undertaking new projects, without reservation.  MBA schools would do well to give all students a copy of it with their diplomas and businesses would do well to give a copy to all new managers.

B0028SBGQO|5.0|We start out with an old man in front of a skeeball location getting the snot beat out of him, then a flash to the story. Evidently two ejected angels sent to Wisconsin for the duration have found a loophole that will allow them to return to Heaven unscathed. Seems that no one from above or below really wants this to happen. So several beings with their own agenda are coercing Bethany Sloane (Linda Fiorentino) to do their dirty work as she unknowingly is the only one qualified.<br /><br />Will Bethany be able to stop the two angels before it is too late? Or is there a sinister unnamed force helping the fallen angels to succeed?<br /><br />Some of the actors are just coasting through the movie (probably to pick up some spending cash).  But Alan Rickman is excellent as usual and plays the indignant part to the hilt. See him again in \\"Galaxy Quest\\" made the same year.<br /><br />Defiantly designed for certain genre tastes (sort of a cross between Ghost Busters and Monty Python with a little Arthur Miller tossed in.) I personally found it a tad too potty mouthed and over obsessed with sex. Other than that it brings up good premises and a few eternal questions.

0385338724|5.0|I immensily enjoy Sophie Kinsella, aka Madeline Wickham, as an author. Her books are light, but are filled with humor. They always transport you into another world because her characters are so alive.    Remember Me? - Is a fantastic book. It keeps you guessing until the end. While the plot reminds you of romantic comedies you have seen, the protagonist is immediately loveable and causes you to fall into the storyline. You feel for her from the moment you meet her. What would it be like to wake up and have no recollection of the past few years? What's even better, she has a life that is WAY better than the one she remembers. She is gorgeous, married to a handsome man, and successful. It seems like her life is perfect, but you will soon find out that everything is not what it seems. This book made me laugh out load. Ms.Kinsella is a beautiful writer, and this book will not disappoint. :)

B000F1IQN2|4.0|I missed \\"Munich\\" when it was originally released but I recall the reviews at the time.  As I understood it, \\"Munich\\" was criticized for being too \\"soft\\" on the Palistinians.  After watching it last night, I understand that criticism somewhat but that isn't my criticism of the film.      I was 20 at the time of the horrible event at the Munich Olympics and I am surprized as to how little I knew about the details.  I discovered how limited my knowledge was when I watched the excellent documentary \\"One Day in September\\".  That film was electrifying and it was the unanticipated standard that emerged as I was watching \\"Munich\\".  I was put on guard with the opening note \\"Based on an actual event\\" (or words to that effect).  What could be more rivitting than the actual events?  Well, not \\"Munich\\" as it turned out.  I did not play Spielburg's introduction to the film so maybe there was something in that which could have assuaged my concerns.  Nonetheless, I took heart in realizing that this movie would be about the ruthless and systematic search and destruction of the group that plotted the outrageous act.  That went well until I started questioning who, what and WHY was there a family that, for a price, did all the search and location of the enemy participants.  I realized right away that this had to be a fictionalized short cut that denied us the greater appreciation as to how the \\"good guys\\" were able to locate the \\"bad guys\\".  I assumed, with disappointment, that it was an effort to save time on the already lengthy script.  It bothered me and I couldn't let it go.  It may have served in a symbolic way although I didn't get a point worthy of its' inclusion.  It did give us a perspective, in time, of the hunters becoming the hunted.    Ultimately, the message I got from \\"Munich\\" was that violence is its' own reward.  The individual in charge of the actual search and destruction metamorphs into a very troubled individual.  The overall theme that I found is that hate met with revenge reproduces itself endlessly until a new dirrection is introduced.  Tell that to the Israeli's who don't have many options to safely experiment with.  There were elements of world-wide politics that were introduced to the movies and many might have caught some conspiritorial meaning in those allusions.  However, I was immune to that since that French family of missing person brokers convinced me it was all fiction anyway.  If you thought that \\"Munich\\" was interesting from an historical perspective, be sure and get the better (and more dramatic) reality from \\"One Day in September\\".
B001EO748M|3.0|The backdrops and costumes are beautifully done. The acting is good. The stories are a blend of history and historical fiction that fills in the pieces of cultural life back then, but I got bored with the piece before the end of the season. Most of the story was focused on Henry VIII and I didn't think he was interesting enough to carry the whole series. I would have preferred to have other characters fleshed out a bit as well as developing supporting story lines. Still, it's not a bad way to spend some time.

My husband Tivoed Darjeeling Ltd last year, burned it to a dvd, and we finally just watched it.  I'm a 59 year old woman who identified with Owen Wilson's oldest sibling character. I howled as I realized this movie was making fun of ME, as well as my two brothers.  For those who give it one or two stars, you must have grown up in an ideal, non-dysfunctional household - lucky you.  But for so many of us, this movie hit home and, while being hilarious, also brings back a lot of unwanted memories.

Jumping straight into watching the movie without knowing its history may confuse you.<br />First, read the book that tells you of this girl's case:<br />[[ASIN:1597524328 The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel]]<br />If you own this DVD, please watch through all the commentaries of this Special Edition DVD first to understand the intentions of the director and producer in the making of this movie. Listen to the director's commentary on what the movie is trying to convey or not convey. The special features of the DVD are a must to understand what the message of the movie is all about.<br /><br />If you're just looking for a quick horror cinema thrill, stay with the usual fiction and cheap tricks produced elsewhere.<br /><br />If you're not asking yourself in-depth questions about the supernatural by the time you finish watching this DVD, you've learnt nothing at all.<br /><br />So, what actually happened to Emily Rose (case of Anneliese Michel)?<br />Who knows and why?<br /><br />It never ceases to amaze me as to how critics who like to see themselves as<br />\\"learned men and women\\" or some so-called \\"impartial jury\\" (no jury is unbiased) can needlessly speculate, judge, criticize and comment on what has happened to the victim and the priest when they don't even know the situations they were in, and especially when these critics were not physically present in the situation of the victim! Can we make any judgements on the victim or the priest based on any book or any Hollywood movie? Hell, no!<br /><br />Why don't you ask the victim what happened to her? Wait, sorry, she's dead and the public has only secondary and other speculative sources to make judgements on the poor girl and the priest who tried to help her. What actually happened? Who knows?! Authors and movie directors can only give so much in view of the trajectories of their own thoughts on what might have happened.<br /><br />Since this movie is based on a true story (of Anneliese Michel), the challenge for me as a viewer is to ask the perennial question on why God would allow an innocent person to suffer like this so that unbelievers may believe in His saving grace and power? Why not let all the evil men and evil women of today's evil world end up like this? Send the devil to all those unbelievers and people that deserve this sort of suffering.<br /><br />Excerpt from the movie where Emily Rose has a vision of the Blessed<br />Virgin Mary:<br /><br />BVM: \\"Emily, Heaven is not blind to your pain.\\"<br /><br />Emily: \\"Why do I suffer like this?\\"<br /><br />BVM: \\"I'm sorry, Emily...<br />You can come with me in peace,<br />free of your bodily form<br />or you can choose to continue this.<br /><br />You will suffer greatly.<br />But through you many will come to see<br />that the realm of the spirit is real.<br />The choice is yours.\\"<br /><br />Emily: \\"I choose to stay.\\"<br /><br />The next time BVM calls me, I'll be saying that it is not believers that need convincing. Jesus died for all more than 2000 years ago, till today, 5/6 of the world's population still reject Him. The sufferings of visionaries and believers only get mocked in today's world, how about telling God to generously bestow all these evils on the unbelievers and the world's evil-doers instead? I'm very sure there is no shortage of evil people everywhere that God can't smite in this earthly lifetime. No need to wait till the afterlife to give them surprises.<br /><br />It is very sad to know that the afflicted victim in this case had to die.<br />With God's blessing, may she return to haunt all evil men and evil women of this evil world!<br /><br />In my opinion, this is the greatest movie that boldly displays the suffering of the afflicted victim with such horror that can numb any human mind. The overwhelming terror you see in this rare case reflects reality of some real life exorcisms. If you're a skeptic and have never seen such suffering first-hand in real life, you don't know what you're missing. Ignorance may be bliss, but truth can be terrifying.<br /><br />Father Moore to defense attorney Erin Bruner:<br /><br />\\"Once you've looked into the Darkness,<br /> you will carry it for the rest of your life.<br /> I believe you've seen the Darkness.\\" ......<br /><br />Recommended reading and viewing:<br /><br />[[ASIN:006065337X Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061238171 The Dark Sacrament: True Stories of Modern-Day Demon Possession and Exorcism]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0312977379 Beware the Night]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0595246184 The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385522703 The Rite: The Making of a Modern Exorcist]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:059547909X The Devil Called Collect: The Exorcism of Jessica Leek]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000524CY The Exorcist (The Version You've Never Seen)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002348RFQ The Possessed]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001BCUB46 A Haunting - Seasons 1-4]]arthly lifetime.

B00008WG3U|5.0|Fast, fun, furious and laden with great hooks from master craftsman (who only pretend to be drunken doofuses).  Its Bush era anger and humor is for the ages.  One of my favorite releases ever.
0684857219|4.0|This book is really useful as a guide for self training with weights, although there are sections more interesting than others, in general it is a good guide for beginners like me. It is worth to look for the updated version as it covers topics which were not included in the first book release.
B00005QFE5|5.0|go to your nearest dvd store and buy all of Zhang Yimous films then get a case of your favourite Amber Nectar a huge Chinese takeaway and ENJOY!!
0316024597|2.0|This was purchased as a gift for another person.  Don't know about this book or its Author.  I read a bit and found it not to my liking.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This album foreshadowed everything for Michael Jackson. \\"Off The Wall\\" - the single - is (in my view) his best single. That song blends pop, disco, and reshapes MJ's approach (w/ Q. Jones) which eventually would change pop music. \\"Thriller\\" would not have been the same without this great record as a precedent. \\"Off The Wall\\" was pretentious long before being pretentious was standard with MJ which is what makes this record cool. \\"Off The Wall\\" - the album - is one of the great pop albums and if someone said it was as good as \\"Thriller\\" I wouldn't disagree.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I really love this DVD set, it was great to have all the shows in one compact package, and everything was beautifully done and in great shape.
B0026OE2O8|5.0|Excellent story of Earth our home and changes that are occuring. Excellent sound and video. Highly recommend it.
0486448843|4.0|It was nice to have these in a postcard format to share with friends and use as bookmarks.  The only thing I would change is to 'standardize' the size a bit more so that the cards were consistent in case someone wanted to use them for a project.
B00000DHZJ|3.0|...this is a 2.5 star CD for me.    I grew up listening to him and contemporaries of the time, but don't own a single one of his albums.  Looking to correct that, this CD seemed a place to start.    But getting objective reviews here turned out to be nearly impossible.  There was a lot of crap to wade through from Jimi Lovers to Jimi Haters to those who loved to hate Jimi Lovers and vice versa, about what it wasn't rather than what it is.    So I bought the CD anyway.  It has almost all the songs that got air play.  A few were too long for most stations but KSAN and KMPX (both San Francisco) would routinely play long cuts and album sides (for those who remember what those were).    It doesn't matter to me if Hendrix was the greatest, not the greatest, or lip-synced to Milli Vanilli.  Do I enjoy the music or not? Do I want to listen to it again and again?  Yes I do.  This CD has a lot of his stuff that I liked then and now.    But-- the production values disappoint. Had there been more detail on them in the reviews there would have been one less sale.  This CD is labeled [Remastered] but I don't know to what end.  It seems to have compressed dynamic range and not much detail in the high end.  Some cuts lack the energy they had in other albums.  And energy can compensate for a multitude of \\"sins\\" that people may find in his and other performers music.  There are studio albums (maybe some of his?) that have a more intensity and make me want to jump up and play air guitar, and no not the video game.  This CD isn't one of them.    Besides the compression and reduced frequency response, many of these songs end sooner than they originally did leaving me with a \\"Hey where'd the music go?!\\" feeling.  Almost like your girlfriend saying \\"Is that all there is?!\\" (*Your* girlfriend, not mine.)    There is some occasional noise.  Given the tech of the time wasn't universally great, I can live with that.  And I grew up with vinyl.  But the presence seemed a little lacking, almostlike hearing a concert from the very back rows.    While not an audiophile or even an audio snob, I've got some good kit in my house and car and I like to crank music up appropriately.  In the house this CD is just loud, not \\"crankin' \\".  In the car with a little road noise and the sensation of movement, I'll sing out loud.  Now the CD lives in the car.    So for various reasons and under most circumstances, this CD feels somewhat flat and artificial.  In the car it rocks ok.  If it were re-released with my quibbles corrected, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.  Even so, others definitely enjoy it far more than I do.    His first two CDs have been re-released as [Remastered] but that gives me pause.    I know, it's only Rock and Roll.
B001W63DX2|5.0|I have seen many concert video's, but this is the best I've seen so far.
B000FQVY2C|5.0|This classic 1973 album has been enhanced by the addition of 11 tracks of demos and alternate takes. Paris 1919 is atypical for John Cale, being consistently tuneful and mainstream with little experimentation. Some of his most poetic lyrics are found on these elegant songs, most of which are ballads that bring to mind the music of Scott Walker at his creative peak on [[ASIN:B00004TREG Boy Child 67-70]]. A reggae ditty and a powerful rock song ensure stylistic variety.<br /><br />There is a subdued, desolate air about Child's Christmas in Wales, Hanky Panky Nohow and Half Past France while subdued, whispered vocals make Antarctica a brooding, moody track. With its impressive orchestral backing Paris 1919 is less of a rock album than most of his best later work, like for example the three [[ASIN:B000001E9K Island Years]] albums. The exception is Macbeth, a robust, even blistering slice of up-tempo rock.<br /><br />The ballad arrangements may be orchestral but the melodies are simple and appealing for the most part, as on the lovely Andalucia. The delightful title track with its edgy arrangement, birdsong and refrain of \\"you're a ghost, la la la\\" is especially striking, while the lilting reggae beat and trenchant lyrics of [[ASIN:0143039105 Graham Greene]] render it catchy and charming. Paris 1919 is simultaneously a very 'literary' album and Cale at his most accessible. The bonus tracks are interesting but there's nothing exceptional about any of them.
