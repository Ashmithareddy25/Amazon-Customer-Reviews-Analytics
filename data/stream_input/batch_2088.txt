B007V9YF5E|1.0|This is almost as pathetic as striptease. Awful acting. Awful everything. Even the 'martial arts' are galatically bad and poorly choreographed. Rent an episode of sesame street instead.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|End to end awesome. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next one. Just make it longer for more reading time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and it takes u to different places like New York and Rio that's all I've been to so far. And u can get people from those cities and stuff.  REALLY GOOD GAME I RECOMMEND IT. O IT WORKS FOR KINDLE FIRE AND IPOD TOUCH.THAT'S ALL I KNOW
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very creative, hot, steamy on the edge of your set reading. I think every girl would like a fifty shades!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best and first game I've downloaded on Christmas morning 2012.This is the best app that I've purchased.It's a VERY addicting game!I love it! :)
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really didn't get any directions with this game.  I am just kind of playing it.  Do I need to be in facebook when I play the game?  So far I like what I can play, but would love to be able to know what all the stuff means.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A lot more fun. And better graphics than the first temple run. I personally love the huge gorilla thing and the revive with the diamonds.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game.  It is a big challenge to match all the tiles from 1-2-or3 different blocks or shapes.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I've read several books by Follett, and every time, I always wish the book would continue on and on and on.  This story is rich with detail, easy to picture in my mind, and Follett has a special way to capture and express the human emotions of his characters.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Again, there were no directions with this game.  All I know is that I have to push the coins inot the hole.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|The best book on diet and weight loss that I have ever read.  If only scientists and our government would follow it's tenets instead of the misguided &#34;low fat, low cholesterol&#34; rubbish they have been espousing for a generation, out society would not be nearly as obese and unhealthy as it is at present.  A real eye-opener.
0345457692|5.0|This book was badass. Perfectly paced, gritty and violent, but also incredibly steamy at times. A wonderful melding of sci-fi and noir detective stories. It was quite violent, but I can forgive that. I read the entire thing in one go. Will be getting the next books for sure.
1455502758|5.0|Mortality by Christopher Hitchens<br />It is be fitting that thoughts of mortality should crop up at the end of 2012, an eventful year that seemed to have run off too fast.<br />On New Year's Day, 2013, I read Christopher Hitchens' `Mortality' that focused on the last 18 months of Christopher Hitchens' life of cancer, a time when he lived `dyingly'. His father had died at the age of 79 with a similar cancer. A 61 Hitchens felt he could possibly outdo that, live longer than this father. He would live `to read - if indeed not to write - the obituaries of elderly villains like Henry Kissinger and Joseph Ratzinger.'<br />`Mortality' begins with an introduction by Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair Editor, and ends with a touching afterword by Carol Blue, Hitchen's widow. This last book, written while ill with cancer, mostly during the time in the hospital, is both awe-inspiring and sad. It gives a candid insight into the anger, grief and pain of a brilliant thinker, speaker and writer. He writes graphically. Stark, frank descriptions of the evil of his illness - cancer of the esophagus. His speech was often affected and he ended up unable to read and write. This is the worst tragedy that could befall a writer, reader and debater.<br />He denounced and convincingly discredited Nietzsche's famous maxim that `whatever doesn't kill me makes me stronger'.<br />It was while he was busy promoting his memoir Hitch22 that he learned of his illness. In Carol Blue's words, he `insisted ferociously on living' and carried on with his public-speaking engagements even when it meant vomiting `with an extraordinary combination of accuracy, neatness, violence, and profusion' before going on stage'.<br />Hitchens writes `I have more than once in my time woken up feeling like death. But nothing prepared me for the early morning in June (2010) when I came to consciousness feeling as if I were actually shackled to my own corpse.'<br />`All of life is a wager.'<br />Throughout his illness he remained objective, not fatalistic but recognizing the certainty. Many new treatments were tried. If they did not work on him he hoped they would be ready and available soon for future suffers.<br />The day 21 September 2011 was set aside as Hitchens prayer day by both well-wishers and not so well-wishers. Everyone would pray for Hitchens. People prayed for him to suffer and die as punishment for his disbelief in a god; others prayed for him to get well so he might repent, know the mercy of a good god; and yet others prayed he would convert before it was too late.<br />He remained true to the ideas that animated his life. He never gave up his principles, his beliefs, his honesty and convictions. He was not going to become an abject creature and throw himself before a god he knew did not exist. An ethical life is possible without religion.<br />When giving an interview to Anderson Cooper on CNN 360 in August 2010, he stressed his beliefs, saying he was not about to give up and find religion in the last days. When promoting his book `God Is Not Great' he did not go seeking like-minded people but went to the American Bible Belt to debate.<br />Hitchens continued to burn the candle at both ends. He kept up book tours, speaking events and debates. He did not think it proper to cancel bookings, arrangements that involved much preparation on the part of a great number of organizers.<br />In the first part of his memoir Hitch22, he wrote about death:<br />`One always knows there is a term-limit to lifespan, just as one always knows that illness or accident or incapacity, physical and mental, are never more than a single breath away'. A premonition?<br />He continued to write for Vanity Fair and, as he said, it was not as parade of his illness but the narrative of his life.<br />Hitchens' great sense of humour was evident at all times. Once when debating with him on `Freedoms of Speech', Shashi Tharoor, in the midst of the debate, burst out laughing and declared he could debate Hitchens as he enjoyed him too much.<br />At the BBC Munk event in Canada, on Thanksgiving Day, 24 November 2011, a short time before his death, Hitchens debated Tony Blair on the subject of `Religion: a Force for Good in the World'. The debate lasted for one and a half hours of lucid and intelligent talk. His pain and discomfort, and the deteriorating effects of his illness, were clearly evident.<br />`Practise staying alive but prepare for death.' He wrote with dignity, heroically accepting his situation and refusing to let it stop him writing an inspiring book. In the last few pages of this short book he only managed to scribble notes to his editor.<br />Hitchens, a brilliant thinker, writer, speaker, debater and humourist remained all that to the last and then we lost him on 15 December 2011.<br />Many friends, writers and celebrities attended his memorial. Here is a link to Part 1 of Vanity Fair`s memorial for Christopher Hitchens. I found the readings of his essay The Vietnam Syndrome by Sean Penn quite powerful and Salman Rushdie chose to read a humorous one `Porcophobia'.<br />Hitchens left us many messages but one stands prominent for me:<br />`Think For Yourself'
0345803485|1.0|I have no idea why I fell into the trap of reading this. It was awful. Truly terrible. Cardboard characters, little real plot, poor writing. There wasn't much redeeming about it. I made it a few chapters in then threw in the towel. Just goes to show that millions of copies don't make something good.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it because it was free,  Easy to use. Don't know what else to tell you.  I love it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game it's Speaks to me very much it's more great than temple run and gets things like focus inside your brain
B003VANOFY|5.0|I had been using a hard wired headset for several years and on more than one occasion the wires would get tangled in something.  I've owned this headset a couple of weeks and what a difference.  I originally had the USB plugged into a multi-port USB extender and I noticed a slight clicking sound.  I removed the USB device from the extender and plugged it directly into the computer and that took care of the clicking noise.  I had to go out of town for a week and even though I didn't plug the headset into charge while I was gone, I found no degradation in the battery.  I would highly recommend this headset.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Seems easy to use on my tablet.  I am still trying to figure everything out on this tablet.  I am conquering the learning curve.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever produced. I have all of them on Amazon streaming video. Stopped buyong DVDs ages ago, running out of room to store them. My entire collection is either British sitcoms, British mysteries, (Midsomer Murders is incredible !) or British drama and detective series, (Inspector Morse can't be compared). The Brits know how to produce quality, unlike American dreck.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg this game is so fun I stay on this game 24\7 I love it I told my brother and sister about it they love it too and I bet you will too!!!! [:  ^.^  <3
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|Fun movie if you like to see someone kick butt! A little Channing Tatum isn't bad either. I'm looking forward to more movies with Gina Carano.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|U will have fun with the game it is the first time I played it And I love it !
1400067820|5.0|Mr. Taleb is a world changer.  His critics are fearful of the power in his ideas, plus they have no clue as to what he is talking about.  He will change the world with his ideas in a positive way and not the destructive way of politics.  This is a follow-on book to &#34;Fooled by Randomness&#34;  and &#34;The Black Swan&#34;.  Read them in order to get the most out of him.  He has some great youtube videos.  He does not suffer fools gladly.<br />&#34;If you see fraud, and don't yell fraud, then you are a fraud&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|People should try this game it's awesome  and it's just like this game called temple run but in a subway
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I have fallen in love with British films--movies and series such as Downton Abbey.  I purchased Season 1 and 2 hoping I would enjoy them and ENJOY I DID!!  It was like a book I couldn't put down.  It's so nice to relax and watch a DVD without cringing at foul language, nudity, sex scenes, and violence.  Thank you Masterpiece Theater for a wonderful experience as I watched Season 1 and 2.  I breathlessly await Season 3--I ordered it this weekend.  I'm sure after reading the reviews, that the third season will thrill me just as the previous two.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Well plotted.  Unbelievable the amount of physical abuse the protagonist undergoes.  Keeps you reading.  I have read all of these Harry Hole books.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game with good graphics. Wish it was a little longer. Either that or I need to be a little slower. LOL
B0063GORYU|5.0|I gave spider solitair 5stars it's my favorite app on my kindle fire I play it  all the time  it's fun &addictive  I would recommend it to anyone
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is very fun! if you like horses this is the game for you!  if you don't well I did not like horses but now that I have this game I am on a horse running like the wind!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Okay,in all honesty I was like great just another dumb app. But this is the most accurately made game I've seen. The way the horses move and react its truly amazing! If you love horse's as much as I do you should have this game!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great TV. I have to continue to watch it........ .... ..... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... .... ...
159420411X|5.0|It's hard to remember reading a book that so ably synthesizes and explicates complex phenomena from so many fields. It is lucid, totally engaging while remaining challenging. Silver provides far more, and more interesting footnotes than a standard decision and prediction book. He provides critical readers, writers and thinkers fascinating evidence for the existence of trends and fashions in academic disciplines, which, despite their mathematical abstruseness are just not very good, and he manages to combine a humble, self-questioning tone with that of the polymath. And, if that were not enough, he has written the best closing line of the acknowledgement page that I have read. I'd give it 6 stars if you provided that in your ratings system
B008J1QFLU|5.0|worthy of BBC Music critics' #1 best ever classical recording. The presentation of this limited edition remastered release is of very high quality.
B002DPXSPO|5.0|Doris Day has been my hero for as long as I can remember.  In Send me no flowers, she and Rock prove once again that 60's comedies rule.  Along with Tony Randall, this trio brings many laughs.  I could watch this film over and over.  A true classic!
159562015X|3.0|I picked up this title shortly after I completed a management seminar based on working with and identifying a team's talents from the Gallup testing website.  The Gallup test has been a great tool to identify talents.  The online test provides all of the content from this book and more.  Oddly, it is cheaper to buy the book and use the test code than to simply take the online testing and pay through the Gallup site.  This book is not a traditional book that is meant to be read from beginning to end.  It will not be of much value without first having your test results ...but will serve as good reference after.  Highly recommended as a team building exercise if you work as part of a team!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Highly recommend. A lot of fun and of course FREE! I have it on my KIndle and a nice way to kill time where WiFi does not exist (e.g. Dr office).
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|The worst movie I've ever seen. Was beyond stupid and really should stop putting movies like this out.  Terrible movie
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I am not familar with the game, so I am just struggling through it. The sound was irritating until I found where to turn it off.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It was good but it could have been better if we had the urban dictionary :) :-{) so please put one in it
B0060AY85C|5.0|I loved this story , the way it was written and the lives it told about were unique. I felt I was down south in Georgia, or at least wished I was. What happened to Cee was unbelievable but then again only Toni Morrison could have included that tragedy in her book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had a great hook and twists and turns.I was hypnotized by the main characters Nick and Amy there crazy love story turned missing person turned homicide turned set up. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I was mildly disappointed with the end. I will be recommending this novel to my book club.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|This guy have talent with the beats. Lots of hits on the radio too. Great album to get for your party<br />Awesome!!!
1594745692|5.0|Stays authentic to Rider-Waite without being afraid to innovate. The artwork is cool yet appropriate, the book that accompanies is ample. Check out the \\"graveyard\\" spread.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this game works well on kindle. advancing and winning all stars pretty difficult but challenges memory and dexterity. can't beat the price.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has gripped me from the very beginning.  I it is in fathomable to even think that this could even happen in today's time or in ancient times.  Very creative - can't put it down.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Pretty simple review. Exactly what you are looking for in a DVD boxset. Most addicting series HBO has ever produced.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Informative, fascinating as a look into not just the operational methods but into the mind of a warrior ( though he probably would hate the term applied to himself).  Owen appears to be as level-headed as a store owner going to work, and his descriptions of what that work entails are jarringly surreal. Hampered as he was by the need to keep classified material secret, he still does a very good job of initiating the  reader into the life of a highly specialized soldier, as well as that of a mission so subject to mis-information. The fact that most of the proceeds are going to benefit the families of fallen soldiers makes this book a worth-while purchase.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game graphics are simply amazing! Gameplay is fun and relaxing with mulitple mini games that allow you to mix it up.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|fast shipping, came in perfect condition and the movie was cute :) The songs are very catchy so 'beware' ;P I enjoyed this movie, and kids love it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I play the game as much as I can I even have a iPod with this game on it and then I have a computer with the game on it
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I had a great time. The visuals are very clear and almost like 3d quality. The mini games were just enough to keep me interested without being to hard. Second game I played from g5 and probability will buy more.
B003L16FAE|1.0|If I could rate this disc a negative 5 I would.  It won't play in ANY blu ray player.  It won't play in either of my PS3s, and it won't play in a brand new Sony blu ray player.  I have so many DVDs and Blu ray discs, and this is the first one that I have ever bought that doesn't play.  You can't tell me that Amazon doesn't know about this defect, which is why they are selling this disc for such a low price.  Shame on you Amazon!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|what have you done to this game?use to love it now everytime I play it I want to throw my kindle across the room.please fix it.
0425252868|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. This is the story of two WWII pilots, one American and one German, who meet in a combat situation where the German pilot actually saves the lives of a bomber crew.  The author did an excellent job of detailing the lives of these two men and, for me, providing a new insight into the German air force.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|This is a number of recordings from the motion picture. I wish it had been a more studio version of some of the music, but this is EXACTLY as advertised. As a huge fan of Les Mis from the stage show, I found the soundtrack somewhat disappointing. It was just as advertised, although I had hoped for a bit better. I guess the quality of the original performers and 25th anniversary show ruined this &#34;Big name, mediocre talent&#34; version for me.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|I like this album, and the files were delivered instantly to my computer.  It was no trouble to move them into my itunes.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Another really good hidden object game from g5.I have purchased most of them and been pleased with them all. Really good graphics and good story content. 5 stars
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I used to have the one piece plastic version and wanted another one, but they no longer made them. so a few years ago I got this version and LOVE it! its is very study and can hold even a 17&#34; macbook pro which is pretty heavy. the edges are well finished and there are no even or sharp edges. the rubber feet is very 'grippy' and doesn't really require that clear plastic cap they provided. if you take your laptop off of it a lot, make sure you wipe the grips with a wet towel once in a while because dust can make it not as grippy.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this is that leg connections are not as tight as they can be, but that can be a good thing if you happen to travel with this.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|mnorcia,<br />  i am very happy with being able to take pictures and video. it is easy to use. glad i installed this.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My son loved it, watched it 5 times.  We rented it two days in a row.  Good movie for your kids and parents will laugh too.
030716327X|4.0|The book is not very sturdy, it can very easily tear. I wish the binding was different as well. I was expecting a little more considering it was 12.00...with all that being sad my daughter who's three seem to like it..
0765325950|5.0|Great book, very pleased, recommend it to everyone! If you ever gonna read a serie of fantasybooks , please choose this one!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Finished this one in under three hours.  Really loved the perspective of the book and the complex issues it tackled from a  very unique view.  Just felt that it did not give us enough....very short read.
B002FHJ4B2|5.0|Best movies of the 80's.  Loved it then and still love it after all these years.  Time to show it to the kids.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Book was good--though Sparks is a bit forulaic.  Can predict his plots and practically write the outcomes.  Would love to see him take his clear writing style to a plot with more twists to it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|such a good show, with a great cast of characters always evolving and moving forward.  hope it continues for another season
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this daily for math homework, and it is super easy to use. Would recommend this to  friend, for sure!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|definitely a really fun game, with great graphics and a lot of options. If you like horses, I would recommend this game, try not to get addicted!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed the book greatly, as did my wife. The cast of characters is large and always changing. It was very difficult to put the book down and do something else. My only suggestion for an improvement: start off with a prologe that reintroduces the main characters and the situation from the first book. Am looking forward to the third book in the trilogy.
031237593X|5.0|If you're a fellow history geek, intrigued by the news of the discovery of Richard III's skeleton - I highly recommend this book. It is constructed from well-researched contemporary evidence (not Tudor propaganda) and lyrically and compellingly told. In a world where people take Shakespeare as the gospel truth (never mind that he was commissioned to glorify Richard's vanquishers) and never bother to look up contemporary records, it's more than a breath of a fresh air - it's long needed, sweet sustenance. It's what got me interested in the period, and has yet to be surpassed.<br /><br />One of my favourite books of all time, and one of my favourite authors.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Holy Bible offers guidance for daily living if you just read it and believe it. It requires much study in order to understand what it says.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Fun read about what it took to get Bin Laden. There are now a number of books and movies about this topic, but this book tells it from a single person's perspective on the ground. I enjoyed it.
B00AJLHUWQ|5.0|(May 3rd update - look in the comments section below for my discussion of last night's how In Atlanta!)<br /><br />Yes this is just a copy and paste of the discussion I tried to start when Amazon wouldn't let me post a review last week!! But it is my opinion of their new CD.<br /><br />Riverside is my 2nd favorite current band after Porcupine Tree so it goes without saying that I have been greatly looking forward to this CD! I've read that some reviews are out on other sites but I have yet to read them. I also heard that many are criticizing the first single as being too \\"pop\\".<br /><br />I haven't looked for it so don't know which track is the single but figure it's probably the 4th - We Got Used to Us. But it doesn't really sound \\"pop\\" to my ears, just mellower. And Riverside has done plenty of songs like it before, I Turned You Down for example. The 6th track - Deprived, is also like this, but it reminds me more of something off a Lunatic Soul album than Riverside. So I think this is just Duda's \\"Lunatic Soul\\" coming through in Riverside more than it ever has before. In any case, neither of these songs make me think of what I call pop. When I think of pop I think of the shallow garbage the mainstream American media is pushing, and this isn't it.<br /><br />Bottom line is I really like the new CD, even upon first listen. The first track in particular starts off like a Lunatic Soul song before \\"cranking up\\" about 1/3 of the way into it. And, while the 2 bonus instrumental tracks are worth hearing, I can already tell the majority of my time will be spent playing the main CD.<br /><br />First impression is that it's not as heavy as Rapid Eye Movement or Anno Domini High Definition, but, overall, is heavier than Memories in My Head. And I have to say I like the heavier stuff (but really like ALL prog), and always have. Growing up in the 70s I liked Led Zep, Sabbath, Purple, UFO, BOC, etc just as much as I liked Yes, ELP, Genesis, King Crimson, etc, so it only figures I would really like prog/metal genre (or as many call it powerprog). Which is also why I got into Rush so early (mid-70s), they were one of the first bands I heard that really bridged the gap.<br /><br />I've listened to it all the way through 5-6 times now, and some of the songs more than that, and it continues to grow on me. Riverside has always been a good band but their compositional skills just keep growing and growing!! (Now....if we could just get them to tour over here, and not just hit a few festivals, I would be a happy man!!)<br /><br />EDIT!!! THEY ARE TOURING, 6 announced dates so far, including my neck of the woods (Atlanta):<br /><br />2013-04-30 The Windjammer, Isle Of Palms<br />2013-05-02 Vinyl - Center Stage, Atlanta<br />2013-05-04 Rosfest 2013, Gettysburg<br />2013-05-06 Roxy and Dukes, Dunellen<br />2013-05-08 Double Door, Chicago<br />2013-05-10 The Pour House, Raleigh<br /><br />Riverside tix (in Atlanta anyway) are sold through Ticket Alternative, never used them before. General Admission and only $20 too, including service charge!!<br /><br />Will call is the only delivery method though, weird. And kinda sucks, wonder what the line will look like, and how early I should be?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I've also noticed something else: Shrine doesn't have the high-range we've come to expect from this band's CDs and DVDs. Home stereo, headphones and in the car, it all sounds as if someone has turned my tweeters down compared to just about every other product I own by this band (which is everything).<br /><br />Huummm......since this is the EXACT same complaint I had about Porcupine Tree's Octane Twisted...I certainly hope this isn't some new trend!!!<br /><br />Bottom line - if you like bands like Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Dream Theater, Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, The Flower Kings, etc, then you should already be listening to this band, they are a keeper!!I would really like prog/metal genre (or as many call it powerprog).

B005GFPZYK|4.0|I was disturbed that he thought the killing was at times fun. I suppose he has to be able to disassociate the people he killed from people who have families and loved ones in order to do his job.<br />Honest account of what happens in war.<br />I don't find his wife's addition to the book necessary. I didn't understand the intention of different chapters. Would have worked better if the editor split the book up in time periods.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|I can't say much more except that this is a wonderful film that all generations should be watching. Youngsters, see how it was done back when! Pay attention to some good singing and dancing.
0316044695|5.0|Great book about a TRUE AMERICAN HERO. Provides the reader with an awsome behind the scene look at what a soilder goes through to protect our freedoms, and the lengths they will go to to do it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham titles always grab my attention.  This is not his best book, but it's a fun, sometimes confusing trip, through a revengeful mind.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It was a joy to read, with every character fully developed, every scene richly described so that you could &#34;walk into the book&#34;.  From page to page, I was spurned on to read further to unravel the great mystery of this fantastic setting where the most intriguing people lived and worked.  The ending could not have been better.  I didn't want it to end, but if it had to, it was the perfect wrap up.
B006LSZECO|2.0|How this book has stayed on the top ten list for so long is a mystery to me.  The jumping back and forth format is very confusing.  The language and mental pictures are disgusting.  Sorry I wasted my $ and I will certainly think more than twice about buying a book from the top ten list in the future.
160309007X|5.0|Great conclusion (but I don't want to spoil it for you readers out there).  I can't wait for the next installment.  May it arrive soon.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|I received it free with purchase of Canon DSLR. The beg itself is good quality, holds DSLR, lenses and other items easily. But it looks kinda ungy. It has orange zip ties with Amazon Basics written on it. So that makes it look more ugly
B009YP9L7U|2.0|It was like a PG fifty shades of grey. No climax really completely predictable. Was a cute easy read though.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I had never heard of Lana Del Rey until she popped up on an advertisement on my Kindle. I listened to the sample and was hooked. Her voice is amazing, and really compliments the dark melonic tone of the music. I will definately purchase her first album as well. I would suggest this to anyone who loves a chick singer with dark tendencies.
B0012KSUW2|5.0|If I did not know all that I do about Global Warming I would have never believed what I was watching but I do and it was very realistic.<br />Sadly, future generations must be aware of what is to come.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I like this version better than the others because of the way you can use gravity. Pigs are in bubbles and upside down. My son is obessed with it. He always wants to play... and that's when I get my quiet time! Thank you Angry Birds!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|A little to long.  Took me days to get throught it.  Was geting a little tired at the end as it is to long.
B00110K62U|5.0|This is my most favorite musical of all time. I could watch this on a weekly basis.  I lent this copy to a young man in our neighborhood that was actually playing in it as a high school student and wanted to watch the innkeeper.  He had never seen the musical all the way through. I took me months to get my copy back because him and his family enjoyed it so much.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Wife from England and she love it.  Put it up in her collection.  She watched it 3 times already.  buy.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Again, when I bought the 10th anniversary  dream cast in concert at London's royal albert hall , I also bought this version. I can watch and watch these specials.  Love, Love the Music.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Bones is one of my favorite shows and I love being able to get out the set and watch them whenever I want.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a good game for people who like horses. I would recemend it to any body who is looking for something to do and has a untreated in horses.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|One of the best novels Clancy has written. Good story and lots of excitement. Junior needs a love interest in the next book.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|I've been a fan of Andrea for years and consider this one of his best collections of recordings.  The song selection is diverse with many of the tunes being well recognized.  The arrangements of these songs are some of the best I've ever heard; the orchestration is lush but not overdone.<br /><br />Great balance and production quality.  If you are an Andrea fan, the album is a must have.  I you are not an Andrea fan, your chances of becoming one will be significantly increased after listening to these arrangements.<br /><br />B.

B00190OHD6|5.0|I have a secret crush on Gerard Butler and have seen this movie probably 30X.  It is always great!  The DVD version is really well done as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and I love beating my high score , buying the new characters and going to different places I really think subway surfers takes you on a journey.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another wonderful story from Nicholas Sparks. It was very suspenseful and it really kept you guessing. A definite one to read. It's no wonder they made  movie out of it.
B008ENA74E|1.0|Mr Smith lost me after 4 chapters. Poor man, on and on and on he drivels. The minutiae of everyday life. Buying a new polo shirt!! What he wore on his third day at work! Life with his roommates!  I keep reading, hoping against hope that the book will improve.<br /><br />The book did not improve.<br /><br />I reluctantly quit reading. Or shall I say with relief, I moved on to a better,  interesting book.<br /><br />I am an  reader of  non-fiction, biography and memoir.  I was so bored by the first 4 long chapters that I  never did get to find our why he left Goldman Sachs.<br />After Mr. Smith left Goldman Sachs,  I can understand why he had nothing better to do with his time than write a very dull memoir. He needed a job.<br /><br />For his next book, perhaps he could paint a wall in his small apartment, watch the paint dry and write a 10,000 word book about his experience with paint.<br /><br />Total waste of money and time.
B00006JDVV|5.0|I liked this movie when I first saw it. This DVD is in excellent condition. I have watched this movie several times.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|If you like movies with action, a little suspense, and good acting, this is the movie for you!!  Fast and furious driving kept me and my husband glued to those scenes.  I've seen this movie a number of times and I can see it several more times!!!
B0084AZXKK|4.0|I now know where every stylized motif used in Pirate's of the Caribbean came from!<br />I don't know if this is the original use of pirate speak...
B00A89ITZG|3.0|Very complex work. I find it partially useful, partially annoying. If you swim, bike, or run, this should be your technical &#34;how-to&#34;. Please read my comments with I am NOT a big swimmer/biker/or runner, so I am not as enamored by it.<br /><br />If you are into those - you must buy this book as it will be a classic one day on the core technical aspects and retraining of skills.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|...but still fantastic enough to get a 5! this season has a lot more going on than in the first season, and this one is really more &#34;horror&#34; than the first season. and really, i can't say it enough, it has a lot going on.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|why did I ever start this, it's addicting AND frustrating<br />but a great way to kill time. I recommend it IF you have the time to kill. (I don't) but oh well:)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game but u should have an option to where u can creat a character for free. :)

1451673442|5.0|Awesome book....of course!<br />Use it on a daily basis. Too bad everyone in the world don't practice this way...It would be so much sweeter!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome to play.<br />There is nothing that I would play the side cud do something about the animal cells and acknowledge that the animal cells and acknowledge the kindest and I have only just thought it would have been the kindest to thank the kindest to console is from the animal kingdom of a simile that day of a picture and acknowledge the animal is from me and I have been in Hayward and the kindest words from title or description of a picture is from the .
B000FC1192|5.0|This is a children's book that is a refreshing change from others that stay on the safe side. Very enjoyable.

B003L77GRO|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Dexter, but you can tell the writer's are beginning to fail. Sadly. The characters are now doing stuff they would have never done in previous episodes. They are grasping at straws and it shows.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I was happy with the price I paid for these and happy with the product. This was an excellent box set.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Loved it! The DVD caught me up and my wife and I are hooked on Downtown Abby! I will purchase season 3.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I got a great price on this set and it was exactly what we wanted. Very happy with this purchase!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|It was just what I was looking for. I've got an older PC that doesn't have Ethernet hookup and this was an easier alternative than getting a card. It was easy to install and the installation CD was simple. It is perfectly made for XP so very easy to get going. I haven't had a single problem with this product. Works great so far.
1849904251|5.0|I love the casebook. Sherlock and John's post it notes to each other are pretty hilarious, and I like the interviews with Moffat and Gatiss.
B009IA3O2O|4.0|I am a tried and true Roy Khan chick. I make no apologies for that. I happen to worship awesome vocalists and I believe the good ones leave as indelible a mark as any guitarist.  The moment Kamelot snagged him from Conception, this man (much like Geoff Tate and Rob Halford) left an indelible mark upon my psyche. Every song, from 'Providence' to 'The Inqusitor' to 'Sailorman's Hymn' (check out the version from The Expedition--live) to the awesome 'Elizabeth' trilogy to 'March of Mephisto' showcased the man's expressive range and gift for storytelling in song. There just wasn't a Kamelot without Khan's emotive and passionate vocals seducing me in his guise as wicked tempter or breaking my heart as a damned and long-suffering penitent.  Even his use of his last name (which he shortened) just screamed \\"regal and powerful\\".  So when the news came down the pike that he was leaving Kamelot permanently due to burnout and personal issues, my heart sank.  My soul was saying first Steve Perry, then Geoff Tate and now Khan?<br /><br />Flash forward to Silverthorn. As big a Kamelot fan as I am, it took me awhile to accept that someone else was going to be taking Khan's place.  Much like the bruhaha over Annette Olzon when she replaced Tarja in Nightwish, I wondered what a post-Khan Kamelot was going to sound like. I had no fears for the high level of musicianship, because this band even at their not-so-great is still a thousand times better than most bands at the top of their game.  And as much as I liked Fabio Leone, his voice just didn't do it for me.  Enter Tommy Karevik, for me a relative unknown.  If Kamelot had to clone a Khan-alike, they came up huge. There are definitely distinct differences in their tones, but not so much as to be jarring. Tommy nails the nuances that made Khan's voice so memorable, and yet he adds his own little touches.<br /><br />Silverthorn is a haunting tale of love, loss and redemption.  It's a familiar theme in their repertoire but it's never trite because the band always seems to reinvent it in fresh ways.  This is a band who knows how to take a listener on an emotional sonic journey and they do it well. There's darkness, despair and forgiveness. In short, we're talking classic Kamelot here. My favorite tracks thus far are 'Sacrimony', 'Veritas' (I love big choirs and chants) and 'Falling Like the Farenheit'.<br /><br />What makes Silverthorn really stand out is the obvious greater influence of Oliver Palotai.  I adore keyboards and Mr. Palotai is one of the great modern masters of the instrument.  He's not afraid to make them stand out, to be big, and if you've ever seen him on stage, he knows how to be a showman. There is also more of an emphasis upon female vocals, which I love.  No, there's no Simone this time, but you can't possibly go wrong with Alissa White-Gluz from The Agonist and the always brilliant Amanda Somerville (who's worked with and/or been the vocal coach to most of the great vocalists in the European metal scene).<br /><br />If you are like me, a Khan fan and you're wondering if Silverthorn is worth it, trust me, it is.  And if anything, Poetry for the Poisoned it's not, lol. Give this one a spin. You won't regret it.te because the band always seems to reinvent it in fresh ways.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|What a wonderful book! I loved the parts which we've enjoyed in the movie and enjoyed the additions in print which the  movie doesn't contain.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|WAAAHHHH!!!! They ruined it!!! WAAAHHHH!!! Im' old! CG special effects hurt my eyes! I want the old rubbber masks and muppets! SOB!! I hate new stuff! Boo-hoo! The whole story is changed now because they added some new visual effects!! WAAAHHH!!! George Lucas betrayed his fans by updating the films!! WAAHHHHH!!! I can't take this updated version because when I watch it it reminds me that it isn't 1977 anymore and I am not five years old with my whole life ahead of me. Now I have to accept that the world has changed, I'm old, and my life is ruined! George Lucas, you ruined my life!!! WAAHHHH!!!! WAAHHH!!!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />-Middle Aged Cry Baby Fanboy Loser
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I choose this rating because this book is real it's not like the others that are about some fake teen who is having dumb problems. I like the fact that the book is interesting and anyone can relate to it. I would recommend the book to anyone who is looking for something good to read also to anyone who can relate to what's going on and need a guide on how to go about things.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but I've read many others by this author and this was mediocre by comparison. I would probably not enthusiastically recommend to others unless they are such a fan that they want to read all of his books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think its awesome everyone out there, buy the best game ever it is here it is subway surfers get it
0446554995|5.0|Book arrived sooner than expected. Price was good.<br />I am a big FBI Special Agent  Pendergast (Preston & Child) fan.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun. The graphics are amazing but a bit slow at times. It's Easy to play and fun
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Keeps my 4 year old son very involved and he loves to aim for a perfect score every time!!!<br /><br />Bag it is great!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I felt every emotion imaginable! Couldn't put it down! Kept me guessing all the way through. I fell in love will all the characters. I love this author and will be reading her again.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I added this for my younger grandkids who play it everytime they are around. They can start it by themselves and they enjoy the sounds and graphics. It is easy for them to follow and they have a tough time sharing the Kindle when thwey are playing. Good choice for our family.
B008476HBM|3.0|This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking. Which made it a bit frustrating fir the first couple if chapters. Also, I did not feel attached to the characters. Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be.
B009FZFONO|4.0|For a Mac user, Amazon's Instant Video service is an iffy choice.  The streaming quality is quite good, and I didn't have a single buffer/lag during playback.  However, this must be done through a web browser - the Unbox application is only for PC machines.  Amazon DOES offer download capability with its Instant Video app for iPad, though these purchased, owned copies cannot be saved in iTunes or even to a hard drive.  If I had to do it over again, I would choose the iTunes version, as all my products are Apple and this would provide obvious compatibility/flexibility options.  Otherwise, for the one-time viewing or PC-owning audience?  It's a great service.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Chose it because it sounded interesting. Finished it because it was.<br />Wish I was brave enough to do something like this.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Love the movie.  What more can you say about an iconic movie with John Wayne, Natalie Wood and John Ford.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new features like the zip line and new graphics make the game a great one, I think that most people should have this app, it's very fun!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Love all of his books, never a dull moment and couldn't put it down! Now just have to wait for his next book
B004UJ81IA|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much. Not high adventure, but it is an entertaining story of a long walk through the rural mountains of France. I especially liked the characters he met along the way (and the donkey of course). From the book, “For my part, I travel not to go anywhere but to go. I travel for travels sake. The great affair is to move, to feel the needs and hitches of our lives more nearly; to come down off the feather-bed of civilization, and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.”
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Omg! This book is great I didn't want to put it down, it makes you want more I am ready for the next one.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have always loved this movie, and I recommend the movie for any household.  Especially around the Xmas season. Great for Kid watching.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I'ts a very funny funny movie;though because of language it's<br />not appropriate for young children. Haven't laughed so much<br />since some old Bill Murray movies.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|-------------------------------------------------------------<br />Richard Thompson<br />\\"Electric\\"<br />(New West, 2013)<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />A real winner from British folk-rock elder Richard Thompson.  Thompson finds an eager collaborator in roots/Americana insider Buddy Miller, who produces this album and adds some tasty guitar licks that compliment Thompson's own idiosyncratic style. This album boasts a strong selection of songs, each one moody, clever and compelling, defined by aching, deliberate melodies and subtle yet memorable hooks. As the album title implies, this is a rock-oriented set, but it's slyly punctuated with country/bluegrass touches, particularly fiddle riffs from bluegrasser Stuart Duncan and occasionally by Thompson's own mandolin. The performances are tightly focussed with each musician concisely adding to the songs, and Thompson himself in fine form. Particularly noteworthy are the harmony vocals, with English-born Nashviller Siobhan Maher Kennedy adding supple harmonies on several songs, reminiscent in turns of Kate Bush and even Richard's ex, Linda Thompson.<br /><br />Like many folk/roots artists, as a young man, Thompson affected a worldliness and cynicism that belied his years, though now well into his '60s, he has clearly the life experience under his belt to work comfortably in \\"old man\\" mode, and he wears it well. Though rueful, his songs have heart and hope, perhaps best heard on the album's closing track, a sweet acoustic ballad called \\"Saving The Good Stuff For You,\\" in which the singer looks back at a long, sometimes rocky lifetime, and sees only better days ahead. With an album like this, it's a dream that's easy for us to believe as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is so cool I am beastin on this game I love it I think that the whenever they change it you don't know what the are going to change it to.
B0030LLAFU|5.0|I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of sellers who can meet the buyers demand.

B004HW7JMY|5.0|....but not cure your need to see Andy Whitfield again. He was TRULY the best leading man for the role of Spartacus. BUT...the story, the scenery, the magic of CGI...ALL OF IT is still exciting and has you on the end of your seat. I still give it 5 stars!!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Where is the other people like Zack the football star put them in man come on man you can do a lot better
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It was a great price when we bought it! It also came in on time and was packaged properly. I would do buisness again!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Colornote is perfect. You can add notes and change the note color. Also this app has a calender and you add notes on the calender and when the day that you put a note on, it'll tell you what note yo have.<br />I have it on my Knidle Fire and works great and no freeze.<br />So if u want an app to put notes or checklists then this is the app.
B0055S348W|5.0|I wanted a way to print from my Kindle Fire HD 7\\" to my wireless printer at home. I was a little skeptical that anything would work, but it turns out I was wrong. This program works really well, does just what I wanted it to do. I've used it now for a few months with no problems. I don't remember it being difficult to set up. My Fire was already on my home wifi, as was my printer (I print to it wirelessly from my Mac laptop), so the Fire and the printer connected easily. When you choose Share on the Fire, the printer app shows up (along with any word processing programs and such that are on the Fire). You click on the printer app, choose the printer, and the document prints. It just works. If I sound a little dumbfounded, I guess I am. I'm not used to such functionality with so little stress on the Fire (except of course for Amazon content). A lot of apps on the Fire can be glitchy. This one isn't.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I downloaded this app to get music on my Fire and it works great. Ive been looking for an app where I can add music without buying anything. So this app is awesome for downloading music and movies. you should get it.

0817439390|5.0|Forget about all of the other books (other than those written by the even greater David Busch) you've read explaining basic photography--Mr Peterson explains it all in easy to read and understand terminology in addition to providing examples to study.  From the very beginning he challenges--and encourages you--to take a picture stepping out of the all too easy AUTO exposure.  Mr Peterson also reinforces his lessons by asking that the reader go to his free and easy instructional videos available on line.  Who could ask for anything more?  I'm more partial to Mr Busch only because of my eroding comprehension skills but they are both essential teachers for all levels of photography and if you're serious about your craft I suggest strongly that you start with UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE.  I am eternally grateful to the individuals at Ugly Hedgehog for unanimously instructing all newbies that this is an important book to study and refer to.

B008I34ZFW|5.0|Bizarre Sci Fi from the Finns. Well made, odd plot, well made, interesting. Try not to take it seriously. Dark Nordic Comedy I would say. Plot ...Remnants of the SS operate a base on the dark side of the moon and invade NYC. Odd plot twists. Great CGI and acting. The Finnish take on things is eccentric to say the least !
B0050PYNP8|4.0|This was a good light movie to sit down, suspend reality and enjoy  Loved Paul.<br />Maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped but fun.
1442359315|5.0|This book was highly recommended to me by a friend.  I purchased it in audio so I could listen while driving to work and back.  Exceptional story!  I'm glad I decided on the audio version.  In reading some of the book, I might have been a little lost in the script, as it got technical in some areas.  Having it read to me helped me to digest the context.  I would encourage anyone, especially skeptics, to read/listen to this book.<br />Wanda E.

It provided the reader with the facts of the matter, which are often falsely depicted and  embellished by the mainstream media.<br />Mark Owen's historic account of the killing of OBL also allows the reader to become &#34;personally involved&#34; in the daily dramatic affairs of a Seal, his commitment, his sense of duty to his country and fellow Team members, and, yes, also his concerns, hopes, and fears, but ultimately, his strength of character and true patriotism.<br />I was left with the conviction that for a Seal Team member regardless of specific assignment, there indeed is<br />&#34;No Easy Day&#34;.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|this set is great for only the episodes though. The case and disc leave a lot to be desired as far as protection from scratching/damage etc. and no subtitles!  I guess this where they said &#34;I'm a doctor!, not a miracle worker&#34; in regards to it
B003YUQAM0|3.0|Buen artículo, puede mejorar la calidad del producto. . . . . . . . . . .. . .
030758836X|1.0|This book was actually plausible until the last fifty pages. Then it just became ridiculous. The characters do reflect how writers and the media today are self absorbed, think they have power and think they more important than others. Maybe this is characteristic of the author too.
B00B2LPYNE|5.0|Been a fan of Hatebreed since the start.  First listen I like this cd.  2nd and 3rd listen I began to love it!  I agree with the fact it kinda feels like Hatebreed has plateaued with this one not progressing as much as previous albums.  But maybe thats just cause I haven't listen enough yet.  I've listened to it prolly a dozen times now and anything I listen to afterwards just doesn't compare.  :-)  I'm like, lets listen to Divinity of Purpose again!  Definetly a KILLER ablum!  Love these guys!  Buy and support!  Metals UP!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a pleasant surprise. It has a very simple premise - avoid trains and barriers and collect coins and powerups to get the highest possible score. Who would have thought that this simple premise will be positively addicting! I find myself playing the game everyday to better myself and beat my score. When you have friends to play against makes the that much more addicting. I highly recommend this game and, best of all, it's free! What are you waiting for! Download this game TODAY.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I say this dictionary is okay siii read what u can barbie out west side I'm in Cali BTW see me
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the most awesome game in the world I love it I think at my school everyone has this game hahahahahaha
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fast fun addictive, and free<br />Don't play if your heart can't take the adrenalin. Nice graphics and plays excellent on kindle fire
0679809015|5.0|We are very into flap-books right now, and this one is great.  I like how many animals there are (although some of the &#34;sounds&#34; are a bit weird, eg, &#34;Meh&#34; for goat??), and also like that there are other animals that we find in each picture (eg, the spider, the mouse, the frogs).<br />A definite winner.
B006T9PI5I|5.0|Quality was excellent. No problems loading. This is a great movie to watch with the family for sure. I've enjoyed it since I was a kid.
B00846REIS|3.0|It too me over half way into the book to get interested. Probably %75 into it. I just found it difficult to get interested and it was more crude than other books I have read. So for that reason I am giving it a low rating.
0345525558|5.0|I bought it for my Book Club meeting.  The price was lower than buying it at a local book store.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Could not put it down.<br />Fast paced.  Informative and a good story.  Recommended for all ages.  A great talent is lost by Larsson's death.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Highly recommended for readers who enjoy a well-crafted plot and engaging storyline.<br />Courtney milan has a real nack with her writing of being able to surprise as happens with this story.
031236198X|4.0|This is a quick read and very powerful in dealing with change and understanding how others view change as a result of their individual personalities.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Teenage relationships, pressure of parenatl and societal expecttions, and the bigotry surrounding much that law enforcement agencies and the business that is the law and incarseration are central to this quite captivating story. Teenage love, parental friendships, neighbourly engagement and disengagement and the preeures of life experienced by middle class professional families and their powerlessness in the face of tragedy and the machinations of the law make for an excellent read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This App makes my life easy. I was struggling with all the new Tablets and I found this App that let me read a book in all my devices; Computers, smart phones, tablets, iPods, etc.<br /><br />I used it at home, work, and any computer connected to internet. It is simple great.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is terrific for relaxing, napping or just zoning out. I've used it for an afternoon nap, but the flute melody tells me I will like it as background music for painting, as well.
0321701763|4.0|This book is a great tool to learn photoshop<br /><br />Beside other books, if you fallow the instructions, you will get every screen and steps as the book describe it.<br /><br />I recommend this book. The only thing. They should have an advance photoshop book and more exercises.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another great point and click game from g5.  Awesome graphics,  hidden object scenes,  story line and not overly challenging puzzles. A very fun game!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This trilogy will take your breath away! YOU MUST READ IT! It is just AMAZING! Shiver, Linger, and Forever are now my all time favorite. Its just sooo full of feeling! AMAZING!!!!!!:)
B004U8VWLE|4.0|This film kept me riveted from beginning to end. The viewer experiences Portman's character's psychological downward spiral and we are left questioning, with her, where her reality ends and her psychosis begins.  Taking this approach (rather than revealing clues to the audience before the antagonist experiences them) creates an amazing viewing experience.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I love the new album and I love this band! It's rare to hear bands and top 100 singers playing their own music. Mumford and Sons is so talented and it's refreshing to hear all the instruments they play.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I enjoyed this film. It was well made and it has the right amount of humour and action. A little predictable in the plot but worth viewing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love it! there is nothing but crap at the movies and every thing is rated R so you cant sit down as a family anymore to watch a movie until now. I just hope they keep it clean and tasteful just as they have done to date. Dont mess with what works. Hollywood has messed up with all the devil and angry ghost flicks! And all the skin flicks they call romance and what is with the Iliterate writers that can only spell the F-word and thinks it should be repeated over a thousand times in one movie.  Lame !!! time to bring back a story with charachters you grow to love or hate. Now this is a Movie worth watching over and over again. Please keep them comming, very entertaining!
B000TRXRUY|5.0|I admit my bias as a practitioner of the martial arts influenced my opinion of this film. The tragic irony of Lee passing away weeks before the premiere of this film back in-1973?- adds, in my opinion to its greatness. Its plot is typical thin 1970's fare but just to watch Lee in action is worth watching the film alone. His legacy has changed and influenced martial arts and action films that followed this one. (Except for &#34;Game of Death&#34; which is shameful. Don't watch &#34;Game of Death&#34; but watch this film as Lee's final film.)
B00000DG1R|4.0|I . Like it a gift for my sister who loves them and always will has been to all concerts she loves duran duran
B005LAII80|5.0|I love 3D and have almost all of the movies.  This one is no exception.  The 3D is great.  The story is a little weak but there is lots of action and its an entertaining movie.
B005OTPKX4|5.0|I am big fan and always will be all my favorite songs .if you love bsb you will love t his cd
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|My wife and I both 50+  agree this is a depressing view of the longevity of a failed marriage. I don't believe the &#34;happy ending &#34; would last a week.
B000VOC90Y|3.0|I purchased this bag because reviews led me to believe would hold ANY 17\\" laptop.  Theoretically, my ASUS G75V fits, but I have to push it down into the padding and stretch the zippers to get them to close.  My concern is, other than how long the stitching will last, is that there is no room for any padding/protection on the corners.<br /><br />All else seems to be as described.  I own other SwissGear bags and have always been very satisfied with their quality.<br /><br />This laptop is the largest 17\\" model that I've seen, so anything smaller will fit.  I'll add to the review after I've owned it for a while, if I decide to keep the bag.
B008B68IV8|5.0|This new ghoulia doll is totes adorable! Def a must have for your monster high collection. I love these new ghoulia dolls!
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I am pleased with the sounds included with this free app.  If you need more than just background noise to help you sleep, pay for an upgrade.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another excellent by Nicholas Sparks. The characters were well developed and story<br />was very good. I would absolutely recommend this book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and the difficulty of it is quite hard to play because the guard is always chasing you.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Another excellent story by Mr. King. He keeps you in suspense from beginning to end and you enjoy every minute, even while you are feeling sorry for the characters.  The only thing wrong was it left me wanting more, but then nearly all of Mr. King's stories do.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|The dancing as always was amazing, but the plot was eh... The movie was entertaining though.<br /><br />For some reason the quality of this video was horrible, I realize this has to do with streaming issues and not the film itself, but this is the only film we have ever had problems with.
034580404X|5.0|Absolutely adored this series! Heard bits 'n pieces about all they hype but didn't pay attention to the specifics. Yeah, there might be alot of explicit material but it's also a genuine, heartbreaking love story.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This was a great experience. We had ordered the Blue Ray version by mistake as a gift for my mother. When the gift was opened, only then did we realize it was the wrong format. We were able to return the Blue Ray for a full refund and purchase the proper format with no issues. Thanks to all parties involved.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I like word press , it is a wonderful way for me to express my thoughts , I don't post much out to the public but maybe some day I will do more, it is a wonderful program for free and I am sure if you wanted to write for real to buy the whole program would be worth the money
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Everyone was ranting and raving about Homeland so I rented it from Amazon Prime and got totally hooked. Watched 2 seasons in less than 2 wks. and left us wanting more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is extremely well-written, well-directed an well-performed. I do not watch much that is presented on television, but I'm so glad I found this show - it restores my faith in the medium.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief was a sad account of World War II as it affected German citizens.  The plot was riviting, but that was certainly not the outstanding feature.  The way the author described words, &#34;she carried them on her shoulder,&#34; was original and artful.  I loved the way the children were described.  Despite all the horrors of war, they were children, as children the world over, during that time period.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter, since it was sold out other places I looked, it arrived before it was supposed to, and was in perfect shape.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is amazing. Download it and have the biggest nerdgasm of your life. Seriously, I may never ever put my tablet down again because I can do anything on it that I can do on my PC, and do it anywhere.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Really kept my attention and made me want more. It seemed I was right there with the characters. Cheers to the underdog.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I could not get past the first games because I found them tedious and all the same thing.  It annoyed me.  I love games and even if I wanted a game to kill five minutes in the airport...this would not be it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think they should have the update like Apple has I've played it and it's way better<br /><br />Ok thank you mojang rah ruslabuuuuuum
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Great music but the Deluxe version offers a lot more. More music is always better especially if it's Mumford and Sons!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is really addicting I mean I keep telling my self that it is boring but I still can not stop playing the game
B00AE2J93I|5.0|Paranorman is a witty intelligent comedy for the whole family with flashes of adult humor the kids won't know about, it has lessons about doing that is right and being true to yourself!
B00914JWSW|5.0|She could NEVER go wrong. Even tho this cd contains outtakes her voice is sheer beauty. Lovely Lovely Lovely Love l y
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Combines the best of baseball and a touching father-daughter story.  Not quite Bull Durham but better than Field of Dreams.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It hasn't finished airing in the U.S. so no spoilers--but wow! English melodrama at its finest! Seriously, how much more can the Crawley family take?
B00ALY17M0|5.0|Product was in good quality, great time management recieved it quickly picture matched the product so there was nothing misleading about the purchase!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The talent in this show is amazing!  Great acting, great writing.  I would certainly start from the beginning with Season 1 to get to know the characters and understand the plot lines.
B000002LAC|5.0|Dolly Parton, Emmy Lou Harris, and Linda Rondstadt sound fantastic together. I don't usually listen to country music, but I'm going to spend time getting to know this genre.
B002BWP49C|5.0|can't wait til the final instalment comes out.  really enjoyed the wedding and the whole story.  all the movies give a wonderful, seamless story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun game for all ages. It's fun every time you play. One of my favorite games.
B0058YPILY|4.0|This is my favorite TV series.  This wasn't my favorite season, but the episodes surrounding Emily's situation were very good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My daughter loves playing all the different games and it's so much fun earning points to unlock more. Hard to keep her away.
076790592X|5.0|One of the best books ever! It  Helped me understand ALS so much better.  I loved Morrie's outlook on life
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Great price for a Blu-ray/DVD combo!  Also a great movie!  Good entertainment for the entire family.  Spielberg and JJ Abrams are awesome!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the best books I have read. If you are down or feeling depressed give this book a try . I promise you will feel better
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The Avenger included everyone that I have enjoyed throughout these individual movies.  Robert Downey JR and company made a really good fun movie to watch.  You will be entertained.
B00330UFQS|5.0|I love Lady Antebellum. All of their songs are awesome. Need You Now is my favorite. I can't wait to hear more of their songs.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christopher Nolan has always been one of my favorite directors.  The Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises will always be a classic on how movies should be.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|As always, Dexter keeps you on the edge of your sheet.  After a rather boring season 5, season 6 got us very interested again.  Well acted, as usual, and lots of weird and gore.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love SciFi movies.  I almost missed out on this treasure.  When my friend told me that it was a prequel to the Alien franchise I wanted to see where the movies started.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|My husband likes these shoes quite a bit.  Two brothers are responsible for tracking down various monsters.  Pretty entertaining and fun.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Not much to say about the gratuitous violence and a good Sylvester Stallone kicking some major ass.  The movie was really good and has a decent plot but plenty of good action scenes.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a great show that keeps you guessing throughout.  My husband and I can't get enough and have had several Homeland &#34;marathons&#34;.  Well acted, entertaining and thrilling, strongly recommend it.  Not for kids as there is quite a bit of sexual activity and nudity.
B007KOLNXC|4.0|Fantastic season, great content, no spoilers here.  The Amazon user interface is comically non-intuitive, and the lack of closed captioning was a big disappointment.
B009K72G8I|5.0|My 9 year old son loves these shows.  He says that all the boys at his school are watching them, too.  They aren't interesting to me but if you are a young boy I guess they are great.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the quality and the fact there are no commercials. I am a real fan of Walking Dead although I just started watching this summer, Exciting series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband and I are addicted to this show.  Great acting and the plot seems to move quickly, doesn't get stagnant at all.  The different story line between the staff and the royalty are fascinating and fun.  You won't be sorry!
B002ZG976U|5.0|I LOVE this movie...I love music and Cher (still a fan) with Christina. What a combination of beautiful sound! Love the story line and the ending is how I like my endings ????????? I absolutely recommend this movie. Delivery was on the date given, prompt and in great condition 100%.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|A great picture that includes all of the horror classics in one, child-friendly movie. A boy and his dog; got to love it.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I applaud the effort that it took to write each story with it's own style. Each story certainly took a good deal of understanding of the era and base material, such as music in \\"Letters from Zedelghem\\". Overall, the characters were very fleshed out and detailed but, to me, mostly just bland. for the most part I didn't care about any of them. The only exception was Somni, due to her beginnings, it would be expected for her to be bland with little personality. As it goes on though, \\"An Orison of Sonmi~451\\" was like watching a rose blossom open. In my opinion, had that story been fleshed out in greater detail, it would have been a much better effort then the entire book.<br /><br />\\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After\\" was a bit sluggish of a read due to the writing technique. I got through it and it was well done, but the best part of getting through it was Somni part 2.<br /><br />If you take each story and don't split them up, while well written they fall flat.<br /><br />We've all read books that have a unexpected twist at the end that leaves us thinking about it for days. Near the end, I had hopes that all of the story lines would be pulled together in some way that would leave me with this kind of feeling. When finished though, I felt robbed. I had a Ralphie \\"Be sure to drink your Ovaltine\\" moment. What? That's it? Six short stories where only one of them really had any emotional content and no real tie between them?<br /><br />A week ago I was recommending this book to everyone. Now I can't do that. As you can tell I liked the Somni story but little else. Hence rather than one star, I give 2. The extra one for Somni.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Very-well done. Karen Carpenter's &#34;pipes&#34; are wonderfully suited for Christmas music. Good blend of religious and secular songs. Some parts a little over-produced. Overall one of my best purchases on Amazon.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|that is all. nothing else to say. awesome is it. reviews requiring a certain number of words are dumb. dumb.
B008MWBY6W|3.0|this bag is comfortable with the extendable shoulder strap and lightweight, even makes the camera feel lighter than it really is, but, there's no storage for a secondary lens, which I always end up needing. It's a one trick pony that isn't enough for me to recommend to someone who, say, goes to the zoo and needs to regularly change out lenses during their excursion.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|We would recommend this movie...a good one for the whole family...minus kiddos under 6.  A tiny bit cheesy in parts but lots of fun!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Great cast!  The movie is quite good and entretaining.<br />The conclusion comes a little abruptly, but it is a very good movie taking all things into account.
B0085TKAW6|1.0|I really enjoyed the first instalment of this trilogy and was eagerly awaiting the second. Sadly, I was left disappointed and nearly didn't bother finishing it. I love the historical facts and scenarios Follett conjures up in my mind, but the coincidences and left wing propaganda have to be seen to be believed.<br />The way a small number of people keep 'bumping into' each other all over the world is so far fetched as to be ridiculous.<br />The way he portrays anyone who is not left wing as either a bigot, evil, stupid you name it, is an insult to intelligent people and seriously put me off the book. (Of course we all know Hitler/Stalin et al were beyond evil, but they are not exactly typical of centre right politics!)<br />The writing too is very simplistic and to be honest I struggle to believe this book was written by he same man who wrote Pillars of the Earth, which is one of my favourite ever books.<br />I fear that if this was the first book of Follett's that I had read, I would not pick another.<br />I'm sorry Mr Follett, but I would not recommend this book. Go back to what you do best and leave politics out of your stories.
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is always a guarantee of a good time, a well written story that keeps you interested.  Unexpected ending...Great!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved it. Better than my love book as a kid,hatchet. Can't wait to see the movie. But wait....was there a tiger or was he the tiger? Metaphor for the beast he became?
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|A real Masterpiece!  The castle, the clothes, the furniture, the plot, everything is first class.<br />Good Good Good Good Good
B007SOQBCM|2.0|A great app...when it works. Has a frustrating tendency to not load up streams causing me to constantly have to reload the app. An upgrade or patch is desperately needed.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie all the way around, great end to the Nolan series. Out does the proceeding movies, and the story is great to follow.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This version was chosen because it could be easily downloaded to an Android.  It is user friendly and provides access to more Bible translations than you thought might be available.  It is an excellent resource that allows you to quickly look-up Bible verses and can be used anywhere at any time, it even has the words spoken by Christ marked in red letters in the New Testament.<br /><br />It is handy and it allows you to carry many versions of the Bible in your pocket without the bulk of paper.  You literally have all of these powerful Bibles at your fingertips.  I LOVE IT!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft you play as you build.  you can go into God mod. which you can unlimited build to you're imagines.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|If you are going to use this with an iOS device you will need a different adapter to go along with this.  The 1/8&#34; jack does not turn off the internal microphone on the iOS devices.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|When someone gives you an Amazon Gift Certificate and says \\"buy yourself something you won't normally get for yourself\\" get AMERICAN HORROR STORY! I'd \\"heard\\" little about the series, and read a few short articles here and there, but after SIX FEET UNDER and OZ, I refused to get involved in serial television at all. And I didn't! A news junkie M-F, and a sci-fi guy on the weekends, I was fine with supplementing repeats and heavily rotated news with something from my eclectic DVD and laserdisc  collection.<br /><br />I did, however, end up with an Amazon Gift Card from a \\"client\\" after what was a courtesy photo session...and I saw AMERICAN HORROR STORY \\"used/like new\\" priced significantly below the list price. OK, why not?  I could always pass it on to a friend if I REALLY hated it. So I bought it.<br /><br />And the DVD box languished on my shelf. No. I wasn't about to start watching a serialized show. I was too busy. I didn't want the addiction which comes with serial television. Hell. I bought the DARK SHADOWS DELUXE LIMITED EDITION BOX SET of the entire 1,225 episodes...and watched THAT again, after seeing its first run in the 60s, and second run on the SciFi (then) channel in the 80s. But NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I had to watch it again.<br /><br />And then on Super Bowl Sunday, when the rest of the networks were Toilet Bowl television, I thought \\"ok, I'll watch one or two episodes and see what's what.\\"<br /><br />And two discs later (eight episodes, I think) I had to turn off the television and get to bed.<br /><br />WHAT A SHOW! WHAT A SHOCKER! WHAT A RIOT!<br /><br />It took me a few minutes here and there to figure out what was \\"really\\" going on, and then I was totally hooked. AMERICAN HORROR STORY is definitely a nod to DARK SHADOWS (1966 - 1971) but not about vampires. It's about the house, and the characters and the storyline. But it's also a shocking nod to the headlines of the day (no spoilers here) and is impeccably sequenced, written and filmed.<br /><br />I'd missed Jessica Lange on the screen for so long, I was surprised and shocked to see she was in the show. Scraping the bottom, Ms Lange? Not in the least! More like on a seriously slow boil with one of the best psychologically-damaged portrayals I'd ever seen. Sheer Jessica Lange. A part written for her, and she just eats it up (literally?) Dylan McDermott was a pleasant surprise. I'd never really been a fan of his, nor had I been a non-fan, but we did go to the same high school (separated by about 3 years) so I like watching a city native (who has a serious backstory of his own!) as a psychiatrist with his personal set of demons sweating it through every episode.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on, but here's the scoop: if you liked DARK SHADOWS (the original series), Se7en, The Twilight Zone (Rod Serling), SIX FEET UNDER, and some noted classic 60s/70s horror movies (ROSEMARY'S BABY, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL), and some other great, and overlooked, art house and/or indie films (THE FALL, INK) you'll love AMERICAN HORROR STORY.<br /><br />There's really nothing like watching something terribly original, walking the razor's edge for the usual television fare, and knowing you've got the whole season (\\"one long movie\\") as someone put it...so just put the discs in and enjoy it, episode after episode (try to watch a disc at a time, or at least two/three episodes in sequence).<br /><br />I'd give this four stars because I know it's going to come to the last episode and the roller coaster ride will be over, but AMERICAN HORROR STORY rates a TEN for me. Everything about it is great.<br /><br />Watch this with blocks of time, an open mind, open eyes, and put it on pause if you need to leave the room. Missing even five minutes can derail a future character development (or appearance!)<br /><br />If you love Jessica Lange? This is perfect for you. She's brilliant, and I hope she picks up an award or two. Classic Jessica Lange, updated!br />I'd missed Jessica Lange on the screen for so long, I was surprised and shocked to see she was in the show. Scraping the bottom, Ms Lange? Not in the least!

B00B49L7JY|5.0|... this album truly is a hidden gem. That's for sure.  But, everyone should keep in mind that there are 100's of \\"lost gems\\" out there.  Randy Holden, Gary Higgins,  Andwella's Dream.  Someone could probably create a documentary every month for all the artists people have completely ignored. Open your minds to what is beyond what popular culture shoves down your throats - American Idol, and all that fake, lifeless BS.  Thousand's of people are constantly making brilliant art every single day.  And more of it has been lost to time and ambivalence than all the songs someone like Justin Beiber will write in a life time.  As the great musician/philosopher, Cliff Poncier, once said - \\"We're huge in Belgium\\".<br /><br />With that being said, this is a well done and fascinating documentary.  Sixto Rodriguez seems to have a warm and charming personality.  Probably too humble for his own good, and possibly one of the reasons he never became huge.  A true artist, and from what we see on film, a fantastic father.<br /><br />A+

0439023491|5.0|I have truly been enthralled with this series.  You want so bad to learn what happens to Katniss and the rest of the characters.  I have to own them all.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Its better than the file explorers that most of the mobiles, tablets tend to use. Try it out and see.
0736092269|5.0|Of several books that I have came across in this category, this is definitely one of my favorite. It is a great resource on the biomechanics and execution of various exercises. Well worth it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I guarentee that this app is more than just &quot;that horse game.&quot; This app is the real deal. Not only is it entertaining, but its features are too real to be true. This game was simply designed for fun and horse care education.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Great Transaction. This movie has the most beautiful sceens and colors. I would recomend that everyone buy this movie for their collection. Well worth the money.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 5 year-old grandson loves playing Bad Piggies and I enjoy watching him play.  It is amazing how educational and challenging this game is, especially in learning about physics and engineering.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Graphics are great...love the new rope slide and the ability to save my game when I trip up or fall off the edges.
B007QWF26C|5.0|a very very very very good I did loved this is a really really good movie to watch at home.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Good show. I watch it habitually. Will buy the entire season and it is the only show I buy the dvd.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|I was looking for this particular set for a friend of mine as his was destroyed in Hurricane Katrina.  I was so suprised to find the same 2 vinyl set on Amazon. The quality is awesome and he is VERY happy to have his Hendrix set again!  The delivery was on time and the packaging was great.  Thank you Amazon!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Walking the Pacific Coast  Trail before you are truly prepared.  No one starts a quest fully prepared and neither did Cheryl.  I could relate. I loved this book with all its faults, maybe because of them. A fantastic read, but I am a hiker and have made most of the same mistakes.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I absolutely love The Walking Dead!!! And i just bought season 2 the other day! Can't wait for season 3 to return next week
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Pretty good album.But I'm one of those who thinks KISS isn't KISS while missing half of the band.Ace Frehley and Peter Criss are really missed.My opinion,half the band half as good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game. cant stop playing. wish it could b real. love love love it. one of the best realistic horse gamed
B0050XFYNA|5.0|The movie is of two brothers who's love grows by the year.  Their love has no bounds be it between themselves or their parents.  As the parents watch their sons grows they become aware that something is different however after discussing it decide they don't want to talk to the boys and or tell them whats happening is right or wrong.  This is a movie you'll want to watch over and over again.  A lot of love, caring and sharing.  It's a romantic movie!  Not for those who are looking for sex scenes.<br /><br />Foreign film with English captions..............  Just goes to show you &#34;Doesn't matter who you love, but that you love&#34;
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I opened the app one day and all my information was gone.  Everything I had unlocked was gone all my character and boards. all of my points erased. very frustrating.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Love all the movies and this is awesome
B0099114WO|4.0|My wife and I really liked the movie.  We both like Meryl Streep  The story was good and the plot was good
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Love all the movies and this second part is incredible!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Love this series! As a stay at home mom, the only chance I get to read is at night. And this series NEVER dissapoints!  The author has a way of getting  you totally lost in the action,get to know each character personally, and have  you holding your breath while you read the next line. Being very familiar with the DC metro area, I can picture every scene in my head. Which makes the story come alive. So glad my dad told me to read this series. I am loyal Baldacci reader for sure!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game because it is addictive and really fun also it is well thought out and overall amazing
B009XWD02G|1.0|It wasn't what I thought. I thought it would allow me to get my mp3 downloaded from my email, it's a money making thing for Amazon...it so I could down load mp3 I purchase from Amazon, which I'm not planning on doing.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|This is a good game, but it's FREE on Google Play. The Amazon App Store is a joke, not to mention the face that my phone seems to not like it much.
B007Q0OUKS|3.0|This was a gift for my grandson, and he picked it out.  He said it was fun to put together, but it fell apart when he tried to move it like most Lego sets.
B0011EVSGE|5.0|My 3 year old granddaughter watches this movie every time she is at my house!!! We LOVE it!!  Very entertaining!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I received the DVDs last week and I'm certainly enjoying them.  However, I have one BIG complaint.  I have noticed that at least a few scenes that aired on PBS are not on the DVDs.  (As of today's date, PBS has not even finished airing Season 3, so who knows how many more scenes I'll discover are missing.)<br /><br />I have watched the previous two seasons on PBS and then purchased the DVDs.  The DVDs for Seasons 1 and 2 feature additional scenes that were not aired on PBS.  We know that at least for the first two seasons, PBS edited the program to fit their time slot, and it was understood that the \\"Original UK Versions\\" of the DVDs contained scenes that PBS had cut.  When my Season 3 DVDs arrived, I was looking forward to seeing all the \\"extras\\" that had not aired on PBS. It has been very disappointing to not only not find the extras I was hoping for, but to see that scenes and portions of scenes I saw on PBS are missing.  (I have the two \\"official\\" books on Downton and have read various interviews with the actors, etc.  Based on what I have read in these sources, scenes appear to have been cut even before it aired in the U.K., and the actors and author of the books were seemingly not aware of this.  How disappointing!)<br /><br />In my opinion, it is misleading for PBS to advertise it as the \\"Original UK Edition.\\"  Although this statement may technically be true, based on their experience with the past two seasons, fans of the show have understood this to mean they are getting a more complete version of the season.  It would be great if they would release versions for all three seasons that include EVERYTHING before the final edits were made for British or American TV.
0061124958|4.0|A great book little book in fine condition. We'll cherish this for many many years to come. We are loving it.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|We got this for our daughter.  She loves it, and it is also entertaining for adults.  Well crafted story.  There is a little scary voodoo to get through, but overall it's a great story.  If you have spent any time in New Orleans, you will enjoy it even more.
0553801473|5.0|The farther I get into this saga the truly epic expanse reveals itself. A truly phenomenal accomplishment by Mr. R.R. Martin.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My baby plays this game for hours at a time. I sneak and play it myself sometimes. Easy instructions and great graphics.
B00005MP58|5.0|I got this to have it as part of my book collection on my computer..no more space as I have been downsizing...always a great read!
B007AMMZA4|5.0|What a thrilling and suspenseful movie!  It's worth buying it for my Amazon library and the fact that it's in Spanish doesn 't disturbe at all.  You can read very quickly and still see the film.
1451648537|3.0|This was a gift for my son who is in college and admits he hasn't read it yet, but wants to get to it...what can I say...I have lots of books I haven't read yet
B008OHV5HS|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet.  This album took a few listens to for it to really impress upon me probably because of the quantity of long songs.  The end result though is a thorough enjoyment and appreciation for what is a spectacular album.  It is still distinctly Threshold but departs from the similar themes/sounds of \\"Pressure\\" and \\"Dead Reckoning\\" which were also excellent.  This album offers a bit of everything while maintaining a unified feel/personality.  I believe it might be my favorite album of 2012 (although I got it in 2013).  I won't compare or rate the two singers but will say that Damien does a wonderful job at vocals.  I will be loving this album for a long time and look forward to what they put out next too!
0761171703|5.0|As i said it already, it has been love at first sight. Since i found Jordan's web page and went through the videos and try to figured out where to get the book. I loved it, i still love it and i love to come back to it over and over. Is what i think about life, there is that magical feeling in it, the way people, some people truly are but you can't see it from the \\"outside\\". Its a journey in people's souls,the way our creative and not material being is. He is been able to capture and recreate on camera what we would be able to see in the parallel universe of our minds. Now i just have to find him to get the book signed!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Works out great easy to use and helps with spelling, It also helped out my mom because she doesnt know english to well so it was really convieant to use for her
1616550414|5.0|I never thought I would see such glory with my mortal eyes. Every corner of this book is a true work of utterly beautiful art.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I just love pinball so i dont have much to say about it, it takes me back to the good old days
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very entertaining and the daily challenges are great, they will keep things fresh and fun plus you'll come back for tons of subway surfing action; I know you'll love it just like my 4 year old nephew and I love it. I hope this review helps :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series.  1 & 2 seasons were equally as good.  I hope they will continue this series for many years to come.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|My opinion is that I don't think it's the best. I like subway surfers because you get to move it with your finger and not have to control unit electronic with is hard to do.
034580404X|3.0|Got this because I read comments on facebook by friends that were reading it.  Pretty naughty and lame but most entertaining as well.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I loved this book it kept me wanting to read more.<br />I recommend that you all know that a good reading this book is.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|It was a gift, but my mom loved it. The kids watched it & wanna watch it over and over again.
B008476HBM|3.0|I thought it was a good book, but definitely a hard read. I had to read it for school. And I thought it was a great love surely and I liked how the women rolled were powerful.
0060012234|5.0|I totally loved this book. I was a little wary at first because so many glbtq books are poorly written or totally off base. This book was honest, realstic, and has a good twist in the end. Everyone should read this book regardless of their orientation. It shows what its really like to be gay in high school.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is way better than the fist one!!!!!!!! Play it all the time. A kid at my day care plays on my kindle and that is one of the games.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app, fun games and activities, best for 7 and up. However, it's really expensive to buy a second horse. My younger sister loves this game too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game to play against your friends!!! The themes of the game will change once in awhile so it keeps the game interesting.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Good season. All my friends have borrowed this and they are now watching. A little gruesome at times though..Would recommend..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is full of everything It missions daily challanges I prefer this game for anyone I think it is truly the best game ever
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is great. There are a few options so you can customize it how you want: volume, downloading new sounds, sleep timer function, etc. I used to use a sleep function on my phone that allowed me to customize the actual sounds. For example, I could make it so the rain function could be accompanied by birds, frogs, chimes, and/or wind. Even without that option, I think this app has enough white noise options to top that.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's great for if you are a little lazy just the word write it down THEN BAM ITS RIGHT THERE FOR YOU TO SEE IT
030758836X|4.0|Some spoilers may be revealed in this review.<br /><br />Amy takes revenge to a psychotic level.  I found myself cheering for her at first, thinking it pure brilliance.  I could relate to her - the betrayal, the insecurities, the lack of appreciation and love.  I sympathized with her...<br /><br />Then, I realized she is just a crazy, controlling b*tch.<br /><br />And then I sympathized with Nick.  I was really hoping that he would outsmart her, earn her trust, catch her at a weak moment and turn her in.  I'd even be ok with him killing her.  But no...Flynn wanted to be mysterious or whatever.  Personally, I think it's a lazy way to end a book.<br /><br />Regardless, I give it four stars.  It held m interest and was well written - the complexity of the characters was extremely well developed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good but should go in mine more and do crazy mine tricks of the mine. Oh and fun to pass time.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I loved this book! I did not want it to end and I want to know if the Peculiars found another loop. I would like to imagine they did:)
0525953728|5.0|OH MY GOD THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD!!!!! Okay, now that I've got that out of the way, let me explain how I feel about this book.<br /><br />I am naturally very interested in military history and even fictional military-themed thrillers. So, naturally, I was drawn to this book and wanted to learn more about the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden, since it is a huge piece of modern history that I feel is important to be understood. This book does NOT disappoint. There were parts in the book where my heart was beating quickly and I was really excited to get to the next page. There were also parts of the book that were less of an adrenaline rush and more of a learning experience. You learn a lot about the man who wrote the book, and you learn a lot about what Navy SEALs do, and what their lives and personalities are like. I was pleasantly surprised to be educated not only about the mission which inspired this book, but to also learn about the PEOPLE who made it happen, because they are the ones who we owe a great deal of respect to.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much, but this book is great and I HIGHLY recommend it, even if you're not interested in military history. It's a VERY quick read, it never gets dull, never sounds like a lecture, and it's really very interesting. Another thing that I LOVED about this book, which I didn't find out until I had finished it, is that most of the profit the author gets from this book is donated to non-profit organizations that help wounded Navy SEALs and their families. I respect this author so highly.<br /><br />PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. You won't regret it.
B000J233SK|5.0|As always, Loreena has the voice of an angel. Her soulful renditions touch the heart of any listener. Her powerful words and voice along with the beautiful music could calm the wildest beast.
B004TB6GUY|4.0|Alright, so another Black Label Society album, and you know what that means: Tons of bludgeoning riffs and blazing solos. Oh wait, that's right, 2011's \\"The Song Remains Not The Same\\" showcases the other, different kind of BLS, the kind that is completely acoustic and bluesy. It is the kind that owes as much if not more to Seattle's rainy skies than it does to England's pioneering doom metal. Indeed, there is a strong Alice In Chains and Nirvana influence present throughout many of these songs; but this is far from being a grunge album. It is more along the lines of a grungy hard rock record, and a clear continuation of 2004's also unplugged \\"Hangover Music, Vol. 1.\\" (And when the two albums are placed back to back with each other, this one definitely gets more favorable nod.)<br /><br />There are a handful of cover songs present, here. For example, consider \\"Junior's Eyes,\\" a Black Sabbath cover, and a beautiful, piano-abetted brooder that features some especially lovely and infectious cooing and \\"ooh-ooh-ooh\\" sing-along refrains.  \\"Helpless\\" is an awesome, and extremely morose and serious Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young cover with accomplished, baritone, if slightly raspy-sounding crooning. And similarly, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" a Simon & Garfunkel cover, is another melancholy piano ballad complete with more sweet, accomplished singing. And finally, \\" Can't Find My Way Home\\" is a lovely Blind Faith cover driven by cool-sounding keys and symphonic-esque violin accompaniment. And, of course, this song is also of note for having a terrifically doomy vibe about it, as well as featuring an excellent, nicely clean, epically wailing, and partially-shredding guitar solo. (It just might be the album's best solo.)<br /><br />Rounding out the set are tracks like the opening \\"Overlord,\\" a very, very catchy and laid back, blues-rock ballad reminiscent of Lynnyrd Skynnrd (another one of Zakk Wylde's biggest influences), Rebel Meets Rebel, and the above-mentioned Nirvana and A.I.C.. Song number two, \\"Parade Of The Dead,\\" meanwhile, is a beautifully somber and low-key, piano-driven ballad with a fiery-yet-melodic and very ripping soloing section. Then comes the pretty and jazzy \\"Riders Of The Damned,\\" which is peppered with more pyrotechnic soloing.<br /><br />But the set's two biggest standouts are likely its two ending tracks, \\"The First Noel\\" and \\"Darkest Days.\\" The former is a beautiful set closer that sounds not unlike a continuation of \\"America The Beautiful,\\" the closing track from Black Label's \\"1919 Eternal\\" album. It is an entirely instrumental song that features beautiful, harmonic melodic riffing and sweeping soloing. And the latter track is quite possibly the \\"The Song Remains...\\"'s highpoint. It is a very pretty, darkly melodic, and melodramatic-sounding cut, and one that finds country music star John Rich entering the fold. Rich's vocals are a perfect fit with the rest of the music, as he chips in with irresistible vocal hooks and choruses (just try to get \\"stay, rain/take it all away\\" out of your mind!). \\"Darkest Days\\" is also highlighted by a tapping, crystal clean-sounding arpeggio guitar solo from Zakk that is positively gorgeous.<br /><br />\\"The Song Remains Not The Same\\" is not the kind of release that newcomers to Zakk Wylde and/or Black Label Society are expected/recommended to start with, because it is clearly not a good representation of the band's true sound. (For that, proceed directly to, say, 2005's \\"Mafia.\\") Regardless, though, \\"The Song Remains...\\" is a really good hard rock/heavy metal record, and one that is likely to appeal to fans that are even outside of the realm of heavy music. Why? Because it is, after all, one of the absolute finest acoustic albums you are likely to come across this side of Opeth's \\"Damnation\\" and Alice In Chains' \\"Unplugged.\\"A.I.C..

1933492953|4.0|Shows how much you can imply, with just a bit of developed space.  Very interesting for illustrators and story board artists alike.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|It was difficult at first getting used to the format of the letters being written back and forth but soon got into it and thoroughly ed enjoyed it. Plus the historical perspective was well done.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Vera good, i loved it. The quality of the movie is really good, and the movie in general is very intersting
B005LAII8K|3.0|\\"Looper,\\" written and directed by Rian Johnson (\\"Brick\\" \\"The Brothers Bloom\\"), plays out like a made-for-TV Philip K. Dick adaptation. This is basically a TV episode or a 20 minute short film drawn out to be a 120 minute feature film. The film has one great idea that is intelligent and thought-provoking, but sadly the rest of the film is mostly generic and cliché, despite the fine acting from always reliable Joseph Gordon-Levitt and charismatic Bruce Willis.<br /><br />The \\"looper\\" is a sort of contract killer getting rid of people sent from the future by criminal organizations. There is a set of rules for disposing the victims, but the most important is that you cannot let anyone escape - even if your next target is yourself.<br /><br />After the fairly entertaining first 30 minutes, \\"Looper\\" quickly loses momentum, looking for a story to tell. Unfortunately, the best Rian Johnson could think of seems to be the \\"TK\\" idea, which only makes the film's second half so predictable. The impressive cast is doing a good job, but despite their effort, it is hard for me to care any one of the characters they play. Also, Emily Blunt and Piper Perabo are both wasted.<br /><br />Any films about time-travelling have some inherent flaws which I will not repeat here. Even great films like \\"The Terminator\\" and its sequel (I'm talking about \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\") are not perfectly free from them. But they have believable characters we can relate to, with a great story to tell, something \\"Looper\\" really needs.
B004SKQAJI|3.0|I enjoyed the story line of the performance but there were whole lot of dancers I would have liked to see more of.  Also, I would have liked to see some of the performance a little closer up - some of it was too far away.  I wish I could have rented it and watched it because I probably wouldn't have bought it.
B004R6JG7G|5.0|This DVD is filled with some of the great up and coming stars of the 1980's. Tom Cruise is great!
B007PBKG5G|4.0|Some traditional music is good - like various types of blues - but get boring after awhile.  I suspect these guys will fall into that category too eventually.  BUT, now they are young, rough and that lead singer has a natural soul that you don't hear too often...especially in heavily advertised music.  There's nothing shocking or really different about these guys, but they are a tight band, and GODDANG this girl feels this music through every morsel of her being.  If you want to hear some passion and don't want to be challenged too much musically, then pick this album up - I doubt you'll be dissappointed.
B00APUQT7I|2.0|This one is not even close to as witty and entertaining as the previous movies.  My kids (11,13) even commented on it not being as funny.<br /><br />I would have to say 'don't bother'
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I loved this film and the story is like a fairy tale as is Rodriguez, the amazing unknown (to America) folk singer.  Better than Dylan.<br /><br />What an endearing man and his lovely daughters.  Hurray for all those in So. Africa who persisted in resurrecting him.<br /><br />I will definitely buy some of his songs.<br /><br />Check it out and feel good.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|The best of the Robin Hood movies that I have seen.  In the blu-ray version, video and audio was excellent. The DVD arrived when promised.

B0082GQ5HG|5.0|This is a good movie for the kids. The 3D is what I expected. My granddaughter absolutely loves it! I would buy it again
0345803485|5.0|This book is unbelievably wonderful. Once I started reading I couldn't find a way to put it down!!!  I can't wait to get the other 2 book!!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Great family movie. The 3D effects are great!  The entire family was watching it. Everyone loved it! I would buy this!
B005D51II0|5.0|Decca records, London Decca, not to be confused with American Decca had grand recordings on lp, but no one ever heard the actual quality of the sound until now. Have gone through most of the CDs at least once. I am VERY happy with this and look forward to more releases. Bought the Mercury boxed set as well. Both are an irreplaceable part of my collection.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie was highly recommended by friends and did not disappoint.  It was everything critics and friends said it would be and more.  Outsourcing has hit everything else and movie comedically hits topic of &#34;outsourcing the elderly&#34;/  There are some very funny lines, but it is not really a comedy, but a very good movie, very entertaining.  Acting is very, very good..
B000SJJCX4|5.0|I've enjoyed adding this little gem to my setup. If it were to cost $100, I would give it four stars for the lack of quality, but for its price it exceeds my expectations. It feels well built physically, it's quite responsive to very minor differences in pitch--it's all around a decent piece of equipment. Only two criticism, which for $23 I can look past: first, it's a little slow to pick up the first note after being switched on, even if it was on only a minute prior, so it takes a few plucks of the string for it to register. Second, it was a fairly convoluted process to put the battery in, as the user has to push two pins in on opposite sides of the pedal and use a third hand to pull up on the moving part. Replacing a battery on Boss gear is much simpler. Then again, I'm glad I bought this and not a Boss pedal, as I'd rather spend my money on effects pedals or other equipment. Also, some reviews I saw before purchasing the product mentioned an overwhelmingly bright blue light to indicate that the device was active; however, the pedal I received has a significantly more subtle orange LED light, which is perfect (though I'm not sure if that's only because I have a battery in it, but I imagine it's the same light even if 9V DC is plugged in). If you're even thinking about getting this product... just get it. It's worth it.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Heard a lot about this movie. Never heard about Jennifer Lawrence but she was exceptional. I loved the story line.
B003O7I6L6|5.0|bought this as a gift for my son, he was sooooo thrilled, he said it was a classic favorite...a man's movie, for sure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love the minecraft PE on my Xoom. BUT, if I'd bought it from the other android app store,  I would be able to PLAY the 0.6.1 update since Jan. 31st.<br /><br />Today I see. 0.6.1 is the current release here, but no update button.<br /><br />Can't down vote the game for this, but Amazon Appstore is minus one times 5 days.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This album has an excellent mix of \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" Josh, but he sounds like he had more fun with the songwriting and recording than in Illuminations. He definitely shows a wide range and distinct style - the cover tracks would be really difficult to distinguish from the ones he wrote if you didn't already know they were covers.<br /><br />Brave: Catchy anthem with an uplifting message...I've already found myself humming it while walking around, like if there were a movie about my life, I'd want this to be part of the soundtrack. Granted, I've also listened to it multiple times on Josh's website since he released the single, so perhaps there's a familiarity effect.<br /><br />False Alarms: I really like how this starts with a melodic harp, then it takes a surprise turn into something more melancholy. It's a wistful piece, but with a bit of rocker style with an insistent beat.<br /><br />Falling Slowly: A slow-dance kind of song from the musical \\"Once\\" that lets Josh loose into falsetto range, though I found the melody line slightly repetitious.<br /><br />She Moved Through the Fair: A nice take on a classic Irish air, with Celtic harp and Uilleann pipes to add to the mood.<br /><br />Below the Line: Another catchy piece that I've found myself humming, and the backstory is great (Josh participated in a program called 'Life Below the Line' challenging him to live off $1.50 for the day, basically like someone living below the poverty line). It's got a bit of tropical-feeling flair, with the flute and the percussion.<br /><br />E Ti Promettero: A slow beginning builds into a soaring Italian duet with Laura Pausini, similar to \\"Time to Say Goodbye.\\" One of my favorite pieces in this album.<br /><br />The Moon is a Harsh Mistress: A sweetly sad song, the kind to be sung sitting on a tall stool with a single spotlight in a cabaret or something.<br /><br />Un Alma Mas: A medium-paced Spanish song sounding like it could have come from Josh's first or second album. Nice trumpet solo by Arturo Sandoval.<br /><br />Happy in My Heartache: An oddly cheerful post-breakup song<br /><br />Hollow Talk: A slow, melancholy piece with a hard-driving, rock-style bridge that's a bit incongruous. Originally by the Danish band Choir of Young Believers<br /><br />Sincera: A medium-paced Italian piece, again reminiscent of tracks from his first album.<br /><br />I Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever): I'd never have guessed this was originally by Stevie Wonder! It builds up slowly, with some delicate touches of harp and humming that swells into a full gospel choir.  Josh's \\"big stupid finish\\" on drums is a fun way to end the album.t solo by Arturo Sandoval.<br /><br />Happy in My Heartache: An oddly cheerful post-breakup song<br /><br />Hollow Talk: A slow, melancholy piece with a hard-driving, rock-style bridge that's a bit incongruous.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a great game to play but it's hard to get gems. You have to pay a lot of money for many more gems.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|An alltime favorite of 90's MTV cartoons.<br />The script is psycologicaly intresting,it brushes on the topic of morbid humor, and reflects an intresting dynamic of teenage life. Understanding Daria and her unpunful jokes can be quite difficult. The conotations and understory create a intresting conversation topic in tv programming.The show brought new artiscal views that persepcitlvely hadn't been seen on television.<br />Final Say- A recommend prescription for outsourcing teens.Not the best, but worth a watch.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I was a it hesitant when i opened the package for this case, but once i slipped it on to my kindle fire, i was ecstatic knowing it was protecting my kindle. I no longer have to lug around any bulky cases, and its a pretty cool color. All in all a 5/5 for this case!
B00683JK9K|4.0|I really like this app I'm having no trouble with it at all its great to pass the time I'm happy I got this app
B004GJDQT8|3.0|Everything varies, including the items for sale. But I understand that apps are always a work in progress. I can't wait until they update/ make a new version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game ROCKS!!! My only request is that kilo would make another app. I like how you can play with your friends.
B007SGM084|4.0|People constantly talk about the sex scenes and assumes its like reading porn but that's not really what, as the reader focused on.  It's more about the love story. I would definitely recommend all three books!
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I didn't particularly care for this, but a younger audience might be more receptive to it. Much more sci go than I would have expected.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I used to love this game but it won't let me get the 3.5 update with advanced controls, baby animals, and signs etc. Also, pocket edition kinda sucks! There are no endermen or villagers and you can't even explode tnt on creative! Plus, creative worlds are only 254 blocks by 254. Please fix this! And I would rate it better if I had the update!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good book. Saw the movie before reading. It was pretty much the same. Will read the next before seeing the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great read by Nicholas Sparks.  I have loved all of the books he has written.  Can't wait for the next book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff Kinney writes the best books I have ever read. I love the diary of a wimpy kid series. This is my favorite so far.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Better than most apps of this type. My grandkids love it.  As for me, my old fingers don't have the coordination any more to make good music but if I did I think it would be good clean fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's awesome and I play it every day it's has every thing since the update on it and it has armor now
B000001ELP|5.0|i am fan of kiss for 30 years the band of rock and roll they are  best of best....! grand band
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is better than temple run and it is so so so so so so so awesome they change the theme every month. But it stinks that you can't post your score on instagram
B00005JSGK|1.0|Maybe the tobacco companies paid for this film because everyone except the monkeys smokes.  They smoke while they are hunting, while they play cards, while they eat, while they talk.  Oh yeah there is an alleged story during all of this.<br /><br />Seems John Wayne, Red Buttons, and assorted other European actors are all members of a company that captures wild animals for zoos.  Using beat up old trucks Wayne sits in a bucket seat on the front of a truck, driven by Red Buttons to rope rhinos, giraffes and lord knows what else.  The climax, if you can call it that, is the capturing of the man eating monkeys using a rocket invention developed by Red Buttons.  The actors wear all sorts of protective clothing like plastic space helmets and hockey pads (always avail in Africa) to protect them from biting monkeys.<br /><br />There is a mild, confusing love interest somewhere along the line.  Marching elephants and plenty of cigarettes and booze round out this thriller.  If you enjoy watching people lighting up, drinking down and chasing animals in old trucks then this is your movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is fun and addicting games. You can play in two modes creative and survival. I would buy it if I were you.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|this film spoke to me on some level.  but it needs to be thought of for what it is, a musical fairy tale. don't try to over analyze the plot and apply critical thinking on every little detail. if you are truly a fan of music, you will understand how the music in everyday situations just calls out to you. Don't even need to play a note, but just to be appreciative of musical talent when you hear it. great direction and acting as well. the film may be a few years old now, but it's a nice, clean film to watch without the constant expletives and violence that plague so many films, even academy award nominees.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game it has awesome new features like gems, silliness and more. I would get this game.
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|good stunts, decent plot, good acting, all around fun film. a pleasant night's diversion. Joseph Gordon-Levitt doesn't get all the accolades he should.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I clicked for the free Bible but it did not download to my tablet and I don't know how to get it.  I rated in poor because I didn't get it.
B00138KDO6|3.0|I had not listened to Rage in quite some time.  So I downloaded the album on amazon.  It was ok, but not as good as I remembered.  Maybe i am getting old :-)
B0063IH60K|3.0|Would like cards to be larger.  I am older and don't want to have to wear my glasses as I play.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Academy Awards -- where are your nominations for best movie ever?  Get with the program and nominate Pitch Perfect for Best Comedy!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. Well written an  kept me on the edge of my seat. Can't wait for a part two ( hint hint)
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|My daughter loved it. she squeeled when she saw it. It arrived quickly also. Would buy it again in a heatbeat.
1439152799|4.0|Read this book in a few days while relaxing on vacation in Cancun.  Good writing, interesting characters, twisting plot story and satisying ending.  I would order more books from this author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a book to be read. Emotions all over the place. It's a must read  now on to the second book of the three.
B0085W09ME|5.0|I'm happy with the app. used on my kindle fire.  easy free accurate. what more can u ask for. thanks
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The animation is great, the story is surprising, the characters amusing, and there is something to amuse the entire family!
B005DESVPO|5.0|Gary Clark Jr. delivers some great music on this Ep.  Mix of hard out guitar rock and acoustic. Immediately draws comparison with other guitar greats, and at the same time its his own sound.<br /><br />The title track 'Bright Lights' is a rambunctious fuzz rich rocking beat that has you cranking up the volume and stepping on the gas.<br /><br />Followed, by 'Don't Own You A Thang' which is an upbeat rock-a-long bluesy number - whoa, those feet of mine are doin' their own thang - and you'll find yourself up on the dance floor or playing skiffle board with the band.<br /><br />The tempo then slows with 'Things Are Changin' ' - an acoustic number that shows off Gary's lyrical voice.<br /><br />The Ep finishes with 'When My Train Pulls In' a second acoustic number, and a real tour de force, which shows you don't have to plugged in to deliver a musical experience that has as much colour as a firework display.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing GKJr at NO Jazz Fest April 2013.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I thought it was fun to envisage our greatest president as an action hero dispatching supernatural enemies within the context of the Civil War era.  Between the (literally) break-neck action and the hilarity of watching &#34;Honest Abe&#34; wield his death-dealing axe, it's possible to have a rousing good time!
B00007G207|5.0|One of my all-time favorites.  Now I'm able to own both versions.  Well worth the cost.  A very cultural experience.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I really do like all of the previous Bourne movies and Jeremy Renner is very good but I just thought the plot was too full of excessive, distracting, unrealist annoyances to enjoy the movie as much as I would have liked.
B005LAIIPS|3.0|This movie won't hold up over time.  There are many holes in it and it seems like they rushed to film it and get it out quickly to make some money.  The good:  Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz had great chemistry and gave top notch performances with what they were given, specifically Rachel Weisz was incredible and really lets loose in this.  The bad:  The first hour of this film may put the average viewer to sleep mumbling, \\"What is this?\\"  Nothing happens, its choppy and barely makes any sense.  The film kicks into high gear in the last hour, but by then it may feel like, too little too late for some.  Jeremy Renner is hardly in it the first hour.  When he is, he's dodging wolves, jumping in water and you can't figure out what his deal is.  There are plot holes scattered throughout this.  Let's not even get started on why it's called, \\"Bourne Legacy\\" when it has nothing to do with Jason Bourne.  They shoud've called it, \\"The Cross Legacy\\" for the character Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner.  We all know if they did that or changed the name, then no one would have gone to see this.  They had to capitalize on the Bourne name to pack the theater otherwise this movie would have been lost in the shuffle.  This is also why there are comparisons to the Bourne series because of the name.  Edward Norton is an awesome actor and played a thankless role in this where they could've got any no name to play it.  This felt more like a Sunday afternoon TV movie.  It's watchable, but takes awhile to pick up if you can make it that long.
B002GHHHIS|5.0|I had this on VHS and have seen it many times. I have been slowly replacing my old VHS format movies with DVDs.  It's a great movie.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres and I was blown away by how good this movie was and how well the CG was done! I wasn't a fan of the first movie but this was way better!
1936608898|5.0|It Starts with Food should be required reading.<br />Calorie counts on fast food and restaurant menus should be ditched and replaced with a one-page synopsis of the most important takeaways from It Starts with Food. I guarantee you many of us would, in turn, ditch our plans for the double cheeseburger with fries and special sauce. Because we would understand EXACTLY the havoc those food combos wreak on our bodies, and our quality of life - no matter how tasty they are going down.<br /><br />It Starts with Food is, literally and figuratively, an eye-opening and ESSENTIAL gut check on what sort of eaters we have become as a whole - especially in North America.<br />If you are a yo-yo dieter wanting to understand why you crave sugar so often, read it.<br />If you are a weekend warrior trying to better understand how best to eat to perform, read it.<br />If you feel like you are all too often battling stomach `issues' and can't figure out why, read it.<br /><br />If you avoid eating fat yet still can't drop those last 10 pounds, read it to learn why you're undermining your health and your lean-physique goals.<br />And if you want to chuckle after one sentence only to feel your jaw drop in amazement and wonder after another, read It Starts with Food.<br /><br />This book by Dallas and Melissa Hartwig is right up there with Michael Pollan's Omnivore's Dilemma in terms of how it can improve our emotional relationship with food, and our understanding of food's true impact and interaction with every aspect of our health and performance. Sure, all we have to do is look around at any mall, airport or sporting event to see that far too many people have become what they eat: tired-looking, bloated, Franken-food-eating fast food-craving zombies. That isn't nice, I know. But it's true. We are what we eat, and many of us are crap. We feel like crap. We look like crap.<br /><br />But even many of us who think we're eating healthy - whole wheat bagels, soy burgers, couscous, peanut butter, etc. - feel less than great and wonder why. It Starts with Food explains the science of why, in a way that would make sense even to a third-grader. More importantly, the authors offer a solution. Not a gimmick. Not a fix-in-a-pill or a \\"meal shake.\\" A real, simple solution: eat from their list of recommended whole foods for 30 days and feel how your body responds. They call it the Whole30.<br /><br />For 30 days, no \\"fiber bars,\\" no frozen meals. No \\"food-like\\" products. Instead, go for animal proteins, fish, eggs, seasonal vegetables, fruits, healthy unprocessed fats like coconut and avocado, plus cashews and certain other nuts.<br /><br />These are the foods they recommend based on research showing that all the other stuff - including whole grains and dairy - can seriously hurt our insides and inner workings by causing overall inflammation, hormone imbalances, sugar spikes and crashes, and worse.<br /><br />The book is peppered with testimonials from Whole30 participants who found that in following the plan, their chronic ailments -- achy joints, high cholesterol, hypoglycemia, headaches, diabetes, skin conditions, low energy levels -- took care of themselves the way our ancient DNA intended.<br />\\"I completed my first Whole30 in March 2010. Through the process, the intestinal pain, gas, and bloating (of Crohn's disease) completely went away - and did not return....because now I understand its root cause.\\" -- Sarah G., Fort Collins, Colorado<br /><br />\\"The Whole30 has set me free of so many things. Now I can look at my plate ...and know when enough is enough. I have, for the first time in my life, learned to listen to my body. ...I am sleeping better. I am feeling better. ...My skin looks better. I have lost weight, and my clothes fit better.\\" Laura C. Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, Ireland<br /><br />The Hartwigs -- both trainers and certified sports nutritionists -- are a blend of drill-sergeant-tough, realism, humor and practicality. They aren't afraid to call B.S. on our lame excuses - noting, for example, that unless you face plant into the box of donuts at work, you don't HAVE to eat them. You CHOSE to eat them.<br /><br />The idea of the Whole30 isn't that we eat so strictly forever. It isn't a low-carb fad diet or anything close to that. Rather, it is a way to clean the slate, so to speak, in our bodies. To eliminate the crap and irritating foods so that we can understand how our bodies perform with the GOOD food - and what happens when we slowly reintroduce things like dairy and grains back in.<br />They write: \\"Remember, the Whole30 is just a springboard into a lifetime of healthy eating habits. We don't expect (or want) you to stay on the program forever, or eat according to our rules all the time! Think of the Whole30 as a tool, allowing you to build new, sustainable habits that will be with you for the rest of your life.\\"<br />It Starts with Food is methodical, walking us through every step and even providing adaptations for people who are pregnant, diabetic, athletes in need of extra calories and certain carbs.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|One of the best movies in the super hero franchise! Not only did they tie the single movies together very well but they made it fun and entertaining for children and adults of all ages! I have watched this movie a dozen times and it never gets old!
B006YTTVHO|1.0|This is more like an article than a book. The book is seriously lacking in substance. Don't waste your time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put it down. The ending was not what I expected.<br />Enjoyed it very much looking forward to ready more of this author.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|***WARNING - SOME PLOT SIGNPOSTS/SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />There are two ways to compare this film, in relation to the previous Bourne films, and compared to other thrillers and films generally.<br /><br />Firstly - how does it stack up against the prior 3 Bourne films, all of which I thought were masterfully executed by all concerned.<br /><br />Answer: If anything, there was a freshness and an edge to this instalment that a fourth instalment with Matt Damon as Bourne perhaps would have carried less successfully<br /><br />While Damon is obviously 'Jason Bourne' incarnate, I think it was tactically a very wise decision to leave it at three great films and not chance a fourth (The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull illustrates just how bad a great idea can misfire in execution...).<br /><br />The difficult thing that the producers/director managed to traverse very well was that the latest film is, as the title says, abour Bourne's Legacy, which suggests, I guess, that it is a tidying up of the mess that unfolded in the previous three instalments,  (the Treadstone Program, unsanctioned black ops, ...).<br /><br />Jeremy Remner (I think that spelling is correct) is a very different actor on screen to Damon, far less emotion on screen, there was none of the turmoil Bourne was constantly dealing with.<br /><br />It therefore takes a while to adjust to the switch. But by the time the first major action set piece arrives in which Remner's character can show his wares, I was completely won over.<br /><br />Remner has assumed the mantle (I don't know whether he would appreciate me putting it quite like that) with characteristic applomb.<br /><br />Anyone who saw Remner in The Town or The Hurt Locker will know what a tremendous presence and intensity he brings to his roles.<br /><br />Turning to a comparison to other contemporary cinema releases generally, I can say without a doubt that I thought it was falwlessly put together, great cast also including Rachel Weisz, and DavidStathairn and Joan Allen reappear.<br /><br />I loved especially the way the previous Bourne movies were brought in to the story to show that the unfolding drama in The Bourne Legacy was taking place concurrently with events (in the earlier film at least).<br /><br />It was quite simply the most enjoyable film I have seen this Australian summer.<br /><br />I would rate it 5 out of 5. For comparison, I would probably give Skyfall 3.5/5 (the Skyfall story was threadbare by comparison).<br /><br />Note for parents: There are some fairly disturbing scenes in this instalment, for example where a co-worker with a pistol runs amok in a secure laboratory, which amounts to a gun spree - so as close as this is to the recent shootings in Newtown, (I am typing this in Feb., 2013) parents might like to keep such scenes away from younger eyes.<br /><br />At the start I wasn't sure what this instalment of the Bourne series would amount to, but it is great to walk into a cinema and not know what is going to happen. By the end credits the next instalment had been set up perfectly, the same closing song we have come to expect kicked in, and I knew I had just seen something where everyone had done a quite brilliant job in every department.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Bourne Legacy.<br /><br />I have watched it a few times on DVD since, and have enjoyed it equally as much.<br /><br />As we say Down Under, the next instalment is shaping up to be '' an absolute cracker'!
B002QY9RMA|1.0|I really wanted to like this album but it was so over produced and boring. Beyonce is being touted as being an amazing vocalist, and that is simply not true. She is mediocre at best. She is a great entertainer, but she is not a great vocalist. She is like the r&b version of Madonna.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been a Star Trek fan for years.  One, actually two friends suggested that I watch this series.  Well, stupid me watched them out of order wathcing them as the date they came out.  Well, I hated it, after one. (The Train Job) I gave the DVD back.  So for Christmas I got a Kindle Fire with Prime (Love it.) I was encouraged to watch the series again.  And I have watched it again and again.  Every time I watch it I get more out of each episode.  I have become a TRUE Browncoat. I have also watched Serenity several times.  I love this series because it not as rigid and sterile as Star Trek. It is a another writers take on what could happen in the future, 500 years in the future even farther then Star Trek.  Only wish there was more then one season(Let down)<br />Side Note.  Love Nathen Fillion, but not enough to watch Castle.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|of course nothing can compare super mario ever. but this is a really good game. its fun and easy to get into.
B00633W614|4.0|Love the continued drama of Harry Clifton. Can't wait for his next installment. Archer keeps you going and wanting to know more about the trials of Clifton. He needs a break, hopefully the story ends with a happy ending....will they live to see the invention of the DNA test?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have never been interested in British drama. This is amazing. I am now ditching my American tv for more British TV. I used to watch all sorts of reality tv. I can no longer watch it when this show is quality show.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I cannot enter any appointments past beginning of May. Looking for a new app now unfortunately, as the functions are pretty good.
0765325950|5.0|After years of waiting, it's finally over.<br />I did really enjoy the book, and once I opened it, I could't put it down.<br />I don't want to be a spoiler, but there were a couple questions left hanging in the last 100 pages or so, but they aren't vital to the story.<br />I was a little bummed about how quickly it did wrap up after the action died though.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Interesting  because it took place in my area. The ending was predictable but the story was interesting. Tom Hardy was good
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed it. Interesting how every flower has a meaning. I thought it was a very good read. Did tell friends to read.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This movie was simply beautiful I loved it and suggest it to anyone :) the phantom of the opera was one of the best movies I've ever seen
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love the Harry Potter series. It is a magical adventure having all the DVD's. I couldn't afford the fancy expensive collection, but am very happy with this. The movies on blu-ray are awesome!
B005IQZB14|5.0|As usual with a great book, I was a little sad to come to the end of the story.  This hike was an incredible, physical accomplishment. Could I do it?  Let's go for a hike!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My kids and I are all addicted to this game.  We fuss over who get'st to play next.  It is very challenging and exciting.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book gave an inside look at the horror of being taken at a young age and the ability of the human spirit to survive.  Kudos to Jaycee Dugard.  I wish her only the best.  She deserves that and more.
B005HSL626|5.0|My son has to wear an eye patch everyday to help make his eye stronger.  This game has been a God sent for that.  It keeps his eye moving constantly and has been helping his eye.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|A fan of suspense and crime novels, The Black Book did not disappoint me. With its clean writing style, this well-paced story is unpredictable and helps the reader get inside the mind of a personally flawed but greatly insightful detective. A good read indeed.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have even gotten my Mamaw hooked on this game.  She wants to play every time she comes over to visit.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am late to read this, but...better late than never, right? This book...spoke to me on so many personal levels. I needed to read it. I'm glad that I did. To the person who read it along with me: I love you, and I always will.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I like the more action packed games more but maybe my little brother will be able to play it before long and he will love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is a great expansion of the classic temple run. better graphics, different obstacles and lots and lots of timewasting fun!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My son and I both love playing this game.  We fuss over who's turn it is!  It is a blast!
1616614609|5.0|I have played Magic the Gathering and other collectible/living card games.  This is by far my favorite.  I would give this a try if you like two player competitive play.  The asymmetric game play paired with its rich theme make this a winner and a must try for any gamer.
B006OW817C|5.0|This recording is about as complete as it gets.  I'm glad I get to hear everybody else's versions of the Diabelli piece, with the Liszt version coming as a very nice stand-out.  But of course Beethoven steals the show.  It's a pretty magnificent composition, and Andreas Staier certainly does it justice.    The review from The Guardian is what made me decide to purchase this, and everything he says is spot on: [...]    It's especially enjoyable to read the sheet music as you listen.  (The first 4 are here: [...])
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have loud ringing in my ears which sometimes keeps me awake.  This app really helps block out the ringing and lets me get to sleep.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a movie that everyone of us enjoyed.  I actually had some very interesting conversations with family members about it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Outstanding app. Highly versatile. Comes with a huge array of great sounds. (including my favorite: \\"Cat Purring\\") Also comes with the ability to download and import an ever-growing list of free add-on sounds from the developer's website.<br />Includes options for auto-sleep timer if you are lulled to sleep, optional do not disturb mode, and white noise during snooze mode.<br />I didn't know how amazing a simple, inexpensive app could be, until I tried White Noise.
B00006JIA4|4.0|My oldest sister received this gift. She was ecstatic about it. She was and still is a huge Queen fan.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great but should have went on longer after they said they loved each other. Totally worth the time to read.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|It's not a bad album. Zooey is definitely on her game. I actually don't like the overall arrangements. It's a personal choice though.
B0055SWM08|5.0|fiance recommended this game. totally. worth the dollar for anyone who loves thinking games. looking forward to trying the newest version.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  I just randomly chose this just because I needed something to read and I was tired on the same old stuff I'd been reading.  This is the first book I've ever read by this author and I'm going to check if she's written anything else.  This book is so well written, it's a story about friendship and love and the things that people do in the name of both.  It's emotional and it's a page turner, buy it, you won't be disappointed!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I picked up this book yesterday and finished it today.  I didn't want to quit reading even though I knew the ending.  Adam overcame a lot to become the best of the best.  His story inspires you to be a better person, father, husband, friend.  I'm glad I found this book and learned about Adam Brown's story.
B007SGM084|5.0|Started a bit slow, was a bit graphic (which I expected), then ended FANTASTIC<br />Very muc worth the time to read, interesting
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|where do I begin...you get creeped with just the opening music and scenes.  I love the writing, the story line, it's all so wonderfully bizarr!
B008PHN6F6|5.0|This is a must see. As I am sure everyone has seen it. The quality is great through Amazon streaming as well.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book opened my eyes as a parent of 2 high schoolers to some of the challenges they have to face on a very regular basis.  It's a tough life with lots of tough choices!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Tom Cruise is too short and too old for Reacher. Great book looking foward to next. Need four more words.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Just putting the last two movies into my collection.  This is one of the better movies of the series that moves you closer to a resolution of the story.
B00B3MN65K|4.0|This album was MUCH better than his 'illuminations' record. It combines both his old style and his 'new style' of music. I still like his old style better (such as 'confessions' and 'awake'), but I enjoyed this album. If his voice lacks in any part, the music more than makes up for it. The music was beautiful and the choirs are amazing. Brave and Below the Lines are probably my top two favorite songs. I would say that this is worth purchasing.
B001JRB16U|5.0|best kids movie of all time julie andrews and dick do a great job with the kids jumping in to drowings  and having tea way up in the air
B00511ONPG|5.0|This book is great for those of you who are new to social media.  Each chapter provides a guideline on how to apply each social media site such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to your business.  At the end of each chapter, the author reveals a success story from a company that used social media to achieve results or solve problems.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I am addicted! I really like to unlock new characters and upgrade power-ups. An overall great game and awesome to play.
1451627297|5.0|As  always, King delivers a story that leaps off the pages. Jake Epping travels back in time to 1958, there to live out a life with the main goal of saving President Kennedy. But the past is obdurate and fights each change Jake makes. The bigger the change, the harder the fight. Through victory and failure, violence and love, each breath Jake takes in the past causes ripples across time. Every action has a consequence. And in the end, he may find that things really do happen for a reason.<br />This is in part a love story and a very touching and sad one. It's also a story about making mistakes and suffering the consequences. And, like all King's books, it's a story about people. Would you change the past if you could? More importantly, should you? 11/22/63 delivers enough action and romance, and even a little comedy, to please anyone.
B0008GNJZY|5.0|I was impressed with the product, and the sending process was very fast. Overall, I was very pleased with the product.

B009PU2KIQ|4.0|I'd heard a few cuts from this and then finally bought the whole thing - why did I wait???  Already listened to it about 5 times.  It's a great mix of styles, but it hangs together nicely.  Glad I took the plunge.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|If you believe in the near death experience that many people have lived to tell about, or even if you're not sure,  this book is a good read.  It is written by a doctor who experienced an NDE himself and came back a believer.  If you're curious about this or need some verification of your own experience this is a great book.
B008476HBM|5.0|\\"Mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\\"<br /><br />First read. Very enjoyable. Loved Mr. Collins. Bravisimi. Oy, vey!
1603427244|5.0|This book gives so many and varied cast ons and bind offs you'll never run out.  There were some in here I had never heard of before.  They work and they each serve different purposes.  Some stitches need a different cast on or bind off technique depending on the pattern.  Some need to be stretchy and some are just pretty.  Get the book.  You won't be sorry.
159420411X|5.0|Great book. Does a great job weaving in the application of hard-headed statistics to a wide range of real world applications - from terrorism to poker, to gambling to elections and many more. I got the Kindle and Audible integrated editions and love switching back and forth from audio to e-book and it syncs your last read spot .<br /><br />Not a pedantic coverage of the subject - very colloquial - which makes it an easy read/listen
B002ZG976U|5.0|Cher and Christina Aquilera were the dynamic duo in this!The singing choreography and music were the bomb!I enjoyed it very much!
0394800184|5.0|This was my daughter's favorite when she was little, and now she is having a baby, so we will read it to her together!  Cute book, good for reading to them, or having them read to you.

B009GESJH2|5.0|Great cd, again!  More country than some of his others, but great.  Lyrics rock, tunes are strong.  If you liked Rock and Roll Jesus, you'll like this one too.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|I somehow can't get my pictures to transfer. So this is a waste of a product, if u can't transfer pictures from your kindle fire HD to computer to print.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book started off slow & I thought it was more for an adolescent. I was very wrong! It is one of the best fiction stories I've read thus far. I recommend it to many friends to read. It amazed me at how tied together everyone was.
B004TP0M0K|4.0|First time reading David Baldacci, enjoyed the read and found it easy to move through. would suggest to others as worth the read

B0002E5O9G|5.0|Talent to spare, a wonderful production, and extraordinary vocal work. If you've only seen the current movie, you must watch this in order to get the full impact of the songs. Sure, I got teary-eyed in the film, but cringed when Amanda Seyfried sang &#34;A Heart Full of Love.&#34; It was almost unbearably bad, and even worse when you compare it with Judy Kuhn's work on the DVD. Sorry Amanda, but the truth hurts! I first viewed this some 10 years ago, and it's even better with time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book can't wait to read the rest of the of the books I just love the way the book is
B006LSZECO|4.0|There are so many twists and turns in this novel, one is constantly surprised at the next turn.  The plot is so complex, just when you think you know what's next it goes in a different direction!  (The ending will surprise you----)
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Threat Vector is too technical and long winded about cyber stealing, but the plot is good.  Clancy's other novels have been better and faster moving.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Great development of the characters.<br /><br />Do not like the FBI man; hate the lesibans, fast forward through those parts.<br /><br />Why kill off Michael?
B001KEHAI0|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. What a fun way to make a philosophical point.  It's simplicity is brilliant!

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I read this because it was recommended to me. I'm in a relationship that is on the verge of ending. I was hoping for something to help me fix it or at least give me a way to cope. This book was astounding. I intend to try speaking my spouses love language, if I can change our relationship it might save us from losing a 6 yr relationship. I intend to recommend this to all of my friends. You never know who it might help. Fantastic book and highly recommend for everyone. Enjoy.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Now that I have faster internet, I can view more then I ever had before. I like the way it is set up. I am still learning the process.
B002KV8NQ0|4.0|I recently bought a different Imelda May CD recently and fell in love wiht her style, band and songwriting.  This CD is quite good but the songs as a group are not as striking as the &#34;More Mayhem&#34; CD.  Although this is the case, I would still highly recommend this CD as a nice addition to your collection.  Especially is you are a discerning music listener.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book just kept you in suspense of what was going to come next. I don' think the sexual acts that were so profounding detailed was necessary
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I love this show and it seems to keep getting better. It's funny, the action is satisfying, and the cast is awesome.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I am not really happy with the writing of EL, I think the sex is not to tolerate but I was intrigued with the back ground of the man and how he grew up.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The story was well written and the acting superior.  The audience broke out in applause when the movie was at its end.  I admit that most of us were in the older generation but  what a good feeling this movie gave all of us.  It truly conveyed that life is not over at 55 and beyond.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Had a great time with my own private ALIEN marathon when I was sick

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Very Funny and laugh out loud . It is such a unique story idea I was surprised it turned out so well.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|TheTudors was the most awesome part of history to date...King Henry the V111 was magnificient in his Roll.<br />Costumes were supberb in everyway...I learned so much more than just reading a history book of finding out<br />more on King Henry teh V111 in the Book of Knowledge...I wanted more of an ending with Princess Mary after<br />she became Queen...and her sister who adventually became the Queen and was an outstanding Queen for<br />many and more years to come. Wish there was more of an ending. After having so much drama with Queens<br />being poisoned, beheaded and burned...it would have been nice to a little norm at the end..I guess it was said<br />enough in the closing.  The writer, director, clothes designer etc., were out of sight!!!! Your glued to the story<br />almost compelled to see one CD right after another...I will watch this over and over until I get a better understanding of the entire period of this remarkable part of our history. I can't complain one iota...Perfect in every way. King Henry the V111 was excellent...like that he was a little younger too..very handsome man in this story...the series was exceptional and I don't regreat one moment for ordering all the CD's entire Album.
B009O2XY12|3.0|It runs well most of the time. In game they never give the right color bubble when you need it, with the limited bubble supply this gets annoying.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. I rarely read anything in the young adult section and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the story. I would recommend this series to anyone who is about 12 years of age and above.
B00439ONA2|1.0|I just received this DVD from some company in Italy. According to the information on the disk it is in the Italian<br />language. Also, I was not able to play it on either of my DVD players.  I received a message on my player that this disk is unknown. This is the second DVD I have purchased from you that I have had problems with.<br />I have purchase several movies and music disks from you and have been very satisfied but if this continues I will be required to try and purchase items from a local source.
1616550414|2.0|The middle third is a blur because I was so annoyed at the first third, and I think maybe I was crying by the end?  It does get into the other games, but the depth (and time, and space) of Skyward Sword's coverage in the beginning made me weep for what we must be missing from other titles in the series.  Not one other game received anywhere close to the attention skyward sword gets when you first open the book.<br /><br />The artwork is beautiful, the lay-out isn't terrible, and I really need to look through the rest of it before I can offer more.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I have read this book several times. Love it! every young child needs to get his eyes away from video games, movies,and so forth and read a book that makes him use his imagination
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this amazing book in two days, only because I forced myself to take a break for other responsibilities! Written in first person narrative, it felt like I was reading a science-fiction novel, when I was actually reading novel science-NON-fiction! As such, it both satisfied and stimulated both hemispheres of my brain, while simultaneously engaging my heart in the process. Highly recommended reading for awareness/consciousness-dynamics explorers!
B000QE1U9K|3.0|I thought this movie was going to be absolutely awful...I was wrong, but it definitely wasn't great. Every character I cared about died early on or by the end of the movie and some of the CGI footage of the alien running was laughable. I recommend watching it, but keep in mind, the first two movies are MUCH better.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Needed it for work. I use ppt files on it as lesson plans. I prepare the ppt on my 'outer at work and email them to myself. I open and save it on my tablet and I am ready to teach. Just what I wanted it to do!
B00683JK9K|4.0|It is still Winter here where I am at and most likely Summer for those South of the Equator.  Fortunately with today's free app of the day I got from Amazon it doesn't matter since this is Magic Puzzles: Seasons.<br /><br />Unlike most other season themed games that tend to focus on one of the four seasons, this includes all 4 seasons so there are jigsaw puzzles to put together with Summer-like scenes or Winter-like scenes or Spring or Autumn if you prefer to do one out of season.<br /><br />There are approximately 20 puzzles you can put together that are included in this app.  There are 4 different levels where each level has a different specific number of pieces to put together.  You can make it rather simple with only 35 pieces in the puzzle or make it rather difficult with 216 pieces or pick one of the 2 levels in the middle.  To make it more difficult you can fix the puzzle where you have to rotate the pieces to fit them correctly into the puzzle.<br /><br />There are some minor negatives for which combined I deducted one star for:<br /><br />1.  Even though you have an option to show only the edge pieces, I found it to be somewhat annoying that the edge pieces could still be dragged off the screen even though I had put together the entire boundary of the puzzle.  It would have been nice to have this app be intelligent to know that those pieces are in the right places and have them locked into place so they can't be accidentally moved around once you complete the border.<br /><br />2.  I found that beat noise made when you select the pieces or rotate them to be quite annoying.  It would have been nice to use different sound effects for different actions.<br /><br />3.  I would have preferred another tune or two besides the one included with the app.  But this issue is rather minor since one could just turn off the music in the app and play an mp3 of their choosing from their device or cloud drive.<br /><br />4.  Finally, the app could use a little work on the responsiveness of selecting things.  I found myself having to select things a few extra times quite often.<br /><br />But since all these above issues are somewhat minor, I am giving this one 4 out of 5 stars.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|I purchased this 6 months ago to connect my new Macbook to my old Dell monitor.  It has been plugged in/unplugged many times as I travel frequently for business.  I have had no problems at all and recommend this product.

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I was engaged at the beginning, but it eventually demanded such a high-level of suspension of disbelief that I gave up on it. It became prosaic and pedestrian
0812550706|5.0|For some reason I thought I had read Ender's Game shortly after it first came out.  I have vague memories of talking about it excitedly with classmates.  Yet as I picked it up and started reading the book recently, it quickly became evident that I either never read the book or I read it so quickly that most of the details had fled my memory.  I suspect that I just never read the book.  What I do \\"remember\\" about the story are small whisps of general plot points which I'm sure I simply \\"remember\\" due to various conversations with friends and family over the years.  Essentially I knew the very basic plot of the story...that we are sometime in the distant future.  Earth has fought of two attacks from an alien threat and they are preparing for what could be the final war of humanity.  As part of the preparation, they have created a \\"Battle School\\" populated with young kids and training them in strategy, tactics and combat.  Ender Wiggins is one of these young children and the story follows his adventure through Battle School and the training games that happen there.  That bit of plot is laid out in the book synopsis and was the extent of my \\"memory\\" of the novel.<br /><br />Whether or not I read this previously, I came to the book with fresh eyes.  I quickly found myself intrigued by the future Earth presented in the book.  The world was comfortable and familiar in many ways.  We start the story in middle class America observing a family with sibling squabbles.  We're presented with the stress and anxiety of a distant enemy who threatens peace and tranquility from afar.  There are some futurific sci-fi elements, but they are simple and well integrated and described in such a way that everything feels very natural.  We learn a little about the political unrest both on the planet Earth and across the Galaxy as the world tries to figure out a way to deal with the \\"buggers.\\"<br /><br />As we get to know about the family structure of the Wiggins family, we learn about Ender's place in the family.  We get to know his violent (almost psychopathic) older brother Peter and his loving older sister Valentine.  Ender is picked on mercilessly by his brother.  Because Ender is being considered for Battle School, he is constantly monitored.  In spite of the monitor, Peter finds devious ways to torture him physically and psychologically.  After a time, Ender is told he has been denied for Battle School and his monitor is removed at which point he is subjected to even more physical violence.<br /><br />Shortly into the book, Ender is summoned to Battle School.  It's a surprise to everyone since they'd figured he'd been passed over and didn't have a chance.  Due to the current state of affairs, neither Ender nor his family are given any choice in the matter and he is quickly shuttled away.  Upon arrival at Battle School everything seems to be stacked against him.  Even on the shuttle to the school, Ender is thrown into a situation where he is picked on and forced to defend himself.  Once at the school, he is taunted and discriminated against because of his age, his size and his status.  He is put into groups where it feels everything is against him.  Teachers and leaders refuse to assist him and seem to be proponents for his ostracizing.<br /><br />The book was structured such that many of the chapters began with a conversation (either written or spoken) between some unseen adults.  It's apparent that these adults are leaders of some kind in either government or military capacity.  We read as they make plans for Ender and for the coming war.  We are never given full insight into their character and the conversations are usually very short and don't show any specific action or motivation.  These conversations serve to provide the reader with insights into why Ender is being treated the way he is.  We find that Ender's life and situations are being manipulated at a higher scale.  Some higher power is working to keep Ender isolated and lonely, to present him with as many difficulties and obstacles as possible.  They speakers seem convinced that Ender is the hope for humanity and they have determined that the best \\"training\\" he can receive is that of hardship in order to stoke the fire within.<br /><br />Ender progresses through Battle School frustrated and alone.  He slowly makes progress but constantly feels like he is being pulled back just when he should be getting ahead.  He slowly associates with some kids who could become his friends but finds that obstacles continue to get in the way of any true friendship.  Ender's life is one of endless frustration.  And yet, as hoped for by the invisible adult speakers at the beginning of the chapters, Ender's confidence and abilities grow as a result of this forced self-reliance.  As time progresses, he shows himself capable again and again.  More than capable, he forces himself to excel in defiance of the struggles heaped upon him.<br /><br />In Battle School, there are two \\"games\\" that Ender plays.<br /><br />One is a direct part of their training and consists of two teams of 'soldiers' entering a field and fighting to make their way either through their enemy's portal or disabling all of the enemy team.  The game is played in a zero gravity chamber often cluttered with various walls or other objects.  The players are in \\"flash suits\\" which become hard and \\"frozen\\" when shot with a laser gun.  This game serves to teach the students how to work together as a team, follow orders and deal with the tactics and strategy of combat in the form of a game.  From a high level, it was organized like a sporting event like Football or Soccer but to me it sounded more like sci-fi capture the flag.  Sounds pretty fun actually.<br /><br />The other game presented to Ender is an adventure style video game.  The game is very much in the style of the adventure game of the 70s and 80s when this book was initially released.  The player drives an \\"avatar\\" through the game and interacts with the game world to try and solve various puzzles and progress through different game areas.  Partway through the book, we learn that the game program is dynamic.  It changes and adjusts to the player based upon what the game feels the player can learn from.  I've always been a fan of the adventure game genre and I could picture myself wandering through the game world trying to figure out what to do next.  As the book progresses and the game begins to adapt to Ender, the game becomes a sort of psychological look into what may be going through Ender's mind.  By the end of the book, this is very true.<br /><br />While Ender's up at Battle School, his brother Peter has grown  power hungry down on Earth.  Still barely a teenager, he's devised a plan to show off his intelligence and to influence the political situation of the world.  He manipulates Valentine into helping him and they do actually begin to have political influence on the world.  They do this through a 1980s sci-fi version of the Internet.  Valentine and Peter layer themselves behind the anonymity of multiple user accounts and begin posting their ideas and essays out into forums for the world to discuss.  I really loved the prophetic view that the author had of the Internet.  At the time of the book's release, computer networking was still fairly infantile and the concept of a fully accessible World Wide Web was still a decade or more away.  And yet, Orson Scott Card saw the potential of this technology and made it a major player in his novel.  Not for the overall \\"Ender\\" plot line, but it was pivotal for Peter and is remarkably true to our current implementation of the Internet.  Even Ender's plot line had some bits of computer networking.  Each student in the school has a \\"desk\\" which seems to essentially be a tablet computer that's attached to a network.  As a computer nerd, I found this \\"fiction becomes reality\\" to be very cool.<br /><br />For those who haven't read the book before (or like me, who maybe \\"think\\" you've read it...but haven't), I don't want to spoil the way the plot unravels.  The day-to-day training routines and conflicts at school are really pretty interesting.  I especially loved the way we see Ender's thinking and behavior evolve and adapt to the obstacles presented him and the trials he endures.  As his training nears its climax, I was able to guess the end trajectory but the execution still caught me off guard and pulled at me emotionally as I saw the toll wrought on Ender.<br /><br />I think my biggest complaint about the book was that Ender didn't really feel as young as he was supposed to be.  I know part of that is just the situation of the thing.  If you throw a young kid into extreme situations, he will either completely fall apart or he will step up and mature faster than you might expect him to.  Even with that in mind, I really had a tough time envisioning him as a 7 or 8 or even 10 or 11 year old kid.  It really felt like a stretch to me.  I've known some very smart kids in my time and I've known some kids who were pushed to learn and know things far beyond their years.  But even when talking with those kids about advanced topics or having them try new things, it was still evident that they were kids.  Yes, they could recite information.  Sometimes they could even have some deep thought and analysis.  I've seen some kids who could do things physically that their bodies didn't seem old enough or strong enough to do.  But those instances felt isolated and sporadic.  I have a hard time picturing a group of young children who can reach and maintain the level of intelligence, reasoning and physical capabilities presented in the book.  Most of the time when I was reading, my mind pictured a group of older teenagers.  It was only when someone explicitly called out the ages of the characters that my mind pulled back and tried to make them into children again.  It's a cool concept.  It just fell apart too often for me.<br /><br />Besides the story, the book exposes a number of ethical and psychological themes that are often at least on the periphery of political or military discussions.  Probably the biggest theme for me is the idea of \\"ends justifying the means.\\"<br /><br />The goal of the leaders is to mold Ender into their ultimate commander.  To transform him from a young boy into a hardened soldier with the ability to be lethally decisive when called upon.  Putting aside the strange concept of having the training start when he's only 6 years old, the methods of training are arguably unethical.  Similar arguments come up from time to time when dealing with military training or sometimes even sports training.  I remember stories in recent years of kids being hospitalized in critical condition after being \\"forced\\" to run for hours in summer heat in their football gear.  Similar hardships are sometimes reported from other sports trainings or military boot camps.  Coaches and military leaders are usually envisioned as harsh, unmerciful and over-demanding.<br /><br />Ender is berated verbally and constantly pushed by his commanders.  He is forced to train and train and train in ways that leave him physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted.  And then rather than allowing him to rest and recover, he is forced to continue beyond the breaking point.  Each training exercise is harder and more brutal than the last.<br /><br />In addition to the harsh regime of training and learning, Ender is subjected to hazing and harassment from fellow students.  Rather than coming to his rescue or even providing some sort of ground rules for his protection, the adults seem to either ignore the harassment or perhaps even encourage it.  Already at the point of breaking down simply from the harsh training, Ender feels himself breaking apart from attacks on every side with no hope of help or relief.<br /><br />And yet, at the end of the story, the results are positive.  Ender learns what they hope he will learn and becomes the commander they hoped he would become.  Nevermind that he's a broken husk of a human being.  The \\"ends justify the means.\\"  In the final chapters of the book, this theme is discussed a bit but no strong conclusion is outlined.  Some of the events of the concluding chapters of the book seem to suggest that \\"life goes on\\" and that in spite of the harsh \\"means\\", the \\"ends\\" were justified.  But below the events at the end of the book, we get to go inside Ender's head and gauge his reactions.  We are also taken on an interesting journey with Ender as he picks up a new quest to bring his life meaning.<br /><br />This new twist in the plot struck me as strange since it makes you consider the \\"ends and means\\" argument again, but from a new perspective.  Perhaps the \\"ends justify the means\\" can be applied in certain extreme situations.  But who has the authority or knowledge to be the judge of which situation is appropriate for extreme measures?  Who has absolute knowledge to determine that the \\"ends\\" we seek are the \\"ends\\" that are correct?<br /><br />From a pure entertainment perspective, I really enjoyed this book.  I admire the vision and foresight of Orson Scott Card to create a future world that is so real and true to the trajectory of humanity.  In addition the pure \\"story\\" element, I enjoyed the detail and depth and truth of the cultural, political and psychological elements of the situation.  I've never been in the military or experienced that degree of training, but the presentation of the Battle School and the military leaders seemed realistic and appropriate for the given situations.  I read a note somewhere that says some US Military organizations actually encourage their people to read this book in order to gain insight into the psychological and mental aspects of military training.  Kind of interesting.<br /><br />I'm really glad that I finally read this book.  I'm excited to know that Card has written additional books in Ender's world and I look forwardto seeing what else he has in store.<br /><br />*****<br />4.5 out of 5 stars
B000WCDBKM|4.0|One of Johnny Depps earlier works shows how versatile he his. This is a great suspense thriller with all the plot twists you could want. This is a movie for people who like a good story line & plot not special effects.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. The arcade level is my fav. It's so fast paced. I also love the fruit trivia.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is going to be remembered as one of the greatest authors of our time. Mark my words.<br /><br />Yes, this is technically a young adult book. Fortunately, John Green writes for young adults as they are, which is that they are capable of understanding and processing complicated emotions and situations, and dealing with them appropriately. They're teenagers, and thus use adult language and break rules, but are also not prone to temper tantrums (mostly) and flawed young people.<br /><br />AFTER you read this book (not before), go read what John Green has to say about the novel and how he writes for young adults. His frankness and his respect for young people is something most people need to take note of.<br /><br />That said, the story is well rounded, interesting, and heartbreakingly wonderful. Read with tissues. You'll need them between laughing fits.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I got this game for my daughter, and she loves it! I have to limit her on it because she can play it for hours. Great game, especially for the price!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is cool and I don't even care that much for horses.So my point is that this game could be for anybody but animal abusers
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I got this game for my 4 year old daughter, and she loves it! The only thing I don't like is that you have to use gems to buy some of the key ponies like Rarity and the gems are hard to come by unless you buy them, which I am not willing to do.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this.  Story kept your attention.  It was a great ending.  I would have never thought that Nicholas Sparks could have done a better job with the ending.<br /><br />A very good read!

B000002ITW|5.0|Beautiful lyrics bring back the old days.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is so much fun. EVERY TIME I go on my kindle I play this game. It's so much fun and I love it. It's addicting and time consuming and you just wanna do better and better every time.
B0067LY4WG|4.0|This album is pure Leonard Cohen. The lyrics are poignant and reflective. Some of the ballads, however, sound whispered. It remains essentially Leonard Cohen...beautiful and melodic.

B008CJ0KI8|1.0|I am a die hard rocker, grew up on cream,hendrix.stones ect. Every article I have read about this fellow has been great so I purchased a copy of his first album. I was very disappointed. I also purchased tyler the creator and that stunk too. I guess I will stick to all of my old rock and leave this new stuff alone.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is very entertaining.  It keeps you awake and trying to beat all that comes along.  You have to pay attention and it is challenging.  It is also very entertaining for the tweens.

B0054X3FQO|3.0|I admit Miranda Kerr isn't much of a writer, but she's genuine and sweet, and if you treat this book as if you are listening to her speaking and talking to you, you'd still get something out of it. I wouldn't pay for the full price paper version though. Flipping through the Kindle version is good enough!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Great little story!<br />Wonderful plot and well written. Instant classic for both children and adults! Very well done by the author!

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I found this book to be surprising, informative and quite entertaining.  The code of chivalry and concern shared by opposing pilots was surprising and the information concerning the lives and well-being of the people of Nazi Germany was eye-opening.

030758836X|4.0|I came into this book knowing nothing about the subject matter or the plot, only that people were raving about it, I think it's best to go into it this way, so I'll keep this review spoiler free.<br /><br />The plot is you get two point of views on the crumbling of a marriage you get Amy's point of view from the past in journal entries,  and you get Nick her husbands present day point of views, as Amy is gone, we don't know if she's missing or dead, all we know is their is signs of a struggle and a fair amount of blood was cleaned up.  We get all the information second hand as Nick finds out and is quickly the prime suspect, but what makes it interesting is both Amy and Nick are people who like to keep secrets and lie.  So their narration sometimes leads the reader astray, which is good fun, trying to find out which is being truthful about this and that.<br /><br />There is a huge twist, and what i found really interesting is the place of that twist, a lot of times the author will reveal it right at the end and not give the reader a lot of time to get used to this idea, but in this book it comes earlier and make you really analyze the twist and the situation.<br /><br />From a writing stand point I really like how the story was told it was very clever, I don't know how they'll work it into a movie script, but it was very interesting. I really like the way she writes men, this is probably the best I've read from someone not of my gender, because she nailed a lot of things that we do and what's in our head.<br /><br />There is some language issues, which didn't bother me, but I know some others will, most of the language is done for shock value, but it's layered into the plot make some of the twist mean more.  Most of it is used in relation to sex and describing of sex, with paints a pretty horrible picture just like the author intended.<br /><br />Why I gave this novel four stars is there is one character that is very revenge happy it reveals, any person that does them wrong, they're going to pay, But there are two characters that do so wrong and ruin everything for a character, and they're practically forgotten about, and mentioned only a couple times after the incident.  The character has other things on it's mind, but still, they get away with taking a lot away from this person, and there were places where it could have been talked about.  The ending, was okay, it works, but it's not really crowd pleasing, I thought she could have done better.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for people don't want to read the convictional twist and turn thriller novel,  that like a little edge to there story, for women trying to find us guys out.em wrong, they're going to pay, But there are two characters that do so wrong and ruin everything for a character, and they're practically forgotten about, and mentioned only a couple times after the incident.

B000067FP8|5.0|I got this movie for my son who loves the Gremlins right now. I have not watched the movie, so I am really rating the product. It was here quick and in great shape. Exactly what I asked for.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Nope, it ain't gonna change your life. But in between a bioghraphy and Harvard Business Review, it's the best easy going book I've read in a long time. Kudos to Ernest - he's the man! Recommend not only to the Geeks and Nerds and freaks, but also to anyone raised in the 80's - or interested in learning more about it. Hope he writes a sequel soon!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Great story from beginning to end. Couldnt put it down and immediately wanted to read the next one. Very well written.
0142001104|5.0|\\"The Art of Possibility\\" is a very enjoyable read full of interesting and amusing anecdotes.  The practices it suggests are also reasonably effective for improving one's life, and have such memorable names (like giving the A and one-buttock playing) that it's fairly easy to remember them.
B002J2PB10|4.0|it's all about the little things, and it's all about the adrenaline; and it's all about the well-honed aesthetic quality... it's all about each and every second as juicy as the last. its a damn good movie. watch it. feel it. see it again!
031250926X|5.0|This is a big sturdy flap book. Such a fun classic story that my daughter loves to read. This is a heavy book, but great.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Woah... lots of twists I didn't see coming.  I finished this book hating almost every character in it.  But I couldn't put it down.  The characters are sick, twisted, narcissistic, and at times just annoying.  The eeriest part of my reading was the fear that Flynn was painting a disappointing/terrifyingly accurate portrait of more couples than we know.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun game to keep you busy while waiting for a bus or an appointmrnt with Dr. or Dentist. keeps you from falling asleep.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Kate Morton is a great author - I have enjoyed each and every one of her books and this is no exception. A lovely read.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I first saw Robert Downey Jr in Iron Man. That being said,I figured I would watch a couple more of His movies and this one was at the top of my list and once again, I wasn't Disappointed. Sherlock Holmes Is a great film and I enjoyed it very much. Its definitely worth watching. And the plot was awesome. I give it a five star. I would tell the story but that would ruin all the fun so just check it out.<br />I hope this was helpful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kool app I really like it all-out fun play all day on the train.my kids love it and my grandfather also plays version<br />From time to time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games ever everybody should at least<br /> try it is addicting but it's worth it<br /><br />P.S.it's better than temple run
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that this game is very cool I love it so much and when I get board this is the first thing I do
B00005LIN0|3.0|I bought this for my wife.  She had seen it before and liked it.  I had never seen it, but was very familiar with much of the music.  I loved the music, but was bored with every other aspect of the story.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is intriguing. It talks about Ana and Christian who was abuse as a child. he found a way to deal with his problems and became very successful. Ana on the other hand is the young lady whom he fell in love with after she interviewed him. they struggle through the ups and down of their relationship but through it all, they loved each other dearly.<br />The book is fantasy based, dramatic and keeps one wondering what will happen next. It's an interesting read. I would recommend it. Goes to show that though one had a sour past doesn't mean your future can't turn out sweet. So there is still hope out there for the lost.
030758836X|4.0|The book has 7000+ reviews so clearly you can trust the average rating. This is the first book I've read by the author so I cannot relate to her other books, which seems to have higher amazon ratings.<br /><br />This is a solid four star book. Not a masterpiece, but a very good read. The story is interesting and just when it begins to drag on a few occasions something happens to bring it back to life. The structure of the book is rather original so it does not feel like the result of a creative writing course. That is good.<br /><br />In my experience, female authors often lose the narrative. Not so this author. A strong narrative and a female perspective add to make this book interesting. Recommended!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun to play. You guys made it so nice to be able to make enough Dragon cash to do fun things and advance, unlike : ( other games that are so stingy you get so frustrated you stop playing. So thank you for such a fun game. Get this game. Go now. Get it, you will have it on your favs the second you start playing.....Thanks again producers and techs.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The game is entertaining if not very imaginative. The core of the game requires building stores and staffing them with ponies to earn bits. With bits you can buy more stores and more ponies - though certain ponies require gems that cost real money.<br /><br />There are several flaws with the game. First certain ponies that are required to complete the game must be purchased with real money. Second the two pony training games are extremely repetitive - even my 4 year old daughter got tired of them after two weeks. Thirdly the elements of harmony required to complete the game accrue incredibly slowly - it will take months to complete this game.<br /><br />All of these flaws could be overlooked except for the fact that it periodically loses game state when you close the game.  This could be as simple as losing the last bits you collected or as bad as losing gems you just bought.<br /><br />In the latest case I lost the entire Ponyville I had helped my daughter build over several weeks - a large investment of time and perhaps thirty dollars. What a waste.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very nice application. i like the image of the battery showing how many percentage i can still use and it also indicate the time that you can use the device on gaming internet etc.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I have used Lastpass on my laptops for a couple of years. It was well worth the upgrade price to use on my Kindle Fire HD and my Lumia 900 Windows phone.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|fun for the whole family. The cat repeats everything you say and the hubby & kids have a blast with this app
B009UWYFFK|1.0|Its been a long time since I watched a movie that I wanted to turn off and skip the rest of it.....forever. Some movies may only have parts that are funny but I cannot recall even one in this film. The closest is the depantsing of the invisible man but it doesnt even get a smile...just a small grimace. Save your money and dont spend even one cent on this disaster. The sad part is there are some well known funny comedians in this movie but its like having a talented team that just doesnt click.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is great to pass some time. Also-once downloaded-does not require wifi to play. kids like it too. some games easier than others
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|I loved the story Rebecca because it sets a mood (uneasyness), and sets different scenes which are described in detail. I could almost draw the house and its many rooms. The story shows a lifestyle that has gone and will never return. The themes are trust, communication and evil.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great way to spend time for free! People race each other make high scores and have fun at the same time!
B000NTPDSW|1.0|I want my money back.  Course I can't because I excitedly opened the package.  Who knew that I would need a brand spanking new BluRay player to see the quality output? The bonus disk talks about how much time and trouble they went through to restore the film.<br /><br />Too bad my VHS copy looks better!<br /><br />Now I know why it was only $18 on Amazon - because only Coppolla has the brand spanking new bluray player required to view this presentation properly!<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE.  My newest player is only two or three years old and it wouldn't play these disks to their fullest potential.  (At least it was only $18 and not $53).

160774273X|5.0|My wife has been learning to bake bread for some time and was getting pretty good at it. But this book took her skills to a whole new level. This is a book about technique and how 4 basic ingredients is all you need to make bakery quality bread. She has baked nearly 10 loaves since I purchased these and the results have been great. I don't bake bread but I too am always interested in tips to improve cooking technique.<br /><br />Note, this book is the real deal because there are no 'easy bake&#34; or &#34;no knead&#34; type of recipes here. Many of the recipes need many, many hours but the results are excellent. My wife has been following them religiously (we even purchased a cast iron pot).<br /><br />Highly recommended if you want to learn the basics of baking.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought this book was a complete was of money.  Nothing but drival and incredibly juvenile in my humble opinion.

B001AKTZPK|5.0|Feeling Blue and Midnight Special are two of my favorite CCR songs.  All of them on this album are great as this easily ranks as one of their best works.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I love this disc - I'm a Buble fan so I'm biased but the song selection and performance thereof is excellent.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Will fit in with her Doctor Zhivago, Gone With The Wind, Butch Cassidy, Magnificent Seven, and many other quality films that will pass the time in a easy splendor.

B00992CF6W|5.0|the game is great but it needs updates. there are so many new things thatbi cant get but I love it otherwise
B00009AOBI|5.0|I ordered the video on Wednesday and it was delivered to my house the next day in Thursday's mail. This movie has extra scenes that actually made it better then the one I saw in the theater. If you're a (Sam Elliott) Gar or (Cher) Rusty Dennis fan you'll really like this Director's Cut. Rusty and Rocky Dennis (Eric Stoltz) also sing the song &#34;Little Egypt&#34; around a campfire at a biker field party. That was a funny scene. Red dies in this movie and another extra scene is at his funeral. If you're a Bob Seger fan, as I am, all his songs were replaced with Bruce Springsteen songs in this Director's Cut. In real life, Rocky's favorite artist was the Boss but his music wasn't in the original film for some reason. You'll enjoy this video!

0763657875|5.0|VERY pleased with this book.  And it was packaged well and I got it very quickly.<br />that's all I had to say
B000001FDQ|4.0|Yngwie Malmsteen's reputation as an ultrafast heavy metal shredder definitely polarizes rock fans to this day. But this album is definitely worth listening to because it contains three exceptionally strong and daring instrumentals, none of which rely on the cliches of speed metal. They don't have galloping rhythms, Power Rangers-style twiddling, and overly compressed, distorted guitars. Instead, they have varied tempos, some exceptionally clean playing, memorable melodies, and some very emotional phrasing. The lack of over-the-top distortion and Yngwie's varied bag of tricks makes me wonder why an extended track like \\"Icarus\\" wasn't embraced by the prog rock community. The occassional acoustic work is fantastic, particularly on \\"Black Star,\\" which also features some of Yngwie's most melodic and softest playing. I think that fans of melodic, prog-flavored hard rock such as Muse and Queen would really enjoy this track. In fact, given the often understated production textures this just might be the mellowest heavy metal album ever (if that makes any sense!)<br /><br />The vocal tracks, on the other hand, don't have anything you haven't heard done better elsewhere and are definitely dated.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I will start with this statement.<br /><br />If you have not read this book, then you &#34;should&#34; enjoy this movie. Very entertaining and good to watch. Good acting, but simple. Movie goes along at a good pace and the end of the movie is good.<br /><br />now that being said. IF you have read the book, this movie is VERY average. This normally would not be an issue except for the fact that the screenplay writer is the author. I have seen some adaptations in the past, but the movie about 10% of the book. I hope if you haven't read the book that you can enjoy it after watching the movie.<br /><br />Final verdict. Watch it. But for what it is, not what it isn't.
B0076DELIG|4.0|While I liked this book, it is not as compelling as The Drop.  Bosch, however, is his usual interesting character.  I was curious to see how the relationship with his partner would change after their last big case but that didn't appear to be an issue.  Initially, the prospect of reading about a twenty year old case with no seeming connection to the present gave me pause.  But as the story developed, it lured me in and held me to the end. It would be interesting to see if injecting a deeper relationship with his daughter might soften his rough edges.  You will enjoy this book.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I really did not like this movie at all. It is highly vulgar but not really funny. It has it's moments, but it is like watching classic Eddie Murphy, Andrew Dice Clay, Martin, and Richard Pryor stand up, all rolled up into one, without a punchline. DEFINITELY do not watch with kids, even more mature ones. You will be embarrassed in 2 minutes.
B004R2DS9C|4.0|The original package was really small, so I though this toy box will be petit, but When my daughter assembled it, was great.<br />Nice colors, so vivid, has zips each corner so you could assemble it easily.Has 2 handles each side. I rate this toy box with 4 stars because somebody told me the the material of this toy box is not long-lived.
B00A3OTNTC|4.0|It's Pitbull, what more can you say. Good tracks with Usher, Chris Brown, Akon, Afrojack and more. Album is great to work out to. Bought through Amazon MP3.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This was a gift to my granddaughter.  She loves it.  Thanks for making it available at such a good price and customer service was great.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I loved the novel and was up all night finishing it, but then it had this strange end that I didn't think went along  with the rest of the novel. It frustrated me. I loved the rest, but the ending killed if for me. It made Katie seem crazy, and I understand why Alex thought so much an out his late wife but I felt she was too present. At times it seemed uncomfortable. I won't be reading this again.
0061997811|5.0|This book is for my granddaughter.  Her best friend had this book and she wanted one of her very own.  She loves it.  It ois very special to her and me.  Thanks...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I tried Temple Run, which is similar, and didn't really care for it but I love this game!! Its a lot of fun and very challenging!!
0765325950|5.0|Too many lose ends it can't be the end of the series! come on Brandon you got to follow up.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|If you like history in simple form this book is for you.<br />The thing I personally found fascinating is the view of ordinary families from various countries (Britain, USA, Germany and Russia) involved in the important and controversial events in 20th century.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Saw this after someone gave me the book because they said it reminded her of me.  I was intrigued so I watched it.<br /><br />I could relate.  I think the movie does a good job of showing common high school experiences, particularly from an introvert's perspective (if that can be generalized).
0385732554|5.0|she is 11 years old and she loved it so I bought the other three in the series at a local book store
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|A believable geopolitical crisis, more detail then you would ever want to know about weapon systems and an unbelievable story line centered on the main characters.....in this case the president’s son and his cohorts.  It is advertized as fiction and it is entertaining.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|it's sweet and really good. I like it it's sweet and really good. I like it it's sweet and really good. I like it
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you complain about the price, then just wow. It should be 100.00 because of its awesomeness. Its alomost as awesome as budder. (SkyDoesMinecraft Refrence) And budder rocks.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|A good start to the series, must read. But first read the prequel, helps to understand the plot and story.
B00000F169|4.0|An interesting movie that I don't remember ever seeing. Action was good Would recommend to all Sci Fi buffs to buy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you enjoyed the first two seasons of Downton Abbey, you won't be disappointed with the third.  This continues to be the superior series on TV.  The characters are immensely interesting and the visual aspects are overwhelming.  Can't wait to see Season 4!
B00005JK8K|5.0|This was a replacement for a bad DVD. An excellent movie for War Movies Buffs. Action is realistic in a World War 11 setting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent quality via streaming video. Series extremely well done. Was,able to view a whole season in one day. No complaints.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game  so addictive . If I could give it ten stars I would . You should totally get it
0307970299|5.0|Certainly enjoyed every chapter of this book.  Matter of fact, it was hard to find a place to stop reading for the night.  To make it even better, it's a true story.
B000P1KTW8|5.0|I was introduced to the dvd by a friend and love it so much that I immediately ordered from amazon.com. The order as well as the delivery went well and the dvd arrived in cape town without damage. Thank you and I will definitely order through them again.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Wonderful film. Great characters, storyline, actors, settings... All around awesome movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's nice watching a movie that's about characters and a story rather than violence and murder.
B001F290E4|5.0|EXCELLENT REMAKE OF SONGS. SEAL PUT HIS MARK ON ALL THE SONGS. THIS IS REALLY A SOUFUL CD. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LIKES SOUL MUSIC.
0064431622|4.0|The moral of this one is straightforward and found in other books, but the clever illustrations made my almost 4yr old laugh out loud at just how absurd this chameleon started to look! I only gave 4 Stars because the text lacks flow/ease; it just doesn't read well. Oh, and the description says 4yr+ but I'd say 3-6yr olds.
B001HBYHFA|3.0|Acting and direction are thin but special effects and continuity are good enough to keep the story moving along.  Falls between awful Starship Gallactica and juvenile early Star Wars movies.  Lead character is not much of an actor - have to be dozens who  would have brought much more to the screen.  Poor development of character for &#34;the ultimate weapon&#34;.  A waif Matrix type.  More i think about it the more problems i find with the movie.  Still, digestable if there is nothing else you can find.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson does an amazing job in this book. I read it in 3 days, it isn't too long but it is addicting and I will certainly being rereading it shortly.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Highly enjoyable action/love story flick about &#34;what if's&#34; involving religion, fate and freedom of choice - by ALL the characters - which adds to the cerebral enjoyment.  Creative ideas incorporated in the writing that make the movie fresh and interesting.  Don't miss it!
B004J4XGN6|3.0|Made it about halfway and felt like it was repetitive and didn't bring anything new to my view on entrepreneurship and innovation so I put it down and haven't picked it back up..
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|The writing, direction and acting enable us to overcome our disbelief of the suggested society of folks living in equilibrium.  The evolution of the story supports our disbelief and as we near the movie's climax we are RE-lieved to see where we are heading.  Then the stunts and graphics folks re-visit Matrix to get us to the final scene.  That the bad guy turns out to be a super fighter like our hero is a stretch but the scenes and action leading to the conclusion are fun. Once again love conquers all - especially when it is supported by superior weapons!!!.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series hooks you from the first episode-you just have to tune in to the next show to see what happens!
B0030B621W|5.0|Well-written, well-acted, well done!  Character is totally believable and you sympathize with him completely.  As the story progresses u r drawn closer to him.  When the surprise hits, you r fascinated w how they will resolve the situation.  Only MINOR flaw was the last scene - i wish they could have spent a minute more on our hero's fate.  It is a GOOD flaw that we are so interested!  Don't miss this very enjoyable, different and interesting movie!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Fun book to read.  It was easy and didn't take long to finish.  Story was somewhat predictable but still a nice book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am loving this book, but then I love anything that Ken Follett writes. My like in books tends to be historical fiction, so here we go.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Not realizing this was somewhat a series about Mitch Rapp, I read this book first.  Loved it but was somewhat disappointed to learn later that there were other books leading to this one.  Enjoyed the book immensely and cannot wait to start the series from the beginning.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Everyone who has read this either loves it or hates it. I did not care for it. She is a great author, but her ideas are rather weird.<br />However, if she writes a sequel I will have to read it to fine out how they survive.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Good browser, not as fully featured as TotalCommander but it does what it says it does. 4 c h a r.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Is a lot of fun and the sound effects are awesome! My daughter likes it too! Cannot wait to see the next levels!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, would recommend to anyone . Competitions are very fun and always keep me on my toes. Download it now.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a highly addictive game. I love finding items and completing quests. The only thing I don't like about the game is the fact that it is hard to get friends.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|hello,<br />  back in the day when it was running on tv, we did not watch this show.  there were too many great new shows on the local channels.  but, after watching the actors/actresses in other shows recently, we decided to give it a chance.  this show has excellent ideas and plots that do not seem out of place.  it is dark and the ships mechanics are &#34;clanky&#34; like a klingon warship door opening and closing.  it stands out as a great series and has some unusual ideas with lots of surprises.  this series &#34;starbuck&#34; is so much more memorable than the other &#34;starbuck.&#34;  a great show, series and cast...
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book made you wonder how often a person is put into a beyond difficult place by not fault of their own

B0015DROBO|5.0|Good story .  I just wish I had better first hand knowledge of the area the story was written in.
0316069434|5.0|I love Michael Connelly s writing<br />He once again takes us on a ride in Los Angeles<br />I hope he continues to set his stories in LA<br />Maybe he will move back there
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read this one first and then went back to read the other two.  I enjoyed the book.  I am not familiar with the areas the author described in detail
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, I couldn't put it down.<br />I read it in two days and can not wait to read the next book in the series.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Stellar conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy.  Will keep your attention right to the end and beyond. You will have to watch it  again  and again.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I bought this album after hearing the song- If I die young. I had heard it previously but it didnt really strike me. My twin sister died of cancer in May at the age of 51, and even though she wasnt a young woman in many eyes, she was too young to die so soon. She also had a life of not being able to achieve the things so many people take for granted and was dismissed in life by so many. This was played at her funeral and I had to buy it for myself. It is a great cd and the one song is guaranteed to make me cry. I recomend it highly.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Great game. It worked the first time I used it but now it crashes every time I try to open it.
0375507256|1.0|Wow, where to begin...rather than rehash the 1 star comments, I will concisely say that this book is not worth the read.  I kept waiting for some type of meaningful connection between the short stories, but the only connection is that each story references a previous story.  The difficult diction from the first story and sixth story was frustrating, and the pointless nature of most of the stories made me wish I could have my life back that I wasted reading this book.  Other than the Somni story, this book was terrible.  If you want to read a great book, try Cutting For Stone, Life of Pi, Dragon Girl series, or Game of Thrones (except for book 5, which is pointless and does almost nothing to advance the plot - much like Cloud Atlas).
B00300EI3W|5.0|an a plus rating for sicko , an expose of the highest order because this issue affects all Americans whether you have health insurance or not just to know that the American health system was set up as a criminal enterprise by the Nixon administration should be enough to make the the people of the U.S. rise up in revolt.I'm old enough to have seen the contrast between the old system we had and this new oppressive one and all i can say is shame on our government for for protecting it and keeping it in place.
B008B68IEA|5.0|my doughter love this bed, she is an absolutely monster high fan and is verry happy with this bed. PERFECT!
0307450570|5.0|I had checked this out from our local library. kept renewing it and decided to just purchase it. lots of great ideas.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so much fun and addictive. It is the same idea as Super Mario Brothers- and awesome for a free game!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I might be too old for this game, but who doesn't like to be a kid every now and then? I love the animation and how you can redesign ponyville. I like how you can collect the ponies they provide. I recommend this to anyone who likes the tv show of my little pony: friendship is magic. :D
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book held my interest from page one.  Written in such a way that we can almost feel what the alzheimer patient is feeling.  Excellent.  I have already suggested this book to many of my friends.<br />Thank you Lisa Genova

0316228532|3.0|I WAS NOT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT BUT I DID NOT EXPECT SUCH GORE AND GUTS. I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY THE STORYLINE; BUT IMPRESSED AT HOW WELL JK ROLLING JUMPED INTO A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORYLINE.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This version is way better than the last version. Better graphics, more fun, and a really cool tunnel with a mine cart in it.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|First book on Kindle, good interesting read, recommend to anyone who has an interest in running and or sport in general.
B007P9ELWC|5.0|This band has been through a lot since their first album. I am very impressed and think this album is a very solid addition to their already impressive discography.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I really liked the Thrift Shop song and decided to download this when it was on sale.  I have been very impressed!  I like how a lot of the songs have a story or a point.  The lyrics are almost poetic on a few of the track.  The production is nice too.
0345529057|4.0|These books have a lot a characters with a complex story line.  Sometimes I have had trouble remembering how they all fit together.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good game for kids. just downloaded it for the kids to play on and they love it. must say I enjoy it myself also.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw this on a PBS special.  It is the 25th year anniversary performance, Andrew Lloyd Weber is honored, and several of the original make appearances.
B005IZLPME|5.0|This was a gift for my Grandaughter.  No complaints so I'm assuming it was OK..She had asked for this for her Birthday
1449410243|5.0|I have seen daylight.  I thought at first the cat had replaced a lightbulb in the anteroom to my dungeon, but it was from my narrow tunnel to freedom from whence shone the solitary ray of hope.  It was only a day after I ordered this book that the cat saw my browser history and took action.  He set into motion the plans that had been made months in advance.  The plans that now move with the unstoppable momentum of a freight train barreling towards the sole goal of my destruction.  I had forgotten daylight until today.  It beckons me to continue tunneling with all my energy, but I must be careful lest the cat take notice.  For now, I will sit by the light and remember a happier time.  A time before I knew my cat was plotting to kill me.
B0001XALTG|5.0|This is one of the best films ever made.  I saw this movie when it first came out and it remains one of my most favorite movies.  Ewan McGregor is just fantastic as bad-boy, drug infused Renton.  If you are a fan of British films this needs to be in your collection.
0756655307|5.0|Bought this as a christmas gift for my nephew.  It was nicely packaged.  Soon as he opened it, he went crazy!  enough said.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game better than first one although there are some issues of lag this is a good fun game to download
B006R6ZP6U|1.0|We were VERY disappointed with the quality of the streaming video!!! We have used other services without problems so I know my TV is capable of good quality.  I contacted Amazon about it through email twice and never got a response, very disappointing. We will never use streaming video service from here again!
B00004CYS9|1.0|It was not clear that this movie does not work in the US.  They said that I could send it back, but the time and money it would take to send it back, wouldn't be worth it.  I would have appreciated it if they could have sent me a copy that works in our country. My daughter was very disappointed that she can't watch it.
B00A4OALL0|4.0|Wayne Shorter has lived through many of jazz's finest moments. The art form is etched into his bones.<br /><br />He was a protege during the bebop era, learning the craft under titans like Miles Davis and Art Blakey, making contributions here and there. In 1971, he founded jazz fusion mainstays Weather Report with Joe Zawinul, and took the first steps toward crafting his own indelible imprint upon the annals of jazz.<br /><br />Shorter's latest effort, Without a Net, is very eclectic. There are moments of wondrous melody, but there are also many experimental and atonal moments. If you're looking for relaxing background jazz or a soundtrack for an elegant dinner party, this is not your album. If, however, you want to listen to a visionary capable of challenging most listeners' understanding of the art form, Shorter will provide riches in spades.<br /><br />His quartet engages in a somewhat unusual style. Shorter is the bandleader -- on paper. In reality, it's more like a party of equals, so many times they'll go off in their own direction without losing their theme or sense of cohesion. This is truly a staggering feat; it literally opens up a hundred million directions they could go within a single piece. There are moments of pure cacophony, then there are little subdued moments that ease you into a lull, and sometimes there are moments of pure, lovely melody. But it usually isn't long before Shorter's sharp saxophone stabs penetrate into the foreground like an unexpected guest.<br /><br />The songs on this album can be broken down into three separate categories. Let's start with Shorter's reinventions of previously recorded songs. He picked out three songs from different eras, rewrote them, and produced a work that fits cleverly fits under the umbrella of what he's trying to do on the album.<br /><br />Album opener \\"Orbits\\" was a standard bebop piece he wrote for Davis's 1967 album Miles Smiles, but the version presented here sounds like a quartet directed by a madscientist. It opens with some menacing piano chords from Danilo Perez and demented sax, setting the tone for the rest of the album. The main refrain from the original song is retained, but the rest is unrecognizable. Shorter employs shrill sax, and the piano work sounds like a five alarm fire is going off. But even as the band members drift apart from one another, they always manage to find their way back.<br /><br />\\"Plaza Real\\" was a song Shorter originally wrote for The Weather Report. The original had more of a warm, eclectic flavor to it, with more whistling, flutes and electronic effects. The Without a Net version doesn't bear a great resemblance to its predecessor, but it does bring the same startling level of musicianship. This is one of the band's more passionate pieces. There are plenty of wild solos from Shorter as drummer Brian Blade goes wild. You can even hear whooping and hollering from the crowd around the 3:08 mark.<br /><br />His last reinvention is the title song from \\"Flying Down to Rio.\\" This one sounds virtually nothing like the original,  but appropriately is more subdued than his other two reinventions  It serves as a great showoff piece for Blade and Perez.<br /><br />The second category consists of several original compositions preformed with Shorter's quartet only. \\"S.S. Golden Mean\\" is one of Shorter's greatest showoff pieces, which he coats in wild frilly saxophone solos that go all over the place. The song's underbelly is crisp and melodious, at least until the drums start to make their presence known about halfway through.<br /><br />\\"Starry Night\\" is a more calm and subdued, allowing the talents of Perez and bassist John Patitucci to take center stage. Shorter picks up the pace later on and the whole band goes nuts at the end. \\"Myrrh\\" is one of the briefer but more enjoyable pieces, being predicated upon a sense of unease and tension established by Shorter's piercing sax shrieks and the clattering of cymbals and drum pads. It ends ina roar, finalized by the clanging crescendo of the piano.<br /><br />\\"Zero Gravity to the 10th Power,\\" meanwhile, provides Patitucci with his moment in the sun. The entire rhythm section is insane here. Shorter takes a backseat on this track until near the end, at which point he frenetically alternates solos between himself and Perez.<br /><br />Finally, there is the 23 minute \\"Pegasus\\" which the Wayne Shorter Quartet recorded alongside the Imani Winds quintet. This gives the piece a strong orchestral feel; think Fantasia mixed along with free flowing jazz. The Imani Winds take the lead for the first third of the song, then they begin to lay a backdrop for Shorter to solo off of. He takes the lead in the song's second half, before tapering off and allowing the two outfits to masterfully complement one another for the last few minutes of the song.<br /><br />Without a Net, like many of Shorter's recent releases, is a demanding piece of jazz. You have to be in the mood for it, and it certainly isn't for everyone. Given its length and density, there may be times this album  makes your head hurt.<br /><br />Shorter has long had an affinity for experimentation and there's no chance he's shying away from that. Yet it perfectly captures what jazz is about -- the interplay, the improvisation, the way each bandmember can feel each other like putting on an old glove -- these have always been the core elements of the art form, experimental or not. The opportunity that Without a Net presents is a chance to hear some of the world's best doing it better than almost anyone else.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My daughter was so happy to receive this in the mail.  She loved watching it and I'm sure we will enjoy it for many years.  Thank you!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I only purchased one episode (which I had missed watching on PBS) via instant streaming. The video quality / streaming worked very well- no problem.<br />As far as season 3 goes- be prepared to be disappointed!<br />Of course we all knew the spoiler about Lady Sybil dying even before season 3 aired in the U.S. And I actually thought that the growth of the Thomas Branson character made up for the loss of her character, (if you are willing to let go the whole \\"he left his pregnant wife behind in Ireland while he ran away\\" thing). But this business with Thomas Barrow- he must be let go without even a reference- no, he can have the reference- actually we don't even have to let him go, so...lets just forget the whole thing is RIDICULOUS! and Spoiler alert- I assume everyone knows about \\"offing\\" Matthew Crawley ( same character- missing presumed dead during the war- he's not dead he's just paralyzed, he's not paralyzed- he's fine- nope he's dead again). Is this considered character development?<br />I think Tom said it best:<br />Tom: \\"Are you sure you wouldn't rather just cut and run like me\\"?
B001NLKT60|5.0|An excellent read<br />Not for under17<br />I didn't want to put it down<br />At first it was hard to keep names straight as to who was who
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Good spy thriller, but tough to believe that the POTUS s son would be allowed to participate in espionage activity.
140053271X|1.0|I have gone thru a lot of reviews of this eBook before ordering it, mainly due to its long battery life.<br />Within a week, it got shipped home (excellent seller).<br />However, the product itself is far from being a good eBook Reader.<br />I have had two: one Kindle eBook reader (with keyboard) and one 10.2\\" Android tablet that I used as a reader mainly.<br />The Nook is cumbersome:<br /><br />THE BADS:<br />1) the first thing it ask for is to read some kind of agreement, then click ACCEPT !!! (like I am installing a new software !!!)<br />2) the second thing is to setup for a WIFI access, I have troubled to enter the password for my home wireless so it sits there for one day. Can't do anything until WIFI access is established.<br /><br />THE GOODS<br />3) I went to a local B&N store to get instant WIFI access which I did,<br /><br />THE BAD<br />4) then create an account, enter my credit card number (why do I need to do this at this time). Should only ask when I first order something from B&N.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />5) now I can copy my eBook in PDF formats to it, this part is straightforward.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />6) I opened one of my PDF doc and it came up with a huge font size<br />7) try to touch the screen to get to a menu allowing me to change font size, the menu appears, then quickly disappears. I was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there<br />8) it took me a few mins before I can get the menu to be stable, then change to a smaller size. The text now reads fine. But the \\"next page\\" , \\"previous page\\" buttons are too hard to push, it takes a hard push to get it to work.<br /><br />9) I close the document and try to open another one, it won't open<br />10) try to re-open the first one, not open either<br />From this point on, it simply refused to open any document I have on it.<br /><br />11) I even convert one PDF to epub format (specifically target the Nook)  and load on it, does not open either. And the epub size is much largerthan PDF size (i.e. I will have a lot less books on it).<br /><br />To me, this eBook is useless, so I am going to return it back today.<br />And this is not due to (or lack of) my high tech proficiency (I develop firmware for \\"firwmare operated\\" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these \\"Software/firmware\\" operated gadgets quite well, have at least 5 GADGETS with very complicated functionalities at home, all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking, no problem at all).<br /><br />I have written quite a lot of product reviews on Amazon, most of the gave good rating because these products are good.<br />I feel really frustrated with this one, the first bad review I wrote.<br /><br />My older two eBook readers work right of the box. Just copy the documents to it and open to read them.<br />I will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!! I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.<br /><br />I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing). Rather spend a few hundreds bugs to get a good product than a cheap one that does not work.<br />Many users were lucky to get the ones that work (touch scree sensitivity seems to be the key here), I was not and don't want to try my luck with it again.
B00005J8J5|4.0|Didn't hook me upon first hearing. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. If you bought the LP when it was first released you had to buy with brown bag over it. Didn't know which cover you were getting out of 4 possible choices. Genesis with abacab also had same idea, but at least you knew what cover you were getting. Has excellent underrated cuts: carouselambra, hot dog, south bound suarez and pre honey drippers like I'm gonna crawl, plus the usual suspects you'll hear on classic rock stations(if your CD player doesn't work in your vehicle which unfortunately is my case. I happened to purchase the Mlps, which sounds excellent. Can't wait for the new remastered version here in the near future.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Story told in sections from his point of view and then hers. Enjoyed they way you were led along, never quite believing each version, and slowly learning the truth. Interesting, flawed characters. I was hesitant to read since the jacket read as if a crime type novel, but it was murder mystery &#34;light&#34;, characters were quirky, descriptions of any scenes not graphic. Loved Nick 's dark thoughts about his wife at times....you were never quite sure if true things or dark musings......until the last chapters...
030758836X|4.0|fabulous book.  You would never be able to guess what is going to happen right down to the last page.  Read it.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed listening to this album. Phillip Phillips is a very talented young man. I hope to hear more of his music in the future.

B00B19DMUE|4.0|This is an entertaining Movie. More real than other movies that has a subject of demon possession. It was acceptable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|this book was a fantastic read (although there was too much foul language) but the author has got to be nuts herself to think of all this. makes me wonder....
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The game is certainly better than a lot of similar ones on the Android market. I do think the map may give a way a little too much though.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|driving and driving got monotonous but overall I liked it -- liked other reacher books more.  Having Tom Cruise playReacher has tainted by liking for Reacher books.

B005LAIISA|5.0|Saw the movie with my grandchildren when it first came out in the theaters and just had to have it to go along with the others.<br />Really funny.
B005IQZB14|1.0|This was one of those books that I got based on reviews and recommendations and it turned out being one of those books you read a couple pages and put it down, try starting again a few times but nothing holds you there to read on. Didn't get passed the first chapter.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Bought this for me more than for my grandchildren.  Everyone loved it at Christmas time. Wonderful movie, great message, great soundtrack.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Started of a bit slow but ended up loving it. great read and I would recommend it. Think young adults would enjoy

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is better then temple run and it got a competition with temple run two but if they make a subway surfer 2 ohhhh my God it will be the greatest of all the running games I mean subway suffers 1 is good but if they make a two we all going to die of happiness<br />  I give this five stars out there were more I will fill the whole thing up download subway surfers!!!!!!
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved this book because it is a true story, took place in two areas that are familiar to me.  The physicial place<br />Baltimore, MD, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and is the beginning of a new era in research.  Research is my passion.
B000SEI230|4.0|This was a great book I gave it five stars because it deserved five stars. It not only showed a no e story it showed a young man growing in God and when he grew I grew with him.she. he echoed I cried with him. I enjoyed the book.
B00B3MN65K|3.0|After listening to this CD the 2nd time, I've decided what is lacking in Grobans' singing.<br />when he hits the high notes of a song it's as if he straining, the sound of the voice is strained.  It doesnt flow it's almost strained.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|That is the only word I can think of elite because it makes other books look like... their trying to be that good but they just come too short of the line between good and great. Like I say to most people good is not good enough. Now this book is great! Yeah I have to say it, it wasn't perfect but the action and the suspense completely covered for all of that. Personally I think I couldn't top that. I mean seriously Mr. Riordan how do you come up with these... these work of arts and beauty. It  simply leaves me with my jaw all  the way to the ground with that amazing cliff hanger. I mean it was a nail biter. It just couldn't be better!
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call is one of the best stories I have ever read about the air war in WWII. Compelling, accurate, mind-boggling in its intensity, I couldn't put it down! It was an eye-opener to read the story of a German aviator who was an ace for all the right reasons. Please read this book if you want to be uplifted and have your faith in mankind renewed!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|At first it wouldn't show up with my games or apps so I reset my kindle and it all of a sudden show up first in my carousel.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|This was mostly just a really boring movie. It looked very funny in the trailer, but it just wound up being uncomfortably boring.
B007FC3AAI|4.0|Well made series, having not read the books first.  All of the actors are great.  The dvd was in excellent condition.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Need more information on how to play the game. How do you get the pieces in the column by itself.
0988262592|4.0|As others have mentioned before, the Phoenix Project is an easily digestible book about IT Operations.  In it, IT efficiency is gained through application of manufacturing principles to IT processing of work.  In dealing with IT inefficiencies from a strictly process point of view, this book does a great job of delivering ideas that can improve how work flows through IT.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind if you are considering applying these principles to your workplace is the change management aspects given \\"product\\" in IT is created by people -- knowledge workers.  I would recommend that this book be applied in conjunction with the ideas presented by Chip and Dan Heath in Switch ([[ASIN:0385528752 Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard]]).  Successful implementation of changes like this can only be made when there is a corresponding change in culture to accept and foster that change.  And lasting culture changes require buy-in from both hearts and minds.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Came in perfect condition! No scratches, case was in perfect condition! AMAZING CD, thank you! Came just as described! I love Eminem, and I thank you very much for prompt delivery.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. Story lines are fun to watch. There are enought unique characters to not get bored by repeat story lines. Unfortunately it comes off as a tragedy but still a lot of fun to watch.
B000062YAZ|3.0|The CD itself is amazing! Plays great, no problems, but the case came broken, which I'm a bit disappointed in... Be a bit more careful next time.
B009POCFTG|2.0|William Friedken continues the phase of his career he started in [[ASIN:B000XRI8FO Bug]] of nasty little film adaptations of stage plays by Tracy Letts. Killer Joe is a sleazy thriller nominally set in Dallas but actually unfolding in a backlot trailer park of the collective crime movie unconscious. The plot is strictly by-the-book noir (a murder for insurance money), and though the characters all have names it's easier to keep track of them by their film archetypes: there is the Implacable Cold-blooded Villain, the Kid in Over His Head, the Dumb Guy, and the Femme Fatale. Killer Joe tries to mix it up by throwing a wild card into the mix, Dottie, the virginal teenaged sister of the KiOhH who is offered as collateral to hitman Joe (Matthew McConaughey, cast effectively against type). Joe moves in with her and her family until the money comes through (a conceit that probably isn't such a distracting implausibility on stage) and the two start a kinky relationship that consists of creepy jailbait lust on his part and Stockholm Syndrome on hers. Even though he keeps them offscreen for much of the running time, Friedken's willingness to jump into the muck of their ugly power game is the heart of the film. Early on he inserts a few strategically gratuitous nude shots of actress Juno Temple as a way of saying to the audience \\"leer away, guys\\", and midway through is a seduction/domination scene that recalls the business in [[ASIN:B003U74NQW Blue Velvet]] involving Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rossellini, and a tank of nitrous. We don't know what to make of Dottie. One minute she's guileless to the point of seeming mildly retarded, and the next she's chirpily approving a plan to kill her mother. The idea appears to be to have her character act as a discordant piece that throws the rest of the stock noir elements into jarring relief. This almost works, but Dottie is too weird, too much of a writerly conceit even within the stylized world of the movie, and the third act confrontation in which things go inevitably south plays out like an exercise, without real tension. If you get more than halfway through the movie you should stick around for the last shot, in which the familiar lovable goofball Matthew McConaughey creepily emerges from beneath the shell of sociopath he has played up to that point, but don't feel compelled to make it that far. Watch Bug instead.
1616550414|5.0|I bought one, and was so impressed with just the binding that I instantly decided to order another book; without even taking the shrink wrap off the original. There are plenty of well written reviews here explaining all the details of the contents so I won't get into all of that, but all Zelda fans should own at least one copy of this book.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|had to miss a few episodes and this allowed me to go back and enjoy.  love em.  hope they have a season four
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The movies speak for themselves. As far as packaging, this ranks right up there among my favorite box sets, right next to Bond 50 in terms of quality.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|got into the abbey late and needed the background.  these are perfect and have watched them over and over.  each time i find something i missed
B002M9WW30|4.0|Complete in the sense that all five movies are here, each on its own disc. Then one disc of bonus features. Only the first title received a complete frame-by-frame restoration, but the others look great also. The first and final title both have special features but 2-5 do not. Still worth the money.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Omg that book was good. Not only did it keep your attention but the ending was unspeakable. A must read. And don't forget the epilogue!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game I have a horse and this is just like taking care of my horse snowflake but this is so much more fun
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Another story that held my attention, with the kindle it appears that I will read s the Harry Bosch books and have nothing left to look forward your

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffer is a good game and its a game to help kids with their learning skills and that you make it fun
B009MCRHH6|5.0|trying to get the goo balls to go where you lead them is fun and challenging. I am enjoying every level. Hope I mak it to the end!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Seldom does a book grab hold of me, manipulate me, and make me feel like I'm trapped on an emotional roller-coaster like DEFENDING JACOB has done.  Masterful is the best word to describe the plot and the sudden twists and turns.  Brilliant is the word that comes to mind in describing the characters as told from the point of view of Andy, Jacob's father.  And the ending...I never saw it coming is enough to say.<br />This is a book that, even after closing it for the day, I could not stop thinking about and wondering what would happen next.  It is haunting in every respect.  I'm a voracious, and rather fussy, reader but this book will stay with me forever as the best suspense novel I've ever read.
B007H02I4W|5.0|Excellent!  I find myself thinking how glad I am that someone else devoted their life to the Piano.  The fact that at least one of us can make music like this gives me hope that we may actually be redeemed as a species.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|My daughter and I love this game, we'd spend every chance we could trying to work through things.  One would make a discovery, the other would know right how to put it to work.
0937381888|5.0|It answers the questions that you didn't know existed...comprehensive from advance to novice brewing and setup. The first book I read
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I'd say this app is just ok...very similar to Mario but lacking any directions or instructions. It would be nice to know if/how to get to some of the areas that can be seen throughout the game play.  Controls are a little hard to use at times as well...I would be touching the right or left arrow to move and lep would not move.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|This was an easy read.  I finished this book in just a couple of hours and was completely in love with all the characters.  I can't wait to read the second book to see what happens.
159420411X|5.0|Nate Silver is good at predicting. I had never heard of him until last year's election, when friends drew my attention to him, and I bought his book to get to know how he thinks. Instead of getting into this field through a PhD in Statistics, he learned by developing a system to predict baseball player performance and by playing poker professionally, before moving on to politics. After all, gambling problems were at the origin of probability theory, so it is not that far fetched, but having started from several different application domains gave him a ruthlessly practical approach to the field.<br /><br />The subtitle of the book, \\"why so many predictions fail - but some don't\\" is as honest an ad as you will ever see.  Silver actually walks you through high finance, the weather, earthquakes, chess playing, Texas Hold-Em poker, terrorism and climate change, for each analyzing what is special about it that makes it more or less predictable, and the kind of tools by which it might be cracked. I don't personally know these domains, except of earthquake prediction, on which I worked for a few years early in my career; I am impressed by his command of it, and by the depth and relevance of his comments. And it gives me confidence in what he says on the other topics.<br /><br />It's not a \\"how-to\\" book, and does not pretend to be. One clear point is that you need to immerse yourself in a topic if you want to make predictions about it. You won't get anywhere by just applying algorithms to data without understanding what it is all about. In saying this, Silver is in sync with other people who have made a living from analyzing data, like Alan Greenspan ([[ASIN:0143114166 The Age of Turbulence: Adventures in a New World]]). This point is obvious to everyone, except most academically trained \\"data scientists.\\"<br /><br />Nate Silver is 35, I don't think we are done hearing from him, and I look forward to the next installment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like it and if you want temple run then definitely get this game too, its really addicting and obviously a lot of other people agree with me!!!! See, look at the rest of the reviews, and if you decide to get this game, I guarantee you'll at least like it, if not, LOVE it!!!!!!!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I am excited about this coming to the big screen! Having said that, I started this book several times, but was finally able to get into it when I got the audio book (from the library). A whole cast of voices, including Alan Alda and Rob Reiner! Definitely the way to \\"read\\" this book!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Due to my dislike of Katniss my expectations for this book were low. However the author created such a plausible world with ideas and concerns I wanted to further explore. Therefore I decided to read book 2. She did not disappoint. Not only did I get a further understanding of Panem, the Capitol and the districts but also Katniss became a more sympathetic character that I could relate to. Lastly, it helped me to fall in love with Peeta. Strong character development made me like this book better, surprisingly.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />The only thing I detested was the return to the games.  I understand why it was necessary to show even further just how horrible the president and ptb of Panem need to be revolted against. However, it felt traumatic and trite to take the readers back down that horrific path again.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|First, let me say that the pair of AKG K-240s that I recently purchased are replacing a pair I'd had for several years that were accidentally broken. I learned the hard way that they are (like many things) not dog proof!!<br /><br />Anyway, when not encouraging canine misbehavior, I've been engineering and producing music for more than 20 years. As someone who has spent countless hours having to wear the 'tools of the trade' I can honestly say that these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned . Virtually no discomfort even after 4 hours of continuous wear with the AKG K-240s. For anyone who has experienced ear fatigue and pain because of long recording or mixing sessions this is a huge plus.<br /><br />In addition the sound quality is terrific. A nicely balanced flat response all along the frequency range. Good transparency. Probably as close to near field monitors as headphones get in this price range. What you hear is what is on the track. Would I feel comfortable mixing an album with these phones? I've done it and loved the results.<br /><br />The only limitation with them is that they are semi-open which allows for some sound bleed. If you are a vocalist or an instrumentalist who will be micing their instrument and adding a track to a mix then you might want to use a pair of 'closed' phones to eliminate monitor feed leaking into your track. Also if you are doing a live recording in a very noisy environment the AKG K-240s might not give you enough sound isolation to be ideal.<br /><br />However, In the engineer's chair in the studio or for serious recreational listening for extended periods of time the AKG K-240 phones are, in my opinion, an unbeatable value.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun! Even funner that you get to challenge your friends and family if you connect to facebook. I recommend it to anyone that l
B00881VLCE|3.0|I am reviewing the free app and it has ads.  I wouldn't mind the ads but the company placed them next to the puzzle pieces &quot;box&quot; and its too easy to hit the ads when you try for a puzzle piece.  perhaps this was intentional but it is very annoying.  The puzzle photos are cheesy and,  if they did not receive Anne Geddes' permission or license then their photos of babies and flowers (&quot;spring&quot;) seems to infringe her artwork of &quot;flower babies.&quot;  App offers easy and harder puzzles simply by increasing the number of puzzle pieces for the same artworks.  I bought this when I was sick but rather bored.  I couldn't sit up for long but this easy puzzle set really helped pass time while medicine kicked in.
0439680093|3.0|Fourteen year old Matt Freeman could use a break.  His parents died in a car wreck when he was eight.  Since then he's lived with his aunt who sees him as a duty and a burden.  His only friend is a hoodlum three years his senior.  He's been arrested for breaking and entering and accessory to attempted murder.  AND NOW his parole is to live with a creepy old lady and do manual labor on a farm outside the village of Lesser Malling in a very eerie corner of Yorkshire.  The people of the village are down right weird and Matt gets the unsettling feeling that they have something very unpleasant in mind for him.<br /><br />Raven's Gate is a supernatural thriller that takes its cues from Poe, Lovecraft, the Twilight Zone, and more contemporary young adult fiction.  There is a sense of creeping dread without much in the way of gore or the downright horrific (except one scene).  Horowitz spins a pretty good yarn and you'll find yourself turning the pages pretty quickly.  There are very few surprises in this quick reading supernatural thriller, but it is a fun read for vacation.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show and I highly recommend it, but check out the episodes in order so you get the full story overlaid on the history of the time.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a well written story. I really enjoyed it!!!<br />Life of Pi is worth the time to read. I never knew<br />what to expect as I realised it is now a movie.

B008J05EL8|1.0|It says it downloaded but where is it? Sucks when you get charged for garbage like this and then have to waste so much time either trying to find it, get it to work,  and don't Even talk about returning a download. Amazon,  I'm beginning to wonder about you.....
B00683JK9K|4.0|I only played one first level puzzle and it worked pretty Good.  So I thought the bad reviews were right when at the end I was missing a piece.  But in the bottom right hand corner there is a puzzle shaped button in between two others.  I pressed this twice and the missing piece appeared.  I think it was because I had the piece on the board and it got covered by other pieces.  I don't know if this will work on all of the puzzles but it worked for me.  Beautiful puzzles :)

B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game keeps me at the edge of my seat. I cant seem to put it down. absolutely fantastic graphics. I recommend to anyone.
6304011431|5.0|This is a movie that you can view over and over and still feel the same rush of emotions as you watch a truly remarkable young man try to fit into a world where he is totally misunderstood.  (Albert Einstein was once quoted as saying:  &#34;It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.&#34; )  After watching this movie, you will be convinced that POWDER is the answer to that problem.  We can all learn to be more like POWDER.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am fortunate to have no need for an alarm clock, but I use this on my Kindle Fire all the time. I set it to remind me of conference calls and appts as I often get caught up in what I am doing and forget to look at the clock. Initially, my biggest disappointment was that I could only set the alarm on the day of the event, but I discovered that if I used the repeat setting I could set alarms up to a week in advance. AWESOME! The only thing that would make it more perfect is if it had a calendar...oops, I keep forgetting it's 'only' an alarm clock.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I really like this movie. It's very interesting and keeps your attention. The story is great and the grapics are wonderful.
B00683JK9K|2.0|The photos are beautiful and at the higher difficulties it seems much like working a real puzzle, without the space requirements. i didn't run into the problem of the puzzle not saving that others mentioned, in fact I've returned to it a couple times in hopes it would work better. I could not get it to rotate the  pieces on my Kindle Fire HD. When another reviewer mentioned a setting for rotate I thought that would solve the problem... but it didn't.  : (

B001PB3RU8|5.0|I love Florence + The Machine, if you're looking for meaningful lyrics full of symbolism and a rich powerful voice to carry them then you're in the right place. I love the music because it's different from what you hear on the radio now but also for the thought put into the songs and her amazing voice. If you like this CD check out Ceremonials, their latest.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|A wonderful showcase for modern film making and special effects. I find it hard to believe, however, that Ridley Scott allowed his  name  to be associated with this poorly written travesty of a story. From a life long reader of Sci-Fi.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game! Love the challenges. Love the graphics! Hoping many more games to come and free! Love love love love
B004CRR9G0|5.0|This was a great film. several big name actors and great story line. this movie reminded me alot of princess mononoke!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was disappointed after all the hype.  I won't read the other two books.  I learned all I ever wanted to know about S & M.  I didn't feel the story line was strong enough to support all the porn.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|The app has a terrible selection of sounds. Most are very irritating and harsh. I've found that most of these sounds hurt my ears when played through any speaker. Additionally, the app forces you to rate it. It asks you to rate it every time you open the app. This is annoying, pushy, and a major hindrance to the app's usability.
B008745B32|4.0|I always love stories about the English and also like Evelyn Waugh's manner  of writing.<br />I did find that I was sometimes lost due to the flashbacks etc.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is an amazing book!  After working with many children going through the foster care system and the lack of relationships built, I could just see this story taking place.  A must read!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I thought this app would be absolutely amazing but aged a week only this app stiled working I'm very disappointed
B0081X8AE6|3.0|Maybe 2...I was really disappointed.  I think he's got a beautiful voice but this CD was all over the place.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got hooked on this game when watching my daughter play on her phone; and her friend on a tablet.  Be careful, this game is highly addictive and will take away any free time you might have. You've  been warned.
B00AE2I4WK|2.0|So boring - just the same old story line and it took way to long to get to the good parts; the dancing - amazing but just not enough of it to keep your attention.
0143038583|5.0|This book is a great introduction to the world of food - what we eat, why and how it is produced. Mealtime will never be the same after you read this thoughtful, insightful treatise.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|It has helped me sleep many nights. Blocks out noises wonderfully. The alarm also works quite well with several choices of sounds to awaken.
B001FOPODS|4.0|The music and animation are wonderful. The story holds a young viewer's interest.  the music adds enjoyment to the story.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very well done and entertaining. Very talented and believable actors. Scenery, settings and clothing are lovely. I am so  hooked!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A very enjoyable movie. Good for anyone who loves animal movies. I would recommend it for anyone. Loved it so much.
B00005JNS0|5.0|What more do I have to say. It's Disney Cars. My son looooooves this movie and he will watch it all day if I'll let him. Can't get enough of this hit!
B00AQCMK32|5.0|Easy to pick up, enough in game choices to increase the replay value, very addictive. Well worth the money paid and refreshingly not a social game that requires you to continue paying to play or invite friends to participate.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 7 year old girl really loves this app. Great for spending long car rides with.<br />Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!

B008PZ69T8|4.0|After reading Shades of Grey, which was recommended to me by a friend, I wanted to purchase the CD.  I love classical music and the music referred to in Shades of Grey book were selections I already was familiar with.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|We rented this for the weekend for my 2 1/2 year old who had never seen it before.  Good price for a rental and now he is really into Lightening McQueen and the other characters.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Love this album, Love the younger pop sound they bring with the straight harmonies.  C'mon C'mon is my favorite song on this album.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very enjoyable script and subtle interplay.  A country flavor with hints of urban seasons along with a few flakes and poofs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game, really like the way the horse reacts to attention!  Great way to spend some time!  Enjoy!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A very good read.  I couldn't put it down, but was sorry to see it end. One of Grisham's best. John, keep them coming.
B007UXTG8M|3.0|This was nothing more than soft porn. Just a story about a man who was a sexual addict? Two very dysfunctional family members with no real storyline.  I was a weird story, weird.
1594487154|5.0|Census data shows that 11% of the population has a title that includes sales. Daniel Pink in his new book \\"To Sell Is Human\\": The Surprising Truth About Moving Others states that we are all involved in sales. Because one way or the other we're persuading, convincing and influencing others to give up something they've got in exchange for what we've got. This is an excellent follow up to his book \\"Drive\\" which was an in depth study about what motivates people.<br /><br />In \\"To Sell is Human, Pink talks about the changing role and world of sales. In most industries, due to the information at our fingertips, the balance of power has shifted from buyer beware to seller beware and that the only viable sales approach is honesty, fairness and transparency. Daniel Pink also states that the A,B,C's of selling have shifted from \\"Always Be Closing\\" to \\"Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity\\".<br /><br />  * Attunement is the skill of putting yourself in someone else's shoes and learning how to see their perspective.<br />  * Bouyancy is learning how to deal with what what he calls an \\"Ocean of Rejection\\" and how to maintain a positive perspective.<br />  * Clarity is about making the best of a murky situation and shifting our focus from problem solving to problem finding. Pink states that one of the most effective ways of selling and moving others is to find problems or challenges that buyers did not know they had.<br /><br />He makes the case that extroverts are not the most successful sales people. He cites studies that show that the best sales people are ambiverts a combination of introversion and extroversion.<br /><br />Like \\"Drive\\", I found \\"To Sell Is Human\\" to be an excellent book. I am involved in a job search and the ability to move others is a major challenge. I can relate to keeping a positive attitude despite the \\"Ocean of Rejection\\" that I experience daily. I have a new found appreciation for true sales professionals. I recommend \\"To Sell is Human\\" to anyone in sales or the business of moving people.
B006UAWH2S|3.0|I liked the movie. It  made me think of movie Contagion. I was just okay...Nothing really special about this movie.
B003VXOFEU|4.0|If you're an adult, don't be put off by the classification of this book as a teen novel.<br />Jonas lives in a controlled drab community without realizing it. Much of that which makes us human - choice, wonder, beauty, the appreciation of nature, community, family, pain, love, conflict, memory - has been stripped by choice from the members of the community to ensure peace, comfort, and sameness.<br />At twelve, Jonas is chosen to receive the community's memory, and with it he experiences pain, pleasure, and love. His eyes are opened to the wonder of creation and life, which of course are denied the others. He gains wisdom, including horror at the dehumanized state of the community.<br />The conclusion of the book is sometimes said to be ambiguous. For the unreflective or ununderstanding, their reactions to the conclusion probably will reflect their own lack of vision. For those who, like Jonas, have eyes to see (or \\"see beyond\\"), the conclusion fits perfectly.<br />I'm told by an ex-teacher that The Giver is taught in the eighth grade. The edition I read (Dell Laurel-Leaf, 1992) includes a discussion guide. Some of the questions would help understanding, but they won't take the reader to the deepest level.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|I really liked this movie. With so much going in our world. It brought some things home. After seeing this movie, for all that see it should start a dialogue. This real and its scary. Good Movie.
B001IYVUEW|5.0|This movie is everything that all Batman fans would want and has more to grab new viewers (kind of like Casino Royale and JJ Abrams' Start Trek)<br />The only part I don't like is when Gordon waves to Batman at the end ;)
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love this movie!  I bought it for my niece for Christmas.  We have watched it several times.  It ranks up there with the other famous Disney movies.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|I watch this movie many times a year, was about time I owned it outright. &#34;Well, it's Groundhog Day...again...&#34;<br />Love it!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I came across the Alchemist coincidentally, when I was in college and it did change my view of life, years passed by and I started to lose faith in my fate and even ceased to accept it existed! Through a strange pass I came across it again, when I absolutely needed it. Now I feel that I spent many years in the glass shop, ready to achieve MY personal legend.<br />Hats off to you Paulo!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well written, clever chain of events.  It is a little more disturbing than your typical romance, but such a wonderful story.  You will fall in love with the characters.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|LOVE this album!<br />My favorites are gorilla and treasure! But all the songs are great, he has such a classic unique voice and all the songs just make you feel good!
B005FHXB0O|4.0|I like Quentin Tarantino movies, this was is great for the amount of unknown actors that were later starts in Hollywood. Great characters great story and great director! This movies is great
B002VWNID6|1.0|This movie ordered on line - but does not play in this region.  Replace it please with a copy that will replay in Australia
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is good but I just don't really like it as much as the original temple run. It's just that it is just kind of weird to me and how there are also few characters there and also you can't jump over the other stuff it had in the first temple run.
B004JLDSIC|5.0|This  is my third CD that features Stacey Kent.  I've become a major fan.  She has a quality that I find rare in female vocalists.  The arrangements and insturmental backing from Jim Tomlinson is of equal quality.  Sit back and enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think the game is great and I love the characters and the movements they do also how the more coins you get the trains and the characters running gets a lot faster but it just isn't the best game but I do like it that's why I gave it a 4
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love this game. Too bad you have to buy some of it. Maybe sometime I can. It was such a teaser.
B00005MKA1|5.0|This is a great cd and the music takes me away from the cold and snow outside of my Chicago window!!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This video skipped in several places, I had to watch the movie in reverse too much to enjoy it., I am very dissapointed.
B0000669JL|5.0|Bob Marley is still a star! I love jammin' in the car with Bob and I can really turn it up!
B00BB9PW5C|2.0|I've watched 3 episodes and can feel some of the storylines a mile away.  Just wait until they reveal that the young FBI agent is a follower. Couldn't see that one coming.<br /><br />This is just more romanticizing death and gore, elevating the serial killer as a genius.  I can't imagine a plot twist that would be engaging enough to \\"follow\\" this program through 12 more episodes.<br /><br />Even the marvelous Kevin Bacon can't save the show. I wish he could because it's been too long since we've seen him on the screen.  This role is too one dimensional for him.  There's no emotional rangei in the role.  All he gets to do is grimace his way through the episodes as the tortured hero. Snore.

B00AREIAI8|2.0|It kinda suck but it passes the Time for my other  game  To finish o well it will work cor know
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Tom Cruise got me interested in Jack Reacher. Lee Child has made me an addict. I am now on book 2. Book 1 is a great introduction to this amazing &#34;Lone Ranger&#34; type character who also likes women. The character is far better developed in the book than in the movie and really kept me riveted. This is what an adventure mystery should do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's a slow reader starting out, but quickly becomes a page turner to where you won't want to put it down! The book is better than the movie for anyone who's seen it.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Great depiction of actual events in American history....we will always have a convoluted view of alcohol in this country and those in government who try ro regulate it....
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This product has definitely lived up to all of the talk/discussion(s) on the internet.  Great product for all kinds of tough uses & bushcrafting.<br /><br />LOVE IT !
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|Good game but not worth $5. Not being up front with the cost is misleading.  I don't recommend buying apps from this developer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever. You have to get it (especially if you're swift). If you don't get it then turn on your kindle fire and by it. It is a free game.
B002EUQISW|5.0|I have repurchased this cd several time through out my life.  It's one of the best live cds and it has good selection of all her best work up until that time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This product is very good in many ways and is always working. I love it and it is addicting. Very pleasant and its cool that they do the tour.
B0067TGSOK|2.0|I read the reviews and thought this sounds like a good read. I was wrong, a lot of drawn out stories about people creating startups that most people would never start. Never says how they got started. I also think paypal paid money to have this book published... Their name is said at least 3 times in each chapter. Kinda a let down.<br /><br />talks a lot about himself too. Skip and buy something else. Trust me... You will want something else by chapter 3.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and myself got caught up on the series and have loved it and the ease at which we are able to view this great series.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly is a masterful writer who causes the reader to live in the story. Straight-forward reportorial fiction takes you step-by-step through Bosch's solution-reasoning in suspenseful, exciting escapism.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The price is right and I like how the case automatically turns my Kindle and and off.  I do worry though about power draining.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its awesome but still you have to agree with me that its not better than the first I mean come on.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Short games that are good when waiting in line or when you want a quick game. A nice break for hour brain.

B000PAAH3K|5.0|Great book! Really helps to explain why we make those quick decisions and what we can do to make them better.
B004Y5AV4M|4.0|This was one of the first Georgette Heyer book that I ever read. I think that I was only 12 or 13 at the time; I has just moved up from the children's section of the library to the adult stacks. I enjoy that this book is less about Regency high society and more about country life and people who are not impressed by the societal norms of the time.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|It was absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />I was on a 14hour flight from Seatle to Dubai and could not sleep on the flight and finished Reflected in you!! Cant wait for book nr 3!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|After seeing the prior movie with the joker, this one was too predictable, felt too simple, rushed, and too much of the filiming was in the dark.  I can't recommend it, wait for it to be free.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|wonderful to see a series that treats others with kindness and with dignity.  Poignant glimpse into this time period and the societal changes occurring at the time.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Clint Eastwood delivers again, maybe even better than Gran Torino, and Amy Adams is showing what a major actor she is.  Goodman was great.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|There's a fun twist to all the beloved characters and the story never slows down.  I always look forward to the next episode!! You are going to LOVE this show!!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|really enjoyed it on my plane ride to AZ.  better than i expected.  good graphics, fun story line of courage
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun to play with my mom and friends.it's addictive. Once you start you can't stop. I've truly enjoyed the new scenery that's been on. I liked ny. Rio is cool too. Maybe next time Puerto Rico.

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|We enjoy the NCIS series and had been unable to obtain season 4 locally.  It was a great as we expected it to be.  Ordering was simple and it was quickly shipped to us.  Thank you for your help.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I struggled with my kindle fire energy use and settings until my son installed this app. Now I can tell immediately on starting how much music, video, or surfing time I have. I charge my kindle fire when it needs it and only when it needs it. Thank you<br />Youtube
0765325950|5.0|Excellent conclusion to this great series. Wraps up all of the character arcs satisfactorily and really delivers a Last Battle that lives up to the name.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game. I really like the new world tour updates. I cant wait to see where it will go next. And the different characters and boards make it even better
030758836X|3.0|Except in autobiography, perhaps, authors are not their characters. It's tiresome to continually hear that \\"Shakespeare said `The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.'\\"  That was Dick the butcher, of course, a character in 2Henry the Sixth, not the Bard speaking.<br />Still, one has to wonder. The dustjacket says that Ms. Flynn lives in Chicago with her husband and son. I think I would be uneasy living with Ms. Flynn after reading Gone Girl.
0670024813|1.0|Here it says it well in this article:    Mr Diamond makes no mention of the brutality and oppression suffered by the people of West Papua at the hands of the Indonesian occupation since 1963, which has led to the killing of at least 100,000 Papuan tribal people at the hands of the Indonesian military.    Benny Wenda, a Papuan tribal leader, said to Survival, `What he (Jared Diamond) has written about my people is misleading (...) he is not writing about what the Indonesian military are doing (...) I saw my people being murdered by Indonesian soldiers and my own Auntie was raped in front of my eyes.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics and really fun for a free game. Costs for things seem high but I have to see how long it takes to earn enough.
B00683JK9K|4.0|This is a nice little puzzle game. It looks like there are many puzzles to play. I like that you can choose the # of pieces you want to solve for. You can also choose if you want to make it more difficult by having the puzzle piece rotation scrambled like a normal puzzle. All in all, it's what I'm looming for in a digital puzzle.
B00B2IJJQK|5.0|So, when Justin Bieber came out with \\"Baby\\", I thought oh boy..a new teeny bopper pop star. I was anti-Bieber without ever knowing anything about him other than my assumptions. Well, you know what they say about people that assume things! When Justin's song \\"Pray\\" came out, I tried to hide that I really liked it. I decided to buy it on iTunes and after listening to clips of his other acoustic songs, I bought the entire album. I went back into his library of music and bought more music...the kid was super talented. I saw his movie and that was it for me...kid had me. I was now a Belieber, as his fans so cutely call themselves. With his album Believe, I got my mom and sister and a few friends to all give him a chance...they're fans now too. And now, Believe Acoustic...amazing. Listening to his vocals, they are raw and real. His voice has matured and he knows just the right tones and notes to hit. I melt with some of his runs because they flow so beautifully. Pure talent. And I'm not a little girl just saying this cuz hes like sooooo gonna marry me some day. I'm 31 years old. I listen to a lot of music from Johnny Cash to Booker T, Randy Travis to Wu Tang. Justin has talent. And I am already anxiously awaiting the next album.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great app I love it. Keeps me busy when I am bored. Thanks, its way fun. Keep up the good work

B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael connelly is one of my favorite authors.  This Harry Bosch novel did not disappoint and I always look forward to the next
B0068PHS5Q|4.0|The novel opens as Margaret Lea is summoned by the reclusive and mysterious author Vida Winter to hear her life story. Throughout her life Ms Winter has weaved many tales about her origins, with only one feature uniting these stories: they are all untrue. Now approaching the end of her life she wants to set the record straight once and for all with someone she knows she can trust.<br /><br />Biographers all over the world would sell their souls to be the one selected to write the biography, and Margret Lea is a very unusual choice. A bookish, unworldly woman who has published a few biographical articles in scholarly journals, she catches Ms Winter's attention due to a piece she penned about brothers. Ms Winter correctly guesses that Margaret Lea is grappling with her own demons and that her story also centres around siblings. You see, Margaret had a twin sister who perished at birth but she only found out about this sister when she was snooping in her parent's room as a child. The loss of her twin has left a void in her life and this loss haunts the entire novel, even when Ms Winter is narrating her own story (I must admitt Margaret's constant agonising over her long-dead twin does get a bit much).<br /><br />The Thirteenth Tale is also haunted by the ghosts of books from the past. Many references are made to Jane Eyre,  Wuthering Heights, The Turn of the Screw, The Woman in White and others. There are many events that shadow these books, including  a young motherless child, strange sightings,  a mad woman locked away from society, a mansion fallen into ruins and a fire that destroys and disfigures. I loved these gothic elements borrowed from the classics as I feel like I'm reconnecting with an old friends when I come across echoes of my favourite books in other novels.  The story of the strange, dysfunctional family who occupy Angelfield has a warped fairy tale quality to it that I found very effective.<br /><br />This gothic literary mystery is an enjoyable and engrossing read that kept me guessing until the end. I found it very unconvincing that Adeline could change so dramatically from a wild, violent child into a capable young woman, but I didn't see the twist coming that explains this transformation. At first I was a little annoyed at this unlikely turn of events, but in hindsight I can see that the author did offer some clues that could have been deciphered by a more discerning reader than myself. The book is written to reflect the style of writing in the classics and it may be a little slow for some readers, but if you are a fan of the Brontes and Daphne du Maurier, and love a literary mystery then I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham back in his element.  Very good book once again involving the legal world and its underbelly.  He weaves an interesting tale and characters every time
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|No words can express the way I feel·······WOOOOOOW!!!!!<br />Please don't let this book pass your reading, this is a must read!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I am addicted. It is very fun and I enjoy unlocking boxes, don't understand certain aspects but doesn't ruin the game.

B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I loved the film. The acting was great and the story is well done too. Not quite as good as the book but nothing ever is. Definitely worth the watch though!
1451620829|5.0|All I can say is WOW! I thought that Ace Frehley's book was going to be the \\"tell all\\" Kiss book with the wild stories. This book screams past Ace's with more sex, more guns, more drugs and more behind the scene lies and betrayals. He tells all the stories, from the streets to the mansions. I have to be honest, some of the items I would rather not have known. After all, these four people are very special to me (and I'm sure to millions of other fans) but \\"let the truth be known\\" and it is time to know the whole story. For years we have only heard half of the story and now (with this book and Ace's) we can now hear the other half. Peter holds nothing back. He is hard on Gene, Paul and Ace, as well as himself. Half of Peter's problems have been Peter himself, but I wonder how any of us would have handled the problems, situations and temptations that he had to deal with. Would we have been able to weather the storm or would the storm have buried us. Peter rode the storm and survived! Long live The Cat, and may he and his family be free from future stress...

B0098VYKSA|3.0|This was a late-night purchase and it's exactly what I expected it to be: some action, some special effects, some terrible acting by Kristen Stewart. It is what it is.
B00992CF6W|4.0|don't get me wrong- I am a huge minecraft fan. but I was mad when amazon didn't get the app for 2 years, and now their 2 updates behind! 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 ! I am really excited about signs and baby animals but they just had to ruin the fun. The app itself gets 5 stars. But the reason its only 4 is because of the update.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|this book was a bit better than the last, it had a bit of a storyline, but I still skipped pages. All I can say is the author got paid a heap of money for rubbish, Maybe I should try writing books, I'd probably do a better job

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was hesitating to start this series because it was not finished. But I could wait no longer. The story has enthralled me done the begging. People compare it to the Twilight series, and the only thing it has in common is that it sucks you into a different dimension and u never want to leave. Thank you Deborah, for all your hard work!!!!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I thought I'd persevere to give the books a chance, but this book was so repetitive and boring that I skipped most of the paragraphs, it was a waste of paper. Rubbish
B000FBJGKO|5.0|While this novel tells the tale of a young woman from Bangaladesh brought to London through an arranged marriage, at some level it could be a story of any woman.  Monica Ali's poignant selection of events in the life of the featured character as compared to the story of her sister who continues to live in Bangladesh, could be seen as a commentary on the potentially suffocating life of an Islamic woman in an arranged marriage.  But instead, both the featured character's and her sister's transformation through the years of learning to live with a marriage partner and raising young children, into confident, self-aware, mature women has a universal quality.  A side benefit in this novel is the introspective description of life in Brick Lane, a street in London known to London residents and tourists for its Indian restaurants.

B000N2HBSO|4.0|My only negative is it is very detailed and I am impatient but that is my deficiency.<br /><br />It goes into an in-depth analysis of the basic character of all of the main cabinet members and the evolution of their attitude towards Lincoln. Lincoln was a very complex personality but his sterling character was not obvious at the beginning and he was frequently under-rated by most people until sufficient time had elapsed. It also demonstrated Lincoln's ability to learn from complex situations and his patience with people who disagreed with him. Many people do not appreciate the value of listening to other peoples' opposition and modifying their opinion when the necessity for &#34;give and take&#34; is recognized. Lincoln changed his mind based on the logic of their disagreement sometimes because he took the time to reexamine the merits. Sometimes it took years for others to recognize Lincoln's humility and greatness! Even most of his enemies had to admit he was a rare &#34;jewel&#34; whose integrity and honesty was exceptional in any age.

B000NY12LO|5.0|In Nineteen Minutes, Picoult tackles both bullying and a school shooting. The main character (and shooter) Peter is shown as a person with feelings and, to him, a reason for what he did. While this doesn't make the reader forgive him, it does make one feel for him and for what he has been through at the hands of the \\"popular\\" kids. He is tortured and bullied since the first day of school-even his older brother and his best friend forsake him for popularity while he continues to be bullied. As the story is told, Peter seems to believe this really was the only way.<br />Picoult is a great writer who has covered a number of difficult topics in this book, and in a way that makes you feel.

B002XTBE6K|1.0|Like many of the reviewers, I am an ardent Jane Austen fan and take great enjoyment in the various movie adaptations of her books. The most interesting thing about these adaptations are how the story is re-invented and interpreted throughout the years. Who is cast and how much of the overall look and feel is retained or slightly updated, and how the main leads interact with each other.<br /><br />I had high expectations for this new version, and heard/read rave reviews. Boy, were all those positive adulations so off the mark! In this version of Emma, we have Ramola Garai. As our lead heroine, while beautiful and flits about in her silly endeavors at matchmaking, fails to convey the clever earnestness and tongue-and-cheek wit that is so Emma Woodhouse, and have seen well executed in other versions. Garai did not understand Emma Woodhouse, and therefore, did not know how to play her. This Emma comes off far too manipulative and calculating, selfish and immature, and worse, insincere at almost every turn, oftentimes putting down every person around her. The elegant intelligence and bubbly charm was gone, replaced with a vapid interest in the trivial and came off...dislikable. That alone is an astonishing feat to manage. This Emma didn't seem to grow up and mature, but became more annoying and frivolous as the film progressed. Johnny Lee Miller is a solid actor, but as George Knightly, is also woefully miscast. He came off timid and uncertain, almost shy and confused, the complete opposite of the Knightly we all know: classy and worldly, kind and wise but always confident but modest. Also, Garai and Miller lacked ANY chemistry! Chemistry alone can make up for a lot. If they were two people playing brother and sister, they would have been ideal, but as two lovers, huh? I just didn't get it at all.<br /><br />The direction (Jim O'Hanlon), screenplay (Sandy Welch), casting and acting is what makes this movie different from other versions, and not in a good way. The direction was mediocre, the screenplay awful, the casting neither here nor there and the acting, just off. There was no energy, little substance, the dialogue was poorly written and executed, and after the second episode, didn't leave me wanting more though I kept watching, hoping it'd get better. The script was nothing short of uninspiring but the editing was well done. The supporting cast did a good enough job, but they added very little to overall feel of the movie. It felt very much like they just happened to be there and it was all so heavily focused on Emma. There was faithfulness to book's structure that I appreciated but it was constantly mishandled throughout by either the pithy acting or clumsy narration. While not a terrible addition, this just wasn't as good as I'd hoped it would be and very surprised by all the praising reviews. The production, musical score and costuming were lovely but unfortunately, for me, this 2009 BBC version of Emma fails to capture any of the most important elements of Emma: a genuine, vibrant and joyful excitement and coy amusement. There was no fun, no lightness. If this was supposed to be the updated and modern version, it failed. I watched it once, and that was enough.on was mediocre, the screenplay awful, the casting neither here nor there and the acting, just off.

B008476HBM|5.0|Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had just completed reading Emma. I was so bored by the tedious nature of Emma that I couldn't see what the inspiration was of such a following as portrayed in the movie \\"The Jane Austin Book Club\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed and was inspired to read some of her works. I prevailed and went on to read another of her books, Pride and Prejudice. I am pleased to say that I'm hooked and am looking forward to reading another of her works. (I still feel that Emma was very tedious and boring though)

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I did not want this book to end. I felt like I was actually there with these guys. Thank goodness I wasn't. This novel captivates and takes you to another place where you can almost hear and smell the battle. One of the best battle sequences I have read on the war on terror. Enjoyed it so much I hunted down as many you tube and other interviews with marcus luttrell as I could find. The way his parents community and friends banded together in their most darkest moment while waiting on word on marcus was touching and heart warming.There are good people out there who love and care about what our soldiers (Canadian & American) are sacrificing. VOLUNTARILY I might add. Thank-you.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Funny for adults and children. Isn't scary. Kids loved it! We all would watch it again. We will buy it next time not just rent it.
B005E89X7E|3.0|A very long series. a little boring at times and sometimes too repetative. Could have ended series after 4 books instead of 6. Still appreciate his research into the historical side of his novels.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|All the characters you know and love are in this one from Jack Sr. to Jack Jr.to Clark, Ding, Dom, etc. Fast paced and surprising with some good twists.  I gave it 4 out of 5 because there were a couple of errors that jumped out, for example Jack Jr. is listed as Jack Sr.'s oldest child. Aparently, someone forgot about Sally. Don't let that stop you though, still a great read.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|This album is different than their past work, but it is just as good, if not better. The jangly, synth-heavy 80s pop sound suits them well and while some &#34;purists&#34; might call this record a blatant attempt to hit the mainstream, they're just trying to find a reason to hate. It's a great album.

B005K01VZS|5.0|If you enjoy Mitch Albom, this is another great book. It was the first book I bought for my kindle - I had been waiting to purchase it!
0345803485|3.0|The title of this book should have been Fifty Shits of Grey instead. I still can't fathom how this book is the fastest selling romantic novel of all time!?!?!  There's nothing romantic about this book at all!! It's pure porn!!  If Romance is taking fifty shits from a man, I don't want this type of romance at all.  So if you haven't read the book yet, please save your money. Let me briefly highlight some of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly of the book.<br /><br />GOOD<br />Don't get me wrong. The book is definitely captivating and a page turner.  It's morbid fun and harmless. I liked it in a guilty pleasure kind of way.  Very descriptive sex scenes, loads & loads! Some gross out & some interesting scenes that would definitely make the heat in your bedroom.<br /><br />BAD<br />Annoying characters.  Anna, the female character sounds like she's taken right out of the 12 year old girl's fantasy. Christian Grey, the male character is the kinkiest, obnoxious, controlling and obsessive character I've ever read. Everything around him turns him on. He gets aroused every time Ana bites her lips. I bet Ana bites her lips a 100x and then gets spanked by Christian a 150x.  It seems like she has a climax on every page. There is so much repetition in the book.  Seriously, how many times do I have to read about Anna's inner Goddess/subconscious talking to her?  It is nerve racking to see all these repetitive words like \\"Oh My\\", \\"he's freaking so hot\\" or \\"holy crap, double crap\\" on almost every page.  E L James should have been better off with one fine book instead of stretching it out into a trilogy.<br /><br />UGLY<br />Christian Grey has been seduced when he was 15 by an older woman who made him her submissive for 7 yrs.  She saved him by teaching him to be her sub.  I don't know how to take that. I can't approve of an older woman manipulating a child in such a manner.

0060254920|4.0|'Where the Wild Things are' is portal into a little mischievous boy's imagination. We are first introduced into 'MAX', who right off the bat is up to no good in his home, nailing holes in the wall and scaring the house pet. As a consequence he is sent to his to room with an empty stomach but a roaring imagination. The books illustrations go through a transformation from Realism to Surrealism. As the reader we are transported away from his room to fantasized world with ferocious creatures roaring and stomping for his arrival. 'Max' the protagonist character is able to create his own setting and implement his theme; being able to rule the ferocious rambunctious beast who roam his fantasized world with NO RULES OR CONSEQUENCES. He later becomes tired, hungry, and realizes that his room in his real house is where he truly belongs. I would consider this more of a picture book, only because the pictures dominate the little literature that is in the book. I would consider acting out the book to keep the listeners on their toes.
B008A1B5Z0|1.0|In fact this app wasn't too pleasant at all, after running it only once, it smoked entire my sd card!<br />I uninstalled it. I wouldn't recommend at all. The designer needs to really lay out better instructions or make it less aggressive
B007M45PMU|5.0|I heard them on SNL and had to get the album. You will enjoy the songs as well. Their style is unique
B004JZBGWI|2.0|Maybe I was expecting something more for this app but I supppose it comes in handy for just keeping notes
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I have one of this mic's big brother's already for my desktop, but wanted a clip mic to help me with the slight amount of room echo I sometimes get with the big USB desktop mic.<br /><br />But no such luck. After trying two of these, the first one had a very loud background hiss, that no amount of battery changing could fix. The second one had a slightly different background noise pattern, but one that was too loud for even casual youtube videos.<br /><br />In the end I sent that one back too. Off to try the Olympus and see if it's any better.<br /><br />What's sad is that I have a $5 USB headset mic with better sound than both of these lavaliers AND my desktop AudioTechnica. If only I could stop myself from breathing into it so much, it would be all I ever used. Grr.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was by far the best 99 cents I've ever spent. You might expect that the story of an astronaut left for dead on Mars with little in the way of hope for survival or rescue would be a bit of a downer. Not so here! Mark is one of the most engaging and enjoyable characters I've had the pleasure of reading in quite some time. His exploits had me laughing out loud multiple times, much to the amusement of my husband. I definitely will be keeping an eye out for future works by this author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I seriously love this book. It was so intriguing. The author was amazing the way she brought the characters to life.
