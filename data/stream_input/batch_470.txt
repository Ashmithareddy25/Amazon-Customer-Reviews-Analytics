B00005JNBQ|5.0|When Napoleon first appeared on the screen, the character looked eerily familiar.  I went to highschool in a town surrounded by farms.  Many of the characters just reminded so much of some people that attended the same school.  Scary as that sounds, it's true. <br />Keep in mind that Napoleon doesn't represent any one individual, but bits and pieces of many personalities thrown into a blender to produce one funny character with just a few quirks. <br />This is a film that all will love in either one of two ways.  You will either love loving it or love hating it.  With this film, there just is no inbetween. <br />I watched it with a big group of teens and it was funny both watching the film and watching their reactions to it.  The Napoleon impersonations have not yet ceased.  Great fun all around. <br />When you watch this film, keep watching until after the credits for a great and fun surprise.  Amazon, were are the sixth and seventh stars?
B00008EY63|3.0|This was a thin concept that never made enough use of its star - Ron Pereleman.  An indestructible demon brought to Earth by Nazis during WWII (which overlapped with the \\"Occult Wars\\"), Hellboy was found by American soldiers and raised by a kindly professor (John Hurt) to fight evil.  Though he can clear tall buildings in a single bound and utter no more than \\"oh, crap\\", Perelman brings out a decidedly human side to the character.  HB has been working for our side - specifically the kind of super-secret organization that exists only in comic books or movie adaptations of them.  We first meet HB through the eyes of John Meyers - a young transfer from the FBI, who finds that his new job involves following HB around and making sure to have plenty of candy bars around for the right moment.  Though HB seems to have things under control, two problems nag him.  The first is his unrequited love for Liz (Selma Blair) an emotionally scarred fire-starter (she doesn't like the word \\"pyrokinetic\\").  His larger problems involve plans to complete the world-destroying plot that began with HB's arrival on Earth.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie, mostly because Perlman brings surprising earnestness to his role of demon who likes kittens and can't get the girl.  The best thing about comic books is that they work as great ensemble pieces (a team of heroes, or a solitary hero working against a great villain).  Unfortunately, the script gives HB little support.  Rupert Evans as Myers can do little more than follow HB around, and keep him supplied with mounds of pancakes and gallons of chili, and there aren't enough scenes between Perlman and Blair or with his Hurt.  There's a scene midway in which Jeffrey Tambor, HB's reluctant boss, reminds him that theirs is a team effort - yet much of their back-up is anonymous.  Even the villain is generic - the kind of old-world sounding occult dude we had enough of in \\"Underworld\\".  The basic plot riffs on Lovecraft, but so did \\"Ghostbusters\\" 20 years ago.  In the end, HB becomes little more than Perlman v. CGI, a match that underrates the talents of both Perlman and his character.  HB is still nothing if not satisfying, though you never get past the sense it could have been so much more.tbusters\\" 20 years ago.  In the end, HB becomes little more than Perlman v.

B000001Y79|5.0|Tragic Kindom has turned out to be one of the most successful and recognized albums of the early 90's. Tragic Kingdom is unlike most No Doubt albums. The sound and feel of the album is true to their sun-shine California ska and third wave music. But Tragic Kingdom also offers songs like \\"Dont Speak\\" and \\"Spiderwebs\\" to a crowd of alternative listeners. This is a true album of talent.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|The title sequence where the robots invade the town directly rips the old max fliescher super man cartoon mechanical menace. Right down to camera angles, robot design, everything.  And never is there a mention as him or the cartoon as a inspiration. Polly perkins is even a reporter like Lois lane.  And the last comic ripp off I found was the Frankie character, who just like Marvel's Nick Furry, has an eye patch and comands a flying base in the clouds.  And once again there is no mention of the comic or character as in inspiration. The mysterious woman character reminded me all too much of Darth Maul from starwars. And while the technology was a step forward all the charcters were a step backwards, with no credit to the origionals. Not origional enough for me.
B000001E7L|5.0|This album is just HAUNTING. I mean, all the songs are good and you can't help humming them all the time. \\"Zombie\\" is without a doubt the best song of the album, as well as the best song by The Cranberries. I heard the song the first time, I couldn't help hearing it again and again. Dolores O'Riordan has an excellent, haunting, distinctive voice that is just so pure in the sense that you love it. Recommended.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I can understand how people complaint a lot about this very unscientific Sci-fi. I've managed to accept it at my first visit in theater. Mostly because they did it all the way to end like telling u right in the face \\"this is how we wanna play it\\". The diagnoue r very cartoony that actually help a lot to digest the whole picture, since the whole show is like a big cartoon. And I like cartoon and animation so I dun find myself having problem to accept it. Once u beyond that point, the whole show is really joyful, MTV grabage my ass, it rocks and thrill and its all that matter. The only thing that distingulish good movies from bads is, it doesnt matter which way they plot and design the show, the question is just \\"how much\\" can they pull off from the emotion they are trying to deliver originally, this movie is about rocking fun with space as its background and they do hit it right for me. Just sit back and enjoy 2 hrs cinimatic fun.
B000002MY3|5.0|It deserves all the recognition and praise that it got. When it came out in 1995, there weren't too many lead female rock singers, which eventually opened up to so many great talents. Each song is catchy in its own way. Each individual song differs in its own way. You take a song that is slower such as Perfect and then there is songs like All I Really Want or Ironic. There is something for everyone. And even if people don't want to admit it, once or twice in there life time I'm sure they were once singing an Alanis Morissette song to themsleves. To wrap this up, I just want to say, if you haven't even listened to this album before go out and buy it because it is worth every single penny.
B0006MT314|5.0|I like this soundtrack a lot, Butch Walker's Mixtape is by far the best track on the album.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This is such a great compilation. Honestly, I don't know what to say about it. I love it though. My favorite songs (and the songs I recommend that you listen to) are: \\"Linger\\", \\"Zombie\\", \\"Does Anyone Care\\" and \\"Dreams\\". It's really great.
B000002LKU|5.0|This review is intended for Mark Knopfler fans who heard about this album through and interest in his music, exactly my situation when I bought it. Bottom line, if you like M.K., you will like this. He plays lead guitar throughout the album, sharing solos with Paul Franklin on pedal steel. You might know Franklin from On Every Street, the last Dire Straits studio effort, amongst other Knopfler productions. The listener is not left feeling deprived of Knopfler's brilliant twang. He wrote one song and that song is the only one on which he sings lead, but it's a good song.  <br /> <br />Also pick up Neck & Neck, with Chet Atkins. That album along with this one and Dire Straits' On Every Street represent an interesting period for Knopfler. This period preceeded the Soundtracks but one can hear the seeds of his current work in those three albums.
B000002BBY|5.0|A previous reviewer says that Oasis taught THE BEATLES everything they know? That reviewer clearly isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer! The Beatles came around 30 years BEFORE Oasis did, so it was THE BEATLES who taught every rock act that came after them how to do things! Anyway, this album is alright. The stand out songs are \\"Hello\\", \\"Wonderwall\\", \\"Some Might Say\\", \\"Hey Now\\", and \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\". The rest of the album suffers from filler.
B0006IUDXA|3.0|When I was a teenager I had watched MacGyver and remember loving it. So when this DVD came out, I quickly purchasing the 1st season prepared for a trip down memory lane.  Although I can see why I liked it, it seemed to have a few painful flaws...  mostly some of the supporting characters/extras.  The villains in most of the episodes made me wince in pain as they tried to menace even less convincing peasants.  But then there are a few shining moments like Last Stand which works as a tight suspense story.  Other stories are engaging and Richard Dean Anderson is perfect as the good nature yet effective secret agent who uses his mind instead of guns.  This DVD is also the most basic with only the episodes and the trailer available.  So inferior to the Stargate SG1 DVD's which sparkle with insightful and humorous commentary and Special Features
0375414053|5.0|Smart, witty and fun. Every sentence sparkles. The character real and lovable. It won't disappoint.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Seriously, you just want to stick a paperclip through your ear drum if that what it takes to make the dialogue stop! Painfully shallow.  The original matrix movie borrowed very heavily from Phillip K. Dick, various anime, and classic kung-fu movies. Here the brothers try to stand on their own feet and come up short much of the time.<br /><br />Strangely the scenes where live action is mixed with CGI are surprisingly choppy.  They had the technology but they probably went overbudget.<br /><br />But I'll give it 4 stars because it manages to stand up to repeated viewing.
B0006HXXBA|4.0|First of all, this is a good album, and thrashier than most of the supposed thrash albums we've heard in recent years, but it certainly isn't all out thrash, as there is MASSIVE melodeath influence on this album.  There are quite a few thrash riffs here, but there are plenty of harmonized melody lines and bastardized power-thrash-Iron Maiden guitar riffs and just an overall tone that is very melodeathy.  Frankly, I'm not a big fan of melodeath.  There's some good stuff there, but when it gets boring it gets really boring.  Unfortunately, this flaw finds it's way on to 'Enemy of God' a few times, but it's still a quite solid album overall.<br /><br />This album has 12 tracks, which is always a bad sign, because I don't think I've ever heard a metal album with over 10 tracks that didn't need something cut.  Personally, I feel that 'Impossible Brutality' and 'One Evil Comes, A Million Follow' should've been cut.  Simply put, those tracks are boring.  No energy, not all that catchy, boring riffs, no interesting melody etc.  They suffer from the melodeath tendency to try to do everything at once, and thus fail to do anything well.  Everything else here is pretty good, sometimes excellent.  The title track is definitely the thrashiest thing here, with some nice, raging riffs during the verses, and a reasonably effective chorus.  The middle break isn't so hot, and lacks any real impact, but the song as a whole works well.  'Suicide Terrorist' and 'World Anarchy' are both particularly thrashy tracks as well, though not w/o some melodeath flavoring.  'Suicide Terrorist is probably the better of the two, but both are good, if not truly remarkable.  'Dystopia' is one of the very best tracks on the album.  The chorus is total melodeath, but it's quite catchy with some nice guitar melody, and the under verse riffing is quite nice.  It's got a very good middle break too, particularly the 'Armies Marching On'.  'Voices of the Dead' of the dead is a quasi-balladic piece, and a very effective one at that.  The chorus is epic and great, and it's got some great guitar harmony lines.  'Murder Fantasies' recalls tracks 3 and 4, and like those tracks, it's decent but not that great.  It's got a silly, but still pretty effective chorus.  The riffs could use a bit more punch, I think, but it's still alright as a whole.  'When Death Takes It's Dominion' is another one of the best tracks on the album, and is a good example of what could be done if you combined death or thrash with power/classic metal melodicism properly.  Perhaps the catchiest chorus on the album, with more great melodic guitar lines under it.  It's got a great solo towards the end of the track as well.  Perhaps the best one on the album.  'Dying Race Apocalypse' ups the melodicism of the rhythm guitar work w/o losing too much punch or heaviness or turning into a ballad.  Another solid chorus too, with some great double basswork, though it doesn't sound all that different from a lot of other choruses on this album.  'Under a Total Blackened Sky' is quite like 'Dying Race Apocalypse' though a bit thrashier, and with another epic, melodeath chorus, though one which sounds a bit different from most of the other ones on the album.  'The Ancient Plague' is a balladish piece, and a great, dynamic and surprisingly evocative track.  It's sorta a culmination of all we've heard on the rest of the album, with nice guitar melodies/harmonies some softer, more melodic vox, and acoustic guitars to go along with the heavier riffing and rasped vocals.  It's comes to a brilliant climax, with swirling sorrowful guitar leads and rhythm work over some spoken vox culminating in a final howled line and a stirring, shrieking solo.  Definitely a great metal ballad, and one which actually manages to avoid some of the typical clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Quite good melo-thrash.  Check it out.very effective one at that.

B00006RINF|5.0|Why is this classified as gothic? I used to think so too, when I was new to the genre. Gothic is like, Tristania, Sirenia, Theatre of Tragedy... This is atmospheric metal. What is gothic about this? There are no choirs, classical influences, unclean vocals, and it's not very dark. Of course I do like this album but I do not understand... <br />And while I'm at it...Nightwish isn't gothic either. It's female-fronted power metal. <br />and also, what is wrong with Evanescence? I broke away from the mainstream, I know real bands now, and I still like evanescence. Of course they arent as good as what the foriegn metal scence has to offer, but they are quite superb for mainstream.
B000003TAR|5.0|I can't believe the news today, oh,  boy. About a stupid kid who thought Puddle of Mudd is one of the inventors of Grunge. It's fascinating how many special people write reviews online. Some people make comments that are very silly. They are special. Everybody say, \\"SPECIAL\\". Now Puddle of Mudds first album was not even in the 1990's so how did they help create grunge? Nirvana brought grunge to the forefront. Everybody with a brain knows that. You can't compare these new bands to Nirvana because Nevermind and In Utero are better then anything these other bands have put out and it's also over 10 years old. So keep in mind how much music has changed since then. Most of these newer bands are copiers riding the band wagon. Don't get me wrong, I like some new bands out there and I have their albums, but their nothing new. So Special people with your stupid comments, sometimes it's better to just be special and not speak your mind. There is good music out there now, but lets not put Good Charlotte in the same sentence with a band like Nirvana because it's just silly.<br /><br />Re Issue<br />At first I was skeptical about In Utero as well. When I first listened I thought it sounded similiar to the original, but wasn't sure as I have a bass heavy car sound system. Once I played it on my home system I realize In Utero is very true to the original. The volume is virtually identical. The album really sounds cleaned up similiar to the Pearl Jam. That being said I wasn't fond of the Steve Albini 2013 mix of MV and Sappy. What a shame they didn't release the orginal version. Whoever has their Heart Shaped Box single with MV as a B side keep it as this is the only way you can get this version. With The Lights Out does not have the original MV on it. Over all I am very impressed with the packaging and this release. All original art work should have been restored though. It makes sense to keep your orginals in this case.
0060594888|5.0|Jack Canfield has mastered the art of using his many years of reading publications by those who have made positive influences on the world and his many years of teaching their combined methods to millions of people around the world into a marvelous book of \\"real-world\\" self help.<br /><br />The book starts at the heart of why most of us haven't managed to feel successful and that is taking personal responsibility for our lives.  The books takes that simple philosophy and guides the reader through insightful and easy to understand exercises and flows right into the methods of lifting your own self into motivating and rewarding life changes.<br /><br />Even if your bookshelves are like mine...lots of self help books that in combination are a great asset...you will not shelve this one but put it on your reference table for frequent information.<br /><br />No matter who's self-help methods you prescribe be it ROBBINS, KIYOSAKI, HOPKINS, ZIGLAR or the great CARNEGIE this one will only help make their methods better for your life.
B00006V9A0|3.0|It's a bit difficult to write about a compilation like this, because many questions seem to arise. In the case of Nirvana, they were truly revolutionary, and after Kurt Cobain's death, Nirvana ceased to exist, and the music scene was no longer the same. Their music was largely responsible for putting grunge on the map, and making it popular, and a decade-plus since the band's demise, Nirvana's influence still lingers on.<br /><br />However, the one unreleased song added along with a bunch of hits to make a greatest hits package is nothing new, and makes one suspicious as to the motives behind the release. Indeed, one wonders if this was made as an attempt to cash in on the band's success. Make no mistake, the music is excellent, as to be expected, but one should also realize that Nirvana *literally* has dozens and dozens of unreleased songs (many of them studio cuts) that are only found on bootleg releases, 7-inch vinyls, or import releases--things that would cost fans big bucks in order to own  (and I myself own quite a bit of Nirvana's unreleased songs--on a hard-to-find import release, nonetheless--and they are quite excellent.) Something along those lines would have been a better release.<br /><br />So, in the end, this release gets no more than 3 stars for the reasons listed above. It's probably biased on my part, especially when there could be some value in this for the listener who is new to Nirvana. The music is a stellar 5, no question, but, again, for the reasons above, it gets no higher than a 3.

0385336810|5.0|Such a simple story that made me laugh out loud. Can you even imagine telling a stranger all your secrets and then having them show up at your job? I would die! Emma thinks she will too. Every single thing she says is amazingly funny to me. This is one of those rare books that makes you smile throughout. I hated Emma's \\"sort of\\" sister. I thought her family needed help and my heart went out for Emma. Although she was very strong in this book I just wanted something for this poor girl. She is so much like the rest of us. Doing what she can to get by and trying to figure out her life! She comes to life in this book and I simply can't say enough about it. This happens to be my first book by Kinsella and I would love to meet more of her characters. Or I'd be thrilled if she'd bring Emma back one more time!
0425170349|1.0|This book was surprisingly bad. Clancy's flair for telling an exciting story took a vacation on this one. The basic plot isn't very interesting to begin with and then he fills the book with pages of exposition on the environment and government and I felt like I was at a lecture, not reading a novel. The terrorist plots the group foil along the way to the main story are poorly executed. The team never misses a shot or takes a misstep while the bad guys are like Keystone cops. When you get to the main story, your boredom turns to laughter. It was like Simon Bar Sinister on the old Underdog cartoon and his plots to \\"ruuullle the world\\". Clancy has written some classic thrillers. Go re-read one of them.
B000022TSY|3.0|This movie may not appeal to everyone, but it definitely lives up to the title.  It doesnt reach out and grab you and force you to pay attention, but it's not boring either.  It is pretty relaxing to watch.  There really isn't much of a story, but overall, the movie is interesting.
B000002KKS|4.0|I'll admit I was worried what Sabbath would sound like after Ozzy was gone, and while this was a slight style change I was blown away with Heaven and Hell. 20 some years later and it's still one of my favorite metal albums. Dio brings his Dungeons and Dragons fantasy style lyrics to a new level with these songs and the songs Heaven and Hell and Children of the Sea are two of Iommi's best guitar riffs. I agree with one other reviewer that the sound is different. It's not as heavy and sludgy as earlier Sabbath (which I loved). This is a little more slicky produced but I don't think it takes the edge off at all.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />Most of these boring songs (even the decent ones...which are far and few between) take forever to get going. In most of the songs, Bono sounds tired...like he's an aging rockstar who can't quite hit the notes like he used to. A lot of the melodies are mundane and meandering while the lyrics are pointless. A lot of the music isn't distinct either. The Edge seems to be making up the guitar parts as he goes along on some songs and borrowing from bits-and-pieces of old U2 songs some of the others. <br /> <br />There's a ton of piano/keyboards on this puppy...too much if you ask me. In fact, a lot of these songs sound more like B-side tracks. Very disappointing!. Where's the song-writing ability here ? <br /> <br />Tired music, tired singing. This is the laziest U2 album ever.  <br /> <br />Time to quit U2, really. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00064MW6A|5.0|Most underrated Movie ever comes on an excellent Blu Ray Disc    Plot: Halle Berry plays a shy designer who overhears something she wasn't supposed to hear and the bad guys (and girl) try to kill her. Of course they don't succeed fully, because otherwise it would be a really short movie. So, floating in water, she is rescued by some cats and given quasi superhuman powers.  Now she tries to bring the evildoers to justice, save a bunch from people getting seriously ill from using a bad product and have some fun along the way.  Even though I compressed the story in a few lines this is way more plot than current blockbusters like \\"Transformers\\" or \\"G.I. Joe\\" offer.    PQ: The PQ in this movie is simply excellent. I really couldn't find a thing wrong with it. The picture is crystal clear and very sharp even though there was clearly NO Edge Enhancement or DNR used. Blacks are really black. Really this is one of the best PQ I recently encountered on a BD    SQ: The TrueHD Soundtrack (which usually hovers around 7mbit/s) is also extremely good. Dialogue is always very crisp and understandable even if a lot goes on in the back. Directionality is very good. Bass is not overused but when they call for it, man it delivers.    Extras: Not much there, just a featurette , some deleted scenes (including an alternate Ending)    Summary: THIS IS REALLY A GREAT MOVIE. WHY? IT HAS A SOLID PLOT, GREAT ACTING, VERY GOOD PRODUCTION VALUES. Well what more can I say.. The whole movie seems like an artpiece and one should not dismiss it just because some people didn't get it.  So get it.. or at least rent it..

B00008CLOA|5.0|This album starts with the thumping of a heart. It's interesting for me because my parents used to listen to it when my mother was pregnant with me. They had this idea that it would make me grow up and love Pink Floyd, they were crazy hippies I guess.  <br /> <br />Lo and behold, 30 years later I am still listening to it with my son who is now 4. This is THE masterpiece of all genres. Whether you like rap, country, pop, whatever, doesn't matter just buy this. You don't even have to be a Pink Floyd fan. It will still give you 40 some odd minutes of pure musical bliss. There is no fault on this album. From the start with the heartbeat and \\"Speak to Me/Breathe\\" to the setting the stage of paranoia with, \\"On the Run\\" to the ringing of the alarms in, \\"Time\\" to the beautiful \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\" to the bassline monster, \\"Money\\" to the building of allies of, \\"Us and Them\\" to the soft, relaxing instrumental \\"Any Colour You Like\\" to the dramatic build back to paranoia of \\"Brain Damage\\" and finally \\"Eclipse\\" which ends with the thump-thump-thump of the heart as the album started, is perfection. This is the most beautiful piece of music ever written. The vocals on this album are probably better then any of the albums except for maybe Wish You Were Here. Again, Gilmour shows why he was named the greatest guitar player, knocking off Hendrix and Clapton. His playing and his backing vocals made Pink Floyd. This album shows it, stop reading this and buy it.  <br />
B000001EAQ|4.0|After buying U2's most recent effort, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" I've been going back and listening to all of their material, including this one.  \\"Pop\\" is easily U2's most underrated release.  It is typically caricatured as a vapid techno album, when it in fact displays some amazing musicianship and some very pointed observations about contemporary culture.  What makes this album so bracing is the way that it is torn between celebrating the decadent glitz of pop culture (here represented by disco and electronica) and sheltering what little humanity and passion remains beneath the shiny surfaces of today's culture industry.  It's all too easy to dismiss this album as ironic.  It seems to me that this album explores the appeal of being ironic about everything, but it also repeatedly uncovers the ultimate emptiness in that appeal.  Pop is an album that interrogates itself and is for that much more compelling--both artistically and emotionally--than most of U2's subsequent work.
031286504X|5.0|Richard Matheson's style phenomenal. I picked up this book looking for a good vampire book, and got way more than that. The story is absolutely fantastic. The characters are very deep and are constantly developing. A deep look into all the emotions somebody would go thru being a complete outcast, last man on earth. Lots of cool stuff, very complete and full. Hits on all the emotions a book like this should. Very well written.<br /><br />Robert Deville is the last man on earth, everyone else is vampires. He holes up in his house during the day, drinking, listening to music, trying to stay sane. At night these vampires come out and beat upon his house, thirsty as hell for his blood.<br /><br />I would definatly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.<br /><br />Exciting, dark, terrifying, classic =)
B0006399FS|2.0|A few years ago U2 came out saying that \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was their attempt to win back the job of \\"world's greatest rock and roll band.\\"  This attitude has, I think, proved to be U2's undoing.  Great bands don't treat their art as a job--they treat it as an adventure, as an avenue of self-transformation, as a means of testing of their own limits.  Anything but as a job.  \\"Achtung Baby,\\" \\"Zooropa,\\" and \\"Pop\\" were the products of a band that knew it could no longer go on making music the way it had before--the world had gone postmodern and earnest homages to the American blues tradition seemed, well, irrelevant.  U2 came back with three superb albums that thematized their very artistic quandary--they wrote about the appeal of pop culture and its soul killing ingredients.  They adopted pomo irony, but in a way that made it perfectly obvious that the irony was just a shield for a great big bleeding heart.    As often happens when artists pursue their vision, U2 lost some fans, especially after the release of the uncompromising \\"Pop.\\"  Evidently rattled by waning album sales, the band has attempted to win back old fans by returning to the tried-and-true formulas that made them big in the 1980s.  \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" and \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" are, from the first notes, all too familiar--the anthemic choruses, the jangly guitar lines, the dead-earnest lyrics--all hearken unmistakably back to early U2.  But what was bracing and new in 1983 is today--thanks to the band's own legacy--a shopworn clich.  As a result, very little seems to be artistically at stake on either album.  The songs are expertly crafted--\\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" has drop-dead gorgeous harmonies and the swaggering self-confidence of \\"Vertigo\\" is contagious--but the excitement that comes with taking a chance is largely absent.  I won't say the no-frills production sounds bad--but I will say it sounds affected.      U2 is now, after all these years, in the business of making \\"U2\\" albums.  It may be a well-paying job, but I, for one, hope that they find the nerve to fire themselves.
0802130208|5.0|Anyone who cannot appreciate John Kennedy Toole's humour needs some serious therapy.  Several years ago, I read this as part of an informal reading group.  The characters are memorable.  The plot is unforgettable.  Leave your prejudices and bad mood at the door.  It is NOT advisable, however, to read this in public - people moved away from me in the CTA because I couldn't control the snorting, guffawing and sheer laughing out loud.  I still look forward to re-reading this book...
0743216458|5.0|Band of Brothers(1992). A Non-Fiction novel by Stephen E. Ambrose.<br /><br />In World War II, as Hitler and The Third Reich rose up against Europe, America's brave young soldiers were deployed into an event the world will never forget. In the Army, many fine soldiers gave their lives to defend our freedom, and, to this day, no battalion was as decorated and remembered as well as the 101st Airborne Division. As good as any rifle company in the world, Easy Company, part of the 101st Airborne Division, was responsible for parachuting into Normandy on D-Day, freezing in the Battle of the Bulge, and liberating Hitler's Eagle Nest at Berchtesgaden. Although they suffered causalities of over 125%, Easy Company remained intact, a band of brothers until the end. With all the heroics and legendary tales about Easy Company, it's no surprise that Stephen E. Ambrose, author of D-Day and Citizen Soldiers, recounted the history of Easy Company. Drawing from hours of research and interviews, Ambrose recounted the stories of these American heroes, and his effort turned into a New York Times Bestseller and a very successful HBO miniseries. So, was the book your typical history novel, or a breathtaking history of Easy Company? Read on to find out...<br /><br />Plot-<br /><br />The United States is at war, and to preserve our freedom, they must fight for liberty and peace with the nation's finest, the elite soldiers who do what they must to protect our country. No matter where you came from, may it be the North, South, Midwest, or California, World War II soldiers shared a common bond with each other, a sense of comradeship that lasted through life until death. For Easy Company, 101st Airborne, the dreadful Camp Toccoa brought them together. There, the company faced the harshest tasks, from running 25-miles to doing a thousand push-ups, and the soldiers felt the same aches and scars together. After months of intense physical workouts and numerous parachuting exercises, General Patton is ready to deploy Easy Company for their first mission. As part of an elaborate plan (D-Day), Easy Company is ordered to take out the numerous gun batteries around Normandy to provide cover for the infantry coming from Omaha Beach. In that day, Easy Company showed valor and courage beyond imagination: with just about 50 men, Easy Company inflicted casualties four times that. After that, Easy Company was shipped off to Holland to help with Operation MARKET-GARDEN, and fight in the subzero temperatures of the Battle of the Bulge. Easy Company was also the first army regiment to take Berchtesgaden, a nazi stronghold. Throughout their adventures, Easy Company became world-renowned, taking place in the most important battles of World War II, and receiving massive attention. To this day, Easy Company's adventures are still being researched today, and their legacy will live on forever.<br /><br />Writing/Opinions-<br /><br />I don't like non-fiction, much less historical non-fiction. Even though, I've always been fascinated by war and its aftermath, and I was a big fan of the TV miniseries 'Band of Brothers', so I decided to pick this novel for a project. Fortunately, I didn't write this novel off, because, this is by far the best book about World War II I've ever read, and it kept me interested on every page. Stephen E. Ambrose extensively and thoroughly researched Easy Company, compiling hours and hours of interviews from survivors and studying journals, so this novel could catch every little thing, and the results are breathtakingly surreal. I wondered many times where Ambrose could have gotten some of his facts, but they're all documented. Ambrose lays the battle scenes out with perfect precision, never missing a beat, keeping the reader enthralled on the field of battle, and even when Easy Company's taking a break from war! Ambrose is a magnificent historian, and it shows in his work!<br /><br />Overall, 'Band of Brothers' is an excellent novel on World War II and Easy Company, and the books fast-pace and realism kept me interested all the way through. Every scene was intense and passionate, and Ambrose never fails to miss even the most unimportant information. If a biography could get more specific, I'd like to see it! Ambrose excels in writing and research, and that really shows in his non-fiction, which reads like any fiction novel.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF WORLD WAR II, HISTORY, THE 101ST AIRBORNE, OR STEPHEN AMBROSE. HISTORY NOVELS DON'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS! IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE, CHECK THIS OUT!<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />Band of Brothers- DVD<br /><br />D-Day- Stephen E.

0446607274|5.0|\\"Angels Flight\\" is Michael Connelly's eighth book, his sixth to feature Harry Bosch and was first published in 1999. Much of Bosch's background has been covered in the earlier instalments. Orphaned at twelve, he later served in Viet-Nam before returning to Los Angeles and joining the police force. He currently works the Hollywood Division's homicide table, though he was once a member of the LAPD's elite Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD). He's seen by some as a maverick, though he's not quite the 'loner' he once was. Following a Vegas wedding he's been married to Eleanor Wish for about two years, while he's settled into his role as Squad One's Team Leader and works well with his partners. In fact, he seems determined to become a new Harry Bosch : he's even trying to quit smoking.    The book opens with Bosch and his team being summoned by Deputy Chief Irving to investigate a double homicide Angel's Flight. Bosch is confused, as the crime scene is beyond Hollywood Division's boundaries, and inside Central Division's. Irving, however, has his reasons - firstly, Central Division's homicide detectives are all on training. Secondly, the case itself is somewhat sensitive. Although two people have been murdered - Catalina Perez and Howard Elias - the department is specifically worried about the implications of Elias' murder. Elias was a lawyer who specialized in police and civil-rights cases, and his murder has come two days before what might have been his biggest case against the LAPD. Michael Harris, his client, is suing fifteen RHD detectives for ten million dollars. Questioned regarding the kidnapping of a twelve-year old girl, he claimed the detectives had tortured him over a three day period. The girl, a member of a well-known and rich family, was later found dead near his apartment, while his fingerprints were found on a book in her bedroom. Nevertheless, he was found not guilty in the criminal trial.     By rights, RHD should've been investigating Elias' murder - butgiven Elias was planning to sue RHD, their involvement would've been viewed as a possible conflict of interest. Irving has therefore selected Bosch's team to deal with the investigation. The case itself also worries Harry : he knows that, given the nature of Elias' cases, many of the most obvious suspects will be cops. These may include his former colleagues at RHD - including his former partner, Frankie Sheehan.     Part of the help Irving has assigned to Bosch's team is a group of IAD detectives - a group that includes John 'Sustain' Chastain,  IAD (Internal Affairs) is the section that investigates other police officers - that department, and all its employees, are detested by every other cop in the city. Harry, himself, has been investigated by IAD a number of times - twice by Chastain, who seems determined to drive Harry out of the force. Harry suspects that the IAD grouping has been assigned to hinder, rather than help, the investigation. However, this isn't Harry's only problem. Given the high-profile victim, the newly-appointed Inspector-General, Carla Entrenkin, has been notified of the murder. This position allows her to oversee any investigation she chooses - and Harry suspects she has a 'personal' interest in this case. Furthermore, Harry believes that Elias had a source feeding him information from the Parker Center.     As with Connelly's previous books, I found this to be an excellent novel. It's a difficult case for Harry, though - despite some 'political' interfering from Irving, he's determined to solve it to the very best of his abilities. Those who have read the previous instalments will know Harry's past, and several old favorites return. Although having read the previous book in the series (\\"Trunk Music\\") may be helpful, the 'newcomer' won't feel left out. \\"Angel's Flight\\" covers enough of Bosch's past to tell the story without any gaps. Highly recommended.
B000003S0I|5.0|My first review of this album focused on the inaccessiblity of the music on this album to the average listener.  However, since, then, I've listened to the album enough to appreciate the depth and genius.  I will hold to my recommendation that this perhaps is not the best place for those uninitiated to King Crimson, but if you give this album a try, you will be rewarded.  It took a while for this album to click with me, but once it did I immediately started adding KC discs to my collection. Prog rock at it's finest from the John Wetton era.      I would recommend listening to this album for the first time on a warm spring day, lying on your sofa, with the windows open enough to catch the scent of spring on the air, and to hear the sounds of the birds.
1400032717|4.0|First published in 2003, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" won the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award, the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize and was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Mark Haddon, its author, has also worked as an illustrator, a cartoonist and a screenwriter. Other awards he has won include two BAFTAs.  <br /> <br />The hero, and narrator, is Christopher Boone - a fifteen year-old with Asperger's Syndrome. He is very good at Mathematics, and plans to take an A-Level in the subject at the end of the school year. He routinely tells the truth (lying confuses him too much), likes animals, doesn't like being touched and hates the colours brown and yellow. Although he hates France, he lists this as one of his 'Behavioural Problems'. His memory is like a piece of video-tape : it can run forwards and backwards and comes with a smell-track, as well as a soundtrack. As an only child, he lives with his father in Swindon - his mother, it would seem, died from a heart attack some two years previously.  <br /> <br />The book opens with Christopher finding the corpse of Wellington, the poodle that belonged to his neighbour, Mrs Shears. Wellington had obviously been murdered - he had a garden fork sticking out of his side. Generally, Christopher likes books about Science and Mathematics; however, he also likes murder-mystery books. (\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a particular favourite; Sherlock Holmes seems to be something of a hero for Christopher). Having decided to find out who murdered Wellington, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time\\" is Christopher's murder-mystery novel. However, his investigation brings some things to light he never expected to discover.  <br /> <br />In keeping with Christopher's personality, the book has been written in a very matter-of-fact manner. He remembers being told of his mother's death : he wondered what sort of heart attack it was, and remembered that Mrs Shears made him spaghetti and tomatosauce. As he likes prime numbers, he decides to make the chapter numbers primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11..) rather than cardinals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5..). A little unusual, but a very easily read and very enjoyable book. <br />
B00069YE0W|5.0|I haven't been a fan of John Frusciantes very long(Californication-present), but his six albums are the best albums I have ever owned.  Each album has its own unique quality that make them special.  His sixth and final release \\"Curtains\\" is more mellow when compared to the other 5 albums. It consists of acoustic songs and the same creative genius that is found in John Frusciante's other works.  Just like his other albums the lyrics, music, and vocals are all interesting and creative.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The first time I heard this album I realized that I had found the music that I had been waiting for.  I never knew that what I wanted to hear so bad was the music on this album.  It is totally different and new and innovative, but all so familiar.  The continuation of the album without pauses or breaks between songs reminded me of Darkside of the Moon.  Immediately after listening to it the first time (must be done listening straight through, without taking any breaks) I repeated the cd and played it again.  Till this day, every time I listen to the album I find something else that makes me love it even more.  Omar makes his guitar talk through most of the album, his sound is just like nothing you ever heard before, along with Cedric's awesome vocals that contain howls and screams from another planet, this guitarist/singer duo reminds me of Page/Plant.  Ikey owens provides great sounds on the keys, and Jon Theodore's drumming is just great.  John Frusciante and Flea from the Chili Peppers help out on the album as well.  Even more amazing than the music on this album is the live show, a display of chaotic harmony, the best I have ever seen and heard.  If you are someone who is tired of the music they play on the radio or on tv, you must definitely listen to this album.
B00069YE0W|4.0|Another good Frusciante release.  But some of the songs sound like they are just rough ideas that needed to be hammered out a bit more.  Perhaps it is the way the album was recorded.  John recorded the basic tracks in his living room and then overdubs were done in the studio.  I think some of the ideas could have been fleshed out a bit more and with a little more thought this could have been a 5 star release.  John's music contains such beautiful melodies, hooks and choruses.  It just seems that this release needed a little more seasoning.  As it is I can only give it 4 stars,<br /><br />Lever Pulled, Time Tonight, The Past Recedes and Ascension are my favorite tracks.<br /><br />If I were to rate the six releases I would rate them as follows:<br /><br />1. The Will To Death<br />2. Inside Of Emptiness<br />3. Ataxia Automatic Writing<br />4. Curtains<br />5. DC Ep<br />6. A Sphere In The Heart Of Silence<br /><br />Don't let the rankings fool you, these are all quality releases worthy of a spot in your cd collection.<br /><br />When all is said and done, this guy really is a prodigy.  Sheer genius does not do his talent justice.  I remember when he joined the Chili's the turnaround in the quality of their music, they went from Punk/Funk to something different, something truly special.  Then he went through his rough period.  When you listen to Niandra and Smile the progress he has made as a musician, vocalist and songwriter is absolutely astounding.  So much talent in one human.  It is not fair to other artists.  This man is a music making machine.  Heartfelt, eclectic and gorgeous thought provoking music.  I thank him from my heart for the gift of music he has brought into my life throughout the years and the treat of such high quality albums in 2004.  He released 8 albums worth of music in a 2 year span.  From The Sounds Inside (internet release), Shadows, Shadows Acoustic (internet release), and these 6 albums.  We are blessed that he recovered from addiction and has graced us with such beautiful music.  Thank you for coloring my world John.coloring my world John.
B00005JLEX|4.0|It's been so long since I've watched the show's first or second seasons straight through that there were a few episodes that I had completely forgotten about (odd, considering I see at least an episode a day playing in syndication on 5 different channels), which was a nice surprise.  You can really see the way the show evolved from a more traditional sitcom (though never cliche or obvious) to what it's known for--a show about nothing--which is also really interesting.   <br />The DVD set also has some really great extras, way better than what you get on most boxed sets.  The commentaries are interesting and funny (especially the ones with Larry David), and I usually am not a huge fan.  There are also \\"notes about nothing\\" which you can turn on or off like subtitles, which provide factoids about the show and each episode.   <br />This is really worth checking out--highly recommended!
B000001Y42|1.0|First off, on this site, someone w/the screen name Avril_Lavigne#1fan went off slandering all of these classic albums and discrediting them of their greatness. Not only that, but this person claims that Avril Lavigne's guitarist and bassist is better than Iron Maiden's? It's sheer f**king bulls**t. Avril's crap alongside other s**ty new bands out there just strum power chords and jump around like a buttf**king brady bunch. Iron Maiden and Megadeth both have intricate riffs, complex guitar solos, and intense dueling guitar harmonies. Oh yeah, the measure of greatness of a band doesn't depend on trl, which is run by corporate money hungry sons of b**ches that just care about trends and profit rather than talent. The greatness of a band depends on the originality and distinct style. When you hear Iron Maiden, you know it's them, because they have such a unique style  with Bruce's high soaring vocals, Steve Harris' lightning fast plucking and going all over the bass, and its duel guitar attack. When you hear Megadeth, you know it's them because of their extremely fast riffs, snarly vocals, and brutal guitar solos. With bands like Avril Lavigne and Limp Bizkit, there's nothing to them. They don't have a unique sound. They sound like every f**king one else. So in short, this album is pure bulls**t and is NOT, I repeat, NOT the birth of metal.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This movie is one of the best in the line.  Mind you i mean the TNG line. Great story, good production, and outstanding effects. A must own for any trekkie.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This looks like something a bunch of uni students put together. Except these guys had enough money to rope in someone like Bill Murray. I usually love 'arty' films, but to me this just lacked depth. This is about two people who find some comfort in each other while feeling somewhat lost in their own lives. There is a little flirting, an occasional and sometimes awkward kiss on the cheek, a couple of kareoke parties where not much happens, dialog between the main characters is kept to a minimum and often the characters simply blend into the background, which sometimes I think is more interesting than their own story. I think this is the kind of movie, where the characters should have been explored a lot more, so that the audience can really connect with them. There's a scene in this film where Bill is appearing in a Whiskey advertisement and you can see that he just wants to get the heck out of there, probably thinking: is this what my life has come to? Half way through this film, I started to wander if that's how he felt about this film. I realise some people loved this, but it didn't do it for me. There was not enough depth for me to be emotionally drawn to this story and I think the potential was there.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|firstoff, if you havent seen this movie, you absolutely need to- if for no other reason than so you will know what people mean when they say \\"ligers are pretty much my favorite animals\\". but seriously, this is the funniest movie i have ever seen in my entire life- if you do not think it is funny, you have no sense of humor, and i feel sorry for you. this is a movie that will become an instant classic and correctly portrays the high school experience.  who cares if it is set in idaho (where i actually have been) and the fact that kip is 30 something and still living it home.  any movie that can cause me to break into spontaneous laughter during my college classes when i remember a line is worth your watching.  so many lines to quote, and a sweet movie all around.  makes you want to go out and get a brown tux at a local thrift store, even if you arent a guy, or be a taste tester for a dairy farm.  by far the best movie i have ever watched, matched only by other such works of randomness- monty python- which i would put in the same category of funniness. enjoy the movie, and you will be quoting it for the rest of your days! \\"like anyone could even know that\\"
B0002DB52M|5.0|at the age of 78 i watched in fascinated horror as one scene after another caught a community of ordinary folks slipping into the predatory opportunistic behavior that drives participatory fascism. as grace sought to comply with the demands of her tormentors it was one munich after another: \\"peace in our time\\" at the price of liberty, with a finale as slave laborer, auschwitz style. these are heavy days and trier  took a large leap into the autocratic tomorrow towards which we are rushing, only of course to be labeled \\"anti-american.\\" hopefully we'll discover a solution that is something short of \\"wiping 'em all out,\\" but i'm not so sure.
068987474X|1.0|There are lots of great books on relationships out there... this is definately NOT one of them. Written totally from a man's point of view (center of the universe it would seem) and an admitted \\"dog\\" as a single man, this book was somewhat amusing at times.  However, if you are looking for real advice on relationships or dating, look elsewhere! Dateworthy by Dennie Hughes is a much better book.
B0002X314C|5.0|I love John Legend!!! Ordinary People is my favorite! I love the simplicity of it.

B00005NWRS|4.0|GOLD is Ryan Adams second album and has some really memorable songs. This Limited Edition is worth seeking out. It has a bonus disc with some outtakes from the GOLD sessions. The bonus disc includes tracks such as \\"The Bar is a Beautiful Place\\" which is my favorite, \\"Rosalie Come and Go\\", \\"Sweet Black Magic\\", \\"Cannonball Days\\" and \\"The Fools We Are As Men\\". The CD also includes the original GOLD disc. Highlights include \\"When The Stars Go Blue\\", \\"Nobody Girl\\", \\"La Cienega Just Smiled\\", \\"Somehow, Someday\\", \\"Answering Bell\\", \\"Firecracker\\" and \\"The Rescue Blues\\". A great album from Ryan Adams worth picking up if you haven't already!
B000268QB2|5.0|This is my first ever recommendation on Amazon so that should say something that I am going out of my way to recommend Keane's \\"Hopes and Fears\\".  Sure they are being compared to Coldplay but I think that is mostly because they both use the piano as a main instrument.  In my opinion, Keane's songs and melodies are better than Coldplay and I really enjoy Coldplay.  Tom Chaplin's vocals are reminiscent (at times) of Freddie Mercury.  I also hear an influence of ABBA but don't let that scare you away if you don't like ABBA.  In any case, as I stated in the title, I have tried to get this CD out of my car but somehow, it continues to \\"stay in the rotation\\" while other CD's head back in the house.
006054094X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in the past few years.  I say that because it dares (much like Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs, and Steel_) to ask big history questions and challenge assumptions that many academic historians fear to address.  That's been one of the reasons behind the backlash of criticism of this book from academic circles.  Certainly there are questionable, even doubtful, assertions made at times in this book. But simply to ask \\"what if the Chinese discovered Africa, Europe and the Americas in the 1400s?\\" and then to be able to back it with many examples from such diverse areas of study as shipwrecks, stone monuments, DNA, and samples of chicken and vegetable species, not to mention oral traditions, is an admirable task.   <br /> <br />Menzies is able to lure the open minded and even skeptical reader into his argument by carefully explaining his train of thought as he studied old maps and sea charts, while arranging the book in geographic order.  Once we accept his evidence for the Chinese rounding the Cape of Good Hope, he lures us into his research on Atlantic islands and then the Americas.   He does so in a comfortable writing style that easily makes this a page-turner.   <br /> <br />It is fascinating to read how someone who begins research on such a wide-ranging topic begins to encounter unforseen links between seemingly trivial bits of archaeological, genetic, and oral information.  There are fascinating details like the Chinese bringing coconuts to Ecuador and roses to California, as well as the revelation of Chinese wrecks in San Francisco harbor.  Finally, his updates in the paperback edition and his use of a web site for keeping readers appraised of new information demonstrates his infectious enthusiasm for this ambitious undertaking. I recommend that people check out _When China Ruled the Seas_ (particularly helpful for its wider chronological scope and illustrations of the boats).  Find out more about the Chinese attack on Greenland (!) and secret maps of Europeans when you read this fun book.
B000002U82|5.0|Their are very few albums that truly deserve to be called a classic, but this is simply one of them. This album heralded a new era for Pink Floyd. The psychedlic, (in the words of guitarist David Gilmour \\"psychedlic noodling\\") had been toned down, and a more mainstreamed style was coming forth. The band, however, refused to be molded into a pop group, and realeased an album that mixed beautiful melodies with soul searching lyrics. <br /> <br />Perhaps one of the things that makes this record so great is the fact that it is three decades old, and it sounds like it was recorded a few years ago, at the most. All of the sounds are crisp and clear. <br /> <br />At was at this time that Pink Floyd was the most \\"democratic\\", and the influence of every member of the band is shown here. Each band member provided something in this album. Weather you like songs with a strong rhythm, a strong beat, or a strong melody, you are sure to find it here. The lyrics are deep, and listening to the album always leaves me feeling hopeful. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd has always been great at leaving space in their music, and this would have to be the best example. Nothing is rushed. The music is allowed to progress at it's own pace, to form it's own climaxes, and their are only two or three guitar solos in this album. However, everything is so melodic and carefuly crafted that it will stay in your mind forever, and each time you hear the record, you will hear somehting in the background, often the keyboards (Rick Wright) or the very jazzy (in my opinion) bass (Roger Waters). <br /> <br />This album seems to only get better with age, and that is what i think truly counts as a classic album. I hope you purchase and enjoy.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Halle Berry a prison psychiatrist, Charles S. Dutton, Robert DowneyJr. plays her collegue, Penelope Cruz as an inmate at the prison and a patient of Halle's who plays a psychologist/pschiatrist. Overall a very good movie! This movie has many twists and turns Halle ends up an inmate at the very prision she works at. Her colleges all think she's went insane. An invisible force assults her against her jail cell wall, floor, and furnishings, they assume she is trying to commit suicide when they see this on their security cameras.

B000002BE9|4.0|Wow I think I am out of the norm here. Last night I decided to review this, fully expecting to come here and see it praised as her masterpiece (so far)... instead I see several mentions of it not being as good as When the Pawn. *Whew* that certainly is not what I think. When the Pawn is largely electro-drivel, in comparison to this great album.<br /><br />The piano and vibraphone combination on this album give Fiona's music a whole different feel from anything else that was out there at the time this was released...or since. My problem with When the Pawn was that it seemed like Fiona ran out of good songs, and the \\"sound\\" of that album was more about the production. There is nothing on that disc that compares favorably to Never Is A Promise, Sullen Girl, etc...<br /><br />I guess I would tend to think of this disc in terms like low, pained, smokey, etc... but those are bad terms because people hear \\"smokey\\" and begin to think of some sort of lounge-jazz context, which this is not. There is so much garbage that lives on the airwaves. This was one of the few great albums of the '90s to actually get alot of airplay.<br /><br />Whereas others (largely male counterparts) almost always seem to turn the emotional pitfalls of their young life into cheeseball, overly dramatic teen-angst fluff, Fiona seemed to truly be able to dig into the core of her own consciousness and say things in a way... both lyrically and melodically... that could touch people on all sorts of levels.<br /><br />On one hand, this is an album that sort of wallows in sadness, but it also has a strength and spiritual independence to it. This is one of my favorite pop debuts of all time. Even though I thought When the Pawn was a gigantic disappointment, it doesn't really tarnish my thoughts on Fiona. I mean hey, so maybe she only had one near-masterpiece in her, so what? That's one more than most people.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is a great movie! Imagine being able to go back in time and change the traumatic times in your life... Sounds great right?...NOT! What if by changing your past you severly altered the present? One can not assume all will be without consequenses. Good or bad. As a child he had episodes where he would just \\"blackout\\" Evan(Ashton Kutcher) had no recollection of what had just transpired. Year later while in college studing to become a pschologist Evan discovers he has the ability to alter his past by re-reading his journals from childhood past. Clearly a thrilling movie, see  it for yourself!
B00004S8Q9|5.0|This is Raw, Heavy And bluesy with Melody! This is quickly becoming my favorite cd! You wont regret this, It's a mixture of the first 2 albums but with a heavy edge to it. Everyones playing on this is amazing!
B00069YE0W|5.0|I wasn't sure whether to be happy that John released another album yesterday, or sad that it was his last one of his recent string of releases. Whatever my feelings were, I can tell you that this is a magnificent album.  <br /> <br />It is a lot slower and more melodic that his previous ones, but still has some emotionally stirring and straight out phenomenal songs. A great deal of the songs seem like they could have been taken straight from Inside of Emptiness as well as the Will to Death. My favorites being Ascension and Leap Your Bar. I put the repeat on Leap Your Bar and probably listened to it about 15 times before going back to the beginning of the album again.  <br /> <br />The only song on the album that I think is rather annoying is Control which is rather repetitive, and gives me about as much of a headache as the first four minutes of A Sphere in the Heart of Silence.  <br /> <br />After purchasing all of John's recent albums, this would be the order in which I personally would rank them: <br /> <br />1. Ataxia-Automatic Writing <br />2. Inside of Emptiness <br />3. The DC EP <br />4. Curtains <br />5. The Will to Death <br />6. A sphere in the Heart of Silence (Sorry Josh) <br /> <br />I don't want this to be interpretated as anything negative. All of these discs are five stars. So if you are missing any from this set, I urge you to run out and pick them up, cause you won't be disappointed.
B000002LQR|5.0|everything everybody else has said is what this album is, the album was made it was a big hit and it will always be top 10 on a \\"greatest cd's of all time list  or \\"greatest bass moments of all time or even \\"greatest guitar moments of all time\\" 10 out of 10, five stars.
0451528018|5.0|One of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's best works in my opinion, a carefully and cleverly crafted thriller, it'll keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat. A storyline so unpredictable, that one would never trust their instincts. It is so well written, that no matter how many times one reads it, it never seems to age.
0345350499|5.0|Ms. Bradley brings King Arthur's Britain to colorful life in this untraditional retelling, from the women's point of view. Igraine, Arthur's mother, is married to Gorlois of Cornwall in an arranged marriage and has resigned herself to her typical fate of women of her day when she finds true love with Uther Pendragon. Igraine's sister Viviane, High Priestess of Avalon, is desperate to preserve the Old Faith in a world quickly being overtaken by Christianity. Morgaine, Igraine's daughter by Gorlois, is an innocent pawn rather than a villain in this piece, manipulated by Viviane to conceive Arthur's heir in a desperate attempt to put a king faithful to paganism on Britain's throne and bring Avalon out of the shadow world. Gwynhyfar, sold to Arthur in marriage, is equally determined to make Britian a Christian country.<br /><br />A towering tale of grief, tragedy, triumph, love and hatred, \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is perhaps Ms. Bradley's finest work, even over her celebrated Darkover series. This novel grips the reader's soul and will remain for the ages as a testimonial of the power of legend, and one writer's extraordinary talent. If ever a book deserved more than five stars, it's this one
B0006399FS|3.0|This album has been reviewed as both excellent and terrible.  It is neither.  It is an average, middling album that is only really horrible in the sense that it is the product of a band that should be able to do better.  In the same stroke, it is only truly fantastic if you are such a die-hard U2 fan that you don't really care anymore what the music sounds like. <br /> <br />Vertigo, the opening track, has power but lacks the poignant message of the really great U2 songs(Sunday Bloody Sunday, etc.).  I enjoyed Miracle Drug, but City of Blinding Lights was about enough to make me quit listening.  The final track, Yahweh, wasn't bad, but I had expected something more of the closing - something that really left me with the impression of an excellent album. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is worth having if you can find it for less than twelve dollars or if you really have to own every U2 album.
B00006LI4S|1.0|I recently bought both the David Gilmour DVD and Roger Waters \\"In The Flesh\\" DVD. The reviews for both were quite favorable, so I thought both of them would be a good addition to my collection. Unfortunately I found David Gilmour's video to be tired, listless, and boring to watch compared to Roger Waters' video. \\"In the Flesh\\" came across as so much more powerful and exciting and it had me riveted to my seat marvelling at the musical excitement conveyed throughtout the entire video. I did like David Gilmour's version of \\"Wish You Were Here\\" better because he kept to the original version, whereas Roger Waters changed the version somewhat, I didn't like the start of the song but as it progressed it got better. Roger assembled a far superior band, and his drummer was especially good compared to the drummer for David Gilmour. I kept an open mind when watching these videos, and didn't have a preferenece or opinion as far as the Gilmour-Waters struggle, but my eyes and ears recognized a far superior effort put together by Roger Waters. <br />David Gilmour included two versions of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and both special guests had to read the lyrics off a page in front of them, they didn't bother to memorize the lyrics for this show, and the entire show lacked any kind of excitement. <br />\\"In the Flesh\\" is a much better effort and kept me thoroughly entertained.
B000683VI4|5.0|A young woman must choose betwen the man she loves and the man her parents want her to marry. this movie is based on the book by nicholas sparks, brought to the screen with unforgettable performances. <br /> very touching film that deserves being watched with a loved one. <br />  the DVD includes audio commentarie, deleted scenes, profiles of the director, and two behind the scenes featuretts.
055321263X|5.0|Collins was a contemporary of Charles Dickens, and its interesting that his stories are still just as exciting as they were when first printed.  This is a great mystery story that is as evocative as its title.  Whoever has read this story never forgets Wilkie's crossroads.  \\"the road to West End, the road to Hampstead, the road to Finchley and the road to London.\\"  This is where we see his solitary woman dressed all in white from head to toe.  The story is masterfully written, and Mr. Collins uses some of his characters to \\"write\\" different parts of the story.  In this unique way the reader really gets to know his characters and how they think.  There is a wealth of detail, and a carefully plotted story.  Still as exciting today as the day it was written.  No higher praise can be given for a mystery story.
B0006399FS|1.0|How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is the inevitable result of U2's long, slow slide towards VH1 easy-listening coffee-table schmaltz that began with 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'.<br /><br />Listening to this CD is a real torture. U2 are truly out of ideas. The same rotten formula they worn on 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'. There's absolutely nothing innovative here. Artificial 'emotion', lame music, lifeless, tuneless, monotonous, dull, boring, mainstream, annoying and pointless. Virtually unlistenable. We really don't need this overhyped crap. It's just an excuse to tour again. This is one of the biggest letdown in my music-buying history.<br /><br />Bono sings like s**t, neverthless he likes the sound of his own voice. He lacks any real passion and intensity. Bono's \\"vocals\\" sound damn lazy. The songs are repetitive, drawn out and lack any great melody. He no longer sounds like he's SINGING anymore and seems to just to strain to hit the high notes. SO ANNOYING !.<br /><br />This album contains the worst U2 ever tunes:<br /><br />'Vertigo'<br /><br />'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own'<br /><br />'Love And Peace Or Else'<br /><br />'All Because Of You'<br /><br />'A Man And A Woman'<br /><br />'One Step Closer' and<br /><br />'Original Of The Species'<br /><br />Do you want to have 'The Worst of U2'?, so BUY THIS ALBUM NOW !!... I almost forgot: \\"I can't wait for the new Tour !!\\", \\"U2 are back to Rock !!\\"...<br /><br />Could U2 be any more of a self-absorbed jerk? Has there been a single awards show, sporting event, or other overwrought extravaganza in recent years where they haven't shown up to put in yet another insufferable performance? Those questions are rhetorical, by the way...
B00003ZKSP|5.0|I have always been a Maggot since my brother got a bootlegged copy of the original CD before they were widely known and still underground. I bought the album with the newly added songs, which are awesome! My favorite off the new tracks is Despise, which is an unfinished version of Purity. But Prosthetics and Scissors are my favorite off the album.  It is the best Slipknot album, becauase it is the first, with that said, Iowa and Subliminal Verses are great, too.
B000001EAQ|5.0|<br />The entire album it's excellent, there isn't a bad song to be found. Best Bono's lyrics ever. Music is omni-directional and unique in its own right.  <br /> <br />This is U2 at their most imaginative hour. What have become of U2 ? I really hate mainstream. I really love Pop because it's a completely different experience. Avant-garde, experimental, powerful, dark, emotional, nostalgic, weird, Intoxicating and hypnotic. All at the same time. <br /> <br />Best songs? The highlights from Pop are innumerable. The album itself is a highlight !!. Special mention must go, though, to 'Discotheque', 'Mofo', 'Staring At The Sun', 'Last Night On Earth', 'Gone', 'If You Wear That Velvet Dress' and my favourite one, 'Please'. <br />
B00005JLIU|5.0|As a child growing up in the 70's, this was a favorite movie with all my friends.  Every birthday party usually began with \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" on 16mm film projector.  Today, my friends and I still use a few expressions we picked up from Carol Channing and Julie Andrews.   <br /> <br />This is a funny and entertaining musical that takes place in the 1920's.  I still enjoy seeing it everynow and then.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|This album is absolutely unbelievable.  The first time I listened to it, I thought I'd turn it off after a few minutes and go to bed, but the music changes so much and goes so many places that it's hard to find a good stopping place.  Actually not hard, more impossible.  This album is meant to be listened to in one sitting, for the full 68 minutes.  It never gets boring or flatline, it's always changing.  Pick this up and set aside 68 minutes to listen to it.  It's awesome.
B00009V7T2|5.0|De-Loused in the Comatorium is an amazing journey through the subconcious mind and music. Perhaps that's a little over stated but for the first time in ages a band has finally come along that has successfully meshed diverse musical influences (from free jazz,to punk, alternative, latin, and electronic music) to form a mind bending , yet coherent album that gets better every time you listen to it. Simply put, the musicians on this album will constantly amaze you with the directions and original thoughts they express, as well as pure , unadulterated mastery of their instruments. To top it all of the energy of the vocals, and emotional rollercoaster of a journey through the subconcious mind of a comatose, suicidal artist, make for simultaneously dark and uplifting experiences, and stimulate thought and introspection in anyone that is willing to give it a listen. This is the Alice in Wonderland of the 21st century put to music.
B0006399FS|3.0|I remember when I first heard Achtung Baby...I neither liked it nor disliked it. However, after listening to it a few times, it began to grow on me. Now it is my favorite U2 CD along with The Unforgettable Fire and Joshua Tree. How to Dismantle the Atomic Bomb feels the same. I neither like nor dislike it, but a few songs are really starting to grow on me. Listening to Miracle Drug and City of Blinding lights, I am starting to hear the classic melodies of U2 past. Hopefully the more I listen to it, the more it will really get under my skin. Its starting to...thats a good sign.
B00005JM02|1.0|I'M VERY CONCERN ABOUT THE IMAGE THAT THIS MOVIE SHOW ABOUT THE DENTISTS. DOES ANYBODY CARE ABOUT THE MESSAGE THE WRITTERS OF THIS MOVIE ARE SENDING TO OUR KIDS? WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PART OF OUR HEALTH. I THINK THEY MADE A BIG MISTAKE INCLUDING IN A KIDS MOVIE A PART WHERE A DENTIST PLAYS A ROLE SO NEGATIVE. I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANY OTHER PARENT IS WORIED ABOUT THIS ISSUE. DENTIST SHOULD SAY SOMETHING!!!!!!!
6303637493|5.0|Admittedly, I did not know a lot about opera or Farinelli before seeing this movie, so whatever historical inaccuracies it might contain were not noticeable or distracting to me. With this disclaimer made, let me say that when the movie was over, I was immediately moved to learn more about this legendary singer and the opera he performed. <br /> <br />This move is gorgeously shot, beautifully acted and never slow. For those reviewers who complain that Farinelli is portrayed as being ashamed of his castration, I would argue that an early scene in the film, when Farinelli sees another castrato being made fun of in front of an audience and gets up on stage to defend him and show off his own beautiful voice, is proof that the castration itself is not a source of shame for Farinelli. He is certainly proud of his talent. I think the movie is more concerned with Farinelli's ambivalence toward his brother and his strong desire to be a father. He is not ashamed of his catsration, but rather feels pained that he cannot start a family of his own, and that he must be so dependent on his brother. <br /> <br />As another reviewer mentions, the real tension of the movie is between the brothers, who both help and constrain one another terribly, with Farinelli being especially held back by Riccardo. <br /> <br />This tension simmers throughout the movie and finally explodes in various climactic scenes. You will be enthralled to see how the relationship between these two men develops, changes and eventually disintegrates. <br /> <br />The actor who plays Farinelli is perfectly androgynous as a true castrato would be, and though he has some trouble with the lip-synching, he puts so much emotion into his part that it doesn't distract too much. Also, I did not find the sex scenes to be over-the-top as others have suggested. Remember, this is a European movie about a young, stirring European man, and the attitude toward sex in Europe is far less prude than ours tends to be in the U.S. This is definitely an erotic and passionate film, so be prepared for that. <br /> <br />This is a deep, complicated, beautiful movie about relationships, dependency, art, and music. It won the Golden Globe in '94 for best foreign film and was nominated for the Oscar in the same category. Enjoy.
0316172324|2.0|these ideas.  I'd recommend instead (or in addition to) \\"Art of What Works\\" by William Duggan.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is, in a few words, an indescribable tale of true love.  I've read a lot of romantic poems, stories, and seen a lot of movies, and this is one of the most powerful and beautiful tales of love I've found since William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet.  The way it is woven together speaks clearly of the vision of the story.  I do not want to give away the plot, for that would tarnish your viewing of it.  And that would be tragic.<br /><br />However, this movie is not what you expect, and from the casting to the soundtrack, exceeds any expectations wildly.  The story is timeless yet modern, and plays on all of our joys, our hopes, and fears... I cannot find words ample enough to give you a glimpse of this movie.  It is a work of art that has to be seen to be appreciated.  Enjoy it with a lover, or a good friend, or on your own.  You will be blown away.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Just to reiterate what others are saying, this is definitely the best Green Day yet. It's a shame that \\"American Idiot\\" is the main song played on the radio because it's probably the worst song on the album (and it's not like it's a bad song).
B0006GAI6O|2.0|I feel the original Japanese version of \\"Shall We Dance\\" had much more depth to the characters and the ballroom dancing sequences were much more elaborate as the actors actually appeared skilled in their dancing (not so much in the remake). I would highly recommend seeing the original to see what this remake was lacking. <br /> <br />The newer version with Richard Gere and J-Lo had a lot of quick editing in the dance sequences and the dancing did not seem as refined. Also Stanley Tucci's role was cute, but his counterpart in the original, Mr. Aoki was downright hilarious. I hope Hollywood stops trying to remake Asian movie hits....Tortilla Soup was very watered down compared to the original \\"Eat Man, Drink Woman\\" and the Hollywood version of \\"Shall We Dance\\" shows many \\"missed steps\\" compared to the original.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This is a great movie, Whitney Houston is as good of an actress as she is a singer. Its plot it great, the writing is great. I was in tears by the end of the movie. This is a superb love story. I love it, cant get enough of it
B0006M4SO6|4.0|(3 and 1/2 stars would be more accurate).  <br />Pat & Co. are back in fine form on the new 'This Way Up'. He and Lyle are writing some signature vamps and, while still not up to those heady days of the 'Offramp' / 'Letter from Home' period, this shows they still have the spark. There are no songs per se (like 'Have You Heard') that stick in your brain, and the loss of Paul Wertico from the Group is sorely missed, but hey...after 2 or 3 miserable group and/or solo projects, I'm jut grateful they hasn't lost it entirely. <br />Buy it!
B00000AFGM|5.0|its differnt then anti christ superstar because its like slower i guess but its very good album, it reminds me of deftones white pony cd its not as heavy but its amazing
B000053VJI|5.0|I can only echo the sentiments expressed in other reviews. Juan Luis Guerra has a unique sound and is one of the few artists who can claim to sounding really different and original.  The merengues have a folksy yet thoroughly modern quality that is very beguiling. Perhaps even more impressive are the gorgeous ballads. \\"Bachata Rosa\\", in particular, is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I find it impossible to listen to without a few tears coming down my face, especially with the associations I have with it.
B00008FC9O|5.0|this should be a dvd!!! - - it is just outstanding.  for all you who like \\"new\\" nick drake - this is a must have to see where he came from musically.....fantastic.
0743455967|5.0|I have no desire to become a writer and I've never read a single novel by Stephen King (not really into horror).  I read this book because I wanted to learn more about King and it's always good to hear a master talk about his craft.  This book succeeds on both accounts.  The autobiographical parts of the book are charming and insightful and the instructive sections contain bits of knowledge that anyone can use.  Now I will definitely read some of his novels.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I was asked in an interview for an art college what my favourite style of music is, and I gave an answer that seemed to perplex the guy asking the question in the first place. I said that I don't have a favourite genre or style because I appreciate and adore so many different styles. I like music that makes me dance, music that makes me think, music that makes me cry and music that makes me rejoice in the wonder of just being alive. Sarah McLachlan definitely fits into that latter category, because she makes music that is so poignant, so touching. Okay, so she makes 'safe' music that is appealing to radio and a mass audience, but there's nothing wrong with that in this case. Her music runs deeper, under your skin, and finds its home amongst your soul. With tranquil, peaceful music, she combines her angelic vocals to create some of the most beautiful music your heart will ever hear.<br /><br />I currently own five of Sarah's albums, and \\"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy\\" is still the best. \\"Surfacing\\" is also another superb effort, which brings me to her latest release, 2003's \\"Afterglow.\\" After a six year hiatus, Sarah returned with this beautiful album, which instantly sold millions in America and occupied the top spot of the album chart. Fans were not disappointed and neither were the critics. To be honest, after six years, we deserved something amazing, and that's exactly what we got with this album.<br /><br />The album opens with the massive radio hit \\"Fallen.\\" I believe that this would've been the title of the album were it not for Evanescence's album which was currently selling by the truck load at the same time. The song itself is a beautiful, mid-tempo song, similar in vein to Dido's \\"White Flag.\\" It has Sarah's trademark style, and sounds similar to the material from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. \\"World On Fire\\" is not much different in sound from its predecessor, but the lyrical matter is very different. She sings of the hatred and disruption in the world, the subject of a post-September 11th world playing a major role. \\"Stupid\\" is one of my favourites from the album, even though I didn't really like it very much to begin with. Sarah sings of being totally stupid in a relationship with a man, which has since ended. The song starts off very slow and melancholy, before breaking out into an almost rocking chorus as she wails, \\"How stupid could I be?!\\" The instruments used on this song are amazing, along with the haunting backing vocals. It's not a very long song, but definitely one of the most memorable. \\"Drifting\\" slows down the pace and introduces a gorgeous and soft ballad - the first on the album. The glowing introduction makes way for Sarah's passion-filled vocals as she sings of that somebody who has been drifting up above for so long, despite the fact that below them, there are many people who care for them. The piano on this song works superbly with the guitar to create easily one of my favourite ever Sarah songs.<br /><br />\\"Train Wreck\\" is even better than anything else on the album in my opinion, and it seriously borders on being so beautiful that sometimes I can hardly listen to it. I love how the song starts, so distant and far away but drawing closer. I don't know why, but the way Sarah controls her voice in the verses as she sings, \\"Would your love in all its finery tear at the darkness all around me?\\" makes me feel so fulfilled. Her voice is so pure and undiluted, and when you combine that with the imagery in lyrics such as \\"Would your eyes, like midnight fireflies, light up the trenches where my heart lies?\\" you have perfection. Sarah sings of being a complete wreck, emotionally, and that the person she is singing about (and to) is her total saviour. Halfway through the album, Sarah achieves total beauty. \\"Push\\" is another great slow ballad with some great lyrics. I really enjoy this song as it relaxes me no end, but there seems to be a bit too much emphasis on her voice when she sings, \\"I get mad so easy but yougive me room to breathe.\\" Sometimes she sounds a bit too 'off' for me, but overall it's another amazing song.<br /><br />\\"Answer\\" picks up from the last song and is just...indescribable. It's another beautiful, beautiful song with some soothing percussion in the background, accompanied by the piano. The way Sarah's voice echoes over the dark landscape of the song really brings about an atmosphere to the song. My favourite part is where she sings, \\"Cast me gently into morning, for the night has been unkind\\" because her voice seems so close, like you can feel it whispering in your ear. \\"Time\\" is another one of my favourites from this album because it has a distinctive quality to it which makes it one of Sarah's most accessible songs to date. The beauty of the song lies in the lyrics that are arranged to rhyme, like \\"Would you give me no choice in this, I know you can't resist.\\" The next song is \\"Perfect Girl\\" and is a little bit of a step down from the rest of the album in my opinion. However, Sarah's voice is definitely at its best here, especially when it rises on the word \\"Everything!\\" The album closes with \\"Dirty Little Secret.\\" From the title of this song you'd expect something a little bit more rockier or raunchier, but no, that ain't McLachlan's style! Again, it's another mid-tempo ballad, that does seem a little bit samey to the rest of the album, but the focus is definitely on Sarah's voice. When you have a voice like hers, you can sing anything and make it beautiful.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />I was rather surprised by how quickly I took to this album, because it actually took me a long time to appreciate \\"Solace\\" and \\"Surfacing.\\" There was something about the modern quality of these amazing songs which made them click with me. I love every song from the first song to the eighth song, but the final two seem to taper off a bit. I'm not sure if that's just me (it probably is) but I am very impressed with this album because it's just so beautiful. If I ever want to feel relaxed or comforted by music I will put this album on. If you disagree then you need to listen to it more. If you still have problems accepting it then you obviously have problems accepting the raw beauty of the female voice! Amazing, buy it now..\\" Sometimes she sounds a bit too 'off' for me, but overall it's another amazing song.     \\"Answer\\" picks up from the last song and is just...indescribable.

0156027321|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've read in the past year.  You will fall in love with Pi and feel what he feels through all of his unlikely adventures- sometimes wondrous and sometimes horrifying.  Martel is a master storyteller and he will push and pull you with the flow of the story.  Strangely, this book reminded me of an existential version of Carl Sagan's \\"Contact\\".  My only advice would be to skip most of the other reviews since many of them contain semi-spoilers.  Just pick up the book and enjoy.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have waited so long to review this album that now the time has come I don't know where to begin - I'm gobsmacked. This is the reaction I also get every time I listen to the album. I don't know how good this will be, but I'll try anyway...<br /><br />After the success of their massive second album \\"The Bends,\\" Radiohead returned two years later in 1997 with the undeniable masterpiece that is \\"OK Computer.\\" The band had matured considerably from their debut \\"Pablo Honey\\" to that second album, which shocked and took many Radiohead fans by surprise. Nothing would prepare them for OK Computer, though. It arrived in May 1997 like an atomic bomb, exploding into the music industry with a fire not seen since the 1970's. It became Radiohead's first UK No.1 album where it went on to sell by the truckload. Everyone was raving over this album, and for once, all that raving was rightly justified. Within six months of its release, a nationwide poll conducted by Q Magazine hailed it as the Greatest Album Ever Made. At first this sounds ridiculous, but after you think about it, it becomes scarily reasonable.<br /><br />What Radiohead achieved with this album was the first album of the new millennium: this was what music would be like in the future. It would be illustrious, modern, ground-breaking and fresh. Whilst that hasn't come true, this album portrays a vision of a high-tech industrial society going through some monumental changes. This is not only reflected in the music on the album, but also in Thom Yorke's abstract lyrical content and the beautiful, intricate album art work.<br /><br />The album opens with the stunning \\"Airbag.\\" I don't have a favourite song on this album because they're nearly all amazing, and if I were to try and pick one it would change every week. However, at the moment, this song is my favourite. I am always in awe at the way this song is constructed - it is a tapestry of beautiful guitars, vocals and drum-beats. Yorke sings of a metaphorical car crash where an airbag saves his life. Musically speaking, he is preparing the listener for the next 11 songs. The part where the stuttering guitars start to creep in at 1:18 is amazing - it's the deep breath before the plunge, and when it submerges you at 1:32 behind Yorke's vocals you close your eyes and experience Heaven. Look at the cover of this album as those guitars soar up and down in sync with his voice and there will be no doubt in your mind that you are hearing one of the greatest songs ever recorded.<br /><br />\\"Paranoid Android\\" is widely regarded as the greatest Radiohead song of all time. It's the Bohemian Rhapsody of the 1990's, with good reason. At over six minutes long, it is divided into three sections, constantly switching (effortlessly, I might add) from psychotic jittering to harmonious melancholy. I'm trying hard to describe this masterpiece in more detail, but I can't find the words - just listen for yourself. \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" was my favourite song on the album when I first bought it because of the gorgeous soundscapes that cling to the song. I've heard artists attempt this kind of expanse on songs to try and elevate the song to an epic scale, but no one has quite achieved it as successfully as Radiohead on this song. It's so amazing, so complex. \\"Exit Music (For A Film)\\" is another superb song. As the Soundtrack to Romeo & Juliet, this haunting ballad runs the Cardigans \\"Lovefool\\" into the ground! Thom's vocals are incredibly emotional here and the lyrics are so powerful: \\"Pack and get dressed, before your father hears us. Before all Hell...breaks loose.\\" Yorke achieves something with this song that makes it more compatible with Shakespeare's drama than any film could ever achieve, before an almighty climax at 3:21 lifts the song higher and higher into the atmos.<br /><br />\\"Let Down\\" contrasts this with beautiful and warm guitars. The way the vocals are made to reflect the music is amazing, making this a naturally feel-good rock anthem. It blossoms and unfolds on itself, with a gorgeous instrumental in the middle of the song, before closing as if flickering lights are gently dying out. Five minutes of real music right there. \\"Karma Police\\" is one of my favourite songs from the album with its pounding and relentless drum beats. The lyrics are abstract and funny, political and obviously prophetic. The song manages to achieve the effect of crumpling and reshaping itself around 2:30 with the shift of the song, where Yorke starts wailing, \\"For a minute there, I lost myself! Phew, for a minute there, I lost myself!\\" The sounds that pound into your ears as the song draws to close achieve the feeling of a grand climax. \\"Fitter Happier\\" is the album's only duff track. It's the 2-minute computer-voice interlude that most fans find annoying. However, it serves as the voice of this society which Radiohead are trying to get across about a lifestyle which is so false and fake, spoken through a computer.<br /><br />\\"Electioneering\\" is a fantastic, upbeat song with loud guitars that prick your ears with heavy drum beats. This is the kind of music that you could expect on a crazy advert, and it sounds almost 60's in its approach. It's a real head-banger with some misunderstood but catchy lyrics. This is contrasted by the harsh darkness of \\"Climbing Up The Walls.\\" Yorke apparently visited an insane asylum and used this experience as the inspiration for this song. It's very scary with dark lyrics, muffled vocals and hair-raising guitars. There are also small alien-like sounds that puncture the surface of the song relentlessly. The song's peak comes at the fourth minute as Yorke screams with such vigour that you feel every nerve in your body electrified. Amazing. This is then contrasted again with the simplistic, melodic beauty of \\"No Surprises.\\" Using a simple keyboard, Radiohead manage to create one of the most relaxing and comforting songs I've ever heard. Yorke's vocals wrap themselves around you in a warm embrace as you succumb to a lullaby-style of the song.<br /><br />There are only two songs left on the album, and they are really amazing. A part of what makes this album so good are these final two tracks. Where a lot of albums place all the good material at the beginning and leave the ending with filler tracks, Radiohead make sure that the listener experiences this masterpiece in its entirety. \\"Lucky\\" is a great song with a strange intro that sound dissipates as the chorus fires up. It bursts out as Yorke wails \\"Pull me out of the aircrash! Pull me out of the lake. I'm your superhero. We are standing on the edge.\\" This song is one of the album's highlights, but it cannot be topped by the final song, \\"The Tourist.\\" This is the only song that could end the album because it just feels right, like the album has come first circle and has landed. The verses are beautiful and the chourses striking in their honesty. Yorke sings, \\"Hey man, slow down. Idiot slow down.\\" Everything that has occurred in the past eleven songs are brought to a gradual halt and you know that as the song finishes with one gentle ping that this is an album you'll love for a lifetime.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />If you haven't heard this album then you must. If you hate this album then you're a fool. I'm sorry to say it, because I'm usually so laid-back in people's tastes, but this is real music right here. It's the centre of beauty and if you can't recognise that then I pity you! This was the first Radiohead album I bought back in July 2004 and I've waited six months to review it, since I wanted to review all of their albums in order. This is easily in my Top 5 albums of all time and I think it always will be. I know it must sound like such a horrible clich&eacute;, but you really must own this album. There's a reason why it has more than 1,500 reviews on this site. Experience the real Radiohead now, OK?l-good rock anthem.

B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of the best albums Eminem has made. He really expressed him self in a way that only he can. A lot of people think that the lyrics are to explicit. In my opinion despite the explicit lyrics this is his best album so far.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|This is an absolutely wonderful comedy starring James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich with Kirk Hammet in a riveting supporting role . This is comedy at its best. Three prima donnas who've got the world by the balls complaining about how difficult life is. The three most vain , self absorbed , egocentric men ( men ? ) in rock and roll. I'm a huge fan of Kill Em All , RTL and MOP , but im sick and tired of hearing these three whiney washwomen complian about everything from Napster to Jethro Tull. Grow up boys ... there are a growing number of us fans who are absolutley disgusted ( and amazed ) at seeing three grown men act like 12 year olds girls. Do ya think you could possibly take your faces out of your handkechiefs long enough to put a decent album out ?
1881273156|5.0|Chapman's book, the Five Love Languages was recommended to me by a friend.  At first I was hesitant to pick up the book because in all reality my marriage is fine.  However, being of the mindset that things can always be better, my wife and I decided that getting the book wouldn't hurt anything. <br /> <br />As I read through the book, a lot of what he had to say made sense in a logical fashion, especially as I thought about my own relationship with my wife and as I looked at other couples we know.  There are different ways of expressing love and not all of those ways are interpreted the same by all people.  It's a matter of determining which actions are going to be interpreted as being expressions and acting accordingly.  When people are acting in ways that will be interpreted as expressions of love, then the partner in the relationship feels love.  In many ways, what it boils down to is how to effectively communicate with your partner that you love him or her and recognizing that actions speak louder than words (unless of course the love \\"language\\" is words of affirmation). <br /> <br />Chapman peppers the book with examples of couples that were rescued from the brink of divorce to illustrate the power of the love languages.  In some cases the examples seem a little too extreme to be true, but even if those examples were false, they still serve an effective function which is to get the reader excited about the possiblity of being able to communicate more effectively with the partner.  So, the examples, while I initially shook my head and said, \\"yeah right\\" in the end made me think that perhaps there is some merit to his ideas.  Ultimately I have yet to have a chance to really try them out and see what happens, but I don't see that there is any harm trying. <br /> <br />There might be some complaints about his basing the ideas in religion and using the Bible to back up certain points in the book.  Personally, I wasn't bothered by the basis in Christianity.  It is necessary to have something from which to formulate the initial ideas and I can see where Chapman effectively used the Bible to support his contentions.  If the mention of Christianity is something that would bother a reader, they probably shouldn't pick up the book, but if the mentioning of Christianity is viewed as either supporting a basic thesis to begin with or is wholeheartedly embraced then the book is something that is worth reading.   <br /> <br />If his contentions are accurate, that we all have different ways of understanding expressions of love, then this book is a must read for you if you are in anyway hoping to improve your marriage.  This recommendation comes with the caveat that if you can't or won't read past a religious basis, then don't pick up this book.
B000000H4V|5.0|simply put...the masterpiece...and surprisingly it was'nt delivered by JAMES! Let me see...this album blew everybody's mind (in 93 when it was released)and no other metal released since will ever top it?
0385336810|5.0|most people that pick up this book will have previously read one or all of the shoppaholic series featuring the bumbly and sweet yet spineless becky bloomwood. though i laughed at the first one, the following two just tired me out. i began wondering if this is all sophie kinsella knew how to write, even if i found myself relating to becky a bit...    then she comes out with this book. i initially purchased it when it first came out but didn't crack it open until just the other night. folks... i just could not put it down! the alarm was ringing and i just decided to skip the world altogether, i was so engrossed into this book.    this book isn't going to change the face of modern fiction, but it will definately make you smile and put a nice fuzzy feeling in your heart. i absolutely *adore* all of kinsella's male characters, even the blindly clueless yet incredibly sweet connor. luke brandon (of shoppaholic) and now jack harper - these men are quiet stoic types - totally the type i *love*. but emma is... so much more different from becky. becky will scrape the magnet strip off her plastic just to get her hands on whatever fancies her eyes whereas emma will be far more frugal and purchase what she wants as long as it's within her budget and at a local thrift store. becky has a serious addictive issue with spending and can't control herself whereas emma struggles to maintain a job and attempts to get promoted. where becky hides behind everything and loses control in her own life, emma, though she has similar struggles, attempts to get a hold of herself, realizing that, perhaps, releasing all those secrets - however mundane and trivial they are (like, \\"i'm a size 8, not 4\\") - allows herself to be more forthright and honest to those around her with each passing sequence of events.    i loved emma so much more and jack was adorable. as a character, i believe sophie kinsella has much more potential with creating a delicious character with emma and her roommates, the brainyand creative lissy and the spiteful and revenge-hungry jemima (would love to see a spinoff books on them)!! should she decide to do an \\"emma\\" series, i'd be the first in line and can't *wait* to see what, i hope, will become the \\"chronicles of emma corrigan\\".    simply put - i love emma because she gets a backbone. the world is spinning around her yet she manages to catch herself and do something about it. becky feels like a slimy jellyfish in comparison to emma.
B000000H3W|5.0|This album rocks or should I say thrashes.  This album is a great follow up to BTR.  I compare them a lot to Metallica even though Metallica is better.  I hate to think that they both became watered down.  They both stink as of now.  I can only pray that they improve in the future.  We'll have to wait and see.
B00005JM0B|1.0|First of all, dont expect too much! <br />As a big fan of Terminator 1 + 2, i was absolutely dissapointed of Terminator 3. This Movie has a lot of cool actionscenzes but the soul of the terminator movies was not included. Jonathan Mostow did a bad job. Because of... I dont remember that the Terminator was a clown!?!? There were too many jokes the Terminator did speak out...I expect from a Terminator movie a serious Killermachine without joking, like in the Part 1 + 2! That was a big mistake wich Jonathan Mostow did. He didnt realise that this is a Killermachine and not a Clown!!!!!  <br />Anyhow..this movie has a lot of cool actionscense/SFX and the story was OK! Alltogehter this movie is dissapointing ...for a NONE TERMINATOR FAN, this movie could be interessting..Hopefully T4 (2006) will be much better... <br /> <br />
B000003C4K|5.0|Great album!  Souza was better than Baloff.  However, I can respect Baloff with his uncanny lyrics and vocals.  Gary and Rick do a great job dropping the solos and riffs.  For some reason I can't hear Rob's bass that well.  It's not bad.  Tom's drums are good as usual.  This album is a thrash classic that all Exodus fans should have.  It's up there with Kill'em All, Show No Mercy, Fistful of Metal and Killing is my business.  Overall, as a thrash head I'm quite satisfied.  In the end, it comes down to your decision.
B00006RCNW|4.0|Cop dramas have been with us since the days of radio, first there was \\"Dragnet\\", \\"Police Story\\" in the 70's, \\"Hill Street Blues\\" in the 80's, and \\"NYPD Blue\\" in the 90's. With each decade the format has grown and changed, usually for the better. Along with \\"The Wire\\", \\"The Shield\\" has not only evolved the format for this new milliuium, it has turned it on its ear. Characters are flawed. The good guys aren't always good and the bad guys may not be that bad. In \\"The Shields\\" first season we're introduced to a broken down sub section of L.A. where a dilapidated precicent struggles with success, failure, and corruption. <br /> <br />Much like \\"Hill Street Blues\\", we follow the work of beat cops, detectives, a strike team, and the precinct's Captain. Michael Chiklis plays Vic, head of the departments counter strike team. It is usually Chiklis' tough domineering mug we see when the show is promoted and it's easy to think that this show is nothing more than a testosterone fueled hour of blazing bullets. In reality the show is far more melodramatic, there's a rookie cop who can't admit he's gay...even to his boyfriend, a arrogant but smart police detective who craves the respect he thinks he deserves, an ambitious precinct Captain who has his eye on a city council seat, and of course there's Vic's task force; who bully there way through the streets of L.A., planting evidence on suspects as quickly as they place on the cuffs. <br /> <br />\\"The Shield\\" leans towards shock value (maybe too much with victims getting their feet nailed to floors and pedophiles who trade kids like baseball cards). Even the last few episodes of the first season looks like Faluja Street Blues, but for the most part these moments of jaw dropping awe usually kick-start each show before the blaring Latino music pounds away and a broken police badge reassembles itself with the opening title. What makes this show really work is how it creates complicated characters that we end up caring for. Vic is a corrupt cop that should be off the street, but then you imagine the streets without him and you see that even a corrupt cop has his place. It's dark thinking like that which you don't expect from a police drama and that's when \\"The Shield\\" shines.   <br />
B000000H3Z|5.0|I believe this is Sepultura's best album.  I love Arise but BTR is better musically.  They're thrash all the way but manage to change the riffs and avoid monotony.  Not many thrash bands do that.  This is probably their classic.  It's their Reign in Blood.
0553296981|5.0|This diary has done great good. The story of one young Jewish girl's living in hiding, and surviving with her family during the Holocaust has perhaps been read more than any other diary in history. The story is not only of survival in everyday life, but of the growing pains of one young adolescent girl. This girl is however a person of remarkable, insight, intelligence and spirit. That she was among one of the more than million Jewish children whose lives were taken from them before they had a chance to live suggests how incomparably great this loss  was and is. Anne Frank has become a symbol of humanity's contending with evil, and at the same time retaining its humanity. Her faith that in the end ' people are good at heart' in the face of the experience she knew can be an inspiration to all of us who looking at the evils of the world today , need to hope that a better world and a kinder humanity will be our future.<br /><br />It is horrible to know that the monstrous Nazi European anti- Semitism which took the life of Anne Frank has now become a major element in the anti- Western Jihad which a part of the Islamic world is now engaged in.<br /><br />Would that the lesson of Anne Frank's life and loss be that instead of hating each other we all learn to be kinder and more considerate towards our fellow human beings.

B000002GVO|5.0|The title track was one the Eagles' all-time best,undoubtedly. On the cover,we see the band in a hotel lobby with many other guests. Other hits include NEW KID IN TOWN,LIFE IN THE FAST LANE and VICTIM OF LOVE. Eventually,Glenn Frey and Don Henley,the band's drummer would pursue solo careers of their own. Frey and Henley are the Lennon and McCartney of the Eagles. Frey takes the lead on NKIT. Henley takes the lead on the title track,LITFL,WASTED TIME,VOL and THE LAST RESORT. The other songs are good. There's also an instrumental and classical reprise of WT which is 1 minute and 22 seconds in length. Some tracks were recorded live for the 1994 reunion concert album HELL FREEZES OVER.

B0006399FS|1.0|How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb swells with far less assurance. A seven-nation army couldn't get the bluesoid riff of \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" across; more to the point, the title threat's too coy to specifically finger the love-and-peace deficient. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own,\\" purportedly an elegy for Bono's recently deceased dad, begs for the empathy U2 once effortlessly summoned. The lyric sheet is a battleground where flowers of occasional eloquence (\\"I would never take a chance/Of losing love to find romance\\") are trampled by legions of rampant clichs (\\"You were pretty as a picture\\"). And some nifty harmonic guitar clanging on \\"Vertigo\\" hardly counters my suspicion that the chorus's original lyrics went, \\"We need a single.\\"  <br /> <br />How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is a one-paced affair, enamoured with drawn-out ambient intros, crystalline guitars layered with reverb, four-note rumbles for basslines, choruses that go on forever and occasional, half-hearted stabs at \\"groove\\". Meaning that it sounds EXACTLY as you would expect U2 to sound. This album pretend to be \\"classic U2 sound\\". Strained and dated perceptions of the nebulous concept of \\"soul\\" still infect Bono's vocal delivery (listen to the hideously overplayed rasp of that line on the Band Aid 20 single). <br /> <br />Alone among bands, U2 convinced millions they could fill the bottomless chasm of meaning to the very brim with nothing but their own collective hugeness. Shame on U2. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005AQE8|5.0|this album is a classic not like you hear today how the word classic is being thrown around today. like you can say movies like cindarella, the little mermaid, casablanca, were all classics because at one point on that time that song had really great moments in its time and were inspiring in a way. but you cannot call a music album such as scarface and his it song my block because it raelly wasnt big or enough to call it classic besides the fact that it is old. so please think about it before you throw in the word classic when you desribe something.

1401301010|4.0|I feel that Publisher's Weekly missed the point of this book when they said Kiedis devotes too few pages to his music and too many to his drugs and women.  <br />Having read the book, it appears to me that while the book is biographic in its nature, his motivation in writing it was to explain to others the dangers of drugtaking so that they could be disuaded from it and also to help himself stay clean as part of his 12-step programme. <br />I feel that his music represents something that saved him from drug-taking and a vehicle to express some of the emotions that the drugs induced- it is not the focus of the book in any way, and he might well argue that it has not been the centre of his life either. Readers hoping for deep musical analysis should look elsewhere.

B000001EGA|4.0|This CD (minus the three bonus tracks) is a concept album detailing Elton's earliest beginnings up through meeting lyrical collaborator Bernie Taupin and recording their first album (1969's \\"Empty Sky\\"). For those who only know \\"chart\\" Elton John, don't take the fact that only \\"Someone Saved my Life Tonight\\" graced the pop charts to mean this is a bland effort. This is songcraft of the highest order.<br /><br />If it's so good, why did I not give it 5 stars you may ask? I do so because several songs, while excellent, don't have as much \\"punch\\" if you don't know the background..they're a little TOO personal, lacking the touch of the universal that informs the finest songs, the ones that speak to generation after generation. I would place \\"Meal Ticket\\", \\"Captain Fantastic..\\", and \\"Better Off Dead\\" in that category.<br /><br />Highlights of the album for me are the songplugger lament of \\"Bitter Fingers\\", \\"Someone saved my Life tonight\\", \\"Tower of Babel\\" and \\"Captain Fantastic\\" (which I just appreciated as a piece of surrealism until I was able to understand it as autobiographical..).<br /><br />For those complaining about the bonus tracks, they are \\"bonus\\" because they weren't ever meant to be part of the album itself. If it bugs you so much that they exist, program them out of the lineup! Taken as individual songs, Elton's version of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" (with Lennon on guitar) is welldone and gets playful with a reggae bridge that works. It's one of the few covers that doesn't pale in comparison with the original. \\"One Day at a Time\\" was a B-side at the time, and it's clear why. It's just not a compelling tune. \\"Philadelphia Freedom\\", John and Taupin's tribute to the \\"Philadelphia sound\\" of R&B producers like Thom Bell in the 70s, succeeds in spades. It sold over 2 million at the time as a single and still sounds great.<br /><br />Elton hit higher heights with TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION and DON'T SHOOT ME, I'M ONLY THE PIANO PLAYER but this is certainly one of his best ever.
B0002SROT0|4.0|Shooting Star gets my vote for the best rock song of 2004.  <br /> <br />I only know one person who doesn't like this album, and he really sucks.
B0000019PA|3.0|You simply have to adore the effort and passion that Jeff Magnum & co. put into this record.  However, this is not masterpiece.  I agree with the reviewer who said that hipsters cling to this record for its obscurity and the fact that most (all) mainstream music fans will find it impenetrable.  I'm not bashing this album, I think it's quite good.  \\"King of Carrot Flowers Pt.1\\" \\"Aeroplane over the Sea\\" and \\"Two-Headed Boy Pt.2\\" are very well-written songs whose effects carry over well after the album is over.  Jeff Magnum's voice, though, strives to reach notes that simply aren't there for him, and the production is so lo-fi that it's painful to listen to at times.  Anyone with instruments and $1500 can buy a Boss BR-1180 and have production 100x better than this.  I honestly enjoy this band and this album, but it's just NOT worth 5 stars (save that for Disintegration).  I recommend the Decemberists, they play folk-pop in the same vein as NMH, but with much better production, lyrics, singing, and instrumentation.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  Every song on here is amazing.  Vedders voice rises to the occasion and Stone Gossard's guitar playing is amazing.  It is hard to beleve that most of these songs were written within a week of these guys forming the band.  The only flaw that I can think of is the recording itself.  I don't know exactly what it is but their later releases had a direct and immediate sound.  No biggie though, cause the songs more than make up for it.  This was also the period when they got alot of bad press about riding on Nirvana's bandwagon.  I thought that was unfair because there were plenty of differences between their music and a lot of bands benefited from Nirvana's success.  Listening to songs like Once, Black, Alive, Jeremy, Porch, Garden and Deep you can't help being struck by the sheer depth of their music.  Will always be in my collection.  An absolute essential album to own.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Many people have described the epic sweep of this album better than I ever will. <br /> <br />I came late as a Radiohead fan. I had been put off by the horrible, chugging alterna-rock-by-numbers of 'Pablo Honey' (in general) and 'Creep' (in particular). It was not until I gave 'Hail to the Thief' a chance 10 years later that I saw that there was, plainly, much more to this band. <br /> <br />... so I've been working my way through Radiohead's back catalogue and I'm impressed. I like this album the most. It's about as far removed from 'Creep' as 'Love Me Do' is removed from 'I am the Walrus'. <br /> <br />Recommended to any fan of pop music with scale & grandeur, and The Beatles.
B000003TA4|5.0|1991.  I was 12 years old and had no interest in music what so ever.  Then I heard Smells Like Teen Spirit and it changed everything.  Its a time I will never forget.  Nothing sounded better at the time.  These loud angry songs that just allowed you space to just loose it.  All the songs are great and all have something to give. Time has not diminished the power of this album.  Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, and Lithium only scratch the surface of what you will hear.  Lounge Act, Drain You, Stay Away, and Breed are amazing powerful songs.  And Something In The Way, a nice, quiet and beautiful song.  An interesting way to end an album that brought anger and passion back into rock.  Rarely does an album come out that changes everything so completely.  This is one to those rare albums that did it.  Just like people still talk about Highway 61 Revisited by Bob Dylan or Sgt. Pepper by the Beatles fourty years from now people will still be talking about Nevermind.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Playing like an \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\" on speed, \\"Saw\\" is a no holds barred terror ride that lets you know right away anything can and probably will happen. <br /> <br />The title \\"Saw\\" comes from the name \\"Jigsaw\\", the name given to the serial killer who actually does not kill his victims, but instead finds ways to get them to kill themelves by placing them in scenarios by which if they do not perform certain tasks -- they will die. <br /> <br />A sample scenario: A mechanical vice has been strapped to your head.  Similar to a large bear trap that works in reverse, you need to get this thing off your head in 60 seconds or when it goes off -- it'll rip your head apart.  Sounds simple, right?  Oh, did I mention the key to unlock the trap is in the stomach of the man lying on the floor in front of you? <br /> <br />Yeah... it's that twisted. <br /> <br />A must see for any self repsecting horror film fan. <br /> <br />
B00003CXC7|3.0|\\"Rear Window\\" is an excellent thriller by the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.  All throughout the film, the audience becomes a willing accomplice to a peeping tom.  The audience watches the main character's nieghbors right alongside the main character. <br /> <br />L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair due to a bad accident in which Jeffries nearly lost his life.  It was a car accident, occuring as Jeffries tries to get a picture of a car racing, but the race car ends up coming apart just as Jeffries takes his picture. <br /> <br />Needless to say, Jeffries gets injured and his camera gets broken.  He has broken his leg, preventing him from being able to get out of his apartment.  These days, when that happens, someone might take to spending his time watching television.  However, this film takes place in the 50's, when television was just coming into it's own.  As a matter of fact, at the time, advertising companies generally were not agreeing with thier clents as to whether or not to advertise on television.  The advertising companies thought television was doomed. <br /> <br />Hence we have the reason why Jeffries ends up spending his time watching the nieghbors.  He has nothing else to do.  He makes up his own name for each of them.  There is a woman he calls Miss Torso, who dances all the time.  There is Miss Lonelyhearts , who cries herself to sleep every night.  Then there is the travelling salesman, who Jeffries becomes very concerned about. <br /> <br />Turns out the salesman's wife is bed-ridden.  Then why is no one paying attention to her?  Why is it the salesman is wrapping such bizarre things as knives, and in newspaper? <br /> <br />The film is certered around this mystery, and the audience becomes a peeping tom themselves as they try to unravel the mystery alongside Jeffries. <br /> <br />What I am trying to point out here is that the film is entertaining, but, like all Hitchcock films, it requires a different sort ofattention span than a modern day film does.  Sure, the film is about the same length as modern films usually are, but ;modern films have to have something exciting happen often, something usually in which the main character's life is threatened.  Take for example \\"I Robot.\\"  The character played by Will Smith cannot go more than twenty minutes before he has problems with the androids in that movie. <br /> <br />Unlike \\"I Robot\\" \\"Rear Window\\" has the ability to just focus on the mystery and the development of the characters it has.  This is not to say that the film is not interesting.  Trying to unravel the mystery to \\"Rear Window\\" is fun, even though it means becoming a nieghborhood watchdog like Jeffries. <br /> <br />Also, considering the year the film was made, the portrayal of the woman in the film is somewhat sympathetic, like in other Hitchcock classics including \\"The Man Who Knew too Much.\\"  Films from around the time, such as\\"The Three Faces of Eve\\" have a tendency to look at all semi- strong woman as either loony or dangerous.  \\"Rear Window,\\" however, has a very sympathetic strong female character in the form of Lisa (Grace Kelly).  She goes with the nurse to dig up the plot of ground Jeffries believes the wife is buried in.  She is the one who goes and gives Mr. Thorwald's apartment (Raymond Burr, known to television audiences as Perry Mason) and even breaks intoThorwald's apartment, an event that becomes pivotal to the story in a way I will not mention, through a second story window while wearing high-heels. <br /> <br />In other words, the women of the story make up for Mr. Jeffries' weakness. <br /> <br />These are all reasons why \\"Rear Window\\" has stood the test of time.  Although there are also other reasons, the film is fun to watch if you don't have to have something exciting happen every few minutes in order for the film to keep your attention.  The mystery to the film makes watching \\"Rear Window\\" a lot of fun.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I must admit when I first heard the idea of Tom Cruise playing a hit-man, I thought it might be an example of miscasting, much like Tom Hanks in Road To Perdition (Hanks was good but it was still hard to accept him in that role).  But Cruise continues to surprise with his versatility as an actor and you can see him get better with each film he does.  His steely-eyed professional contract killer is intense in every sense of the word and combine that with Jamie Foxx's terrific performance and you have the makings of a very good film.    Foxx plays Max, a nice guy cab driver who longs to have his own company but dreams about it more than actually doing anything.  He ends up picking up a fare called Vincent(Cruise), who is impressed by Max's knowledge of the streets and routes around Los Angeles.  As they are driving to the first location, Vincent makes an offer to Max he can't refuse--a ton of money if he will stay with him all-night as he makes 5 stops.  At first Max refuses (he could get fired), then changes his mind when he sees all the money but even then he is not totally comfortable with the idea.  But what Max doesn't know as he waits for Vincent at the first stop is that he is a contract killer hired by a drug lord to wipe out 5 people involved in an upcoming criminal trail against him.  All that changes when the first victim decides to jump out of the window onto the Max's taxi.  He's dead and Max starts feaking out.  Vincent regrets that Max had to find out what his job entails and now has to use a gun to get a reluctant Max to finish out the night.  The plot really picks up and never lets down after that great scene that sets up the rest of the movie.    Even though the basic plot is quite simplistic, there are other things going on in film, which, in my mind, elevate the film beyond the ordinary.  You find out the motivation behind Vincent and why he became the man he is and how this ties in with Max and how his life is not everything he thinks it is.  These are not the things of a by-the-book thriller and I found that aspect very interesting.  Vincent is not faceless madman with no humanity and Max is the not the totally great guy we are lead to believe in the beginning.      The first thing that struck me about the film was the unique look.  The cinematography, which is beautiful but very dark, adds greatly to the atmosphere--it's almost like another character in itself.  It really grabs you and pulls you into the story.  And Michael Mann's direction is sure and steady, keeping the action coming just when things appear to be slowing down.  Mann keeps proving himself as one of the best directors out there.    While Collateral proves itself as an above-average thriller, I was let down somewhat by the conventional ending.  Up to that point I felt the film was very unique, but the ending seemed to drawn from every other film of the genre. Still the film packs a great punch and features two great performances by the lead actors.
6305897786|4.0|I ws not expecting anything when first viewed this movie late at night.   But I soon became aware of  sinister plot by the producer to build a crescendo of surprise all along the way.  Each event leads to another thrilling episode in the quest of this book dealer.  Even he is surprised at the sequence and occurence of events tht have been laid in his path.  Johnny Depp is very good in this role. Not many actors could have pulled this off.  I still am a bit entrigued about the ending.  Not sure what he finally did but looks like he made a deal with the devil.  It is a great story and everyone should watch it but don't leave the tv as each event leads up to another and the story never dies in the middle but follows a definite narrative all the way thru.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I was so impressed with this set that I purchased 2 extra copies to send to my brothers!  It just seems like set after set of great music.  I think that the variety of guitar playing styles represented gives a fantastic cross section of the the types of music available.  I am not a big fan of Country music, but Vince Gill plays a mean guitar!  I didn't care much for the Indian music (Vishwa Mohan Bhatt), or John McLaughlin's set (sorry, everyone is entitled to an opinion), but the rest of the set was incredible.
B000089RV6|5.0|I remember being 13 years old when this album came out, and everyone talking about it at school. 5 years later I was singing in a rock band and trying to sound like Brian Johnson. This is still on of the great rock albums of all time, in any format.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|First off, I am a film maker, for the most part a horror/suspense film maker. I love when movies like \\"Saw\\" are released simply because it gives a twist on todays film indistry. I must say, seeing the trailer for \\"Saw\\" the first time, I thought it looked like another slash em up movie on a first date kind of level, but was I ever wrong! \\"Saw\\" is an absolute miraclous film. I was amazed by it. In the beggining I admit it seems like a pointless reason to throw blood around, but give it time, it starts to get good and twisted fast. This was director James Wan's debut and I must say I am right proud of this young man. The movie is superb in every way except its acting. I'm sorry, I apoligiese to those who are true critics because the acting in this movie is not all that believable, yet the movie itself makes up for it. I would have to recomend this movie to every horror fan out there, but be warned, not for the faint of heart. But all in all you should find yourself guessing, sweating, breathing heavier, and wide eyed from first frame to the masterpiece of a twist. The best twist since \\"The Sixth Sense\\" no lie. \\"Saw\\" is a great film and if only its acting was imrpoved this would limp away with an easy **** 4 stars. From Horror/Suspense Writer/Director Matt M. Thank you.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Okay, I don't have any mind-blowing analytical takes on Norah's Jones' debut CD.  All i can say it that this is a great CD and she deserved each of the 5 Grammys she won for it.  Her melodies, lyrics, and voice are so relaxing and inspirational.  I know her lyrics dont' exactly express poetic epiphanies of life, just observations of a young woman loving and living her life--that's what I got from it atleast.  It's also nice that this is a CD you can never get tired of!! I was a little disappointed that Norah Jones didn't write as much of her material as I expected, but I was thrilled that she did write \\"Come Away With Me\\" because that is one of the greatest love songs I have ever heard! I love her details like wanting to go away with her lover on a bus and sleep listening to rain on a tin roof.  WONDERFUL!
1404325204|5.0|Pollyanna, published in 1913, became an instant classic when it was first published, selling over one million copies within months.  The books is still popular today among elementary and high school students.  I enjoyed this classic even after the ninety-two years since it was published. <br /> <br />  I'm guessing the readers out there already have a basic foundation of what Pollyanna is about, so I'm going to explain some things that other reviewers that gave this classic a low rating failed to mention. <br /> <br />1) The ignorant reviewers seem to think that the character Pollyanna was too similar to Anne Shirley (a character I loved).  Well, this may be true BUT, the majority of female characters from the early 1900's were your Annes and Pollyanna, perky young girls who tried to look on the bright side of everything. <br /> <br />2)  An assumingly young reviewercomplained of the books spelling.  Well, by the time I finished reading your review, I was thinking \\"digraceful\\". <br /> <br />  I just don't know what these people have aggainst Pollyanna.  Yes she's kinda like Anne, but personally I found her to be more interesting.  But then again, I haven't read \\"Anne\\" since the fourth grade. <br /> <br />  I would recommend Pollyanna for ages 8-12 (And up) and Anne of Green Gables for ages 12 and up.  I encourage you to check both of these books out. <br /> <br />R
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|I heard this cd when it first came out and i thought i would be better. It had singles like \\"My Band\\" and \\"How Come\\" but not as good as I thought. Eminem bust out some good lyrics but the cds just isn't that good. Not worth the money $$$
B00006M183|3.0|I only review this because I feel like I can be a means to the two extremes.  Despite my best friends antics I think Cameron is doing a great job with Pearl Jam, and accomplishing things Irons couldn't; this is evident in the opening track, which I love by the way.  My problem with this album greatly lies on \\"Love Boat Captain\\" and \\"Thumbing my way\\"... as earlier said, Vedder sounds in the ditches(possibly intentionally) and may be attempting something Dylan-esque, which doesn't pass the test for me, but may for others.  The highlights for my tastes are easily \\"Cropduster\\" and \\"You are\\"... well written and versed; I love \\"the Police\\" influence on Cropduster, and the guitar/ear delay challenge of \\"You Are\\"!  Over all, if you enjoyed \\"No Code\\", \\"Binaural\\" as well as \\"Vs.\\" I would still definatelly recomend this album.  To me though it's another shame that an artist has to politically isolate himself to his audience... this obviously was the case in why Riot Act was so dark... but it also means he won't be selling records to Colin Powell, Tommy Franks or even Ralph Nader for that matter (Gee, think he cares?). <br />
B00065LY1I|4.0|Kylie Minogue has released yet another greatest hits package.  However, this one promises to be the most comprehensive one yet, as the title suggests.  What we are treated to is a two-disc collection that spans her entire catalogue.  Disc 1 has her early material which skyrocketed her to fame in the world outside the US.  Disc 2 has her more recent material (early 90's to the present) which includes songs from the Fever and Body Language albums (the only two to be released in the US besides her debut).   <br /> <br />Sadly, the songs of disc 1 did not age well at all.  In fact, I'd dare say that except for a couple of songs, they're some of the cheesiest and poorly produced pop songs I've ever heard.  I seriously wonder how these producers managed to make her so famous!  Thus, if you're a collector of Kylie's music and you haven't already imported the albums, this disc suits you.  It serves only to show what Kylie's done before.  The songs are bland, the lyrics are horrible and the vocals are frequently off-key.   <br /> <br />Move on to disc 2.  Right away you can see a vast improvement.  The new song, \\"I Believe In You\\" starts off the set and it only gets better from there.  Songs spanning her self-titled album, Impossible Princess, Light Years, Fever and Body Language deliver the unique disco-pop-electronic-dance fusion of the modern Kylie Minogue.  It's non-stop pop perfection!  You wonder how songs like \\"On A Night Like This\\", \\"Put Yourself In My Place\\" and \\"Breathe\\" never made it to the US!  If for no other reason, buy this set for disc 2 and you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />As a retrospective of Kylie's ultra-successful career, Ultimate Kylie delivers in spades.  Literally every song that made an impact in the charts is here.  For US fans, it's an opportunity to hear songs never heard before AND have the great songs we've come to love all in a convenient, well-compiled collection.  For any Kylie Minogue fan, this is a must-have!
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Is it good account of Homer's tale? Of course not. Still, to be fair, the movie is called \\"Troy,\\" not \\"The Iliad.\\" The credits even say that it was \\"inspired\\" by the Iliad (an exaggeration; the movie, though often effective, is hardly inspired).    Judged in cinematic, not literary or historical terms, though, \\"Troy\\" is by no means the complete turkey that most reviewers pronounced it. The director, Wolfgang Peterson, doesn't do much that is memorable with the cast-of-thousands scenes (with their rather obvious computerized effects), but imparts some dignity and occasional grandeur to the more intimate and solemn moments. The costuming is striking and vivid without being too extravagant, and while the Egyptian-like sets of the city have provoked much scorn and are no doubt anachronistic, we don't know what the Troy of circa 1200 BC looked like, so what's the big deal? The sets, particularly the interiors, are evocative, as is the score, surprisingly exotic and spare for a \\"big\\" popular movie.    True, the dialogue is generally undistinguished and trite, and the casting includes a few damp squibs such as the amateurish Garrett Hedlund as Patroclus and an overly pompous Peter O'Toole as King Priam. But some of the acting is right on the money. Casting the great Brian Cox as Agamemnon was a smart move, and Sean Bean as Odysseus steals every scene he's in. Orlando Bloom conveys Paris's charm and impetuosity, offset by callowness. Eric Bana gives the role of Hector the authority that is needed to pull it off.     Saffron Burrows, as Andromache, and Rose Byrne, as Briseis, also distinguish themselves. Diane Kruger (Helen) is not a polished actress, but she has a rare beauty, and the costumer has added to her allure. You believe that this is a face to launch a thousand ships.    Brad Pitt as Achilles is, I think, the film's main weakness. His performance is all sensitive-hulk notes. You're not drawn beneath the surface; he doesn't project what it was in Achilles's character that made him the central figure in an epic.    The scriptwriter had a serious problem on his hands -- making the status of Briseis and the actions of Paris acceptable to modern audiences. In the Iliad, Briseis is -- in line with the mores of the Bronze Age  -- no more than a captured slave, a bit of crumpet who precipitates the great stand-off between Achilles and Agamemnon but is otherwise unimportant. Brad Pitt could hardly be portrayed as a brute arguing over a slave girl, so in this version Briseis is a \\"priestess of Apollo,\\" and Achilles's love interest.     Paris couldn't be presented as a royal yob dragging Helen off to Troy by the hair, so this movie gives us the two as hot young love birds.    (And to ward off any suspicions of a homosexual attraction between Achilles and Patroclus, they have been made into \\"cousins.\\")    So I can understand why lovers of the Iliad would find this something of a travesty, and there are other mistakes, such as turning Agamemnon into such an unsympathetic rotter that it destroys the tragic element of two great figures locked in a clash of wills. (And having Briseis [!] slit Agamemnon's throat in the midst of the Greeks' overrunning Troy deprives Aeschylus of some of his best source material.)    But while the movie is in no way on a par with reading Richmond Lattimore's translation of the Iliad, or probably any other translation, it has its pleasures. Take it for what it is.    The letterboxed DVD is an excellent transfer, with richly glowing, natural colors and sound to match. You will of course want the widescreen edition.
B0002ZDVEU|1.0|A great idea (see \\"The Bourne Indentity\\"), a great book series, and a great actor all should add to a great movie. Or not? Well, not really. We forgot the PG-13 rating.    I am willing to forgive the cameraman who suffers from compulsive Parkingson's disease, and the shoddy direction by Paul Greengrass.    I will not forgive the PG-13 rating. Are we little toddlers who need parental guidance for everything? We have entered the age of fear. Everybody is afraid. Nobody dares to say anything for fear of... who knows? Fear of retribution? Fear of the government coming at us with the thought police to punish offenders for the sin of having free and independent minds?     These cowardly movie companies make me sick. If they release a movie for general audiences, okay, rated commercially with a PG-13. If they release a DVD, please make an R rated edition or a director's cut for adults.     They killed the plot, the character and everything else. Why didn't they hire Doug Liman to direct this movie? (See \\"The Bourne Identity\\"). At least it would have been much better. But, oh no, they know sooo much and are sooo wise. Well, they suck.    This movie sucks, too, and so will the third installment if they don't have the guts to film it the way it should be filmed.    Minus stars for a cowardly PG-13 rating, bad direction, bad camera techniques and stupid book adaptation. Wait a minute! Which adaptation? It had nothing to do with the book! They just borrowed the title and forgot the plot. What a bunch of jerks!    One lonesome star for Matt Damon who was great as always.
B000000OU0|4.0|Love this Band - always have. This CD & DVD are sensational. <br />Although much of the material is of the 70s - the songs have <br />stood the test of time well.Tequilla Sunrise & Hotel Cali are <br />a classic intro into the live stuff.Pretty Maids is cool,I can't tell you why is a highlight & NY Minute's moody.Joe's <br />\\"Help Me thru the night\\" is a stand out (DVD only).Great value <br />to old Fans like me,and New ones.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Writer Robert Ludlum created the Jason Bourne character and wrote three novels in this series: \\"The Bourne Identity\\", \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum.\\" <br /> <br />Jason Bourne is a killer with feelings. As portrayed by Matt Damon, is a film character better than James Bond. This first installment will keep you at the edge of your seat. <br /> <br />The producers and scriptwtriters decided to update the plot (it was written at least 30 years ago) bringing it up to our time. They succeeded. <br /> <br />It is a great idea: Jason Bourne does not know who he is, has lost part of his memory and struggles to reconstruct his past. During the process he falls in love with Franka Potente and things get really complicated. <br /> <br />All in all, is an excellent action movie. One star for the R rating, which shows sensitivity on the part of the producers and respect for their audience. 4 stars for acting, cinematography, direction and script.
B00005ASHM|2.0|..that song being god only knows a great song. Wouldn't it be nice is cool though not great. The rest is a mish mash of bubble gum boy loses girl pop and pointless instrumentals. This was influenced by Rubber Soul but really misses the boat big time. The thing is brian wilson was a good songwriter of surf pop tunes but couldn't compete with lennon/mccartney when it came to deep timeless pop. As for best album this album probably isn't even among the best ever. The people who rate this album highly either have an agenda or like ho-hum music.
B000002I99|5.0|I remember seeing this show my senior year in high school. I still think of it as the greatest live show ever. Suzi Quatro opened and then this Broadway production \\"Welcome to my Nightmare\\", (in the vernacular of the time a \\"Rock Opera\\"), it really was a great show, although decidedly different from anything else I had seen at the time. The album is a concept album that has to be listened to (in order) from start to finish to get the idea, and I loved it. The music is still great 30 years down the road.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Anchorman is the funniest film that I've seen in the past ten years. I haven't laughed as consistently or harder than I did at some of the lines from this film:<br /><br />Champ: I will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and then never call her back!<br /><br />Wes Mantooth: Dorothy Mantooth is a Saint!<br /><br />or<br /><br />Brick:\\"...Years later a doctor will tell me that I have an I.Q. of 48 and that I am what people would call mentally retarded.\\"<br /><br />or<br /><br />Ron: \\"You have an incredible heine...I mean that things good...I wanna be friends with it...Do you know who I am? I'm kind of a big deal...I'm known...I have many leather bound books and my apartment smells of rich mohogany.\\"<br /><br />Seriously, do not hesitate to buy this film it is hysterical. Ferrell does a great job as Ron Burgundy but his supporting cast is just as good. This will go down in the comedy annals as one of the greats. Highest Recommendation.
B000062X90|5.0|No doubt, Argus is the one of the brightest moments of rock and roll, and after over 30 years, it is just as bright. The only problem I have with this reissue is the extra tracks. Not that they aren't as good as the other reveiwers have stated, It is just that Argus was thematic, that was one of the great parts of the album. If you want the extra songs (and I did) then buy Distilation(and I did), just don't do a touch up on this masterpiece!<br />But in any case... If you don't have this album you should.<br />The beauty of the guitar work is just amazing. The original vocals on this studio album are haunting. The concept theme of this album can take you away to another \\"Sometime World\\"<br />An album that you will play over and over. Argus is one to own.<br />And one to share with friends and your kids because it shows how great music can be.
B000002NG7|3.0|(3.5 Stars) <br /> <br />\\"Album of the Year\\" is Faith No More's final album, unfortunately. And although it's their weakest overall, there's still a lot of great stuff on here. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Collision\\", \\"Last Cup of Sorrow\\", and \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" follow a similar course of soft, omnious verses and heavy, anthematic choruses. All good songs, no complaints. <br /> <br />The trip-hop/electronica flavored \\"Stripsearch\\" is friggin awesome. It's very atmospheric and seductive sounding. Mike Patton's vocals really soar here. <br /> <br />There's also screamy metal (\\"Naked in Front of the Computer\\" and \\"Got That Feeling\\"), Middle Eastern/evil circus stomps (\\"Mouth to Mouth\\"), majestic epics (\\"Helpless\\"), and even bouncy, piano-led soul (\\"She Loves Me Not\\", in which Mike Patton croons with the best of 'em).  <br /> <br />The main problem is that, with the exception of the soaring, beautiful closer \\"Pristina\\", the last few songs are pretty forgettable. But everything else ranges from good to awesome, so I can't complain too much. <br /> <br />Best Songs: Stripsearch, Pristina, Helpless, Collision, She Loves Me Not.
B000009CEM|5.0|I remember when my friend in job corps used to play this album and so i asked to listen to it. I loved the song DESCENT and would play it every morning. I bought this cd in a pawn shop and listened to it non-stop. I especially love the melodic voice parts in the songs. The story reminds me of The Matrix! very weird. I think this is the best ROCK album I have ever owned. So if you like to headbang or just wanna chill then pick this disc up. You won't regret it.
B00009P1MP|5.0|Great CD.  The words and music are heartfelt and important.   <br />\\"Vincent\\" perhaps the strongest song in this collection.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002MUN|5.0|\\"It's just that Harrison on his own is a second-tier rock & roll figure whose best work is long behind him, and that's pretty much the case with Petty as well.\\" <br /> <br />George's best work came out not too long before this and was succeeded by an equally towering achievement after he died.  As for Petty, he's far shy from having one foot in the grave as a creative artist.  Criticism is subjective, to be sure, but these comments are not only way off base they're offensive.
0783114893|4.0|Everyone who has watched this loves it. Need I say more? It's just one of those cult psycho thrillers that goes off. <br />There's another DVD which I am hoping to find (anyone heard of it?)called \\"Back for revenge\\" starring C Thomas Howell in a reversal role. He is the avenger and some of the murder scenes are just great.
0790730960|5.0|\\"I haven't been fed all day\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Eat floor, high in fiber\\" <br /> <br /> <br />one of the many great catchy lines in this great dark, gothic style movie that is ultimate burton and the all time best batman (you could say sequel, but storywise this one is my absolute favorite) ever!! michelle piefer is THE GREATEST CATWOMAN OF ALL TIME, HALLE BERRY, YOU SUCK, MICHELLE OWNS THIS SO GET THE HECK OUT OF HERE YOU WERENT EVEN GOOD IN JAMES BOND SO GET LOST MICHELLE IS SO MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE THEN YOU AND ACTS BETTER, DONT CARE ABOUT MONSTERS BALL GET LOST, THIS IS NOT YOUR TERRITORY, oh,lol, sorry, got a bit enraged there, but it just proves a point, Michelle piefer has and always will own this part and i absolutely ador her in every way possible, especially in this movie. she steals alot of the movie, partly becasue i am absolutly in love with her and her character,i have a feeling that we would have been a great couple, and of course her great peformance. if selina kyle existed in real life, i wouldnt care if she was a total dork, i would still love her and treat her the best. but ANYWAY, getting off my love for michelle, i have been a HUGE Batman fan since i was a baby technically, and i grew up with these films. i believe i saw this one in the movies, but i was to small to remeber. all i know is that the character development is SOO well done, and the im guessing \\"minaiature\\" sets, like that zoo place are great and i put it almost on par with the minatures in the lord of the rings for detail. basically, batman has three villians to stop, the penguin who is running for mayor (i dont know what the ppl of gotham are thinking, but i wouldnt be caught dead voting for a freakin freak like penguin in my life), catwoman/selina kyle (who is....omg....dont get me started...absolutly stunning, espcially at that dance ball thing), and, the real villian in my opinion, Max zorin, i mean max shreck (oops, wrong movie, lol) who wants to bulid a power plant to leave his \\"legacy\\" for his dopey son. selina discovers this and he tries to kill her by pushing her out of the window (shes his secratery), and alot of alley cats somehow bring her back to life, some superstitios way wich is pretty cool, and then starts acting real freaky until she becomes catwoman. i dont know about many ppl but i like michelle as selina and not so much as catwoman, although either is puur-fect. like many have stated, michael keaton is the best batman ever and always will be unless someone else comes along which is highly doubtful, even with this christian bale guy coming in, keaton will always be THE Batman. ulike nicholsons super evil joker, the so called villians, other then christopher walkens Shrek (oops, not Shrek the other one, lol), are more pitiful (not in a bad way) then you would think of a batman villian, they are not supervillians, more like half villians, espcially catwomans character, who is from the start emotionally unstable, or depressed, whichever, and is totally ready for her transition to catwoman, i think anyone in her shoes would be. peguin is like wise a tragic being in himself. i mean, his parents rejected him because he was different, but not really because of his looks, but the fact that he would, well, for example, eat animals like cats (woull see whern you watch the movie) and even has to be locked in a cage. wow, what a sad person/penguin. but i never understood how a woman could give bith to a...penguin? maybe it was to many of those martini's, plus being married to peewee herman doesnt help, lol. but by far, the best parts in this moviewere not the action scenes, or the penguins (lol) but the love scenes between selina/catwoman and batman/bruce wayne. that whole scene where they are dancing and they recite there own \\"mistletoe\\" poem, and then at that point relize who there real identities are is so romantic, and yet so heartbreaking, because you want them to be together, but in the end it just wouldnt work out, they are too, well, emotionally unstable with themselves, and they probably wouldnt be able to have a normal relationship (although i wouldnt expect it to be). still, i wish that selina and bruce got together in the end, but i believe that they still loved each other, but they just couldnt be together because of there radical circumstances. max shreck getting toasted at the end was great, hes such a nasty villian in this, as he is always, and he also happens to be the villian in tim burtons other awsome movie, sleepy hollow. the batsub thing that he rides in the sewers is awsome, but it should have went faster and sprayed water everywhere and killed those stuipid peguins with the missles. i dont know about everyone else, but i never noticed the supposed 'stupidity' of the bomb dressed penguins. i always like it, it had aquirkiness just like the penguin himslef, it wouldnt make sense to have a villian like penguin and not have the penguins, and the penguins giving oswald a proper burial was somewhat touching, for all the neglect he had from humans, the penguins loved him, and thats where he truly belonged, with them. bruce wayne and his whjole\\"parents\\"thing isnt really shown here at all like in the first film, and its kinda good that it didnt, with all these new characetrs and complicated histories of them. all in all, very goo movie, touching in places, yet dark and scary in others. the atmosphere, as in all butrton films, is top notch, and the looks they gave gotham city, even though it looked like it was painted or something, was sooo cool and awsome,and i prefer that then a real city anyday. great filmmaking and the characters are cool, beautiful, and disgusting (dop the math, lol). oh and one more thing, MICHELLE PIEFER I LOVE YOU!!!

B0000042GM|4.0|To be honest, I can't really figure out how much I like Katchen's performance. It's hard to gauge because Brahms's piano music is inherently exceptional played by just about any performer.  <br /> <br />I feel that the ballades, op. 10 are played way too fast (although I'm not exactly sure how close Katchen is to Brahms's tempi indications). I've heard them by several other performers and, being a Gould fan, would have to say that his slower interpretation really captures how beautiful the pieces are more than anyone else. I also enjoy Kempff's performances of many later works. Katchen really seems so rushed for some reason. To me, that really takes attention away from the fine details, which I think are so essential to Brahms's piano music. He's not quite delicate enough with some of the pieces. <br /> <br />This faster speed is only very slight for the rest of the set, but pretty consistently. I think he does a better job with more intense pieces like many of his larger-scale variations and the sonatas. Those I would give 5 stars, but only 4 stars for the op. 116-119, for they're a little too fast. <br /> <br />My only other qualm is the arrangement of the set. It would be nice to have all the sonatas together on a disc, 116-119 on a disc, etc., going along with the whole chronological thing.. <br /> <br />However, all these things are personal preference. I would definitely recommend this set. It's made up about 1/2 of my music listening for the past couple months. It's not expensive at all for what you're getting, and if you get just one Brahms piano cd, you're going to want to get more, so you should just get it over with and have this whole set, it's fabulous music. Just keep in mind that this is not the only interpretation that should be considered. <br />
B000244EMO|5.0|Major Duke ( Arnold Schwartzenger)and his recruits ( Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, Bill Duke, Shane Black and Richard Chaves) go into the South American jungles to rescue innocient hostages. Soon they discover that a sneaky alien creature begins to hunt the team down then slaughter them one by one, as Duke must try to find a way to defeat the unseen enemy force.<br /><br />A supsenseful and really violent Science Fiction action adventure that has became a genre favorite even with it's box-office success and fan base. There are some gore in this movie that may not be for the squeamish, but it's action and pacing never lets down the viewer especially with it's good special effects, the creature itself is quite a unique kind of alien monster that is fully armed with invisibility mode and all kinds of deadly weapons designed and created by Stan Winston.<br /><br />This special 2-Disc Edition is an improvement over the original badly transfered bareboned with only trailer DVD, it has a great and informative audio commentary by the director. The features on disc 2 are just cool, it has featurettes, documentary, Never-before-shown outtakes, deleted scene, still gallery and more.<br /><br />A must have DVD and movie for fans of action, adventure, horror, and Science Fiction everywhere.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\" The Thing\\" ( 1982), \\" Aliens\\", \\" Predator 2\\", \\"Alien\\", \\" Total Recall\\", \\" The Running Man\\", \\" The Terminator\\", \\" Terminator 2\\", \\" Alien3\\", \\"Alien Resurrection\\", \\"The Deadly Spawn\\", \\" Contamination\\", \\" Pitch Black\\", \\" Lifeforce\\", \\" Killer Klowns from Outer Space\\", \\" Jurassic Park\\", \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Stargate\\", \\" The Matrix\\", \\" Ghost in The Shell\\", \\" Cannibal Ferox\\", \\" Cannibal Holocaust\\", \\" The Evil Dead\\", \\" Evil Dead 2\\", \\" Event Horizon\\", \\" Creature ( 1985)\\", \\" Critters 1 & 2\\", \\" IT!

B0000DD7LB|4.0|When I first bought this cd, I didn't know what I was in for. I thought it was going to be lame with only one or 2 songs on the album that I liked. But this cd is definately one of those cds you pop in and listen to for like a week. The songs really do grow on you over time. I think it all depends on what you're going through. I was going through boy problems and this cd did the trick to make me feel independent, and bold. The different styles of music on this cd are what really makes it a good cd. Not every song has the same beat and style. She does a good job of mixing things up. All the songs are pretty good to me, my favorites are Outrageous, and probably Showdown. Get this cd only if you're into being open with your opinions. If you're narrow minded and you listen to all the trash going around about Britney...then this probably isn't the cd for you.
B0000039LE|5.0|One day young Michael Myers decided that his sister shouldn't live anymore. She must have been in her late teens. He was six. He stabbed her to death. It was Halloween.<br /><br />15 years later Michael escapes from the mental asylum. He returns to his hometown, Haddonfield, persued by his psychiatrist, Dr Loomis.<br /><br />In Haddonfield people are preparing to celebrate the holiday. We follow three girlfriends who are going to meet with their boyfriends, and babysit. The great thing about having things taking place on Halloween is that this holiday means many things. It means party, which means opportunity to work (babysit), and it means horror. Of course you can mix these quite naturally.<br /><br />Leaves are falling from the trees. The girlfriends are still in the classroom... being asked about fate in literature class. There are children in the schoolyard scaring each other, saying that the \\"Boogeyman\\" is coming on Halloween. And Michael Myers appearing everywhere, just watching or driving his (stolen) car. John Carpenter knows how to set the mood. And his music in this film is gold.<br /><br />There are scarier movies out there, but it's hard to top the mood of this one.

B00069YE0W|4.0|In my opinion Frusciante produced the best music in 2004.  I looked forward to buying every CD.  Curtains was no exception and it is definitely worth buying if you are a fan.  The longest track on the CD is hard to listen to and I am already at the point (after a few listens) where I need to skip it.  There is however some really good, innovative ideas and classic Frusciante guitar that makes this another worthy CD to add to the collection.  Buy every CD in this collection if you want to enjoy driving around in this crazy world.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My two favourite bands, The Used and My Chemical Romance. I enjoyed MCR's last CD, but I've fallen more in love with them on this one. I can't help but to deny it's super catchy and their lyrics are amazing (what you can always expect from them). If you're into a more upbeat funky MCR, you'll really enjoy this cd. <br />These song reviews are pretty hard to write considering I love the entire album. Definitley one of my all time favorites that I've ever heard. <br />1. Helena - Amazing beginning..well, just an amazing song. One of my favorites. 10/10<br />2. Give Em' Hell Kid - The beginning is really funky. Gerard's voice sounds awesome..not my absoloute favorite, but I still really like it. 9/10<br />3. To The End - From what I've read, this song is *okay* but honestly the beginning of this song is my favorite out of any of the songs. It's easy to move to..but once it gets to the bridge, gets a little soft and not as catchy but then they pick it back up with the chorus. Love ittttt! Dark lyrics are wicked too. A definite fav 10/10<br />4. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison - this song is interesting. I like how it starts out. Bert (from the used) screams in this song. It has to be loved by me, haha but it's only about an 8.5/10..but it's still growing on me. <br />5. I'm Not Okay (I Promise)- this song isn't terrible, so I don't know why it's getting bad feedback. It's a little tOo *MTV* but you can't deny that it's really catchy and it constantly gets stuck in my head. THe lyrics are pretty good too. *You said you read me like a book..but the pages are all torn and frayed* - 8.5/10<br />6. Ghost Of You - This was actually the first song I heard off the album, my friend had told me about it before the Cd came out. It's a lot softer, more like a ballad but it's absoloutely beautiful. The chorus gets to me so much. One of my fav's. 10/10<br />7. The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You - I really enjoy the chorus of this song, although the rest of the song isawesome too. It's up there with the favs 9.5/10<br />8. Interlude - Pretty soothing..interludes are nothign special anyway. The singing adds a nice touch. 9/10<br />9. Thank You For The Venom - (2nd song I heard off the cd)I adore this song. I just love how it's all mixed up you have all these different beats and the way he sings..just ahh it's so much fun to listen to. I love ittttttt. 10/10<br />10. Hang Em' High - Beginning's a bit weird...a western feel to it. If you like their louder songs, you'll enjoy this one. 9/10<br />11. It's Not A Fashion Statement, Its a Death Wish - Not one of my personal favorites, but I still enjoy listening to it. About 2/3's of the way through the song there's a really awesome part where the beat changes and it's really cool to listen to. 8/10<br />12. Cemetary Drive - The lyrics are pretty awesome for this song. It's different than the rest of the cd. The chorus is pretty loud, but the verses are quite soft. It's a nice change though, its a deep song. 9/10<br />13. I Never Told You What I Do For A Living - This song sort of loses it's energy a few times but it's got a pretty good beat to it thats fun to sort of bob around to. I also really like the screaming with the guitar...veryyyyyyy awesome. 9/10
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I don't want to talk about the performance itself, which is already much discussed about in others' reviews. One thing I noticed was, why on earth were all the American audiences at JFK so dull?? It's painful to watch them standing around doing nothing. On the other hand, Britains were so great that day at Wembley, with the aid of perfect music. Sorry Americans, but it seems the capital of Rock music is located at the other side of the Atlantic.

0316776963|2.0|This is a compilation of about 200 Andy Rooney-esque 60 Minutes essays, just that Andy Rooney is funnier and more interesting.      There is no story here, just the author ranting and raving about his life, which to me, doesn't make a book interesting or enjoyable. I didn't know this book would be like this going into it.      I can complain about my own life. Why should we care about Sedarris complaining about his?  Amusing, but once you are done, it will leave you mind forever.     Everyone else loved it, just not me.
B00006L83N|5.0|I just bought this CD a few days ago and it is better than anything Dream Theater has done since \\"Scenes From a Memory.\\" I am a pretty big DT fan and I wasn't really a fan of Symphony X's material before this album, but man does \\"Odyssey\\" rock hard. From the awesome opening guitar lick in Inferno through the bonus track it is hard to pick a weak song out of the nine. Michael Romeo really shines here and I am glad the keyboards have now taken a back seat to the outstanding guitar work here. While his solos might not be as melodic as John Petrucci, his riffing and interesting style are better than anything JP has done in a long time (and this is coming from a huge Petrucci fan). I also love the vocalist who has a wide range to his voice, much more so than James Labrie. If you were to buy one Symphony X album this would easily be the one in my opinion.
B000084T18|2.0|I got this CD a couple of years ago when 50 came out and everyone was sayin' he is sick and all that. When i first heard \\"In Da Club\\" i thought it was great, even if I don't now, so I bought it and when I played it on my cd player I thought it was good. I'll tell you what I think NOW<br /><br />The thing I don't really like about 50 is he is to commercial and raps about the same thing like P*ssy lickin, bling and how he got shot 9 times (even though he probably didn't) The song \\"Wanksta\\" must of been about himself cause he ain't a gangsta, he is a p*ssy MTV rapper. True hip hop heads know this is fake, most people I know like Pop Rap cause they probably haven't heard better.<br /><br />Another thing I don't like is his voice, it's damn annoying, he ain't got any skills either, his lyrics are sh*t too. The beats are tight tho.<br /><br />The only tracks I like are \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Heat\\" the rest is garbage, \\"21 Questions\\" is my least favorite and \\"PIMP\\" get on my nerves. Overall I wouldn't recommend this to hip hop heads but to Fake Rap lovers who also like Chingy, Nelly and all those.<br /><br />Instead you should buy GZA \\"Liquid Swords\\", NWA \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" or anything better than this.
B00005OCMR|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was awestruck, I had never really seen anything like it before. Yes, I know that this movie seems incrediblly cheesy now that the special effects technology has improved but hey, I guess that this movie could be called a classic. I think the story line is very clever and interssting. I mean, have a lot of people come up with story lines about computer programs fighting other programs? Which is the reason I give this movie four stars.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|Cube stands out for me as one of the only films in years that has truly impacted me.....it left me unsettled, creeped, and definitely kept me thinking about it long after the end credits had rolled.  Watching it was a true rollercoaster - suspense of the finest quality.  Hypercube was a waste of potential.  Mediocre acting and a definite case of writers with more ambition than talent.  The very definition of squandered potential.  Worst of all, there was no suspense, no tension, and the \\"ah ha!\\" moments of revelation were anything but exciting.<br /><br />Cube Zero brings a return to the tension of the first, and does the only logical thing it could do: answer some of the questions raised by its predecessor.  Part of the beauty of Cube was the lack of answers, but also a frustration.  CZ takes us \\"behind the scenes\\" of the monstrosity that is The Cube. It delivers just enough insight into that background to satisfy, but (thankfully) doesn't give it all away, and raises a few more questions of its own.<br /><br />Orwell's 1984 has obviously always been a heavy influence on Cube, and that influence comes to full flower in CZ.  Cinematically, the first film often posed the camera as a real observer, watching the Cube's victims.  The theme is expanded upon here naturally and elegantly.  Unknown, unseen controllers watching those inside the Cube, themselves being only \\"button pushers\\" for the real(?) controllers, who reside upstairs, but who themselves may be just one more layer of the onion.<br /><br />The acting is fine, no true standouts, although Terri Hawkes makes quite a bit out of a small role as Jellico, one of the Cube's \\"residents.\\"<br /><br />A word of strong warning: this movie is extremely graphic.  If you've seen the first one, you've seen gore, but some of the scenes in this one will make you think you were watching a Disney movie.  I don't generally support that level of graphic content, but it did drive home the brutality of the content in a very powerful way.  Those in control of the Cube are sadists, dehumanizing monsters, without question, from frame one of Cube.  Cube Zero takes their horrors to a new level, with violence to match.  That having been said, some of the \\"new\\" traps are positively beautiful in their cruelty, marking a sharp contrast to the often quick-and-dirty nature of those in the first film.<br /><br />The ending?  I won't give anything away, but I will say I saw it coming from the very beginning of the film.  But did anyone ever think for a moment that the Death Star wouldn't be destroyed at the end of Star Wars, or that Luke wouldn't be the one to do it?  It's the journey that matters, and this journey had every hair on my neck standing on end, and me on the edge of my seat.  It has made me want to show it to all of my friends, so I can talk about some of the thoughts it's left in my head.  What more can anyone ask?<br /><br />[EDIT] typo
0316096199|5.0|When Alex Sebold was eighteen, enrolled as college freshman at Syracuse University, she was attacked and raped on the last night of school walking home late at night.  She was forced onto the ground in a dark tunnel \\"among the dead leaves and broken beer bottles.\\"  She gives descriptive details of the rape and its immediate aftermath inside the dorm, while at the police station, and at home with her parents.  After going to the police she was informed that the same place where she had been raped there had been the murder of a different young woman, and was also raped.  Alex Sebold considered herself very lucky.  Thus as a writer she decided to share her life altering experience.  Changing the names of all characters for privacy, this book was non the less very, very moving.   <br />  <br />Alice Sebold not only wrote through this book about how she overcame her rape and was able to survive it.  She also gave the her audience a certain amount of knowledge of the real world and the dangers that come along with it.  It is an amazingly well written book.  A memoir is self-centered descripted work. She wrote in a sense for herself, victims who have encountered the same situation or a very similar situation.  I have not read her other book, The Lovely Bones, but after reading this very moving book I am curious of what The Lovely Bones could do to move me like this one did.
B000008GEF|4.0|Given the task of somehow following up the critical and commercial triumph of &quot;all things must pass&quot; George Harrison seemed to crawl back into his insecurity blanket.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It has action, love, and drama.  I know alot of people say its a bloody movie, but people fought bloody wars with swords, arrows, and many other blood drenching weapons long ago.  Besides the battle scenes, this movie has deeper meaning.  It potrays the lust for power and glory, then lets the main character realise that there is more to life than fame.  Their is love, honor, and the usual good things in life.  I like the fact that there are no gods and goddesses or any other mythical characters in this movie.  It tells the story of humans and their struggles which gives the viewer a sense of being able to relate to the characters.
0385513755|3.0|First of all, in regards to all the hype surrounding the 'revelations' in Brown's book all I have to say is: It's fiction, folks!!  Nothing more than light entertainment.  He may use actual works of art and architecture, but the rest is fantasy.  Even the supposed historical tidbits aren't very well researched at all (i.e. his book says the Knights Templar were executed by the Pope when it was actually France's King Philip the Fair who had them arrested, charged and killed).<br /><br />As far as fiction goes, it's a fun piece of fluff; a good way to kill some time on that 10 hour flight to Europe or in your doctor's waiting room.  But after having read both this book and Angels & Demons (the stories are practically identical in a didn't-I-already-read-this kind of way), I feel like Mr. Brown severely underestimates the intelligence of his readers.  He announces every moment of foreshadow.  His attempts to build suspense remind me of a father embellishing scary stories to his young kids by making \\"oooo\\" noises while making monster faces and stomping around the house with his arms over his head like some sort of ghoulish gorilla.  He has to drag out the revelation of each clue which can be annoying when you've already figured it out, but you still have another 2-3 pages of \\"oh, what could it be\\" to go through.  And he has a tendency to go off on random tangents that do nothing to enhance the story line (i.e. the entire why-I-wear-a-Mickey-Mouse-watch saga).<br /><br />I'm starting to get the idea, based on his writing style, that a conversation with him would go something like this:<br /><br />\\"Happy Birthday, Wendy.  I've got something for you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wow.  Thank you, Dan.\\"<br /><br />\\"I've got it here in this bag.  It's a surprise.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh.  What is it?\\"<br /><br />\\"Boy, you are really going to be surprised when you see what it is.\\"<br /><br />\\"OK.\\"<br /><br />\\"Guess what it is?\\"<br /><br />\\"Um, can I have a hint?\\"<br /><br />\\"You told me last week that you were hoping to get this.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh yeah.  A gift certificate to the spa.  Is that what you got me?\\"<br /><br />\\"You are never going to guess what it is.\\"<br /><br />\\"So it's not a gift certificate.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's something that's really relaxing.\\"<br /><br />\\"Besides a trip to the spa?\\"<br /><br />\\"It's a way to get really pampered on your birthday.\\"<br /><br />\\"So no spa then...\\"<br /><br />\\"I can't wait to see the look on your face when you open it.\\"<br /><br />\\"So, do I get to open it now or do I have to wait until later?\\"<br /><br />\\"No, you get to open it now.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ok...  Dan... Give me the bag, Dan.  Are you going to give it to me or not?\\"<br /><br />\\"Alright, here it is.  Aren't you excited?\\"<br /><br />\\"Actually, I'm starting to get a headache, Dan.\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, here it is!!\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh.

B00008J2DQ|4.0|Is it just me, or does this sound like Metallica did about ten years ago.  Heck, I like the album.  It does rock.  And maybe the criticism others have about it sounding like their earlier work is right, but I don't own their first two albums and I like this.<br /><br />Track seven, though, I don't copy to my mp3 player.  Really stupid track.
B0000A0DRY|2.0|i have an earlier cd of this, but was intrigued by the remastering and the additional tracks.<br /><br />disappointed, to say the least. the remastering is...louder. compressed, to the point where everthing smears, and the (originally over-used) reverbs bury over everything. the mastering could have been more subtle, more respectful of the limitations of the original record (rather than a modern paint-by-numbers mastering)<br /><br />for me at least, the earlier cd is cleaner, clearer.<br /><br />as for the bonus tracks: whatever.<br /><br />am giving this to my brother, and keeping the older cd<br /><br />(altho the booklet in the new one was fun to read)
B0002X314C|5.0|I've been following John Legend for a while. I have his live albums from NYC's Knitting Factory and SOB's and have seen him live a couple of times. It's funny that Kanye is now promoting him, but at the SOB's show a couple of years back, John was the one promoting Kanye and hyping up the crowd for his mentor. <br /> <br />This CD is amazing from start to finish. Sadly, it's a litlte on the short side, but there are no bad songs on here. He has a rich soulful voice, and while he has a sense of humor, doesn't cross into \\"silly\\" territory. <br /> <br />His combined talent of writing, performing and singing his own songs reminds me of a newer Brian Mcknight. While Brian Mcknight has stayed consistently R&B and hasn't really crossed into the maintstream so-to-speak, John Legend is the best of both worlds. He has the star potential to be huge, and has the talent to back it up. <br /> <br />There are two songs that were released with his singles but aren't on the album here: Johnny's Gonna Go, and Money Blowin', which are great songs and should have made the final cut, but sadly didn't. If you manage to find these songs, be sure to d/l them at least. John Legend and this CD deserve all the praise they've been getting.
B000068TPN|5.0|Based on the book of a similar title (We Were Soldiers Once and Men), this war film portrays the up-close, gory \\"face\\" of battle in the Vietnam Central Highlands.  It vividly shows the courage and controlled terror and rage of infantrymen in close combat.  Heart-rending portrayal of the dread and grief of family members whose loved ones were missing or killed in action.  Excellent performances by Sam Elliott and Barry Pepper.  Pepper's portrayal of Galloway shows how survival instincts can overpower one's conscience in the heat of battle.  Mel Gibson gives a believable performance of Lieutenant Colonel Moore's unflappable courage under dire circumstances and his love for his soldiers and their well-being.  One of the most accurate Hollywood portrayals of the horrorific reality of combat and the human story that underlies every victory and casualty.  Not to be missed.
B000059LGC|3.0|The main attractions of this production of the Agatha Christie story are the over-the-top performances of acting powerhouses like Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Angela Lansbury, and of course shameless ham Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot. <br /> <br />You'll never for a moment believe that Ustinov is playing anybody but Ustinov, well outside the character and almost strictly for laughs.  Likewise, Davis and Smith have a go at each other as travelling companions (Davis looks remarkably like the aged version of her character in \\"Mr. Skeffington\\" from the 1940's!). <br /> <br />But top honors in the scenery-chewing department go to bug-eyed, grandiosely bizarre Lansbury, who would later play Christie's Miss Marple.   <br /> <br />There are some other second-tier stars and some nice Egyptian scenery, but you won't be able to concentrate with the aforementioned quartet around.  The film just bides its time till one of them takes over again. <br /> <br />Murder On the Orient Express is still my favorite of the Christies made around this time. A bit subtler and a stronger, more unified cast overall, not to mention a real surprize of a solution to the crime.  Better director, too!
0486282112|5.0|Mary Shelley was ahead of her time in writing what some consider to be the first ever science fiction novel.  What I found most intriguing about this book was that the main story was not defined to me until one moment at the very end.  In fact, I am still unable to decide for myself whether it is what it is.  A definite must read for anyone who is at all interested in fantastic fiction.
B00000G3I2|1.0|The term \\"yuppie\\" originally referred to middle-class Americans who had come of age in the 1960s, had been hippies, and by the 1980s were financially successful.  That term and the term \\"baby boomer\\" both entered the American lexicon not long after this egregiously influential film came out in 1983.<br /><br />\\"The Big Chill\\" was one of the first manifestations of the navel-gazing, self-absorbed, self-pitying subset of the \\"baby boomer\\" generation who around this time came to the horrific realization that they were beginning to age, that their lives had turned out to be much more cynical and materialistic than their '60s youthful idealism, blah blah blah, yada yada.  The manner in which this film and its characters treat the Meg Tilly character, who is not in \\"their\\" generation (and so is portrayed as a shallow nitwit), is a prime example of certain baby boomers' self-righteousness and self-aggrandizement.<br /><br />This film made me want to vomit when I saw it in 1983, and the mere idea of it makes me want to vomit today.  Still when I hear any of the classic songs which were desecrated by appearing on its soundtrack, I get cold chills down my spine at the memory of this crapfest.<br /><br />Those cold chills only last for a moment, but the societal problems and stagnation the selfishness of this subset of the \\"boomers\\" wrought for post-boomer generations -- McJobs, draconian student-loan repayment plans, \\"safe sex\\", the anti-aging industry -- these are forever.  And this film crystallizes them all in a shiny happy package fit for consumption by (to paraphrase Don Henley) Deadheads driving Cadillac...Escalades.
B00002E224|2.0|Performances were OK, cinematography was fine, story was OK.  Lacked sexual or emotional chemistry.  He was an immature little boy by his own admission; she was a co-dependent perhaps but even so too good for him.  What did these two find in each other?! Other than company to be walking around Vienna with?  Everything she loved, he belittled or hated... the fortune teller, and the beautiful poem.  The hell with him.  They should have made the girl just want him for a romantic roll in the hay.   <br />I guess all the rave reviews come from women so desperate for a good romantic movie, they are easily impressed.   <br />I too would like to see Hollywood do more in the romance arena, even some adaptations of favorite romance novels, but alas \\"BEFORE SUNRISE\\" is not one of these masterpieces. <br />Good, OK, worth seeing, but not worth the hype.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Y'all lost me when you declared Pet Sounds as the best album of all time. That's simply a ridiculous claim, hell I'll take Black Sabbath's Paranoid, or Sticky Fingers by the Stones, or Dark Side of The Moon by the Floyd, or Kid A by Radiohead, or XTC's Nonesuch, or King Crimson's Discipline, or the Sex Pistols, or Revolver by the Beatles or Axis: Bold as Love by Hendrix and many others (and we're just talking about rock here) before Pet Sounds any day.  Now if you'd said that Pet Sounds was the most influential album of all time I'd have given a longer pause to reflect.  After all XTC would probably never have done Nonesuch which owes a huge debt to the vocal harmonies of the Beach Boys and the Beatles wouldn't have done Sgt. Peppers in order to compete with Brian Wilson's masterpiece.  Pet Sounds became for a brief time in the mid sixties a kind of pop music benchmark and was the most complex and ambitious pop music album of its day.  And that ambition, that desire to make rock 'n roll or pop music grander, more musically serious, is Pet Sounds most profound and lasting legacy.  A legacy that influenced the Beatles, Moody Blues, King Crimson on up to Pink Floyd and beyond.  One could make a case that Pet Sounds was the first progressive rock album. But it doesn't really matter if Pet Sounds is the best or most influential album ever made.  What does matter is that Pet Sounds is sublime pop music.  The lyrics may be slight, so what, the sound of this album is a gorgeous island of melodic and harmonic bliss.  It's just damn beautiful, at times very touching and shouldn't be missed.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.
B00006IX0R|5.0|While not myself old, I am a long-time listener of The Cranberries.  Some of the older songs, as well as the newer, evoke nostalgic memories.  Thus I get that sad-mixed-with-happy feeling when listening to the album.  \\"Zombie,\\" and \\"Salvation\\" are two of my personal favorites, as I am a fan of some of the faster tracks.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that there is a certain uniformity about this album - some of their slower recordings could have been implemented.  One that I would have chosen is \\"Chocolate Brown.\\"  However, I do believe that each past album was well-represented and, of course, one can't please everyone when producing a \\"greatest hits\\" album.
B000268QB2|5.0|After buying Keane's CD a week ago, I was so impressed I immediately began scrounging around for a ticket to their sold out concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom. Luckily I found one because the concert blew me away: Tom's voice filled the venue and hit every note perfectly while Tim pounded away energetically on the piano with even his legs getting into it. The show had so much energy and good vibes. I didn't want it to end. They also seemed genuinely appreciative of their fans. Everyone from young kids to adults in their 50s were enjoying the music - they definitely have cross-generational appeal. This is money well spent and a great band to support. Try to see Keane live but buy the CD first because you'll want to sing along to all of their songs!
B00020HEL6|3.0|After two little-known country albums, Renee Olstead has been revamped into a jazz/easy listening songster, courtesy of producer Dave Foster.  Much of the songs here are covers and some work, some need work.  Much of it has to do her voice, which is passable, but the arrangements and the overall relaxing late night jazz atmosphere of the songs make up for it.<br /><br />\\"Summertime\\" from Porgy and Bess opens her eponymous album, starting with a nice piano before going full force with some sassy horns.  She does one other Gershwin song, the late night chill-out of \\"Someone To Watch Over Me,\\" probably the best song here, with some mellowed strings and Chris Botti contributing a trumpet solo midsong.<br /><br />Another standout moment is her duet with Peter Cincotti on Neil Sedaka's \\"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do.\\"  Cincotti is clearly the superior singer here; he does piano here as well.  Next up is the Norah Jones-ish \\"A Love That Will Last,\\" another gem here with its nice and smooth arrangements, with Foster himself on the piano.  What Norah Jones could do with this as a \\"Don't Know Why Part II\\" style song!<br /><br />Her languid cover of Maria Muldaur's classic \\"Midnight At The Oasis\\" fits in one of those that could be better.  Ditto for \\"Meet Me, Midnight,\\" the Manilow song no less, where her improvised scat provokes some raised eyebrows and \\"hmmms.\\"  And what was the decision behind her uninspiring cover of Louis Jordan's \\"Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby\\"?  While her cover of the Vernon Duke-composed \\"Taking A Chance On Love\\" is passable, I'm expecting Jane Monheit's version to be better.  Her weak voice on high notes is shown in \\"Sentimental Journey\\" best known for Doris Day's version.  When she sings \\"seven,\\" the strain clearly shows.  Otherwise, the rest of the song isn't bad, although I'll go for Doris Day or Ringo Starr's version anytime.<br /><br />Foster's production, the musicians, and Jeremy Lubbock's string arrangements are probably the best things on this album.  As for the vocalist, well, let's say Ms. Olstead does an adequate job overall.  Should she decide to continue her music career, maybe she should take some tips from current jazz songbirds as Kate Allyson and Jane Monheit, or listen to some of the legends such as Peggy Lee or Doris Day.s on this album.

B000065V9Y|3.0|It took almost 5 years for Peter Gabriel to record a pop music follow-up to the massive \\"So,\\" but he endured a lifetime's worth of experiences through the period. The soundtrack to Martin Scorcese's \\"Last Temptation Of Christ\\" took up a huge amount of his creative juice, and a divorce also took place. The resulting \\"Us\\" aches from the beginning plea of \\"Talk To Me\\" to the final \\"Secret World\\" question of \\"what was it we were thinking of?\\" Peter is certainly asking us to feel his pain, but it isn't always the cathartic kind (think Phil Collins' \\"Face Value\\").<br /><br />The other problem with \\"Us\\" is that Gabriel was beginning to sound like formula. Both \\"Steam\\" and \\"Kiss That Frog\\" are far too similar to \\"Shock The Monkey,\\" \\"Big Time\\" and \\"Sledgehammer\\" from previous efforts to think that Gabriel was investing much thought into them. They stand out like sore thumbs from an artist that derives most of his best music from his startling originality.<br /><br />Which is not to say that \\"Us\\" doesn't frequently strike its emotional target. \\"Blood Of Eden\\" and \\"Washing Of The Water\\" do find that emotional catharsis that Gabriel so obviously was trying to purge. \\"Only Us\\" and \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" meditate and shout at the causes of his loss, and \\"Fourteen Black Paintings\\" is clearly influenced from the \\"Last Temptation\\" compositions.<br /><br />What it leaves us with is a so-so album from an artist who frequently turned his emotional tumults into brilliant art (even the dramatic downer \\"Up\\" pushes this CD aside). While even a dodgy Peter Gabriel album puts most other artists to shame, there are other Gabriel CD's that would make a better purchase than \\"Us.\\" For me, this is the only CD post PG3 that is less than stellar.
0802130208|5.0|\\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is the standard by which all humorous and satirical novels should be measured. John Kennedy Toole's  wickedly profane masterpiece refutes the conventional wisdom is that \\"serious\\" literature is never a funny matter.<br /><br />Toole's principal character, the unforgettable Ignatius J. Reilly is an unlikely champion of the dispossessed and downtrodden. Toole's characterization of Ignatius Reilly is the comic equal of Joseph Heller's wise-ass bombardier Yossarian in \\"Catch 22\\", or Phillip Roth's sexually obsessed Alexander Portnoy in \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\".  Toole's characters are quirky denizens of the bottom rung of rigid social order in of New Orleans in the mid-1960s. It was an era when that rigid social was imploding from the tidal wave of the civil rights movement.<br /><br />Beneath the Toole's humor lies a darker message about the provincial attitudes of southerners and their deep seated intolerance for those who are different. Toole is exploring the same Southern Gothic territory as author Flannery O' Conner's world, but unlike O' Conner, Toole has absolutely no reverence for the rigid southern customs of civility. Toole's message was that southern society was not only intolerant to its black citizens but to anyone else who refused to fit into southern standards that governed conventional behavior.  Toole's prescription is to parody the intolerance of southern behavior as a farce. Like Great Britain's comic troupe, Monty Python, Toole spares no sacred cow in his humor and may offend the sensibilities of those in polite society. Even as he recklessly shoots from the hip when he aims his humor, Toole often creates most memorable comic moments, when he does so.<br /><br />A few years back, I presented \\"Confederacy\\" as my selection for a reading group I participated in. It was a rather staid group of serious readers. At our first meeting to discuss \\"Confederacy\\", nobody could read a passage or discuss events of the book without somebody erupting into gales of teary eyed laughing. The laughter was so highly contagious that soon everyone in the group would be consumed in a chorus of hyena-like laughter. After an hour or so, the fits of laughter took on a curious life of their own. Almost as soon as club members were sufficently calmed from a previous explosion of laughter, someone would blink and ignite yet another convulsive round of laughing. We finally had to adjourn discussion because everyone was too paralyzed with laughter to continue. In the end, the book club members agreed that \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" had serious literary merit, but those merits could not be discussed because the content of the book was just too damned funny.ary eyed laughing.

0385510454|2.0|I've always heard that description, explication and dialogue are, in some way, supposed to move the plot along. But, in this case, the dialogue is, basically, a guy learning to speak Italian (which is then translated into English so that the reader knows what is being said) while the description and explication sound like something lifted from the pages of a travel book. Meanwhile, the plot is barely moving and the suspense is more about WHEN will something happen than WHAT will happen. Sorry, Mr. G., this isn't your best.
B000127LW2|4.0|I think the idea of this series was a good one having the voyager sucked out into the delta quadrant 70,000 light years from earth. It starts out where the voyager is chasing marquise rebels who along with voyager get pulled across the galaxy by the caretaker who is searching for the right species to help take care of a planet it's kind had accidentally cause life on this certain planet to go underground due to unforeseen ecological damage it had caused to the planet. The caretaker is dying and eventually dies leaving voyager trying to figure someway to get back to federation space(it would take decades to do so). The Delta quadrant is full of hostile beings. One of the first is the Kazon. One of voyagers crew( who was one of the rebles at first(Seska)...and unbeknownest to them a disguised cardassian becomes one of the voyager's greatest enemies when she gives the kazon some federation tecnology. She escapes and starts helping the Kazon out including several raids on Voyager. Another enemy in the quadrant are the phageans who steal other races body parts to keep on living due a genectic disorder which deforms many of them called the phage. There are several run ins with them along the way. In all, it was a good idea to do this with this series because it has it's own uniqueness to it with a new series of protagonists and allies.
B0002OOUP0|4.0|\\"Jump Back\\" is a well assembled and reasonably well annotated overview of the Stones' 70s and 80s output. The sound is excellent, and almost everything that the casual fan could want is here. 74 minutes of tough, raunchy rock n' roll, from the gritty \\"Bitch\\" and the swaggering \\"Brown Sugar\\" to the soulful \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" and the ballad \\"Angie\\".    This is a quite reasonably priced compilation which really shows the depth of the Stones' collective talents and the variety of their music, blending rock n' roll, blues, R&B, and a little bit of country into a distinctive \\"Stones\\" sound, anchored by the greatest rhythm guitarist in the business, Keith Richards.  And this is a CD, right? So you can just program out the hideous disco-experimentalism of \\"Emotional Rescue\\" and the forgettable \\"Undercover Of The Night\\".    Compare this compilation with disc two of \\"Forty Licks\\" and you'll find that \\"Jump Back\\" blows \\"Licks\\" out of the water.  Coupled with \\"Hot Rocks: 1964-1971\\" (or the magnificent box set \\"The London Years\\"), this album provides the best career overview currently available.  If you don't want to spring for the Stones' original albums, this is the way to go.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Among the vanguard of the Second British Invasion of the 80's was a group dubbed the Fab Five.  These pretty boys got their name from Milo O'Shea's character in the Jane Fonda cult classic Barbarella.  I refer of course to Duran Duran, who during their peak years comprised of Simon LeBon (vocals), Andy Taylor (guitar), John Taylor (bass), Roger Taylor (drums), and Nick Rhodes (piano), he of the heavy makeup.  But the reason why Duran Duran stood over contemporaries like the Human League or Spandau Ballet was their MTV coverage and stylish videos and that certain edge they had in their mostly danceable pop tunes.<br /><br />Their first UK hits were \\"Planet Earth\\" and \\"Girls On Film.\\"  The first had a lively and upbeat synth backbeat much like Spandau Ballet or Berlin and is a standout.  The second, with rapid-fire camera snap effects, was the group's first UK Top Ten hit, and made notable by its racy Godley-and-Cr&egrave;me directed video.  Its chorus, where the title is sung twice in a row, the second at a lower pitch to make an accompanying and memorable couplet.  But they hit pay dirt when the superbly upbeat \\"Is There Something I Should Know\\" topped the UK charts-it later hit #4 in the US.  \\"Please please tell me now...\\"  Oh yes!<br /><br />Rio, which featured silk-screen girl album artwork from Nagel, had the title track, with a cascade of keyboards and drums, before settling into a more leisurely chorus-\\"my name is Rio and she dances on the sand...\\"  But love that sax solo in the middle of it all!  Also from that album, the #3 \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\" with a guitar riff that would later become hardened in the Power Station, featured catchy hooks in the chorus, great guitar from Andy Taylor, and a running pizzicato-like synth.<br /><br />Despite their hit power, they only had two US #1s.  The first was \\"The Reflex\\"-remember, \\"whyyyyyyyyy don't you use it?  Tryyyyyy not to bruise it\\"?  Definitely one of their best songs with Roger Taylor's power drumming.  The other was the title hit to Roger Moore's last James Bond outing, A View To A Kill, alternately upbeat and moody song with an airy synth, whose video had shots of DD mixed with film scenes to make it look like they were also in the movie.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\", with Andy Taylor's guitar riffs, and the tribal thumping drums and grinding guitar of their #2 hit \\"Wild Boys\\" seemed a prelude to the Power Station, the Robert Palmer-led side project which Andy and John Taylor joined during Duran Duran's hiatus.  When Andy and Roger Taylor left, DD did the Genesis thing-\\"and then there were three.\\"  Simon, John, and Nick released Notorious, whose funk-laced title track reached #2.  It was slightly different from their earlier oeuvre, but when the mid-paced \\"Skin Trade,\\" with its horn arrangements accompanying the usual synths, only charted at #39, it was clear DD was losing its audience.  A pity, as it's not that bad a song.<br /><br />Their last big hits came from their 1993 Wedding Album, which yielded a brace of more maturer and mellower singles, the reflective \\"Ordinary World\\" with a nice guitar solo from ex-Missing Person's guitarist and new member Warren Cuccurullo and majestic synths and vocals, and the moody \\"Come Undone\\" with high-pitched female vocalist singing the refrain.<br /><br />The songs are not in chronological order, not too big a complaint.  It supersedes their previous compilation Decade, which didn't include the two Wedding Album singles and \\"Serious\\" from their ignored 1990 Liberty album.  The grinding near-techno of \\"Electric Barbarella\\" from the John Taylor-less Medazzaland, seemed to show the band ironically coming full circle-remember where they got their name from?  Despite coming this late in the game, a great single by all means.  The fact that the original members got back together for Astronaut indicates that despite their brief splash from 1981 to 1984, they were one of the most important forces in the 80's music and fashion scene.  Take a bow, guys.c and fashion scene.  Take a bow, guys.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|There are only a handful of movies that I associate with my youth while growing up in the 80's.  \\"The Karate Kid\\" was definately one of them.  By taking a seemingly cliched premise about the student being taught by the master to avenge his honor, the filmmakers were able to inject a lot of warmth, humor and heart into the movie to make it an entirely unforgettable film.  Unfortunately, the sequels (as they rarely do) never lived up to the original with the fourth one (starring a young Hilary Swank) being a parody of itself.  But rather than bore you with inane details as to what I loved and hated about each film, I will describe the special features, which is the only reason to put up with the last two sequels.  A treat for \\"The Karate Kid\\" fans is a forty-five minute documentary on the filmmaking process from its origins to the final cut.  It was great seeing Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita, Martin Kove (Kreese) and William Zabka (Johnny) as they are today, describing their experiences while making the film.  Hearing Kove admit that his initial dislike for the director helped him to channel his character's anger was great. The \\"East Meets West: A Composer's Notebook\\" and \\"Life of Bonsai\\" featurette were basically fillers and only added trivial information about the film.  However, I was a little disappointed that the same amount of features weren't found on \\"The Karate Kid, Part II,\\" nor the other sequels, as bad as they were.  But it's the first film that I hold close to my heart and with the great features and affordable price, the collection is well worth the price.
0451526384|4.0|I have now read all of Austen's completed works and wrote reviews for all them as well ^-^. (I'm feeling very proud of myself by now) It's not my favorite, but it's definitely not the worst. And for Jane Austen, even the worst is an enjoyable, entertaining read; I only mean the worst compared to her other novels not on a general scale.<br /><br />To get down to the book, it was quite different from the others. Anne is twenty-eight at the start of the book, she is plain and unattractive having lost her `bloom' seven years earlier due to the loss of her love, and isn't as witty and sparkling as Elizabeth Bennet or Emma. Yet you don't come to despise her; she's not weak. And when you come to think of it, her agreeing to break off her engagement with the hero was a wise thing to do at her age. If he hadn't acquired a great fortune or perhaps died in service, then where would she be? Plus the fact that she was young and smothered with disapproval all around and the woman she thought of as her mother was dead against the match.<br /><br />So anyway, she also has the most despicable family out of any of Austen's other novels-even Mansfield Park-they are conceited, selfish and self-important. The sad thing is that you realize that people like Sir Walter really exist, people who care solely for appearances and rank. Even Anne's sister Mary, perhaps the nicest sister, is selfish without really meaning it, and treats Anne the way a spoiled child treats it's parents; nicely when it wants something, but all the while thinking: what else do they have in their lives to do but to cater to all my whims?<br /><br />There are a few trivial things I didn't like: first that Sir Walter Elliot is such a snob; Walter is my absolute favorite name! Austen gave it a pretty bad impression. Secondly, I wish that James could have married Anne; I really liked him, much better than the hero, and he suited her so well! I didn't really like the hero of this book; I'm a sucker for the rich, dashing gentlemen of her other novels. You don't really know the hero of this book so well.<br /><br />Anyway, like all her books, the prose is outstanding, her usage of the language remarkable and the reader's attention is never lost; Austen's greatest gift. I have always loved Austen's style of writing, it's great! Great book, highly recommended! Add it to your classics shelf. Don't have one?

B000244FDW|2.0|So rarely do I disagree with the majority of Amazon reviewers that I watched this movie twice, so as to be sure I felt the same way after viewing it again. <br /> <br />While it is true that the script follows the dialogue of the novel more closely than does the later production, I cannot see how it is more true to the book. I feel it fails in some of the most interesting aspects of the book in that it doesn't capture the comedy and is far from being light, bright and sparkeling as JA herself described the story. Tongue in cheek she mentions in a letter that it 'wants more shade'. It seems to me that the actors and director introduced a bit too much shade.  <br /> <br />I respect Fay Weldon but take issue with the way she wrote the script to have the actors repeat what is actually narration in the book. This makes for very uncomfortable and heavy dialogue, which the actors are incapable of carrying off. Further, their acting is very wooden, and I do not find Rintoul in the least handsome except in profile, and while Elizabeth Garvie is a pretty girl, the actress who played Jane has the beautiful eyes that should be necessary in the actress who plays Lizzie's part. <br /> <br />I found myself not caring in the least if Darcy and Lizzie or Jane and Mr. Bingley finally get together as there was no chemistry between those actors at all.  The actresses who played Lydia and Kitty were much too old for the part, as was the actress who played Mrs. Bennet. After all, Jane is but almost 23 and her mother surely would not have been more than 43 and was a beauty in her day.  Overall I felt almost the entire core cast was actually mis-cast.  Every single actor is entirely forgettable. <br /> <br />The music was reminsiscent of an old BBC soap opera.  <br /> <br />I gave this movie 2 stars because the sets and costuming were spot on and is leaps and bounds better than the worst P&P production of all time - that horrible 1940's Greer Garson movie where they are wearing Victorian,instead of Georgian/Regency clothing.  <br /> <br />I don't find the Ehle and Firth production in the least dumbed down and far prefer it.  In fact, that production has been more instrumental in bringing the works of Jane Austen to the 20th and 21st centuries than any other because it includes all the major elements, though perhaps not all the dialogue of the book. It captured the spirit of the book <br /> <br />If you are a Janeite, by all means rent this movie. But do rent before you buy.  <br /> <br />The happiest part for me is that while I did buy the movie, I got an excellent deal on it, or I am afraid I would have felt even more disappointed than I do.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I have to admit that I *loved* this movie much more than I thought.  The previews I saw made me immediately disinterested, but I just signed up for Blockbuster's Online Rental Service (and I have been a renting FOOL), so I figured what the heck. <br /> <br />From the start I was hooked.  It was not what I expected.  Over and over again I am surprised by how great a talent Jamie Foxx is.  I have loved him since his In Living Color days, and lemme tell ya - this is quite a departure. <br /> <br />The movie moves quickly, but it's not difficult to keep up.  The action is great, the dialogue is even better.  Jamie and Tom were in perfect form and they couldn't have picked a better pair. <br /> <br />The only thing that keeps me from giving the movie 5 stars is the ending.  Like another reviewer said, kismit action movie formula kicked in - the ending was abrupt, and slightly disappointing. <br /> <br />I still must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next.  I'd watch it again, and would like to own it.
078062999X|5.0|Teachers:  This is the best version to show in the classroom.  It sticks to the play verbatim.  Branagh is excellent and carries the play, although like all actors who play Hamlet, he is too old for the part.  The presence of Billy Crystal and Robin Williams adds absolutely nothing to the play. Jack Lemmon and Charlton Heston add more than the other two clowns.  Kate Winslet does a fine job.  I highly recommend this.
0385335482|1.0|I picked up this book hoping for a light read and what I ended up with is a book with a main character so repulsive that I could not finish the book. <br /> <br />If I could give negative stars I would !! <br /> <br />Do not pay to read this waste of paper !!!
0375759174|5.0|This is perhaps the most childish (I mean that in a nice way) of Jane Austen's books. It's good for even teens my age to read and enjoy because it's shorter, with a more obvious side of humor to it than the other novels. (I have never minded reading classics; my friends think I'm weird but...I don't care!) Jane Austen seems to be laughing up her sleeve at her own story and its characters. It's a satire of Mrs. Radcliffe's novels and the stereotype heroes of the age and she often refers to Catherine as `a heroine' and compares her plights to those of other heroines. It's really very funny and some of the situations Kate finds herself in are highly entertaining.<br /><br />Gone is the restraint and almost painfully polite atmosphere. This is really the only Austen book where you don't feel that suffocating blanket of manners and what's proper all around you. The heroine speaks pretty plainly, and the hero openly teases both her and his sister (and is very cute ^-^). The ending is pretty shocking and totally unexpected. My mom is almost psychic when it comes to guessing plots and their outcomes but even she didn't know what was coming when she read this book.<br /><br />This is also the only Austen book (besides Pride and Prejudice) that got me to laugh out loud. It has a priceless section about how most heroines would never deign to touch a novel; if they picked one up by accident they would be sure to put it back down in disgust. However, Catherine is more than ready to read novels with her friend Isabella; books like The Mysteries of Udolpho, though she wouldn't like to admit it. When the hero-much to her dismay-finds out, he entirely approves. They have the cutest romance, and I really like the naïve Catherine as the heroine.<br /><br />The only thing about the book I didn't like was the soppy friendship between Catherine and Isabella. When Catherine is slightly late meeting her friend, Isabella says this sickeningly sweet phrase to her, \\"Where have you been, darling? I have been waiting for you this past hour!\\" (Not an exact quotation, but something along those lines) I much prefer Henry's sister as her friend. There is actually a really god contrast between the beautiful Isabella and the quiet shy sister who turns out to be the better and more deserving friend. And Catherine is such an imaginative heroine, who reminds a bit of Anne of Green Gables with her flights of fancy that end hilariously!<br /><br />I really liked this book and will probably read it again soon along with Emma and Pride and Prejudice. I'd like to see the movie also. Great book, and a great place to start reading Austen's novels. Highly recommendeddarling?

B000002LKF|5.0|Different than any other PS album, but still great. \\"The Cool, Cool River\\" is possibly one of the best songs ever written. Hard to write a review for an album that I've listened to for so long. Words don't begin to explain it.
0767834739|5.0|Yep, it's for real.  There have been very few times in my life where a sequel to a movie was as good to me as the first movie, but this is one of those times.    It was great from start to finish!  Tons of action, excellent special effects, and great storyline.  A previous reviewer mentioned that you might better understand and enjoy this movie if you've played the video games, and I will admit that he has a very valid point.    I am a big fan of the games, so this movie was perfect in my eyes.  I thought they did a fantastic job, especially with Nemesis.  I swear it was like he walked out of the video game and into the movie.  The special effects make-up guys are unbelieveably talented!    If you're a RE fan, you won't be disappointed.
B00006SFBD|5.0|First off, when you look at the track number you will realize that there are only 6 songs.  Yeah, I know you will have thought \\"What the...\\"  Well, I'll also tell you that their 4th song \\"For Absent Friends\\" is only 2:17!  That makes 5 songs that actually have words in them.  Well, the disk itself is over an hour.  Amazingly, these songs are longer than most of their previous stuff. <br /> <br />   Without 5 songs with 10+ minutes, you know you will get even more depth from the songs than Blackwater Park, although that album is the easiest to get into.  I will also tell you that this album is HEAVY AS HELL at times.  I've figured out a song structure in these songs - they go from heavy and unmelodic to a buildup of eery tunes.  In easy terms, the beginnings of the songs aren't likely to attract you as the end of the songs.  Yet, the buildup is tremendous.  You'll probably read other reviews of this buildup.  One reviewer had mentioned that the ending of \\"Deliverance\\" has this mysterious and mesmorizing tune.  And yes, he is on the target. <br /> <br />   The reason this is my favorite album is because it is seriously intricate.  It's been a hard choice for me though.  Some people don't like the direction Opeth is going, but that is only for critics, as they've pretty much stayed consistent.  Add this to your list okay?  kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk <br /> <br />  by the way, master's apprentices rules like many ppl have been saying
B00005JN2Z|3.0|If television tells me anything, it's that many people in America have had the unfortunate experience of being held by the ankles while their head is dunked into a flushing toilet. <br /> <br />Personally I'd never experienced this.  I was quite content with this, I might add.  Then I watched this DVD. <br /> <br />I now know what it is like, as the conclusion of this movie is quite akin to the director giving you a swirlie, only more humiliating. <br /> <br />The movie begins quite strong and quite well.  However, Michael Mann seems to enjoy advertising this as an intelligent film.  It is quite the opposite.  Towards the end of the movie there is a car accident.  This is when all logic goes out the window and the film bows down to the standards expected in a mindless action movie.  Horrific accidents without seatbelts yield little damage.  Professionals forget their incriminating laptops.  Professionals forget how to fire a gun.  The planets align and convenient coincidences are abound. <br /> <br />The director explains that you need a brain for this film.  The first 3/4 seem to use the brain.  However, the last quarter entirely asks that you turn that brain off, forget all you know about life, logic, and what the movie has told you, and baa like a sheep. <br /> <br />3 stars because it begins well.  I feel as if it should be worse, though, as it's amongst the most infuriatingly insulting films I've ever seen.
B0002S943O|5.0|I saw Depeche Mode live in Copenhagen in 2001, and I was quite dissapointed in their performance back then. The Paris 2001 DVD wasn't much better - Dave's voice simply wasn't as good as it had been (not to mention that the Exciter material wasn't the best the band had done). This concert, however, is superb - Dave's vocal performance is really amazing, and the full band is at their best. <br /> <br />The set-list is great, featuring a nice ballance of newer songs from the Faith and Devotion album, mixed with old classics. Of course we'll all have some favorites which we would have liked to see included (I, personally, sorely miss One Caress and Strangelove, and would have preferred A Question Of Lust rather than Stripped or Behind The Wheel, but that's a detail). The song arrangement is great, and the song order works very well, even though I was quite supprised to find the song Fly On The Windscreen in the encore - I'm only a casual DM fan, and have never heard this song before - and found it very dull - so I think it would have been much better to either leave out this track or place it earlier in the setlist, and take in a greater hit in the encore. <br /> <br />The sound is great, and makes the music a real pleassure to listen to. Also, the sound editing is fine. <br /> <br />As to the visuals - the filming is a bit dark, but this is done intentionally to emphasize the visuals on the 9 smaller screens along the seperation of the upper and lower level of the stage, and this works great. Even though the lighting from the lights over the stage is limited, the overall visual result is great, and fully captures the live atmosphere. The somewhat unusual stage layout also works very well in my oppinion, and I think it's a pity that they discarded this one the second leg of the tour. <br /> <br />As to the extras, I think they are great. The two extra songs from the set ARE on disc 1 in my region 2 version of this release - I'd like to have them re-edited back into theset, but they haven't done that. The documentary and the interview with Antoni Corbijn are very interesting. The promotional videos are nice extras, even if they have been released elsewhere. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, this is a release everybody with some interest in DM should own - it features the band at their very best, and is among the strongest live recordings I own. <br /> <br />Rating: 10/10
0792838068|5.0|To me, this is one of the best romantic films that you can get your hands on.  If you are interested in seeing a pure love, one that is not focused purely on sex, but instead emotional and mental connectiveness, then this is the film for you.  While others will argue that this is not the best date film, I would beg to differ. Leaving Las Vegas would be a perfect choice for a first date film over anything that Meg Ryan or the recycle bin of Hollywood has to offer.  It is a gripping story of realistic love, and the dramatic consequences of giving your heart to someone.  It is about dreams, companionship, and the hurdles of everyday romance.  This is a film that proves that the darker underbelly of our society still has a shimmering light of hope and love.  Director Mike Figgis has done an outstanding job of giving these two rich characters the right elements to build upon the \\"classic\\" love-story moments, while giving it a flavor uniquely his own. Figgis' mixture of gritty Vegas with the beautiful jazz sounds really created the ambiance of love and pushed these two ugly ducklings closer towards their transformation into love. I think that is what really captured me on this film, was that it was similar to the love stories that Hollywood continually releases, except it gave us two tragic characters instead of these bubbly, money isn't everything, characters that seem to be repetitive cogs in the Hollywood machine.<br /><br />Let me explain this further.  When you think of a love story, what are the elements that you consider?  You have a guy and a girl (normally), they have this coincidental moment where they find their common bond, they are held back by either an internal or external dilemma, there is a factor of insecurity, and finally the dramatic ending where the two rush together at a predisclosed location (normally an airport).  Does that sound familiar in any way?  These are all elements that you can find in LLV.  I have seen this film at least a dozen times, and for some odd reason it was this viewing that it just seemed to click for me.  This is the perfect American love story told with a darker tone.  While most will see this as nothing more than the story of a drunk trying to kill himself and a graphic scenes with a prostitute, I saw it as the classic story of love.  All the elements are present.  Ben and Sera coincidentally meet one night, both seeking companionship and without the pressures of sex, they immediately form this bond that will never be broken.  Through Ben's drunkenness, he remembers her and continually wants to see her.  They both have internal factors that hold them back, Sera's is prostitution while Ben's is his drinking.  Even through there are these factors, they still find themselves together.  That feeling of insecurity is even there when Sera arrives home one night to find Ben with someone else.  It all seems to fit.  Then there is the amazing ending that will either have you in rapture or in awe.  These two are in love, and it isn't this bubbly love between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, it is truths of America finding the dream of compassion.<br /><br />The only unnecessary moments that I felt could have been fine-tuned were those involving Julian Sans.  I just couldn't capture his character.  I needed a bit more back-story or perhaps more interactions between him and Sera.  Something was missing that distracted from the scenes that they shared.  Outside of this one element, the rest of the film was purely flawless and even at times carnal.  For example, when Sera has the opportunity to be on her own, she chooses to forego her independence and be with Ben.  Shue and Figgis both demonstrate that perhaps Sera is not in love with Ben, but instead the concept of a man wanting to be with her because of who she is.  It is obvious that Sera seeks companionship, and probably has never had it all her life, when suddenly Ben struts into the picture.  This may explain why she continues to work when she doesn't have to.  She is used to the job, she thrives for the intensity, and perhaps uses it to fall deeper in love with Ben.  Figgis doesn't come out and give you a reason why Sera continues along her path, but instead leaves it up to your imagination and enjoyment.  Leaving Las Vegas felt like a combination Breaking the Waves, Love Liza, and All the Real Girls.  This is a love story with so many different human elements coming to you at once that the average viewer would probably ignore the signs and see this as a depressing film.  While it isn't the lightest film of the ages, it does prove that \\"Love is a very splendid thing\\".<br /><br />I cannot end this review without at least mentioning the amazing acting done by both Nicolas Cage and Elizabeth Shue.  The chemistry between them is rare in Hollywood.  I felt that these two really made this film and were just not placed in their roles to sell tickets.  Cage really felt comfortable and understood his character while Shue fit perfectly with her secrets and heart.  It is obvious why Cage won the Oscar for his role in this film, and while I am sure we will never see him take a role like this again (thanks to summer blockbusters), it was good to see him take a role that really redefined the romance genre.  The same goes for Shue.  While she hasn't really made another film like this one in a very long time (outside of Adventures in Babysitting), it is good to know that she can take on roles like this and have the guts to follow through.<br /><br />Overall, this was a very powerful and emotional film for me.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****'t have to.

B0001LJCMK|3.0|First of all, the druming is so damn solid. He hits his drums harder than the chinese algibra. And the songwriting is brilliant.  How can you listen to \\"Kiss the Devil\\" without getting the insatiable urge to snort a bunch of coke off a stripper's ass and have sex all over the back seat of your dad's BMW, then proceed to murder the baby jesus on a sacrificial alter in the church of Rock and Roll. And unless everyone talking ill of this album is some accomplished anal-retentive music producer, I don't see why y'all are complaining about the quality of the vocals, the quality of the guitar tone, or even the musicianship. Go back to Gilliard fags. This is rawdoggin' rock and roll.
0316172324|5.0|I loved the Tipping Point and had to see what Malcom's latest book was about. Wow. I'm just blown away by the information in this book and the insight into why our first impressions are right sometimes and wrong other times. I highly recommend this book.
B000002GA8|5.0|As said our collegue J.B.Fresno, from Madrid, Spain, this tune isn't a masterpiece of the classical music, as himself tought when was 17. I really appreciate to know he become a grow person but I can't resist to say that the most of the 17yo person would like to find sounds that says something to their ears, sounds that merge with their youth... and, I'd like to go far: a lot of people that, as my self (i'm 46), is older than 17 like to hear and feel tunes like that... If you wanna to hear a good rock and roll music, don't miss that! And if you like to hear classical music, well, don't miss Amazon's index about that.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I never really considered Cher as an artist to recon with - oh well, I new the hits, and I even liked quite a few of them, but I never really took her seriously. However, this show, with it loads of everything-but-serious extravaganza, actually proves her to be a very good singer, and an entertainer that deserves huge respect. <br /> <br />First ... make an experiment: Put on this DVD, without turning on your TV set, just listen to the music (or take the seperate CD release with the music from the show). What is easily forgotten in all the costume changes and wigs is, that this live performance is really amazing. This is all live, and Cher does an amazing vocal performance - and her full band plays without a single error. Most of the songs performed here are actually way better than the studio versions (highlights are All Or Nothing, I Found Someone, Bang Bang, All I Really Want To Do, The Way Of Love, After All, Just Like Jesse James, The Shoop Shoop Song and Believe). She actually performs U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For better than U2 - and yes, I'm a fan of U2. Also, 3 bonus songs are added, which are all great - We All Sleep Alone is a favorite of mine. <br /> <br />However, the visuals of this show is a complete world in it's own. Seven full costume changes are performed ('full' meaning everything from top to bottom including the wig is changed), and I won't even try to describe the costumes - fancyfull is too bland a word to use in this context. Minimalistic, if only in size and not in looks, is not beside the point, however. Imagine your 60 year old grandma turning up in an outfit consisting only of pailletes on strings, and which you could probably hold in your fisted hand. Well ... I can't help quote her from an earlier performance: \\"My mother told me, that when I was 2 years old I use to run around naked and sing ... And now I do it for a living.\\" <br /> <br />But this is Cher, and she gets away with it - probably because she considers herself with a lot of irony and humor - her monologues to the audience are simply fabulous, and had me howling with laughter. Let me quote: \\"We have to have these costume changes, cause otherwise drag queens all over the world will be calling each other tomorrow, saying 'I saw the Cher show last night - no costume changes, no wigs ... Do you think she's lost the will to live?'.\\" And no, she deffenitely hasn't, as she concludes. <br /> <br />The stage show is nothing but spectacular - dancers on the stage as well as above it, acrobats, an animated elephant, you name it, it's there. And lots of clips from movies and videos on the giant screen above the stage - enough to keep a dozen of eyes occupied without any of them seing the same thing. She wanted to make, not the greatest show, but the Cherest show on earth, and she deffenitely succeded. <br /> <br />The sound on this release is unfortunately the one very weak spot - I guess that's why they released the CD to accompagny the DVD. The sound mix is horrible - I don't know whoever did it, but that person ought to start looking for another job immediately. The sound is fine most of the time, but each time the music gets more quite, the volume on the vocals gets extremely high. This happens quite a lot of times during the show, and it sounds awfull. <br /> <br />The extras are great - not only does it include 3 songs not featured in the TV broadcasted version of the concert (Save Up All Your Tears, We All Sleep Alone and A Different Kind Of Love Song) but also her remake of The West Side Story in which she does - of course - star in all the roles. Go figure ... this is hilarious. <br /> <br /> <br />In conclusion, this DVD captures Cher at her best, and everybody interested in the music of the last 50 years should have this DVD - after seeing this, you no longer are in doubt why she managed to be a central figure in showbussiness for 40 years (!). The show is quite probably unlike anything we will ever see again, and it is with a certain amount of regret that we say goodbye to Cher with this DVD, cause who could ever really take her place? As the diva says herself: \\"There are all these young girls coming along to take ... well, they are not going to take my place, but they are coming to take somebody's place ... Britney, J.Lo or whatever they're called.\\" <br /> <br />Rating: 9/10 (One point sadly lost due to lousy sound mix)
B000005HFH|5.0|Chet has a voice like no other.  The guy knows exactly what he's doing and it shows.  We could compare his modest phrasing to the one of Miles Davis.  And oh my god, the emotion he tranmits, it's incredible ; he truly lives the songs he sings like i've rarely heard another jazz singer do.  And you should hear him scat!  He scats like he plays the trumpet...  I recommend this record to anybody who likes good music with a humanly touch... Chet Baker gives me goosebumps and he's an \\"hors-pair\\" singer and musician if you want to know what I think....
B0002EXH54|5.0|When this album came out, it was quite evident Dave didnt need Lars or James (of Metallica, his former band)    It was sort of giving the finger to them actually, and divided the thrash community. Into Megadeth fans Or Metallica Fans.  Sure their was some that liked both, but i recall fights breaking out over this rivalry. Anyway Back To Megadeth.    This is Old school Thrash And to see it re-mastered like this... is amazing.. it will be heard like it was SUPPOSED to. By definition that's amazingly, even more hellish and rocking then the original production wise.    SO I have decided to review this classic thrash album, to make this review Fairplay I WILL LISTEN to EACH song before I review it.   Rather then basing it on what I can remember.     Each of these reviews are obviously my opinion, but may offer you insight into this CD.         1) Wake Up Dead (3:57) - Starts off amazingly, Chris and Dave definitely shine here.Rythm is well done, and very catchy. The main guitar solo's are amazing, and come back down to earth with some fast paced rythm afterwards charging right back into the lyrics. Then a cool down of silence, and a very cool eerie guitar part that bounces along. 5/5         2) The Conjuring (5:02) - Great guitar opening, evil sounding vocals with another chugging along rythm. First solo bounces along fast paced and leads back into fast paced lyrics. Lot's of rythm changes in this one, Never gets repetitive.A Megadeth Favourite. 5/5         3) Peace Sells (4:02) -Catchy bassline followed by a short guitar solo to enter, Very aggrivated vocals which suit it well. Cheesy lyrics, but Who cares?  Lot's of guitar noodling on this one between lyrics. Great beat. This is definately a classic song. 5/5         4) Devils Island (5:05) - Very eerie guitar part at the start. Then followed by a cool bass part, launching right into lyric + rythm hell. Very pounding, perfect vocals, suiting the song perfectly. Great solos. 5/5         5) Good Mourning/Black Friday(6:39) - Good Mourning starts out extremely eerie and is AMAZING, Mustaine is great at those eerie  parts on this album. After that it enters Black Friday which is extremely Thrashy, and has cool rythm...but i find a little tedious compared to the rest. 4/5         6) Bad Omen(4:03) - cool guitar opening, infact amazing. Once the lyrics start, it's average.Not a megadeth classic. But the solo is awesome. But other then the begining and the solo its average for them. 4/5         7) Aint superstitious(2:45)- cover song, very weird hearing this version. Very cool guitar noodling between lyrics, cool solo, but not that great of a song. 3.5/5         8) My Last words(4:55) - Very cool eerie begining once again. They are all over the place on this album. Great vocals, one of my fave songs on the album, if not MY FAVOURITE.Great catchy song with a solo that just bounces along. 5/5      --------------  BONUS: The Bonus songs are just mixes/demo tapes, And are weak compared to the Bonus's on other megadeth remastereds.    3/5 for the Bonus tracks. They are worth at least one listen. And were tossed in with the remastered so that's cool.  --------------
B0002X314C|5.0|Don't be fooled, there's a good reason why John Legend will be joining his producer Kanye West on stage at the Grammys. He's got talent. Without a doubt, Kanye has put a lot of faith and trust in John's ability and for a good reason. Alicia Keys wouldn't have him open up for her on tour if he couldn't hack it. Lucky for her. She need not worry because John Legend can carry his own weight and this album proves it. Nothing but solid soul. And he can keep his last name because he's going to need it. But you don't have to question my praise, just go to AOL Music and listen to his live studio sessions and tell me how many contemporary R&B singers could have pulled off something like that. Not many. That's what makes Legend an extraordinary artist to watch. He's a craftsman working every inch of his art. It's not everyday that you get to experience something this groundbreaking. And it's groundbreaking because R&B has lost so much of what is was known for in the past. This album is brave when you think about it. Legend's style of R&B isn't what's popular on radio, but it should be. This CD is a classic from top to bottom. People will still be talking about him 20 years from now because his music has made an unmistakable impression. John Legend is helping pave the way for genuine talent to really surface. And you can't argue with a voice like his because it's not going to give you any room for errors. You'll have to earn it the hard way. John Legend is truly the master of his own domain. <br /> <br /> <br />

0312319517|5.0|I listen to a several audio books a month and have to rate this book probably the best that I have heard or read all year.<br /><br />The book keeps you wanting to keep reading, and the ending is very good too.
159413023X|5.0|For the most part, my short list of recommendations of new literature is rather predictable: &quot;My Fractured Life,&quot; &quot;Secret Life of Bees,&quot; &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot; but the one outsider to the list is &quot;The Lovely Bones.&quot; This is an amazingly captivating novel told from a totally unique prospective  a girl who was brutally murdered. It fully deserves its recommendation among the other outstanding novels.
B0006399FS|1.0|there's something we have to face in that bono is a sub-par lyricist. he's written the same stuff over and over again that we (or at least I) can no longer believe that he still means it and/or has better materiel in him. when \\"the edge\\" pulls out the same crap, it's not a lack of ideas, it's \\"vinage U2\\". the straight fact is that this record is so boring, dull. this is trying to find the gem in utter mediocre dad rock when any judgement past mediocre would be lying to yourself. the people who like this album and the previous one are those that would shun \\"stuck in a moment\\" and a majority of ATYCLB as worthless if it came from any other band. the disaster that was ATYCLB is renewed here. when U2 dont rock out, they have little to say that isn't tired as hell. i can't even get through the entire album in one go. <br /> <br />once the novelty of listening to \\"The New U2 Record\\" wears off, you're not going to be playing this one at all. <br /> <br />
0805047905|5.0|My son got this book for x-mas, right from the beginning at 5 months he would love it when I would say \\"brown bear, brown bear what do you see\\", now he is six months old and he gets so excited and starts to laugh as soon as he sees the book.  It is simple but an adorable book!
068987474X|1.0|So, yeah, I am one of the many single women who got suckered into buying this stupid book.  Even though a friend of mine promised me she would let me borrow hers (since she had it on her Christmas list), I couldn't wait and I ran out to buy my own copy to see what all of the talk was really about.  I heard wonderful things about this book only to find out that I was flipping page after page with my forehead scrunched in confusion, eyes rolling into the back of my head and searching deep into this horrible book for some reality.  As I painfully made it to the last page, I felt cheated.  I cannot make myself believe that people are actually buying the garbage that this duo has printed and advertised for sale.   <br /> <br />Sure, some people may say, \\"oh she must be one of those women who defend men and their stupid ways\\" or \\"she's in denial.\\"  Honestly, I'm not a defender nor am I in denial.  I know how men can be, but women can be just the same.   <br /> <br />I just want people to know how truly awful this book was.  Most of the advice given is just common sense anyway.  But some things were just dead wrong.  Some letters to Greg seemed like they were pulled out of YM or Seventeen.  Women, if you honestly think that your music director boyfriend loves you even though he's out on the road partying with other chics, you need more than a book to straighten your life out. <br /> <br />Sorry Greg.  I am just not that into your book.
B000002UAU|5.0|First of that idiot who said that Oasis is better than the beatles is a joke. How could the beatles steal an idea from a band that wasn't even born during the time that they made this album. This album is just an array of great songs one after the other. The way they knitted the songs together into a orchastra of talent. There use of different instruments and sounds including farm animals and large symphonies. This is definatly on of the top 5 greatest albums of all time.
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend got me attention with Used to Love you but slow jam Ordinary People made me cop this (for 9$ at Walmart) quickly. I have to say I was blown away by this man's talent. Many people have slept on this album. It does have a Neo soul groove to it but its sexy, soulful, and inspiring what R&B cats have been failing to realize you dont have to have club bangers to sell records. <br />Alright, Used to love you, She dont have to know, Ordinary People, I can change, and Stay with you are joints you should listen to. <br />Lets get lifted again is pure love making at its best.
B00000DD2D|5.0|Anyone put off by the \\"all-star\\" supporting cast on this tribute to the late Chicago blues legend Jimmy Rogers, which is an understandable thing based on other such offerings out there, is missing the point. The point is this is a good, solid effort throughout the disc. If you're new to the blues, this is a good, accessible intro. If you're a longtime blues aficionado, this is still strong; this is not \\"blues for kids\\". He gets help from the best: Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, Taj Mahal, Robert Plant, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, Jimmy D Lane, Kim Wilson on harmonica, Johnny Johnson on piano, even Stephen Stills. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the last track, John Lee Hooker's \\"Gonna Shoot You Right Down (Boom Boom)\\" is good stuff. Rogers himself sings the vocals and plays guitar on the tracks and sounds great. He passed before the album was released, but musically, he went out strong with this one. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the blues.

B0006399FS|1.0|This crap is a desperate and bold attempt to get a younger and more innocent audience by the means of sounding more mainstream. <br /> <br />The thing that bothers me the most is that they agonized over this album. I was contstantly on their website over the last year watching all their news and interviews with the band, and I got the impression that this was gonna be something really special considering how much time and effort was being given. But the result ended up being what sounded like a reunion drinks in Bono's basement playing with some pawn shop equipment, out of ideas, dusted off some old pawn shop gear, pressed record, played for a couple hours, and called it a day. I think more time was spent designing the CD/DVD 'artwork' ( by the way, as awful as the music presented here ). My 59 years old father can sing far better than Bono.  <br /> <br />I don't know why they pretend to be 'ambassadors of justice and the human rights' with iPod commercials and sunglasses. <br /> <br />This album is purely marketing that is propelling this heap of musical trash.

B000000YG5|5.0|If there is one Sonny Rollins album that you should own then this is it. \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" is a real gem and is certainly one of the best jazz albums ever made. <br /> <br />Sonny Rollins is a great saxophonist who on this occasion has a rythmn section right up to his level which has not been the case on many other of his albums. <br /> <br />I have now had this record for six moths and continue to play it almost every day and enjoy it just as much as the first listening. That is how good it is! It is a shame that modern jazz is rarely up to the level of the legends of the 50'S and 60's.

B00000I8UJ|5.0|This is a record with a great amount of swing and superb musicianship. All members supporting Dexter do a great job. As for Dex this record puts him up in the top league with the all time greats such as Sonny Rollins and Stan Getz. \\"Cheesecake\\" and \\"Love for Sale\\" are my favourates.
0440180295|5.0|I could add to the volumes of literary criticism that fills the reviews of this book, but what's the point of that? Rather, I will recommend that you hear the book as a book on tape - the book's a stream of consciuosness, disjointed approach works very well on tape. The reader shifts from one scene to another as easily as Billy Pilgrim does. The version I heard was not the one available here. Mine was narrated by Jose Ferrer and he did a wonderful job. Too bad Ferrer has passed on. So it goes.
0451526384|5.0|Persuasion is one of my favourite novels by Jane Austen. Like in all her other novels Jane Austen describes with wit and style the life of a cute heroin. At that point Anne Elliot is slightely different, because she found her real love when she was a young woman, but she had to break her engagement, because the family matters wanted her to. After a few years she still loves the man she broke up with. As she meets him again a couple of years later, he has made a lot of money as Captain . At first they try to keep out of their way, but that seems to be impossible. They meet eachother really often, because the relatives of Anne want him to mary one of their daughters. The love is still there , in both of them, but manners and doubts make it impossible to tell.<br /><br />Like in all Jane Austen's novels there are implications and disaccords that let you always hope for a Happy End .<br /><br />And for my opinion Jane Austen wrote the most romantic loveletter in that book.
B0001O3YD0|2.0|I bought the Unrated Director's Cut of this film with great anticipation.  I loved the theatrical release of Pitch Black.  It is one of my favorite science fiction films, hands down.<br /><br />But the Unrated Director's Cut?  Is a waste of money.  The additions to the film were so few and so subtle, I barely noticed them.  The Unrated part?  More violence?  Not noticeably.  More cussing?  More bare skin?  No, neither of those.  And the extras?  Are almost non-existent.  There's nothing on this DVD that I didn't get on the first one, except some hype about the sequel, and not even that was very convincing.  Seriously, if you already own this film on DVD, don't waste your money on this reissue.<br /><br />If you don't own this film on DVD, see if you can find the original release.  At least it has the theatrical trailers.
B00005U122|5.0|This DVD collects a show Roger did in Portland Oregon, in 2000.  The setlist:    1. In The Flesh (4:41)  2. Another Brick In The Wall (7:27)  3. Mother (5:36)  4. Get Your Filthy Hands Of My Desert/Southampton Dock (3:11)  5. Pigs On The Wing (1:18)  6. Dogs (16:26)  7. Welcome To The Machine (6:57)  8. Wish You Were Here (4:54)  9. Shine On You Crazy Diamond (14:20)  10. Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun (7:15)  11. Breathe (3:22)  12. Time (6:24)  13. Money (6:11)  14. Every Stranger's Eyes (5:19)  15. The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range (5:05)  16. Perfect Sense (7:06)  17. It's A Miracle (8:30)  18. Amused To Death (9:24)  19. Brain Damage/Eclipse (5:50)  20. Comfortably Numb (8:10)  21. Each Small Candle (8:17)      Though the soul of the original Floyd might not be here, Roger has an excellent backing band, and he gives them a chance to flex their muscles. It takes four guitarists and two keyboardists to do the parts originated by David Gilmour and Richard Wright. And in another surprise, Roger doesn't sing the parts originally sung by David and Rick, guitarist Doyle Bramhall and keyboardist Jon Carin handle those passages. The live versions are almost all improvements, especially Mother(where a female singer does the Mother's voice) and Welcome To The Machine(which now has a more solid rythm section). There's even a degree of showmanship; during a long keyboard solo on Dogs, Roger and his guitarists reacreate the classic \\"Dog's Playing Poker\\" painting. The album that's best represented on this show would be Wish You Were Here, with all but one song covered, followed by Dark Side Of The Moon. But we also get the early gem from A Saucerful Of Secrets, and some of Roger's solo material, including a new song, Each Small Candle. There's also an option that some will like and some will not: an option to see the song lyrics as subtitles. This is a default feature, so if you don't want the subtitles, you must go to special features and fix it before you play the show. Now if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go watch this yet again.

B00068IOWM|1.0|How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is the inevitable result of U2's long, slow slide towards VH1 easy-listening coffee-table schmaltz that began with 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'.     Listening to this CD is a real torture. U2 are truly out of ideas. The same rotten formula they worn on 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'. There's absolutely nothing innovative here. Artificial 'emotion', lame music, lifeless, tuneless, monotonous, dull, boring, mainstream, annoying and pointless. Virtually unlistenable. We really don't need this overhyped (...). It's just an excuse to tour again. This is one of the biggest letdown in my music-buying history.     (...) The songs are repetitive, drawn out and lack any great melody. He no longer sounds like he's SINGING anymore and seems to just to strain to hit the high notes. SO ANNOYING !.   This album contains the worst U2 ever tunes:     'Vertigo'   'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own'   'Love And Peace Or Else'   'All Because Of You'   'A Man And A Woman'   'One Step Closer' and   'Original Of The Species'     Do you want to have 'The Worst of U2'?, so BUY THIS ALBUM NOW !!... I almost forgot: \\"I can't wait for the new Tour !!\\", \\"U2 are back to Rock !!\\"...     Could U2 be any more of a self-absorbed jerk? Has there been a single awards show, sporting event, or other overwrought extravaganza in recent years where they haven't shown up to put in yet another insufferable performance? Those questions are rhetorical, by the way...
B00003CXCT|1.0|How dare George Lucas desecrate my childhood like this!!! Sure, go ahead George butcher my precious Star Wars a little more. The Special Features documentary is kick ass. The rest of it is just depressing. By rest of it I mean, the poor CG effects, the deleted scenes that never should have been added in, the pitiful new Jabba the hut scene.

B000002UR7|3.0|The alternating bars of 12/8 and 11/8 that drive \\"Pablo Honey's\\" opening track, \\"You,\\" should have given some indication to the masses that Radiohead would not be forever content to dwell in indie rock's lo-fi world. Though a solid debut effort, \\"Pablo Honey\\" gives little indication that Radiohead would go on to influence an entire generation of bands (Coldplay, Travis, Doves, Keane, et al).   <br /> <br />\\"Pablo Honey\\" is most famous for the hit single \\"Creep,\\" a simple post-grunge pop song completely atypical of the Oxford quintet's style.  In fact, the song was never originally intended for the album. As the story goes, Thom Yorke had written it years before and was strumming it in the studio, when a passing record exec heard it and insisted on including it on the record.  The rest is history, as they say.  Though \\"Creep\\" ranks among Radiohead's least distinctive songs, it did put them on the music world's map, for which we should be eternally thankful. <br /> <br />Beyond \\"Creep,\\" only a few songs stand out: \\"You\\" with its driving odd meters; the heartfelt ballad \\"Thinking About You;\\" the energetic \\"Ripcord;\\" and the dynamic \\"Stop Whispering,\\" which starts as a catchy pop tune but builds to a ferocious crescendo that foreshadows Radiohead's evolution towards more complex arrangements.  \\"Pablo Honey's\\" performances and production values are solid but lackluster, and may disappoint those expecting the studio wizardry and technical virtuosity Radiohead would go on to achieve on \\"The Bends,\\" \\"OK Computer,\\" and \\"Kid A.\\" <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Pablo Honey\\" is a decent record, far overrated by the indie mavens who disowned Radiohead after they went \\"art rock,\\" and unlikely to satisfy those more familiar with their later, more progressive work.  It's a worthwhile debut, but remains a curio in Radiohead's increasingly impressive and accomplished oeuvre.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I rented this out of curiosity, and i was not disappointed. It is quirky, sweet and absolutely hysterical at certain parts. <br />I def. rooted for Napolean at the end even though it took me a while to warm up to him.Loved Pedro and Deb, and Kip and Uncle Rico, they all had a certain sweetness about them. I've bought the soundtrack just because it has a lot of dialogue from the movie on it and i laugh hysterically at it.Also there are some really good old 80's tunes throughout. <br />You will be quoting this movie for a long time to come. <br />I def. believe in my heart that there is something for everyone in this movie to laugh at. <br />one question though what the heck is the year that it's supposed to be set in?  <br />bottom line is just give it a chance. <br />:) <br />
0393312836|4.0|Anthony Burgess' vision of the future entertains by subjecting the reader to a crucible of bureaucratic and Proletariat violence and mayhem dissolved in waters of state subsidized cultural supremacy.  The final solution reverts back to what brought the reader here in the first place: an earlier omitted chapter neither in the film directed by Stanley Kubrick nor in the original United States publication.  This book is about the violent mind of its lead character.  Alex, the narrator who along with his evil `droogs', terrorize innocent civilians is terrorized by the State, when he is subjected to psychiatric reconditioning to curb his violent behavior.  This book is wonderful depiction rehabilitation gone awry.

B000000I3O|3.0|I love the misfits as much as anyone else but I think we are doing potential customers a disservice by simply fawning all over this cd.  The bottom line is the songs are good and the band is great but the quality of this cd reeks of \\"let's make a fast buck,\\" mentality.  First, there is no booklet contained with the cd.  There is simply a few pages of credits and bad cover art.  There are no lyrics, no pictures of the band, no history, nothing that you would expect or want in a compilation album.  Secondly, there is no list of what albums the songs came from, when they were first performed, or how they affected the history of punk music.  Thirdly, the quality of the recording is atrocious.  Many of the songs are live and let's face it, the misfits are only good live if you are there, otherwise pass it up because Danzig's beautiful powerful voice is often totally covered up by the instruments and the lyrics are unintelligable.  For the price this cd is brand new I cannot recommend it.  If you are a dihard misfits fan you likely already have most of this music anyway so pass it up also.
0345440900|2.0|I was so excited to get home and read this book after hearing such great reviews.  Boy was I ever disappointed.  I, a first time mother who's only had a baby for one month, ould of written this book.  I read the book from cover to cover and learned nothing.  Here are the great insights she tried to share.  One, babies have different cries; and when they cry, they are trying to communicate something (wow, what insight).  Two, babies have different personalities; and therefore, have different needs (wow, again what insight).  Three, her chart to help diagnose why your baby is crying is the most ridiculous thing I have ever read. Here's an example of her chart to diagnose why baby is crying: 1. If baby has tiny goose bumps, baby is cold. 2. If baby is sweaty, baby is too warm. 3. If baby is tilting head and opening mouth, baby is hungry. If baby is bearing down and grunting, baby is having a bowel movement.  You think I may be over simplifying, but I kid you not this is her expert insight.  This is what she calls \\"baby whispering\\".  Well, this is what I call basic common sense.  I would of given this book a one, but I guess there really are people without common sense.  Therefore, if you are trully clueless buy this book. This will break things down for those people who need the whole thing spelled out for them.  Otherwise, just use your old fashioned instinct and use some common sense.
B0006399FS|3.0|The thing I like about U2 is that they are always trying something new.  Each album was a new direction for them and they weren't afraid to go out on a limb.  For this reason I tolerated Bono's massive ego and insipid attempts to save the world but it is all getting a bit much now.  As everyone else has said, this album is nothing new, and it isn't.  In fact, the last album was nothing new.  In my opinion U2 should have cut half of the songs from all that you can't leave behind and cut half of the songs from this album and put them together.  Then you would've had one good album.  There are great songs on this album but most of them are slow meditative songs like city of blinding light or miracle drug.  Where is the rock?  Where is the guitar?  Also, there is a fine line between talking about spirituality and preaching.  Bono is walking that line and it is getting a bit tiresome.
0670033375|5.0|Jared Diamond here continues the fine work he began with The Third Chimpanzee and Guns, Germs, and Steel.  In Collapse, he examines the reasons why some societies have failed while others have succeeded, sometimes against all the odds.  Once again he uses environmental and geographical determinism to look at the histories of these societies, and comes up with fascinating new theories to explain their rise and demise.  I was particularly interested in the sections dealing with present day Montana and China, as they indicate so many potential and actual problems (as well as some good news) that face our world.<br /><br />I also found the segments on the Norse colonies in Greenland, Iceland, and elsewhere fascinating in the way Diamond analyzes the reasons for their successes and failures.  The segments on Easter Island and other Pacific islands also make intriguing reading as they demonstrate the connections between environmental and economic activity.  In fact, one of the chief pleasures of Collapse  is Diamond's ability to relate human events like the Rwanda-Burundi genocide to environmental factors.<br /><br />There will be many who will disagree with Diamond's thesis and with his list of suggested adjustments and improvements to the world ecological/environmental balance, but everyone will agree that Collapse is an important and stimulating achievement.

B00006RAKP|5.0|There are some of us...me in paticular...who don't know enough of Elton's regular albums, and just his hits. I'm personally thrilled that finally I have the songs \\"Tiny Dancer\\", \\"Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word\\", \\"Written in the Stars\\" and \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" are finally all on the same album, between both discs generally speaking. I am kind of dissapointed of they had to put two of the singles of \\"Songs From the West Coast\\" (\\"I want Love\\" and \\"This Train Don't Stop Here Anymore\\", although the latter seems to be a good conclusion for the whole disc collection), I would rather that in place of \\"I Want Love\\" be replaced with \\"Original Sin\\" or \\"Dark Diamond\\". Elton has paved the way so far, and I hope he continues to do more songs true to his roots! <br /> <br /> <br />~Also recommending \\"Songs From the West Coast\\"~

B0002Z0EYA|1.0|I rented this DVD before the last blizzard hit, thinking it would be a great way to ride out the storm.  Well, what could have been a great epic turned out to be epically boring!  I just didn't care about any of the characters and the battle scenes weren't anywhere near as exciting as they could have been, and it was hard to care who won!  As far as the story line, where was the explanation for WHY Achilles is such a great warrior and can't be beat?  A little detail about his HEEL (hello!) was left out of the story until the very end when he blatently sticks his heel out to take the arrow.  It might as well have had a bullseye painted on it! It all seemed so silly!  As far as the acting, the only actor worth anything in this movie was Eric Bana.  The rest acted like a bunch of wooden horses.  Luckily, I also rented \\"The Village\\" at the same time, but that's another review....

I love the music and listen to the CD on my way to work. The acting is great and Mandy Patinkin is  attractive enough to get your heart thumpin'. My husband hated it. So what! I am a romantic and this movie makes me happy. I also love to learn so can relate to Yentl's desire. Please make the DVD!!!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles was a genius! <br /> <br />His music is brilliant! <br /> <br />I just say the movie Ray and can only now appreciate his music. <br /> <br />This collection is simply fabulous.
B000002UC5|5.0|Come worship. This is a guy just getting into the life alone. He has the chops(Maybe I'm Amazed,Teddy Boy and Every Night), he has basic melody wanting more (Lovely Linda, Junk) and some tunes are simply fun(That Would Be Something, Man We Was Lonely.)This is Paul's idea of a 4-track bedroom recording. Have you ever tried that? Mine don't sound like this. Get this album if you are not the spoiled music know-it-all everyone claims to be today. I love this music. You will too.
B000068TPN|4.0|If you want to see a movie, with a lot of blood and real bad situation...just see saving private ryan, this movie \\"we were soldiers\\" is good, I respect Mel gibson, but im really tired to see him in the same kind of movie... <br />In this movie the main plot is about the soldiers and their families, the only problem i found in this movie is the lack of action........yes...here you can see a lot of deads and things like that.....but not at the same POWER like you see in other war movies...but it's still good...
B00068IOWC|1.0|What has happened to the band that used to try hard to produce something different and exciting? This album is totally devoid of new tune.....of new direction...of new anything. They have become the epitome of corporate rock. <br /> <br />
B0002VKZL6|4.0|First of all, there are a lot of great songs on here, and only a couple that I really don't like.. (find it hard to get into a song about McDonalds...)<br /><br />Overall one can find oneself slipping into the vexxing music on this particular outing by MK.  The guitar work is not over done, nor is it under done, this work is what people can easily refer to as subtle, but it is quite good.<br /><br />Some songs that I think are worth mentioning:<br /><br />5:15... very good opener to the CD.  Very good guitar work and lifts you off gently so the CD can get a grip on you.<br /><br />Suckers Row, I like this song, and I really like the lyrics.  Wry, dry and easy to sing song to.<br /><br />Postcards From Paraguay -This is a very strong song, and I really like the bank robber and the line 'there are so many reasons I won't be sending postcards from Paraguay'  .. the lyrics tell a wonderful story song.  This is a craft that MK has really fostered over his career, and he still has it on this Cd.<br /><br />Don't Crash The Ambulance ... The last song on the CD is my favorite.  I listened to it many times, just enjoying the music, and it is the strongest SONG on the CD I feel.. but, I was driving to work when it suddenly hit me that this song is George Bush talking to George Bush Jr.  References to the Haiti invasion, the Iraq D.Storm invasion in roundabout ways ... very funny.  I really like this song, and it is one of my favorite MK songs of all time already<br /><br />get this, you will like it.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />The lyrics are terrible, Bono`s voice is a shadow of what it used to be, and songwriting seem to have been going downhill since 2000.  can't believe that some people actually consider this to be a good album, let alone one of U2's best. Give me a break! Is there a worse song in their entire catalog than Original Of The Species? I certainly don't think so.  <br /> <br />Production is pretty bad, even considering this is actually an ATYCLB re-work recording. Not athmospheric, just annoying. Bono is just irritating to say the least. Music is so boring and predictable. Just something we`ve been hearing since their annoying ATYCLB, their most overrated album ever. <br /> <br />This may be one of the worst albums ever made. The only thing good about this record is that it eventually ends. Every single song on it is a miserable experience devoid of melody. After I purchased this piece of trash I could only say to myself \\"this cd cost me two hours of my pay\\". After that I vowed to save anyone else from making the same mistake. Do yourself a favor and buy anything from 1980-1998 and avoid making eye contact with this waste of plastic. You will only loose 49 minute of your life for nothing.  <br />
B000002MP2|5.0|Okay, overall this cd is a 4/5. It's really good and theres no song i don't like. <br />1.

B000001EAQ|5.0|The most fascinating and exciting U2 album, simply is the quintessential U2, as the whole 90`s era. Don`t listen to mainstream U2, listen to THIS instead !!!.  <br />Just buy it for 'Please' alone. Pop is Physological, deep, complex, strong, emotive, novel, majestic, magnificent, dark, praiseworthy, decisive, etc, etc. <br /> <br />This is U2 at their best era ( Achtung Baby - Pop ). Just buy it.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|This was an awesome awesome AWESOME movie and I recommend it to everyone, Metallica fan or not.  But this message isnt about the movie, it is about something that needs to be addressed.  I cant sit here and read these anti metallica messages any more. <br />The following is to all the Anti Metallica idiots:  I think that you are a jealous, ignorant fools.  What happened? Are you a musicians who never made it or never will?  All you can think to do is badmouth 3 guys who just so happened to make it big?   <br /> <br />I think that you people who are anti-metallica are a small and insignificant crowd. I know this because of the Metallica concert i went to in August that SOLD OUT  (not a small venue-The Excel Energy Center).  To me, that seems like there are just a few fans still out there.  (Just a few).  I think its amazing that you people doubt their success!  Heres a figure that you should think of (since the Mustaine issue seems to make so many of you lose sleep).  The Black Album still sells 1 million copies every year.  Just remember that.  To me, that isnt a mark of failure.  You people need to keep your mouths shut and your eyes and ears open to the real facts about Metallica.  I know that my one message isnt going to stop people from dissing metallica, but I just couldnt sit here and keep reading these lies and say nothing.   <br /> <br />

B000002UB3|4.0|Being only 18, I am only just 'discovering' the Beatles. It was only recently, when I became more interested in music that I began to appreciate older music (mainly from the late 60s until present). I heard the No. 1 album, and found the earlier songs catchy and very-pop friendly but strangely lacking in substance. Older songs such as 'Hey Jude' and 'Let It Be' are, however, real classics. <br /> <br />The other day I bought 'Abbey Road' the second-highest selling beatles album and am not dissapointed. I won't say anything that hasn't already been said, but the short track 'Sun King' is a real sleeper and one of the gems on this album. It has a mystical quality to it. Maxwell's Silver Hammer and 'Her Majesty' were quirky little, very British numbers while the only song I disliked was 'Octopus' Garden' save the clever guitar intro. Other than that, I find 'Something' a bit overrated but still good (the same can be said for 'Come Together') but 'Because' was a very good track. In order, I would say my favourite tracks are, Sun King, Because, Come Together and Mean Mr. Mustard. <br /> <br />
B000001EHS|1.0|Pyromania was the first LP I ever purchased back in 1983 (I think that was the year) after hearing the song Photograph on the radio. I then purchased High N Dry soon after that. Def Leppard became one of my favorite bands, and High N Dry is still one of my favorites. I think their last decent album was Hysteria, but they have produced nothing but trash since then. If your going to dish out $15 for a cd, spend it on High N Dry and Pyromania. Hysteria is good, but it was the start of the group selling out. On Through The Night is also good, but isnt as polished as High and Pyro. The bulk of the songs on this Greatest Hits disc are garbage in my opinion.Steve Clarke was the brains behind the group, and one of the most underrated rock guitarists of the 80's. Since his death, they have become a joke....
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets pwnrz joo!!!11111 <br /> <br />I've read some funny reviews on here. To say that this is a bad album is like saying happiness is a \\"bad thing\\". <br /> <br />I am humored by the fact that some people feel their opinion should be taken as the gospel truth. <br /> <br />This album was a landmark album for Heavy Metal (as well as others put out around the same time period by other bands). <br /> <br />As far as those who feel Metal started with bands like Judas Priest, get your facts straight. Any true Metal Head knows that Black Sabbath pioneered Metal.
B00005JMJG|4.0|This was a little weird, but good. You might have to force yourself to get through the first 15 or 20 minutes, but then things pick up and fall into place. It is a little like \\"Memento\\" and others of that genre. Not too predictable. Carrey is at one of his finest points, which surprised me. Questionable for dates, but good movie for (stable) couples.
B0006399FS|3.0|I enjoyed this album and can't wait for the tour. I can't wait for the album to grow on me. But a life changing album? Anyone who believes that rwill be crushingly disappointed. Don't let yourself be misled into believing this album will change your very existence on the planet- they're just four Irish guys with bad taste in sunglasses who make great music, and have managed to hold it all together over the years.
B0000CAQ26|2.0|IMHO commercial pop divas, on the whole, are a species the planet could do without.  There are some exceptions, such as Shakira, and the occasional unexpected treasure (Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\"); I keep hoping Pink will join that list, but there's just not enough depth or consistency here to make that happen. <br /> <br />Sure, \\"Try This\\" is fun to listen to a couple of times, and there are a couple of tracks which are pretty strong - \\"Humble Neighborhoods\\" and \\"Waiting for Love\\" come to mind. Despite the rock credentials of the producers and the punky street level cachet Pink tries to project, the whole thing comes off as too calculated, as something constructed around a percieved market segment.   <br /> <br />Ultimately, this is the type of CD that will get shelved and rarely pulled out once the novelty wears off.  \\"Missundaztood\\" was a bit better, in this regard, having had a few more strong tracks.  While I think Pink is pretty listenable, compared to her (in)famous peers, ther's just not enough of the genuine about her or her music to make her more than an occasional musical distraction.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|A take-off on the movie - THE JACKAL - with Bruce Willis -  <br />Tom Cruise as a hit man just does not pull it off. <br />Jamie Foxx was decent as the troubled cab-driver. <br />Plenty of action - fairly fast paced --- but what ever happened to the police?  Did they end up closing their case? <br /> <br />Too many questions left unanswered. <br />Will probably have to see it again sometime to see what I missed.
B000002IKR|3.0|Alright, I'll keep this short. Other than Testament, I'm familiar with at least something from each of the following first or second generation thrash bands- Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, Slayer, Death Angel, Dark Angel, Exodus, Vio-Lence, Sepultura, Kreator, Sodom, Destruction, Overkill, and probably another band or two that I can't come up with off the top of my head. Anyway, every one of those bands is more interesting than Testament. Testament isn't a bad band, and they sound alright when your listening to it, but they fail to really excell in anyone area, and lack any real personality. They can play some pretty good lead guitar and Billy is an above average vocalist, but the riffs are pretty damn bland on all the Testament albums I've heard, and they aren't that fast, or that complex, or that heavy or whatever. Total middle of the road stuff. It's not a matter of them being derivative- Death Angel and Vio-Lence are equally derivative, but they've got more energy, more distinctive vocals and just write better riffs. Still, you should probably give them shot, cause everyone else seems to like them, and I don't even dislike them, but I haven't got time to listen to albums that are just pretty decent, anymore. If you do wanna get some Testament, check out 'Practice What You Preach' or 'The Gathering', which are both better than this, though not good enough that I didn't eventually sell them.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|When I saw this movie, I had great expectations for it. When one of my friends told me about it, he had a hard time to get the words out because he was laughing so hard, just thinking of it. Another friend said that I would be a complete loser if I didn't see it. When I finally saw it, there were pretty funny parts. I did laugh alot and I did some what enjoy it. The reason that I didn't like it is because it wasn't nearly as funny as I had hoped it to be. There were times where I thought to my self, \\"Am I supposed to laugh here?\\" and I also kept one eye on the timer to see how much longer there was. Overall, though, I wasn't as happy with the presentation of the movie and the thoughtfullness of it all. There were times where I knew it was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. Also, the direction was somewhat inconsistent. At times the flavor of a scene would be surreal, but then cut to something else in the same scene which wasn't surreal at all. The move was a dissapoint to me after all the hype about it, but overall it was a better movie than, say, Garfield.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is probably one of the best album released in 2004. Kanye West is a pure genius like Eminem. He doesn't rap about sex, drugs and beautiful women like most rappers do these days but instead, he raps about his past life and how he became the person he is. If I could, I would give this album a 10+ cuz it's just so good. Buy it!
1556589433|5.0|the scene that i was really mesmerized how a great convinsing actress meryl is when she was \\"marching\\" together with a woman\\"most probably a hitler collaborator\\"  the setting was a muddy field almost a size of a football field ,with the background showing delapidated  makeshift  cells for the would be victims of the eventual holocuast....meryll is  very malnourished and cathectic and hopeless  affect! i commend the director who was smart not to cut this very important scene!!! i's almost imposible to use a  \\"double\\" only meryl can do it!!!!i can not imagine the reactioons of the post-holocoust survivors the moment they see this particular scene!!!   BRAVO AND BRAVO TO MS. MERYLL STREEP!!!!!!  !
B00068IOWC|1.0|'Pop' as it seems is the last good U2 album there really ever was. 1 Star Is Being Generous. This crap just leaves you feeling angry over the money that you wasted. It's abominable. Literally hundreds of the same boring guitars, horrible singing and screaming all over the place, stupid lyrics, miserable 'music', and filler production.    Long-time fans already hate it, the casual listener will dismiss it as a cheap gimmick for sales. Please, dont be dumbest person in the world for even thinking about about buying this piece   [...]  I gladly abandoned this band in the same fashion in which they abandoned me.    Please U2 retire for gods sake...you are an embarrasment.
B0006399FS|1.0|11 unconnected pop songs. Simply a filler stuff for the bucks. U2 are playing it safe once again. They are over-the-hill as they aren't ambitious or take creative risks. Bono botched his singing melodies so badly. I don't know how the hell he likes his own voice. Maybe he's deaf.  <br /> <br />This album is just boring and painful, plain and simple. Not only is this the worst piece of corporate radio fodder garbage album that U2 has put out, but it is now in my top 20 'worst albums I've ever heard.' This album has absolutely nothing to offer.... unless you like to music that sounds like it was made in a church by a bunch of 45 year old half-asleep drunks.  <br /> <br />on another note, dont bother pretending to like this album just so you can be 'loyal' to the band.  <br /> <br />

B00005JNEI|2.0|I give \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" two stars because it was edited well, and I always find Michael Moore amusing.  I was a huge fan of Moore's \\"TV Nation\\" program back in the '90's.   <br /> <br />Let me speak freely, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is a work of propaganda.  Some folks cringe when they hear the word, \\"propaganda.\\"  It's not a bad word.  The third ed. of THE AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE defines propaganda as: \\"The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause.\\"  Moore's detractors use the term \\"propaganda\\" constantly to discredit him.  Moore's supporters are afraid of using the term, although it accurately reflects what his film is. <br /> <br />Moore's film holds a mirror up to its audience.  Those of the left who wish to see the work as a factual account of the wrongdoings of the Bush administration will see this reflected in the work.  Those on the right who wish to see this film as an unfactual account concocted to knock a sitting president will see this. <br /> <br />My biggest concern about the film is the lack of critical thinking amongst its audience.  News departments around the country were interviewing scores of audience members who had just left the theatre after seeing the film. There werwe so many who said they were going to change their vote because of the movie.  Many said that the film finally showed the truth about the Bush presidency.  Anyone who changes their vote or declares a propaganda film has just altered their interpretation of the truth worries me.  How many Germans were swayed to accept the anti-semitic \\"truth\\" of the Nazi party back in the '40's when \\"Jud Suss\\" was released? <br /> <br />Our nation urgently needs to be critical of propagandistic films.  After watching \\"Fahyrenheit 9/11\\" my first impulse was to run to the library to do some serious fact-checking.  It would be insane to think that this film is entirely factually accurate.  Moore is a muckraker, and thank God there are muckrakers on both ends of the political spectrum.  Would Moore be more forthcoming with his sources or his editing techniques if watchdogs on the right weren't putting his feet to the fire? <br /> <br />Watch \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" for the amusement value.  Moore is a funny guy.  I cracked up when I saw the \\"idyllic\\" scenes of pre-invasion Iraq.  Whatever you do, viewer, please, PLEASE view Moore's films CRITICALLY.  Do not believe every single event in them.  Go to the library, do some fact-checking, after you watch a propaganda film from either the left or right.  Don't tell the hometown reporter that you're going to change your vote.  Don't be stupid- DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!!
B000001EAQ|5.0|We love this non-mainstream U2. Pop shines against overrated crap like All That You Can't Leave Behind and How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.  <br /> <br />Stop being such a hypocrite, Bono. POP is the last great U2 album. Period. <br /> <br />
B00005JNEW|5.0|alright this is one of the best movies of the year because of one thing not everybody is happy at the end of the movie. its a true story to show that life is hard. This is an exciting movie ull never find urself bored with and the football action is amazing like how u feel ur there. ANYONE who likes football should pick this movie up its a must see.

B000001DVV|4.0|This CD was not overlooked in its time and yes, millions of people did in fact buy it.  It is incredibly funny and the band is moderately musically talented.  The lyrics are inane but the riffs and solos are top-notch.    As far as posterity goes, people will probably not buy a million more copies of this CD in the future.  However, they will remember a few songs on it with a nod and maybe a chuckle.  That's more than we can say for anything many other junk metal groups from the late 80's and early 90's have produced or ever will produce.
B00005QW5X|5.0|When I first saw Hedwig, I was amazed. Not only is John Cameron Mitchell incredibly hot as a man or a woman. The movie is wonderful. It follows the story of Hedwig Robinson, a german woman born as a man called Hansel in cold war Berlin on the Eastern side of the Berlin wall. Feeling trapped and isolated, the rock and roll obsessed Hansel wishes to get out of Berlin hoping for a better life. He meets the american soldier Luther Robinson, who promises to marry Hansel and get him out of berlin. There is a catch; in order to be able to marry Luther, Hansel must undergo a full physical examination. In order to pass the examination, Hansel takes on the identity of a woman taking his mother's name (Hedwig Schmidt) and undergoes a sex-change operation, which unfortunatley goes awry and Hedwig is left with a small one-inch section of a penis. Sometime later, Luther and Hedwig have relocated to a small town in Kansas now, Luther has left her and now Hedwig must sit alone and watch as the Berlin wall comes down and is now alone. Hedwig gets a job babysitting for a local general while starting up a rock and roll band. She meets the teenager Tommy Speck (later known as Tommy Gnosis) and they develop a relationship while Hedwig sharpens Tommy's musical abilities. After discovering Hedwig's secret Tommy runs off, with all of Hedwigs music. Angry and hurt, Hedwig now travels around with her new band following Tommy. The music (written by Stephen Trask) tells Hedwigs story. John Cameron Mitchell sings the music with so much life you can feel what Hedwig feels. While there are many cross-dressing movies, this movie is simply beyond that. It examines the question of gender, what does it mean to be a woman? How can you define gender, biologically, socially? This is a great film, I suggest that anyone could watch this movie and enjoy it. You don't have to be transgendered to enjoy Hedwig, you just have to have an open mind.
B000683VI4|5.0|Be prepared.  This movie will move you like no other.  You will laugh...you will cry...you will argue over who she should be with...you watch it once...you'll watch it over and over again. Ryan Gosling (Noah) will win your heart over in his pursuit of the woman he fell in love with at first sight.  He knows that she is the one for him, and he won't let anything get in his wife...not even her wealthy, upset family.  This love story will wrap you around its finger and not let you go until the end.  I highly suggest you read the book as well, even though it is different from the movie.
0425170349|5.0|Always like Tom Clancy and couldn't put this one down.  Plot took a lot of twists and turns and was very scary.  Everybody should read this book.
B000002C1W|3.0|BEST SONGS:  \\"Signs of Life\\", \\"Learning To Fly\\", \\"On The Turning Away\\", \\"Yet Another Movie\\", \\"Terminal Frost\\", \\"One Slip\\". <br /> <br />PRODUCTION QUALITY:  Claustrophobic. <br /> <br />I love Pink Floyd's music, but \\"Momentary\\" could've and should've been better.  The awful production just gets in the way, probably because of several factors.  For one thing, the liner notes say that the acoustic drums and bass guitar were recorded in analog while everything else was recorded in digital (digital recording was a relatively new thing in 1987). On top of this were a host of session musicians.  The otherwise-mighty bassist Tony Levin turns in a dismal performance here, along with very weak tone.  Third, David Gilmour had gotten a new guitar system that he was trying out.  A case in point is \\"Dogs of War\\", especially when the band kicks in after the vocal.  The drums are quite loud, and Gilmour's guitar sounds processed, but unrehearsed.  I say \\"claustrophobic\\" because it sounds like they're jamming in a small room with everything on max. <br /> <br />If you want better sounding versions of these songs, I would recommend their 1988 live album, \\"Delicate sound of Thunder\\".  It contains most of the best songs from the album, and sounds much better.

0805076476|5.0|How many times do you read a novel and just know what it coming next?  Too many stories seem to be re-worked versions of things we've read before; after all, how many truly new things are there under the sun?  Palahniuk, however, has created something new and it is both interesting and fun to read. <br /> <br />\\"Fight Club\\" follows a disengaged young professional whose life is sliding meaninglessly by until he meets a man about his age who is his polar opposite, capturing each moment of life.  The two strike up a friendship and a club that pits other disengaged young men in fights against one another.  They strike a chord and events spiral.  To an unpredictable conclusion. <br /> <br />Read this one.
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray is a talent... bought this album upon release based on a review in Stereophile mag - one of the most glowing reviews i have read from guys that are normally very hard to please. <br /> <br />Have been listening to this album incessantly for months - one of the few i have come across in the last number of years that i can listen to straight through and then back through again.  Complete album - the Van Morrison comparo is apt... his voice is definitely his own, but certainly shades of Van Morrison, Joe Cocker, and, at times, Tracy Chapmin.  Unusual voice, gorgeous tone, very cool music.  Just good songwriting with a great voice - you will like it and so will your parents if you sent em a copy.  Trouble is a great song, but you'll also love Hanna, Jolene, et al.
0802130208|3.0|I am not a big fan of dark comedy, so this book is three stars for me, but I still acknowledge \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\" as a very unique book. <br /> <br />If you enjoy reading about the misadventures of largely unsympathetic characters (as many do), you will find few books that do it as well as this one.  On the other hand, just to warn readers whose tastes tend more toward mine, if you like to have a protagonist with whom you can truly empathize in order to feel fully absorbed in a story, this one may not be for you. <br /> <br />A very good book that isn't for everyone.  (Then again, how many books achieve greatness trying to be everything to everyone?)  This book knows what it wants to be and does it well.  I just wasn't the right reader.
068987474X|1.0|Behrendt's attempt at labeling and dividing makes me cringe.  My experience tells me that both men and women are merely humans, good and bad, hot and not. After all, we're all a \\"can of worms\\" to some extent, so isn't it a matter of going about our lives, keeping our eyes open for opportunities to mesh our \\"worms\\" with someone else's.
1592400876|4.0|I probably punctuated my title incorrectly, and if I remembered everything I read in this book, I probably would have gotten it right.  That is the basis of this book.  The author has taken her self-admittedly violent reaction to the degradation of punctuation standards throughout the English-speaking world and compiled her frustrations into a book.  Based on the sales figures, she has a lot of company in her frustration. <br /> <br />While Truss's writing is quite witty for a book about punctuation, it's still a book about punctuation.  Her explanations on how to properly use different punctuation marks and in which circumstances are clear and concise and she has some amusing anecdotes about dire consequences attributable to poor punctuation.  That said, the book gets a bit long-winded in some of her rants (which are fun and colorful when she keeps them short) and that keeps the book at four stars rather than five. <br /> <br />Any punctuation fanatic frustrated with poor punctuation in public will find a kindred spirit in Ms. Truss and will enjoy this book.
B000646MNE|5.0|I was one of those who never watched the show when it was in original runs on HBO, in fact I thought all the hype was ridiculous, especially around the series finale time. Then, I watched a random episode re-run on HBO and truly fell in love.  My husband thinks I crazy, calls me obsessed. I rented and watched every episode of all six seasons within 2 weeks. I started to watch Season 6 part 2 on a Saturday night and had to stay up until it was over. Went to bed at 3 a.m.!  Then watched it again on Sunday morning. Now I feel very sad that it is over. Purchasing the box set is next on my list!
B00069YE0W|5.0|To start this review, I would just like to personally thank the amazing John Frusciante for keeping all of his fans happy with most incredible music on the planet. And now for the review. The last release of the 6 record series, Curtains, is an acoustic masterpiece by a masterful musician. Sure, I've given every John CD 5 stars, but that's because every one of them deserves 5 stars. <br /> <br />1. The Past Recedes - What a great, fresh start to the album. A song with a positive note. Great melody, great guitar, and John plays the harmonica! Great guitar solo. <br /> <br />2. Lever Pulled - Awesome song. <br /> <br />3. Anne - One of the best on the album. Great melody, great song. <br /> <br />4. The Real - Great song. <br /> <br />5. A Name - Pure genious. <br /> <br />6. Control - Rockin, great, awesome. <br /> <br />7. Your Warning - Awesome. <br /> <br />8. Hope - Terrific. <br /> <br />9. Ascension - Magical. Great melody. Great, feel-good song. <br /> <br />10. Time Tonight - Amazing. <br /> <br />11. Leap Your Bar - And this is the end. A perfect ending with the piano at John's fingertips. <br /> <br />My idol and hero has created something amazing for his exclusive fan base with amazing music and poetry for the past 6 months, and this was the perfect finale. Thanks once again, John.
055357342X|2.0|\\"A Storm of Swords,\\" George R.R. Martin's third volume in his mega-epic \\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\\" delivers everything fans have come to expect from this ambitious fantasy series: a huge cast of characters, pulse-pounding medieval battle sequences, pages and pages of political scheming and treachery, and the shocking deaths of characters that will leave readers gape-jawed with disbelief.  <br />Unfortunately, the author seems to have given up on character development. Whole chapters exist solely to introduce a new minor character or dwell upon a seemingly insignificant subplot. Case in point: The scheming yet sympathetic dwarf Tyrion Lannister, so expertly developed in the series' previous volumes, seems to all but disappear as other members of the cast take the stage. The characters I have grown to love (Bran Stark, Davos the Onion Knight) are given short shrift this time around, but Martin throws in two more \\"perspectives\\" into the mix: Jaime Lannister, who is finally \\"humanized\\" to the point where the reader feels sympathy for him, and Samwell Tarly, an obese member of the Night's Watch who finds a backbone in his journeys beyond the Wall. Sadly, Sam's chapters are few and far between.  <br />\\"A Storm of Swords\\" will keep its fans flipping pages all through the night. However, I wish the author had more focus on the characters rather the convoluted plot which seems to be going nowhere fast. Ah, well, there's still three more books to go...though at this rate, we'll all be in nursing homes before the series is completed.       <br />
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I'am big fan of EC and he is great. But I'am also a fan of the guitar and I enjoy all these players. I've got all the records of Eric Johnson, I it's a pity there are no more songs of him on this DVD.  <br /> <br />For the record some people wrote where is Bran May, Steve Lukather etc. <br /> <br />answer: Brian May, Steve Lukather and Satriani were invited and said that they would come, but due to time-problems they couldn't make it. May and satriani donated a guitar for the festval. <br />Gary Moore was injured on his whrist. <br /> <br />I miss Jeff Beck (and Pat Metheny), I don't know why he and EC is not on it, but Mr. Beck never appears on a solo-DVD, maybe he had his reasons. <br /> <br /> <br />Highligts: <br /> <br />EC: Cocaine, HYELAW, Sheriff, Jingo ( with Santana) <br />Eric Johnson <br />Steve Vai <br />Robert Cray <br />James Taylor with Jerry Douglas <br />Vince Gill <br /> <br />
0375701427|4.0|Roth's multi-layered prose can stretch a single sentence on and on for nearly a page, creating an urgency in the description of a thing or activity, even if it appears to be insignificant.  This writing style is what makes the book so compelling.  While some issues are left unresolved (such as, what happens to the daughter in the end?), it doesn't result in an unsatisfying experience, just in more curiosity about the characters.   <br />The way the author sets the novel up is in an unchronological way, so he gives you a bit of information at a time, which is part of what makes you keep reading--you're never sure when another piece of the puzzle will be revealed.  He sets the reader up so that, just when you think you know everything that's going on in a character's head, another memory or conversation pops up that changes things and complicates the story (in a good way).   <br />It's a very long novel, and it took me awhile to really get into it, but once I did, it was hard to put it down.  Much of the writing is exposition, not conversation or \\"action\\" per se, so if this is not your kind of writing, you may find it frustrating.   <br />Roth captures perfectly the schizophrenic identity of American culture in the '60s, when it was split between anarchic social revolution and the scrubbed-clean postwar era image of the decades before.  While, in the end, it feels like he has painted a rather bleak portrait of family life and our society and what it means to be an American or Jewish or from a \\"good family\\", it is a very interesting book that presents vastly different perspectives on life and is supporting by great writing.
B0002I831S|1.0|I certainly hope paramount doesnt screw up THE BRADY BUNCH set when it comes out in March!! <br /> <br />Of course i have nothing to say about the series itself!  But, the over animated menu design is a pain in the neck along with the navigation. (just a personal opinion) <br /> <br />Along with that, WHY DOESNT THE LOSER WHO AUTHORS THESE DVDS IN MANUFACTURING simply make a \\"Play All\\" button on the menu!!??? <br /> <br />Its a pain if you intend to watch the whole disc and have to run for the dvd player every second to initiate a new episode. <br /> <br />How hard can it be?????????????????????????
B0000TB01Y|5.0|What Elisabeth Vincentelli bizarrely fails to recognize in reviewing this soundtrack yes SOUNDTRACK for Amazon is that the songs are all that's on offer; listeners are not impacted by whether they distract from the show's plot.  This Broadway score is an experience not to be missed, in which composer Stephen Schwartz explores new dimensions of his craft and the exceptional talents of Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel are given a fresh yet fitting showcase.  The songs are variously formidable (No One Mourns the Wicked, Defying Gravity), delightful (Popular, What Is This Feeling), energizing (The Wizard and I, One Short Day), heart-rending (Thank Goodness, I'm Not That Girl, For Good).  To be sure, there are some throwaway bits, as with any Broadway show; these are more acoutrements to the performance than they are parts of the score.  What makes this score so compelling, apart from the simple fact of Schwartz's musical genius, is the complex questions it raises about friendship and human nature.  A hundred times we've all seen Glinda in her bubble and the Witch of the West with her monkeys, and probably none of us ever dared to think they had ever been friends (unless Gregory Maguire is reading this).  Even just in the songs, we witness this unlikely rapport as it matures and struggles against tougher challenges; itchallenges our own perceptions of a mythology we all grew up with, and of the way it colors our world.    It should be noted that several of Schwartz's lyrical constructs are just as mind-altering.  I would have gladly paid more than the $19 the stores are getting for this CD if I had known it was THIS good; buy it on Amazon and you'll get double your money's worth.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|i've watched this film multiple times and loaned it to friends who have watched it multiple times.  one reviewer dissected the movie and seemed anoyed by the racial overtones.  poor soul.  if he only new that in most of the rest of the world people judge each other on character and personality not the color of their skin.  get this film and you won't regret it.  i think it's one of the best romantic comedys ever made.
B0006399FS|1.0|NO radio airplay, or fancy promotion. The music simply did the talking, and because of it, all you had to do was let someone hear the light, and they were instantly baptized. Looking back now, it all seems much clearer than it did then, (as it was actually going to sh*t.) To make it brief, U2 died, and faded into the memory of great music (80's and 90's) that won't ever be duplicated. <br /> <br />This CD is absolutely the worst and I mean worst thing they have ever done. The whole thing from beginning to end is nothing more than one big dissapoitment looking for somewhere to happen. So when someone says find a better reason to hold a grudge I say this. What better reason to hold a grudge because you have waited for and have been promised a great album to only get screwed by this kind of pile of monkey crap they want to call music. Then they charge some outragous price to see them to perform it live. For all you people that haven't spent money to buy the CD, please save your time and money and go buy something else. <br /> <br />Rest In Peace, fallen heros.  <br /> <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I can't believe that Radiohead made an album like this.  This is outstanding, I was growing tired of the techno stuff and Thom Yorke and company really made another great album with absolution.  This could be better than Ok computer or the Bends. Oh yeah how did they manage to put out two albums in the same year? Amazing, thank you Radiohead.
B0000648WZ|3.0|...or a leftist \\"cautionary tale\\"? I approached it from the former perspective after having read the Robert Heinlein book it's based on many years ago. The book was one of Heinlein's post-WW II string of YA fiction, with teenage and post-teen main characters I grew to love in junior high and senior high. I figured what the hey, at worst it'll be light entertainment of the PlayStation type. I was resigned to the likelihood that it would bear no resemblance to the book, as movies hardly ever do. But this film doesn't take all that many liberties with the plot, surprisingly. We have new recruit John Rico, who joins the infantry in time of war over his father's angry objections. Then both parents are killed in an enemy attack on his hometown of Buenos Aires. In the book, B-A isn't the hometown and only Johnnie's mother is killed because she's there visiting, after which Dad joins up himself. Johnnie's commanding officer ends up being his old high school poli sci teacher Mr. Raczac, whose commission is reactivated when war was declared after B-A was attacked. In the book, the teacher and the officer are two different people. (This composite role is played by Michael Ironside, who's excelled in tough-guy supporting roles for years, the chief one being the Ham Tyler role in the \\"V\\" miniseries). There's a love interest in the form of Carmen Ibanez, a charming and wholesomely pretty former classmate of Johnnie's who joined up to be a starship pilot. So far so good, but the whole tone of the film isn't exactly the high adventure the book was. There are news reports of the trumpet fanfare war propaganda variety, along with chiche bellicose and bigoted \\"the only good one is a dead one\\" rhetoric from high command all the way down to the man-in-the-street. Along with the assertions \\"so what if we infringed on Bug territory-we're the humans and we got the right, y'know?\\" As in \\"menschen uber alles\\", right? And I can't believe it's a coincidence that all dress uniforms worn by the military feature short-and-wide lapel jackets with a suspicious resemblance to WW II Wehrmacht and SS gear. It's about as subtle as the nuclear mortar rounds used in this film. \\"Look at what the future brings if we let the right wing take over. No vote unless you've served in the military (that wrinkle actually does show up in the book). While you're in the service, you can be flogged for ignoring procedure. Televised capital punishment. Lectures on `why democracy failed' (that one isn't in the book). Propaganda on the tube that turns our innocent kids into gun nuts. I tell ya, these mean-spirited fascists are warmongers when it comes to present-day humans in the real world, much less space aliens in a sci-fi flick.\\" And so on. This film can be enjoyed as light entertainment, as I said. I'm just hoping that there isn't a bit of Michael Moore refusenik zealotry between the lines, that's all. Though not as creative as the Star Wars films or Trek, it isn't as trashy as I expected.military feature short-and-wide lapel jackets with a suspicious resemblance to WW II Wehrmacht and SS gear.

B0001LJCMK|1.0|All I can say is that the vocals are so crappy and that the music sounds like a Queens of the Stone Age rip off. I tried to dig the album, but couldn't. It just isn't worth buying at all. Avoid this one and save your money for something good.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|This is one of the better bands to come along in a while. If you like Atreyu, bleeding through, & just enjoy hardcore punk then you will love avenged sevenfold. I think this guy has a great voice. I love how there is a lot of versatility in there music. I think these guys have made a name for themselves after the release of this album. Great CD.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I saw this film blindly...I had no knowledge of it whatsoever.  I had no idea about the anti-American accusations hurled against von Trier...until I looked at the official movie site and saw some idiotic comments by idiotic Americans. <br /> <br />I encourage people to read what von Trier has to say about this accusation.  It was not the first time he'd be criticized for making a film about Americans without ever having been in the U.S.  As he said, the people who made \\"Casablanca\\" had never been to Casablanca and THAT was really the only reason he made the setting a small American town.  As others have mentioned, it could be any town, anywhere. <br /> <br />Frankly, I think the movie is pure genius.  The sparse set is part of that.  While distracting, at first, it becomes \\"normal.\\"  Eventually, you see the town that isn't there. <br /> <br />Human kindness IS fragile and the film is a wonderful examination of that.  The only truly good person is Grace...and even she can't hang on to her virtues, given the choices life has given her and the treatment she has received. <br /> <br />If it was long, I didn't notice.  Seemed like only a few minutes went by! <br /> <br />If you're looking for a film that follows all the standards of \\"blockbuster\\" formulas, this is not it.  If you don't mind something unique, albeit disturbing, you should appreciate it.

B00065LY1I|4.0|In the mid 1980s, several female dance pop artists emerged in the wake Madonna's success, and Kylie Minogue has outlasted most of them.  Not only that, but she is the only singer who is still enjoying a fruitful career after leaving producers/mentors Stock Aitken Waterman.  In terms of album sales and hit singles, Kylie's success in the United States has been frustratingly spotty, but elsewhere around the world, she's as big a star as Janet or Madonna.  \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" is the umpteenth hits collection from Ms. Minogue, but this one covers all phases of her recording career, and it includes the bubbly \\"I Believe in You,\\" a Number Two UK hit co-written by Jake Shears and Babydaddy of the red hot Scissor Sisters.  The first disc, covering 1987-1992, is entirely produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, featuring perfect pop hits \\"I Should Be So Lucky,\\" \\"Got to Be Certain,\\" \\"Better the Devil You Know,\\" and \\"Wouldn't Change a Thing.\\"  The second disc, covering 1994-2004, is the more diverse CD, ranging from hard edged pop (\\"Did it Again\\"), perky disco (\\"Spinning Around,\\" \\"Come into My World,\\" \\"Love at First Sight\\"), and her biggest hit ever: \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\\"  But \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" is far from perfect.  Missing in action are personal favorites \\"What Kind of Fool (Heard All That Before),\\" the mid-tempo \\"Finer Feelings,\\" and the duet with Keith Washington: \\"If You Were With Me Now.\\"  Any of these songs would have been a welcome replacement for the cringeworthy covers of \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Tears on My Pillow.\\"  While \\"Ultimate Kylie\\" doesn't quite hit the bullseye as a compilation, it does an overall solid job and comes recommended for new listeners and rabid fans.
0316172324|5.0|At the outset, I feel obliged to point out that I am unqualified to comment on neurological material which Gladwell includes and discusses in this volume. For example, what Patrick Murray refers to in his own review:  \\"The fusiform gyrus is not a piece of brain software (page 219), the midbrain doesn't hijack the forebrain much less reach up to hijack it (page 225), and it is doubtful that rapid heart beats shut down the motor systems or any other brain component (pages 220-225).\\" The comments which follow limit their attention to what I understand to be Gladwell's core concepts and key assertions with regard to the decision-making process. These are the ones which are of greatest interest to me:<br /><br />1. What Gladwell refers to as \\"the adaptive unconscious\\" has a much greater influence on our judgments as well as on our pre-judgments (or prejudices) than most of us realize. This explains why we often react with \\"intuitive\\" repulsion or  attraction to another person...or to a given option, peril, suggestion, opportunity, request, etc.<br /><br />2. \\"Paralysis by analysis\\" can result in what Gladwell refers to as \\"momentary autism\\" (i.e. a non-decision) which may or may not prove beneficial.<br /><br />3. In certain crises (e.g. an ambush, a train wreck, a medical emergency), snap decisions must often be made without benefit of sufficient information. \\"The power of knowing, in that first two seconds, is not a gift given magically to a fortunate few. It is an ability that we can all cultivate for ourselves.\\"<br /><br />For me this last is Gladwell's most important point, one which he really could have developed in much greater depth: It is not only possible but highly desirable to become so knowledgeable about a given subject that one can almost immediately complete an accurate diagnosis and then take or recommend appropriate action. I have personally observed this skill on numerous occasions in emergency rooms, automotive shops, and during appliance service calls. The physician, mechanic, or electrician quickly checks out the most revealing symptoms and then knows (if not \\"in that first two seconds\\") precisely what must be done. Theirs are really not \\"snap\\" decisions; rather, they are based on years of experience which have revealed the criteria by which to make the most appropriate judgments in a timely manner.<br /><br />I am intrigued by the possibility that when one develops the skill by which to make such judgments, each such judgment then becomes what Gladwell characterizes as a \\"tipping point,\\" after which there is an acceleration of subsequent events, results, consequences, etc. Perhaps in his next book, Gladwell will explore that possibility.electrician quickly checks out the most revealing symptoms and then knows (if not \\"in that first two seconds\\") precisely what must be done.

B000002BFL|1.0|I am a huge Bruce fan and I was looking forward to this album. However, it's not the new Nebraska. I don't know why Bruce has started singing in that weird Dylan-on-helium voice, but it's irritating to listen to and distracts from the lyrics, which are a disappointment on this album. Buy Ghost of Tom Joad if you want to hear Bruce using profanity, including the f word, on \\"My Best Was Never Good Enough\\", yet another whiny song about his divorce, or for the song \\"Youngstown\\" which is one of the best that Bruce has written in the past few years. Otherwise, buy Nebraska and pretend this album never happened.
0385510454|1.0|This book was a great disappointment.  I kept reading it because I wanted to finish it (one of my own rules - I always finish what I start) and not because I was enjoying it.  The ending was just that - an ending.  It was almost as if the author was ready for it to end, too.  There was no climax, no great plot, no anything of substance to this book.  I have read all of John Grisham's books, but from now on I will not buy a book simply because it has his name.  I agree with another reviewer - maybe he needs to take a break.

0440418569|5.0|The first two books in this trilogy were fantastic, and this book is just ten times better.  From the minute you pick it up, you are immediately engrossed in this story.    The book picks up with Will going off in search of Lyra.  After their inevitable reunion, the adventure that ensues is everything that Mr Pullman hinted to in the previous two books.  Multi-world travel (including new ones), all out war, a confrontation with a supposedly \\"all-powerfull\\" being, and the temptation.  What happens during the confrontation with the \\"all powerfull\\" is supposed to be a metaphor...see if you can figure it out.      Many people complain that the book is very anti-religous.  Those people are not quite grasping Mr. Pullman's intent.  He is shedding light on his view of organized religion and its history of oppression.  Remember it's one man's opinion.      The story is fast-paced and very exciting.  The reader will get very emotionally attached to the two central characters, Lyra and Will.  I was very sorry when the stroy was over and can't wait for \\"The Book of Dust\\" to be published. I recommend this story to mature teens and to every adult who enjoys well written stories that also make you think about life and what happens afterwards. My highest compliments to Mr. Pullman.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|i saw arcade fire perform on what i think may have been a repeat of conan o'brien the other night and was blown away by their performance.  i just go nuts seeing a chick playing an accordian on television i guess.  but it was more than that; the music had such a familiar yet distinct sound i had to pick this record up.  i had been familiar with was has been incorrectly dubbed the \\"post-indie\\" canadian sound including bands like godspeed you! black emperor, a silver mt. zion, do make say think, and the other alumni of hotel2tango, but had never heard of arcade fire.  needless to say, \\"funeral\\" blew me away.  although i was briefly reminded of the band koufax when i first listened, the complexity and versatility of arcade fire quickly repressed that thought.  the album is just great overall, from the clever cover art, to the way the liner notes are prepared as a kind of morbid playbill, to the integrity of the music.  my main picks from the album are \\"neighborhood#2(laika)\\", \\"crown of love\\", and the finale track \\"in the backseat\\", a sombre ballad that almost brought me to tears.  and part of the album is en francais, so you cant beat that.  well worth the money, get this album...

B000002MUN|5.0|Some artists hit it early on in their careers (ie Niel Young and 'Harvest') whereas others reach it later on. Petty found it with 'Wildflowers'. This is arguably his most mature album, and yet he still has a subtle sense of humor. I very much feel this was Petty's 'Harvest'.

Its a spacy record, and if youre into hard riffs, it may not be your cup of tea.

B00004U8P9|5.0|You have to have a special kind of mindset to view the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and it really is a film that either you love it or hate it. Its strengths are its fabulous score and its stagings, which are incredible. If you're looking for a strong plot, however, this is NOT the movie for you, because this is the most plotless of all musicals. It really is a musical for the sake of being a musical and nothing else. If you have a rather twisted sense of humor, a liking for the bizarre and unusual, and are ready to step out of the conventional mold in life, this movie is likely to be the trip you've been waiting for. If not, you'll probably want to sit this one out. It's definitely not for everybody.    It helps to understand that this movie was not a success originally. It was only in later years when in screenings that the audience participated in the showings that it started to gain popularity. At that time, it became a cult film with its own following. Today, audiences view it quite differently than they did when it first came out, with a very different sort of appreciation. It is still a very plotless musical that shines for its impressive score and stagings; most people who buy the movie have a favorite scene or song that makes them want to see it over and over. There's something almost hypnotic about the way it invites people to join in with the fun, which was how it became the popular film that it is today.    Tim Curry plays his part with all his heart and said for years afterward that he was happy to know that there were people as warped as he was, because he owed it to them that the film was such a success and contributed to his later success. The film did prove to be a springboard for his later career. The same could be said for the entire cast, however. Susan Sarandon in the part of Janet Weiss, a rather innocent type who sings in such a pure voice in the beginning, undergoes a transformation in the film much as did the real life Susan Sarandon in her career. Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien, Patricia Quinn, Little Nell, Peter Hinwood, Jonathan Adams, and Meatloaf all appear in the film that is solid entertainment from start to finish. Either you love it or you hate it, but you can't ignore it, that's for sure.
055357342X|5.0|The \\"Fire and Ice\\" books by George R. R. Martin are written from an adult's perspective; if this were a movie, I would give it an R rating for sex and violence. <br /> <br />The plotting is cleverly done and involving. The geography and societal divisions are fictional, and yet are grounded in similar geographical locations and historical forms of Britain, Europe, and Asia. More importantly, the characters are finely crafted, well-rounded, and complete -- no two-dimensional, black and white definitions here. <br /> <br />While despising the evil actions taken, the character definition allows you to understand motivations and to some extent identify with even the worst individuals. At the same time, even the heroes have flaws, flaws which are intrinsic to the high standards they try to follow. <br /> <br />There are no \\"Disney deaths\\" in this series. Also, there is no guarantee that good or admirable characters will win; they are in real danger, from real evil, and it becomes apparent that there is some bad in even the best of us.
B00005UW9T|5.0|Okay, yes, Anastasia is historically inaccurate but who cares?  Just watch a movie to have fun sometimes.  And, yes, Rasputin was unnecessary but Anastasia had to be marketed as a kids' movie, and I don't think any parent wants their kids to see a princess fight Vladimir Lenin... as funny as that would be.  Plus, it's an interesting twist, that Vladimir caused the Russian Revolution.   <br /> <br />Anyway... how do I put this? I LOVE this movie.  I think that there was one summer where I watched it two times a week.  Anasasia and Dmitri are one of the cutest animated couples ever; they had real chemistry!  Plus it was so cute how he was a servant and she was a princess.  Anyway, the reason that I like this movie so much is instead of some crazy plot device that allows a \\"commoner\\" and royalty to marry, the girl has to choose between being a princess and marrying whom she wants.  I like the message better.   <br /> <br />As for the music.. I love the music, and I don't think anyone can deny that Once Upon a December is one of the coolest scenes EVER.

6305944563|4.0|They sure get some adorable kids to play Oliver Twist.  \\"Despised by all and pitied by none.\\"  Hooey.  In 1922 Jackie Coogan owned Hollywood, and the hearts of Americans all over the world.<br /><br />  Well, the Kid could act, and don't let the cover art or p.r. department fool you.  This is Coogan's movie, and Lon Chaney is definitely a secondary character.  This 1922 silent movie is well done, and doesn't feel much more dated than the story it tells.  Lon Chaney, who must have been wearing some (probably terribly uncomfortable) contraption plays Fagin as a bent, wizened, sharp-nosed wheedler.<br /><br />  I enjoyed LIGHT OF FAITH, the 32-minute add-on movie, more than OLIVER TWIST.  Chaney stars in this one, sans cumbersome make-up, playing a street tough who falls for a young woman who moves into his tenement building.  The woman, as they were wont to do back then, is failing from a broken heart.  The distant object of her affection found the Grail Tennyson wrote of in his Arthurian tales.  The Grail, she tells the impressionable Chaney, glows with an inner light and has remarkable curative powers.<br /><br />  So, the girl's dangerously declining, her old beau has the Grail, and Chaney has a larcenous inspiration.  Director Clarence Brown delicately handles the material, and Chaney gives a subtle and nuanced performance.

0684857219|5.0|I have over 30 books on bodybuilding and this book is truly the best book on bodybuilding there is. The only book that comes close is the 1st edition of this book from 1985 which I also have. Arnold lays it all out on how to build a great body. The book has a great history lesson on bodybuilding covering how bodybuilding evolved from strength shows into it's own seprate sport. The book is packed with inspiring pictures of all the bodybuilding greats past and present. Arnold then gives you 3 types of training programs (basic, advanced, & competition) each with 2 levels of intensity. Some complain that these workouts are too much and lead to overtraining. If you can't keep up just add more rest days. Likewise you have to realize that numbers on a page don't convey how hard you have to train in order to get a great body. You really have to go beyond the numbers and put everything you have into training. This book explains every training principle & exercise allowing the reader to exercise their brain and make a custom routine. He even takes a little knock on page 203 against his rival Mike Mentzer's training plan Heavy Duty (now called HIT, by the way Arnold crushed Mentzer at the 1980 Olympia after only training for 8 weeks. Mike was so distraught he claimed a conspiracy, retired and remained bitter until his timely death). This book then gives great information on nutrition and how to eat in order to get big and ripped. Want to know how to pose or win a contest this book takes you through the paces. This book has everything you'll ever need in order to be Mr. Olympia or simply look good with no shirt at the beach. This is a great book and perfect for anyone interested in bodybuilding. Other great bodybuilding books I reccomend are Blood & Guts by Dorian Yates. A Warriors's story also by Dorian Yates. Also pick up Ronnie Coleman's new book Hardcore and CEO Muscle by Jay Cutler. Arnold's Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding is the only bible you need to guide you in life.
0316172324|3.0|I found this a rather typical self-help book, but Gladwell's insights into thinking and how we do it, why we make the decisions that we do, and how to \\"look both ways first\\" are still interesting. Worth a look, but don't expect to learn something truly earthshaking and groundbreaking.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|Accommodating someone else can be helpful to maintain peace, happiness, and joy in a relationship, but it can also affect the person in a relationship negatively.  Many find themselves sinking into a mundane lifestyle while being helpful toward their partner, which often is the result of meeting the partner halfway.  This routine can turn into a monotonous journey where the person in the relationship could forget personal joy in the pursuit of keeping the partner happy.  Sometimes this leads to a break up, or divorce, as the person seeks alternative ways outside the relationship to find a route back to personal happiness in life.<br /><br />In Shall We Dance the audience finds the estate lawyer John Clark (Richard Gere) pondering existential purpose in life.  Often John thinks about life and his existence, as he reflects over previous meetings with clients due to someone's written will.  This pondering often takes place on the \\"L\\", which is the local train system within the Chicago area.  Recently has John's contemplations drifted toward happiness, which his wife Beverly (Susan Sarandon) prompted after having celebrated one of his middle age birthdays with his family.<br /><br />John is not unhappy, but he feels that there is something missing -- something better in life.  One evening on his way home on the \\"L\\" he sees a woman standing by a window.  Intrigued by the woman's face he keeps seeking her every evening with his eyes on the way home from work.  He notices that the woman stands in a dance studio and one day he musters up enough courage to visit it.<br /><br />John enters the dance studio gazing at the mysterious woman, who he later finds out is named Paulina (Jennifer Lopez).  In the dance studio John is pushed into taking ballroom-dancing lessons through which he meets Chic (Bobby Cannavale) and Vern (Omar Benson Miller).  They all have different motives to take dance lessons, but the theme is the same as they all are there because of an attractive partner.  Vern is getting married and wants to impress his fianc&eacute; while Chic wants to use his skills in dancing to impress the girls.  However, as they learn how to take the proper steps, they also find out that dance is something sensual, expressive, and artistic.<br /><br />Secretively John continues to dance as he pursues Paulina, however, Beverley is getting suspicious, as he appears more joyful. Beverly hires a private detective to find out what John is doing that is making him so happy, as she suspects that he might be having an affair.  One evening when John advances on Paulina, she expresses firmly that she does not see students.  Mildly hurt John decides not to go back to the studio, but against his decision he returns to the dance studio, as it actually appears to bring him joy.<br /><br />The story is directed by Peter Chelsom who also made Serendipity (2001) and Funny Bones (1995), but this time he is making a remake.  Shall We Dance turns out to be another Japanese story, as the big production companies in Hollywood have recently decided to turn to the east for new material.  This has given the audience films such as Ring (2002) and Grudge (2004).  The tradition to make remake is not new in Hollywood, as Three Men and a Baby originated from France while Last Man Standing was based on Kurosawa's story Yojimbo (1961).  The question is whether the audience needs to see remakes, which might be argued from both sides of the issue.  Nevertheless, Shall We Dance provides a good cinematic experience, which offers joyful tears and cheering laughter.  The film gives a Western version of this story, and it still provides valuable lessons in regards to family, happiness, and self-actualization.artner.

B000060P79|1.0|This whiny pop punk ass bull sucks!  If you listen to it, stick your extremeities into a blender.  NOW.
B0006M4SO6|3.0|I am a huge Pat Metheny fan and own almost all of his work. My personal favorite is \\"We Live Here\\" with its wonderful blend of memorable melodies and improvisation. While there is some of the \\"classic\\" Metheny sound in \\"The Way Up\\", for me personally, there's not enough. I really enjoyed the Opening track, along with the first part of \\"Part One\\" and \\"Part Three\\". The remainder of the CD, especially \\"Part Two\\" really drag with pointless tempo and melody changes.  <br /> <br />Any true Metheny fan will want this in their collection, but I personally enjoyed \\"Speaking of Now\\", \\"We Live Here\\", \\"Secret Story\\" and \\"Still Life (Talking)\\" more.
B0002OERI0|1.0|This kind of music should never have a concept piece.  They are delving into an area of music that they really do not deserve.  Only talented artists can do it.  Not rich artists complaining how the government is making them poor.  That is bullslit.  This is all human freakin' excrement too.  All these damn bands sound the same too.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Good movie that kept me interested.  There were a couple of parts that made me think of Men in Black but over all good acting by Will Smith.  Not a movie I would take the time to watch again though.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is like a great book you just can't put down.  When my Stanford son and Duke daughter visited over Christmas, I showed them the series.  They resisted the idea of a space western, but at the end of the pilot my son said, \\"that was good,\\" to which my daughter replied, \\"yes, that was very good.\\"  I realized I was enjoying it even more on the second viewing than on the first.  From then on, it took real discipline to limit ourselves to two episodes a night till the series ran out:  someone always said, \\"one more.\\"  Even my wife, who is foreign-born and normally doesn't like American humor, was gripped by this series' wit as well as by its action.  Starfly had everything, imaginative concepts, great cast and writing, truly special camera work -- all in all brilliant!  Anyone who loves westerns or likes sci-fi, do yourself a favor and watch the DVD, then see the movie.   <br />RLW
B0002IVN9W|1.0|....unless you think Lou Reed is god.  In which case, you might think that this album is the bees knees that the critics have described it as.  Yes, it's well packaged, laid out, presented..a nice little artistic theme throughout...but guess what?  The music ISN'T GOOD!!!!  Underneath all the pretention and hype, lie songs that just aren't good!!  And vocals that are virtually unlistenable. I might not give this album only 1 star, because some of the intstumental aspects of a few tunes are cool, but there are so many glowing reviews from the sheeple on Amazon that SOMEONE needs to give the potential buyer a friggin' reality check.  This album is #14 on Amazon? THIS ALBUM IS #14 ON AMAZON!!!!!  Proves how easily so many are swayed.   Open your ears, wash the residue of the Pitchfork review out of you sponge like brain, and listen to the CLIPS for GOODNESS SAKE before buying this.
B0001932ZA|5.0|This DVD is one of my favourite Ahhnold movies :o) so possibly the review is biased!!! <br /> <br />I am somewhat disappointed that this DVD has not come out in Australia, I have waited along time (in the mean time I have got the rest of the Arnold DVD's) for it to come out in Region 4 but still nothing, I saw it on Amazon (region 1: I believe this is American). Picture qulity is great, sounds is great and it has I high amount of Arnolds one liners! \\"Where is Buzzsaw\\"?  \\"He had to split\\"!! haha - great!!!
B00065U08Q|3.0|This is John's experimental electronic based album.  It's cool that he warned everyone of this before releasing it.  That said, if you are to buy this, listen wiht an open mind.  There's not much in the way of guitar heroics but it's an overall interesting piece of work.  Josh Klinghoffer has more of a prominent role on this album providing more vocals than on previous Frusciante releases and in fact singing some songs himself.  Sphere is an amazing opener with a four minute intro reminiscent of the soundtrack to old Atari/Nintendo games from the '80s.  At about four and a half minutes, John's one and only real definite guitar solo for the entire album kicks in and goes for somethin liek two minutes over the synthesizers.  The song ends up being 9 minutes long as opposed to the original half hour version John had written and contains no vocals or drums.  The Afterglow is probably the catchiest song on the album with techno-sounding drums and synths over a funky guitar lick played by Josh.  John's vocals at times sound similar to disco singers liek donna summer during this song.  Walls is a relatively good track with some cool synth strings being played.  Communique and At Your Enemies have so little involvement from John that one would barely notice his presence.  These songs are boring and non memorable.  They have their occasional good moments but just aren't up to par.  Surrogate People picks it back up with John back on the vocals with Josh.  This song has a cool acoustic guitar lick and is an overall cool song to listen to.  My Life is a short piano and vocals ballad entirely done by John live.  It reminds me of beatles songs liek \\"Let it Be\\" and just overall feels out of place on this album.  Also, it has a feeling liek he could have made it longer and placed it on a different solo record such as The Will To Death.  Overall, this album is about number four or number five in rank of the Frusciante solo releases.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This was accually the first cd I had gotten of LP.  This got me hooked on the probably forever.  Chester is an awsome singer but i think he needs to scream a little bit more in there up and coming cds, if they have one.
B00028HBKM|1.0|THIS HAS TO BE THE FUNNIEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! AND FOR THAT I GIVE 5 STARS. BUT FOR ACCURACY AND LOGIC I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE IT A -20. IT WAS FUNNY THOUGH, SINCE NONE OF THIS STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND THERE JUST MAKING IT UP, CHRIST MONTY PYTHON'S VERSION WAS A LOT MORE ACCURATE THAN THIS GARBAGE.
6305313687|5.0|Ok, keep in mind I love this movie. I think everyone should see it at least once, as it is easily the best picture of accumulating hatred, agression, and racism that has ever been made.     But \\"Weird Gurl\\"'s comment about how she doesn't think he should have gone to prison because he was defending himself and his family is just asinine. Protecting your family is one thing, but murdering two people in the most brutal possible way simply because they broke into your car is NOT self defense. They never even entered the house. The brutalness that I mentioned is that when Derek(Ed Norton) saw the three black men, he kicked open the door, shot one of them dead on the spot and shot a second in the leg. At this point the third man drove away in Derek's car, provoking Derek to empty the rest of his clip at the man while he drove away. He then proceeded to drag the remaining man out into the street, and forced him to open his mouth and bite the cement curb. While the man had his teeth on the curb, Derek Stomped on the back of his head, crushing his teeth first, before the rest of his head caved in. That is NOT self defense.    Unbelieveable...
B00074CBMY|4.0|Joe Cocker has always presented one of rock's most distinct voices, with the possible exception of Tom Waits, being the blackest-sounding white man in music. Yessir! <br /> <br />And he's put the ol' throat chords to great use this go 'round.  So many past-prime rockers are doing tribute CDs of the standards that it's become commonplace.  Mr. Cocker does a superb job of selecting \\"modern classics,\\" the great stuff we listened to 30 years ago, as opposed to repacking \\"our parents' Hit Parade.\\"  Lordy, mama, but he can make yer hair stand up intrepreting these songs. <br /> <br />I'm going to pick a nit.  If there's a single flaw that keeps this from being a perfect CD for me, it's the production.  Mr. Cocker's voice is formidable in texture and subtlty but powerfully expansive in reach.  The engineer simply appears to have been unable to adjust to the far-reaching boundaries of Mr. Cocker's vocal scope, often within a single song.  Given today's technology, this CD begs for a pristine sound that captures every emotion - large and small.  Make nothing away from Mr. Cocker though. He overrides any recording shortcomings and delivers. <br /> <br />Pick yer own fave on this set, but I'm stuck on \\"I Put A Spell On You,\\" \\"Jealous Guy,\\" and \\"Every Kind Of People.\\" <br /> <br />We're so close.  Let's get a classic on Vol. 2 guys. . .
B00005AQE8|5.0|first and best double disc album(everybody just HAS to do one now) from the greatest rapper of all time.
0375701427|4.0|yea, it's that good. <br /> <br />What do the great novels require?    <br />They require complete, well-developed characters, which this has.  They require a decent plot, complete with twists, joys, and sorrow;  again, a check-mark for this book.  They require a theme; don't be fooled by the other reviews, the greatest strength of this novel is its theme.  Another thing I find the best books have: a primary 'hobby' or skill so to speak, which a main character dwells upon, that ultimately serves to weave the story together; in this case: glovemaking (!)(?).   <br />Finally, the text must be readable.  I am a simple man.  I prefer the simple text of Hemingway and the Russians; certainly no more complex than Fitzgeral.  Of these here tenets, the prose of this novel is somewhat difficult to get through, though not insurmountable.  <br />Additionaly, literary techniques:  here one character transforms into another midway through the novel. <br /> <br />The theme and the prose: two archenemies, in this case, that work together to form a great novel.  You see, the theme is both obvious and hidden; more accurately, there exist deeper meanings and examples of the same theme:  the decline of our pastoral American lives.  Wade through the mud, but watch where you're going or you may miss something.  Reading the other reviews, I see this is the case. <br /> <br />The decline of American society.  So obvious to some, yet debateable to others.  The decline of the city of Newark, hollowed by the loss of ethnic homogeneity and pride, now racked with racial tension, poverty, and, above all, high corporate income taxes :)    The decline of the family: children lost to a wayward media and the rabid pace of exchanged ideas, and of course the philandering betrothed. <br /> <br />Who stands up to these evil forces but the main character Swede, and his father.  Swede attempts to survive his ordeal through Grace (yeah- that sort).  His father, at the end, in the climax, and last we see ofhim, while trying to wean an alchoholic from her brew, has been stabbed in the eye by this devolved serpent of society, one of several that populate the novel-  this one a drunkard, transformed such because she is married to a spiritually devoid adulterer and materialist.    <br /> <br />There is not much more to say.  Character and plot development, repleat with the character's [author's] reflections of which there are many, though slow and steady and yet interesting, are based around a family made wealthy by the business of glovemakeing, and chronicle this familiy's dissolution.
0395389496|5.0|The reason that THE POLAR EXPRESS has become so popular is not necessarily because of the book's story. Well, actually the book doesn't have much of a story: boy questions if Santa exists, on Christmas Eve a train shows up at his house and whisks him off to the North Pole, he meets Santa and gets a sleigh bell, he loses the bell, goes back home, opens presents the next morning, the last present opened includes the lost sleigh bell with a note from Santa, and the boy becomes a life-long believer. At 32 pages with massive illustrations on most of the pages, that's about the entire story.<br /><br />This is the book that inspired the movie, but the movie and the book are two completely different entities. The movie is a fable about faith, but this: the original story, is not. Instead, it's simply a magnificently illustrated Christmas story. That's it. The story isn't that impressive, but the illustrations are what make the book what it is. In that sense, the book is more a work of art than anything else. Outside of that, it makes a nice story to read around Christmastime or something that children who like trains might enjoy flipping through and reading. Just watch out for the wolves in the woods.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I had become casually acquainted with Ryan through Whiskeytown before this CD came out. Rest assured,this is NOT Whiskeytown..there's nary a steel guitar to be heard here and the banjo that graces \\"Answering Bell\\" is for atmospherics rather than bluegrass purism.<br /><br />The truth about this record is somewhere in between those calling him the new Dylan and those calling it soulless commercial pap. Yes, this is definitely more produced than past outings, but the word \\"overproduced\\" is usually a straw man invoked by those who steadfastly proclaim less is more in spite of the evidence otherwise when properly deployed. (How on Earth could knocking bricks out of the Wall of Sound improve Phil Spector's work?)<br /><br />Yes, this is a bit overly long, due to inclusion of a couple weak tracks that could go without hurting the album (\\"Sylvia Plath\\", \\"Wild Flowers\\",\\"Feel Touch and Lose\\", and \\"Enemy Fire\\") and allowing some other songs to go on WAY past the point at which they're still musically interesting (9 minutes for \\"Nobody Girl\\"? 6 minutes for \\"Tina Toledo\\"?). With those cuts and slicing the two longest tunes in half approximately, you'd now have an album hovering around the 44 minute mark. Judicious editing would probably improve this, maybe to 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />There are a few other miscues here and there, like the choir backing on \\"The Rescue Blues\\" which just renders it silly (the choir works better for \\"Touch, Feel and Lose\\" but the song itself is weaker). \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\", while one of the better cuts, does have a muffed note where his voice pretty much cracks that should have been victim to Ethan John's editing.<br /><br />On the whole, there's some wonderful songwriting, coupled with nice arrangments, that lend me to believe this will wear well on my ears with time. Favourites are \\"Answering Bell\\", \\"New York, New York\\", \\"Somehow, Someday\\" and \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\".
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|Man, the video and the first song released were so exciting to me, I rushed out to buy the album and listened to it the second I got home. The first song was great, reminded me of the Talking Heads, then it went down hill from there! Each song got progressively more and more boring. With so many wonderful elements that made each song *almost* great, it was a huge disappointment to see that not a single one of them really made it to that point. Generic pop-rock. What a bummer.
B000002GGU|3.0|If you only know Bryan Adams as the sensitive, caring (read: boring) balladeer of adult contemporary radio, it may surprise you to know there was a time when he made hits with muscular guitars. Before he switched to a career stuffing saccharine into the airwaves, Adams knew the value of a jagged riff and cutting lyrics.<br /><br />High points:Far and away, the best realized tune is \\"Summer of '69\\" even if it's probably fictionalized (as someone pointed out, Adams was only 10 in 1969..when he claims he \\"bought his first real six-string\\" and \\"played it 'til my fingers bled\\"). He simultaneously celebrates and castigates the good old days, wondering where his first girlfriend is and why it fell apart but still maintaining \\"those were the best years of my life\\". \\"Kids Wanna Rock\\" was an anti-new wave anthem. (Imagine a time when \\"kids\\" actually listened to Adams?!?).  \\"Run to You\\" also makes the grade as Adams rationalizes an affair, complaining to his mistress that his main squeeze is \\"cold\\". In \\"Ain't Gonna Cry\\" a non-squeaky clean Adams insists he's \\"not too shy to say what I'm thinkin'\\" and threatens to \\"maybe re-arrange your face\\" if his ex-flame comes around again.<br /><br />Lows:  \\"Somebody\\" and \\"One Night Love Affair\\" are probably the least memorable of the stack of singles that came off the release. \\"She's Only Happy When She's Dancin'\\" is frothy filler.<br /><br />Usually Adams works a formula, but he works it pretty well here, making for an above average CD.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars
B00004TWZF|5.0|Luc Besson's the Big Blue may be my favourite movie ever. The Eric Serra music, as well as the gorgeous cinematography are fantastic. But it is the amazing acting of underrated actor Jean Marc Barr as Jacques Mayol, and his chemistry with Jean Reno and Rosanna Arquette that turned this movie in a phenomenon in th 80s. Indeed, in France, the Big Blue became an instant cult classic for a full generation turning Besson into a mega star. He went on becoming the European George Lucas, but the BIg Blue remains a unique and fascinating story. A must see and a timeless classic
B00005JMYI|1.0|No, this is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen. I had high hopes for this movie, but I couldn't even get all the way thru it.  One of the main characters, Brick:\\"...Years later a doctor will tell me that I have an I.Q. of 48 and that I am what people would call mentally retarded.\\"  Then the whole movie has this guy saying inappropriate things, and that's supposed to be comedy?  I did not laugh once.  NOT ONCE!  Very disappointed. <br /> <br />
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park were never good, and I regret liking the band 3 years ago.  I bought \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and couldn't stop listening to it. This was when I was 13 years old. One and a half years later, my mom bought me \\"Meteora\\" and \\"Rage Against The Machine\\".  I have regrets buying this piece of crap now. They have become one of the biggest mainstream \\"rock\\" bands out there, and their talent is wasted. One and a half years later, I burnt a copy to put in \\"safe keeping\\" in case I wanted to give it to one of my kids (I may not have kids...I'm an idiot). I sold this CD and got $6.25 out of it! Guess mainstream rock really is worth a lot!<br /><br />If you buy this album, only buy it as a drink coaster or a blank to use for shooting practice.
B0000025RI|5.0|Off The Wall (1979) was an absolutely explosive album by the genius Michael Jackson. Produced by Quincy Jones, Off The Wall was a blockbuster success on both sides of the Atlantic and featured a wealth of hit singles, including the stunning Rock With You.  <br /> <br />Expectations were high for Jacksons next studio project in 1982 and many cynics suggested that Off The Wall (1979) simply couldn't be bettered. However the phenomenal success of Off The Wall (1979) was mereley mediocre in contrast to Thriller (1982). Again, the project was aided by the genius production skills of Quincy Jones.  <br /> <br />Thriller (1982) even more than Off The Wall (1979), really conveys Jacksons extraordinary artistic vision showing off his unparalled talents and shrewd choice of music. Jackson glides through all nine of the origanal recordings with effortless energy showcasing his highly versatile and rocketing vocal approach that neatly surfboards along the complex and dynamic musical arrangements.  <br /> <br />Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' opens the album on a high with its cool, sparse production coated by a a jamming, funky performance from Jackson.  <br /> <br />Baby Be Mine, containing undertones of red hot, pulsating funk is ignited further by Jacksons shimmering vocal delivery. Jackson duets with former Beatle singer Paul McCartney on the vibrant ballad, The Girl Is Mine. Both Jackson and McCartney are two such diverse, gifted artists that surprisingly sound so compatable together on record. Both performances are strong and passionate complimenting the lush orchestrations.  <br /> <br />The title track, Thriller is of course one of wacko Jackos many landmarks in his musical career. With more undertones of pure, pulsating funk and swirling, eerie musical arrangements this track is, without doubt, another classic to Jacksons credit. Jackson embodies his heart and soul into this track and Thriller went on to become another Cross- Atlantic smash hit (and who can forget that video that accompanied it).  <br /> <br />Even more compelling musically was the rip-roaring, totally awewsome Beat It. From that dazzling, tempo-shifting introduction, the track leads into a riotously funky affair where Jackson rides along a tidal wave of musical arrangements consisting of heavy, repetitive drum beats, synthesisers, electric keyboards and a tenor sax solo not to mention that stunning electric guirtar interlude at the bridge of the song. From the shimmering verses to the exalting chrous, Beat It is quite simply another out and out classic that possibly,along with Billie Jean, stands as the cream of the crop on this album (or indeed his entire recording career).  <br /> <br />Billie Jean is also, perharps THE definitive Michael Jackson classic. Beginning with a hooky groove that is immediately contagious, it rapidly pumps out into raw funk that is delivered with an electric and a sizzling, sexually charged performance from Jackson. This astounding, timeless classic became a much deserved cross-Atlantic chart topper.  <br /> <br />Human Nature is much more lush and exotic with its divine, sweeping musical arrangements. Though slightly sugary in its content, Human Nature is another instantly memroable recording that is ignited by the smooth vocal approach of Jackson.  <br /> <br />P.Y.T (pretty young thing) continues in vastly similar vein that holds individual merits of its own whilst things then wind down finishing on a fittingly sophisticated high with that gorgeous, sultry ballad The Lady In My Life. Jacksons' exuberant delivery conveys such style and finesse and proved what a highly adept vocalist Jackson is when divulging into varying styles of music.  <br /> <br />Thriller, to date, has sold well over 40,000,000 copies worldwide and remains the biggest selling album in pop music history (if not THE biggest). Whatever thoughts and perceptions one might have on Jacksons rather fragile, odd, child-look demeanour, theres simply no denying that when itcomes to talent Michael Jackson is right there at the top of the list and remains an upmost genius for his wonderfully-crafted music and continues to be a strong innovator amongst todays new generation of pop singers.  <br /> <br /> <br />Ian Phillips  <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie was not only hopeless and boring, it was a complete waste of money. I don't even agreee with a 1 star rating, it deserves at the very most a half star. <br />The characters were annoying, the storyline painfully erratic and the length was just WAY TOO LONG. Don't waste your money.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|In that time a real bass baritone could sang Don Giovanni. Cesare Siepi is one of the best singers of all time, and easily one of the best 5 basses (to the people that doenst know him well, he usually sanged bass roles like Zaccaria, Fiesco, Phillip and Mephistofeles). His portrayal is amazing, with a powerfull voice, yet ellegant and very flexible, his acting is very good and he doent make the mistale many don giovanni does, that is, going to the extreme of look like a pervert or look like a metrosexual (for lacking of a better word). The other singers are awesome too, maybe i was a little dissapointed by the Commendatore, but nothing is perfect. <br />Furtwangler is nearly god, and the setting is quite charming. <br />Its not only a exellent version of the opera, is a reminder of how good the singers of 40 years ago sang, not only in the quality of their voices, but also in technique.
B000002UA0|5.0|This may seem like a strange statement to those not in the know, but any record nerd out there who knows what I'm talking about knows exactly what I mean. In most cases the difference between mono and stereo is not too significant, and stereo is obviously superior. The thing to understand about this album and others released around '67-'68 (i.e. Sgt. Pepper) is that two separate mixdowns were made from the original master tapes. ie. THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS ALBUM. Because mono was still a more popular sound format, there was a tendency to spend more time and care on the mono. This is true for albums such as Sgt. Pepper which any audiophile geek will tell you sounds superior in mono, and beleive me it does. However, in the case of that and other albums the difference is not so overwhelmingly significant. But the difference between the stereo and mono mix of Piper is like night and day, and the stereo mix is a bastardized, botch job mix of this album. Unfortunately any CD version of an older album is going to be the stereo mix, leaving future generations the misfortune of never properly hearing this album. When I first heard about the mono mix of this album, it was some mythical thing worth so much money that I thought I would never hear it. But in 1997, due to the demand there was a 30th anniversary reissue of the mono mix of Piper released on CD and LP. Amazon has this CD listed, it's the limited edition re-issue with the weird green cover. Unfortunately, it's out of stock on amazon, but I occasionally see it on ebay for not too much money. Seriously, I would strongly encourage any fan of this record or Pink Floyd or Syd Barrett to get a copy of the mono mix of this album ASAP. When people first gave me this advice, I was like, come on, it can't be that big of a deal. Trust me, it is. The brilliance of this album was lost in the stereo mix. I'm talking full instrumentation, soundscapes, all gone. Once you hear the mono mix you will understand that this album truly is one of the greatest albums of this era. I'm a big Pink Floyd fan and personally I prefer their earlier work, though anything through The Final Cut is worthwhile music. Meddle was always my favorite Pink Floyd album, that is until I heard the mono mix of Piper. It stands as my favorite Pink Floyd album, hands down. If you love this band or this album, please please please get the mono mix, it breaks my heart to see it forgotten.
B0000070QN|4.0|I'm not as fanatical about this album as most Harem Scarem fans.  I like it, but I don't think it's their #1 album.  \\"No Justice\\" and \\"Saviours Never Cry\\" are excellent bonecrushing rockers and alone are worth buying this CD.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|If I had written this review just after watching Napoleon Dynamite, I would have given it 1-1/2 stars (just like Ebert). However, the more time goes by, the funnier and better it gets! The deadpan, no-emotion delivery makes it a bit strange at first, but that is what makes some of the lines SO FRICKEN FUNNY! About the only folks who would find this movie un-funny would be the Summer-and-her-friends people of the world. The rest of us can sit back, relax and Have a Killer Time! <br /> <br />The fact that this movie has done so well, WITHOUT VIOLENCE, WITHOUT SEX, WITHOUT FOUL LANGUAGE could send a message to Hollywood.... <br /> <br />VOTE FOR PEDRO! GOSH!
B00006J9OT|5.0|Let it be said that I AM a Diana Krall fan.  Of all her albums, this is an essential must-have for anyone who likes jazz or loves Diana Krall.  I agree that some of Ms. Krall's albums have been over produced and over orchestrated (namely The Look of Love - what's with all the bossa novas anyway?).  But this album is where Ms. Krall shines.  I mean REALLY shines!  I can't help but tap my foot, sing along and wish to god that I could play piano when I listen to this CD.   <br /> <br />It doesn't get any better than \\"A Case of  You\\", \\"Maybe You'll Be There\\" and \\"I Love Being Here With You\\".  My only wish would be that \\"Do It Again\\", \\"All or Nothing At All\\" and \\"I Don't Know Enough About You\\" had been included on the CD like they had on the DVD... which I also highly recommend.
B00005JN4O|5.0|At a time when there are so many films, that after watching you wonder, why was this made.....Finding Neverland was a gem!  Long after you finished watching this film, it had a way of \\"sticking with you\\". The acting was wonderful, the story well written.  Rather than the common insult to the intelligence, that our country accepts happily, this film assumes that the viewer is thinking. Loved it! <br />
B0006IUDXA|5.0|No show was ever more entertaining than MacGyver.  This show came out during my teens and became my all time personal favorite to watch (I still watch it on cable and am glad to say it still rocks).   No one took care of the bad guys better than MacGyver did.  I haven't opened my set yet as I am waiting for all the other seasons to be released for my collection.    I've read people complaining about the dvd collection not having any special features.  I bought this set for the actual shows and to me that's the most important thing and knowing that you'll have many years to enjoy it over and over again.  GO ANGUS MACGYVER!

B00005MP58|5.0|I love this series- the adaptation is brilliant. We can see why Bridget Jones is fascinated by Colin Firth as Darcy- he is just wonderful. I pull this set out once a year or so for a full weekend marathon of pure romantic escapism. <br />Pair this with \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and you have a winning literary film feast. <br />I find the DVDs are holding up well with repeated play- about 4 times so far in 4 years- color etc is good. I have not noticed the color issues others have noted but I bought mine through A&E directly when it first came out- could it be that later prints are just not as good as the originals in the special edition? Have they changed printers/ manufacturers? THis would explain the discrepancy. <br />
0060977493|5.0|This is in response to anyone who did not like the book.  <br /> <br />Please read Thoreau's WALDEN. You all inspire a certain quote in the beginning.  <br /> <br />And for YOU...  <br />To learn about India you must go to India and live like an Indian. You can't expect to get an in dept feel of the place or its' people by reading this book.

1400032717|5.0|Well, to start of with this book is deffinately worth a go (at reading that is). It is worthy of its 5 stars because it was written absaloutly fabuously by the genious that is Mark Haddon.It follows the tragic life of a teenage boy ,living in this very day and age, who has aspergers syndrome. You see the world through his eyes`and it is as if you are breathing his breath and grunting his grunts. You follow him on a terryfying journey to discover the truth of his pasts. Could you ask for much more?
B000059TEP|5.0|This is one of my top 50 favorite movies.  Everybody is great in it from Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore to Whoppi Goldberg.  Even the two villians were excellent though I heard that the actor who played Willie Lopez actually passed away not long after making the film.<br /><br />Sam Wheat a banker, is murdered during a mugging while coming from a show with his girlfriend Mollie.  For some reason Wheat is still walking the Earth, now in ghost form.  He follows Mollie and finds that the killer was really after a password that he had to authorize funds transfers through the bank.  Now Mollie is also in danger from the killers and Sam feels helpless.<br /><br />Sam then happens upon Goldberg, who is running a scam as a medium who can communicate with the dead.  Apparently, Goldberg can hear Sam talk so Sam uses Goldberg to try to communicate with Mollie and warn her of danger.<br /><br />Sam then realizes that the only way to protect Mollie is to be able to use some sort of physical force.  The only problem is as a ghost he has no physical substance so he cannot touch anything.  Or can he?  Sam learns that maybe he can touch objects when he encounters another ghost who is able to do just that.  The other ghost turns out to be one of the most entertaining characters of the film.<br /><br />The movie has it all from a love story, to excellent comedy, fairly decent special effects and a great story.
0393314804|1.0|I have never understood the big to do this film has caused.  It is absolutely awful. I rented the Video with high expectations only to turn it off half way through.  It reeks.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Van Helsing (2004). Universal Pictures. Rated PG-13. Running Time: 2 hours, 11 mins. Live-action.<br />Directed, produced and written by Stephen Sommers.<br /><br />Sequel to the animated film, Van Helsing: The London Assignment (2004). But this film starring Hugh Jackman is live-action.<br /><br /> Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a traveler of the world killing the very things that we fear the most.  As Van Helsing says, if it bites humans and human created it, he will kill them.<br />  The story begins in black & white.  It is when the &#34;Frankenstein&#34; creature is being created in Transylvania.  Van Helsing is there as well.  He must destroy this creature.  One year later (now in color), he is after the &#34;Hyde&#34; creature that Dr. Jeckyll has transformed into.  Hyde is 25 times bigger than the hunchback of Norte Dame.  The fight is good one, but when Hyde becomes Dr. Jeckyll again, all that the townspeople see is a dead Dr. Jeckyll (now back to his normal human self)having fallen to the ground.  They believe Van Helsing killed him.  But of course.  However, the townspeople never saw the Hyde creature transform.  A Bishop calls upon Van Helsing to rid Europe of more of these &#34;creatures.  Next it's the werewolf.<br />  I shall not spoil any further surprises, but this is a fun film to watch.  This film seemed to come out of nowhere.  What a surprise!  I had no idea they were filming this one.<br />  Are you asking yourself where you have heard the name &#34;Van Helsing&#34;?<br />  Edward Van Sloan played &#34;Van Helsing&#34; in Dracula (1931).<br />  Laurence Olivier played &#34;Van Helsing&#34; in Dracula (1979).<br />  Richard Benjamin played &#34;Van Helsing&#34; in Love At First Bite (1979).<br /><br />  DVD includes a feature where by hidden cameras, not known where by the actors, can give you a different angle of the scene and show you how it was filmed.<br />  A sequel to VAN HELSING would have been nice, but they never had a part 2<br /><br />Van Helsing tv series (Syfy, 2016-present).
B00029NMRC|3.0|The Whole Ten Yards was quite a disappointment, considering the success of the first film and the make up of the cast. <br />The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the humor is very poor, and the plot is just average.   <br />Matthew Perry getting hit and smacked around got tiring and annoying very early on. As for the \\"idiot\\" Hungarian mafia family, it was just SAD and not funny at all! <br />Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really... <br />In a nutshell, it's an ok movie, and that's about it; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.  No masterpiece here. <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|Great CD!!  Much, much praise!!  It seems that many of today's new British-Bands are GREAT amalgamations of bands from years past.  Not-surprisingly, their sounds are reminiscent of very SUCCESSFUL and INNOVATIVE bands (The Beatles, The Who, The Clash, Led Zeppelin, U2, Sex Pistols, Radiohead etc.).  It is humorous to critique how: THIS song reminds me of THAT classic song by THAT classic band.  I suppose it is a great way to make sure the sound will sell!!!!    <br />  Keane is no exception.  However, what I really enjoy in Keane is the romanticism in their songs.  This is most often found in Tom Chaplin's vocals. He always sounds so committed to his texts and his melodies (mind you, it helps that he is not playing the piano).  The singer sustains his vowels to the ends of phrases, he has an even-ness of tone, and a sky-blue angelic tenor voice.  His voice evokes passion, love, innocence, intelligence, and sorrow (without sounding morbid and depressive).  Pilate's lead singer Todd Clark and the late Jeff Buckley are (tenor) lead singers with somewhat similar vocal qualities that are generally displayed by singers who have been somewhat classically trained.     <br />        I think that a great singer has a way of making music more interesting than it really is.  Tom Chaplin is a great singer.  \\"Hopes and Fears\\" is very beautiful and very inviting!!!   Go buy it!      <br />
B00005QCYC|5.0|These three films are all really fun and entertiaining films. This set is great if you do not own the three films on DVD yet. If you are a fan of monster movies or sc-fi pick it up!
B0006IUDXA|2.0|Honestly.  I am happy to finally own all the episodes of the first season.  The show was still finding its legs, and it wasn't until season two that it really found it's stride, but it's still worth it to own them.  But for the price listed?  If this were a good release, replete with special features, commentary, interviews with Richard Dean Anderson and even Henry Winkler - it might be.  I'm a crazy fan, so I bought it, but I am not happening. <br /> <br />It's strange logic, no doubt.  Paramount will probably pony up the cash for a sweet season two release if season one does well, but it won't do well with this release.  Way to shoot yourself in the foot. <br /> <br />My advice:  Buy it as inexpensively as you can find it, and write an angry letter to Paramount.
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Countries, people and ideologies world over have forever debated upon the justifiability of capital punishment. Many arguments and counterarguments later an average person still forms his impression based upon some or the other personal experience. Someone who has no strong religious belief or who has not suffered -directly or indirectly- from any criminal act would arguably find herself in a dilemma as to which side to take.<br /><br />`Dead Man Walking' gives the audience an unbiased insight into the social issue of capital punishment. A subtly crafted script, brilliant performances by Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon and a delicate portrayal of events that lead to the execution of Sean Penn - for a brutal double crime of raping and killing - and most compellingly, the act of execution itself - gives the audience a first-hand exposure to the trauma experienced by those involved.<br /><br />It is indeed a very fine line. To kill or not to kill - that is the question. Why and who kills - is not the echoing thought you are left with. Instead you are haunted by the question - is it right to end a life regardless of who, when, why, how? Sean Penn's last words suggest otherwise. He has lived in a state of denial while not confessing, and probably in his self-delusion convincing himself that he too was a victim of a bigger act of serendipity. Eventually, he breaks down in an uneventful moment and accepts his crime before Susan Sarandon - the nun who has done everything she could to give him a fair chance. He subsequently apologizes to the parents of the victims just before his execution. In an enthralling climatic episode, the scenes of the brutal and shameless crime are brilliantly juxtaposed to the sophisticated act of execution. The breathtaking cathartic moments of this episode leave the audience with the big question - is taking a life right? Regardless of who does it.<br /><br />A must watch movie that leaves us with an issue to ponder over.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Unlike Friday the 13th which has tons of sequels mainly for milking, the Alien series was made with installments hoping to continue what could be a long running series. Halfway through it fell apart despite some genius scenes. Fox packaged all 4 films including special edition type films, and many other goodies for a set that is just massive to get through.<br /><br />Alien(1979): Ridley Scott directed the first one which is my second favorite. It had a really slow build and what freaks people out about it is the unknown. A creature who can blend into the architecture of the ship and it was a claustrophic and paranoid type of fear, like knowing something's there but not knowing when it'll appear. It has the legendary chestburster scene and Sigourney in those cute panties.<br /><br />Aliens(1986): James Cameron directed this one and it's my favorite. Again slow build but this one is more intense. More action and combat driven, arguably a gorier chestburster scene, a character's outcome which I can't help but feel sorry for(hint: he's not like his original counterpart) and a cool ending fight. The deleted scenes flesh out Ripley's character more and her relationship with Newt.<br /><br />Alien 3(1992): David Fincher directed this one and he practically disowns it from his filmography. It's not THAT bad but it does have weak storyline and script problems but it's great visually. The \\"alien vision\\" in the tunnels is cool but it has oddly bad CG.<br /><br />Alien Resurrection(1997): Jean-Pierre Jeunet directed this one and it's pretty bad too but the underwater chase is thrilling and the end gore scene is quite brutal but the script just seems too convenient or just odd(200 years for a Ripley clone? Who just happens to have all memories intact? And is pregnant no less?) Plus quite a bit gorier than the others which is interesting cause I always thought the series worked when there wasn't a lot of gore.<br /><br />There's 9 discs in all, one for each film in it's entirety plus the extended editions and commentaries etc and the 2nd disc delving into the making of the films. The 9th disc is stuff like trailers for each film and extra stuff. I doubt they would make a 5th considering the box office intake and just general lacklusterness of the last 2 but here's hoping it takes it into a good and new direction before it gets stale. But for now, marvel at the first 2, and just try to entertain yourself with the last 2.'s entirety plus the extended editions and commentaries etc and the 2nd disc delving into the making of the films.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Forty seconds into the first track, Dark Chest of Wonders, I knew this was going to be one of those bands I'd get hooked on now and forever more. <br />Tuomas Holapainen's music and lyrics are simply beautiful, not to mention their performance by Tarja Turnunen. She has to have one of the most talented voices I've ever heard. The orchestra they incorperated in all of their songs on this album fits well. <br /> <br />\\"Dark Chest of Wonders\\" - 4/5. It took me a while to realize that it was Tarja's voice speaking the first few words at the beginning. But after that, the guitar riffage kicks your ass to the ground, and seconds later, orchestrated sounds come in. I have to admit I haven't memorized this song yet... the downside is the lyrics. I find them quite corny. <br /> <br />\\"I Wish I Had An Angel\\" - 3/5. Seemed like it was one of those songs that was just meant to be a single. <br /> <br />\\"Nemo\\" - 4/5. Yet again another single. Yet the keyboard riff flos wonderfully with the rest of the chords and melody of the song. Beautiful lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Planet Hell\\" - 4.5/5. Wonderful lyrics portraying the planet Earth, and a great drive. Still felt incomplete. <br /> <br />\\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" - 5/5. This song deserves 5 out of 5, especially for the great including of Native American Culture. The lyrics of Tuomas seem almost unreal. And then the orchestra kicks in, and it turns to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />\\"The Siren\\" - 4/5. Once again, one of the incomplete feelings. If not for Tarja's beautiful vocalization and the wonderful sounds of an electric violen, it would have gotten only but a 3. <br /> <br />\\"Dead Gardens\\" - 2/5. Felt a tad boring, even repetitive, I'm sad to say. <br /> <br />\\"Romanticide\\" - 5/5. The hard-driving guitars, emotional lyrics, and Tarja's operatic voice. As you climb towards the end, it goes into Marco's spoken word, and Tarja's breathy singing. Right after you hear Marco's growling \\"... and try to survive your stupidity...\\" Guitars knock you down again, and you hear an ear-piercing classic Metal howl. <br /> <br />\\"Ghost Love Score\\" - 6/5. AMAZING. I NEARLY DIED. In one word-- breathtaking. The chorus intergrated and mixing with Tarja's vocals, the sitar, and lyrics of longing. An orchestra could take up this song by itself and it would still be as amazing. As the song trails off, into a standing 10 minutes, the chorus repeats over and over alongside instrumental sounds. <br /> <br />\\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\\" - 4/5. A song in their native language of Finnish. A little slow and trailing. <br /> <br />\\"Higher Than Hope\\" - 5/5. A powerfully amazing way of ending the (official) album. The acoustic guitar playing is in sync, and the spoken word by some other indivdual towards the end truly reveals the meaning of the song. After hearing, \\"...your Death saved me...\\" continue listening, and prepare for a key change into the conclusion of this record. <br /> <br />Bonus tracks... <br /> <br />\\"White Night Fantasy\\" - 2/5. The theme was interesting to follow and dream about, but just as the title suggests, it is a fantasy. Tarja's vocalizing in the beginning made me kind of tilt my head a bit. <br /> <br />\\"Live to Tell the Tale\\" - 4/5. A very fitting track to go onto the \\"Nemo\\" single. An upbeat song with a great indroductory keyboard part.  <br /> <br />If you like Metal... If you like classical... either one... pick up this album. It does not deserve to be ignored.

B000069HPL|2.0|Not agreat movie at all. I don't care about the performances (all of them good. Including Jennifer Aniston. This woman is gorgeous, astonishingly beautiful). And I loved the idea. Any piece of movie, paper, text, joke, about that awful consultants, that awful corporations, is to my pleasure. The movie shows waht happens when consultants are hired to \\"aid\\" the company: all the company wants them to do is to fire employees. <br /> <br />But this movie is not funny. It's low budget, of course, but that's not the point. Livingston is not a very brilliant actor, and his performance is boring. The supporting cast gives their best, but it's not enough: they don't have enough funny material to work upon.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This film could just as easily be called: Lost in transition. It is a film about transitions and people trying to find their way in this world.

All of this set in Japan, a country making a transition into the modern world, yet holding on to some of their traditions. Even a clip about an older man making a transiton to being old.<br /><br />Scarlett Johansson continues to do outstanding work, and like Bill, you connect with them as someone you like.<br /><br />This movie is an attempt to establish communication between rich and poor, privileged and common, young and old, east and west. It deals with how much gets lost in the translation. I found the bonus material on thie DVD to be better than the film itself. The bonus clips give you more of a feel for the city of Tokyo and the people of Japan.<br /><br />Bill Murrray does comedy and this film is an attempt for him to do a bit of drama and a bit of romance. The question was: How much to hold him back from being funny. I think they held him back to much and tried to make the movie a bit to serious and thus they ended up with a three instead of a four star rating. But they were right I believe to maintain some artistic integerty and not try to go for all out comedy so as to over due it.<br /><br />Everyone did a really good job, but as the title suggests somethings get lost in translation and that is what this movie is all about. Dealing with what gets lost in translations, along with a secondary theme of dealing with lifes transitions.<br /><br />Another problem is they ignore Lazarus, you never see the homeless person, and your not introduced to his perspective. To much gets lots in translation, so that you never really get to know the people of Tokyo. But you get a lot more of a introduction in the Bonus material than you do the movie itself.<br /><br />Otherwise they get the job done and deliver on what they say they were going to deliver on. Of course these are all top rated professionals, so you would expect that they are going to persevere and accomplish what they set out to do. Even as they all deal with lifes transitions and struggle with what gets lost in translation along the way.<br /><br />This is a film that can be studied as a work that shows what can be done with a small budget and a small crew. They could have worked a bit more on the script, but they depended on Bill to improvise, which seemed to be fine with him.get the job done and deliver on what they say they were going to deliver on.

0385720920|5.0|From what I've read of these reviews, many did not enjoy this novel, at least not as much as they liked, say, Survivor. Well, you can like Choke, or you can hate it with a fiery passion, but this work cannot be dismissed. Palahniuk writes satire, and he does a very good job of it. His writing style is intoxicating and original, witty and dark. Choke is not for everyone, to be sure, but that doesn't mean it's not well written. <br /> <br />Let me start off by saying that by definition, this is \\"a guy book\\"... more so then Chuck's debut work Fight Club. I am in fact a girl, but that didn't stop me from enjoying Choke. There was really nothing I could relate to in this book, and maybe that's why I love it so much. I love it because it's from a different world... it's raw, it's sexual, it's bitter. It centers around addictions... addictions that I have never, and probably will never, be faced with. So many concepts of this work were alien to me, and because of that, I was forced to revalute my own life, and how I look at it.  <br /> <br />Chuck Palahniuk continues to amaze me, as does Choke. Love it or hate it... but it will not dissapoint.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever period. Tom Morrello is such a creative guitarist and the sound effects he makes with his guitar are simply amazing. The drumming is sweet and the bass lines are pretty nasty. And of course the singing or rapping or whatever you want to call it are simply inspiring. The lyrics that Zack De La Rocha comes up with are aweswome. <br />The line in Settle For Nothing \\"If ignorance is bliss,than wipe the smile off my face.\\" may just be my favorite lyric from any song ever. <br /> <br />Now all the people that gave this album such a bad rating. I read some of the reviews of people who think this album sucks and the ones i did read they had no reason to hate this album besides the reason that they do not agree with what Zack is trying to say with his lyrics. Not one bad review i read had anything to do with the music. So obviously if you just think this album is simply bad because of the lyrics you more than likely listen to all radio friendly pop/rock that sounds \\"cool\\" but takes no talent to play what so ever. Basically your just proving what Rage thinks.  \\"System of a Down has similar incorrect political opinions\\" yet again proving if I do not agree with it it  must be wrong. This is what most people in America think every bad review i see about this album is just because they do not agree with what Zack says. <br /> <br />And I dont understand these people with trying to categorize Rage in a genre. They are obviously not metal at all so i'm tired of people say rap/metal. Last time i checked they had talent unlike rap/rock or rap/metal bands like Linkin Park,Limp Bizkit,Taproot and so on. Rage Against the Machine in my opinion the most original sounding band ever maybe with the exception of Meshuggah. Yes there have been bands that play rock with rap vocals, but how many have talent? Very few. How  many are able to mix in funk and punk influences also? Well if anyone has i'm sure not aware of it. Almost every band in the history of music you can say oh they sound kinda like \\"insert band here\\". Rage is not one of these bands that you can say sound like another band that is which makes them so damn original. If some one would like to give me an actual reason besides I do not agree with what Zack is saying therefore I will not respect this band then you can email me DKLgoodnight@aol.com till then you can just keep believing we are the best nation in the entire world.

B000777J2S|5.0|My first review and I must say, this CD is better than everyone said it was. Antony has so much emotion in his voice, that it frequently brings a tear to my eye. Listen to this alone in a quiet room for optimal effect.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|When you write a review for Amazon it says \\"If you believe that the product you are reviewing is unsafe or has a defect that could cause injury or death, please report this information immediately to the Consumer Products Safety Commission.\\" Well, I better report this album because listening to it will inspire you to injure someone. Yes, this album rocks. In fact it rocks so hard, it's hard to really convey it without the use of profanity. This is what rock needs more of. More Fugazi inspired riffery, less hipster dance tracks.  <br />Ah, but sadly, the band is no more. Now they are Sparta - another face in the emo (stupidest categorization ever) crowd, and Mars Volta, possibly the most pretentious and obnoxious band of all time. So, so sad.
B000002AHC|5.0|What an astonishingly perfect album.    I first discovered \\"The Notorious Byrd Brothers\\" back in 1991. I was in my early 20's, and had no idea what I was buying back then. I knew I loved \\"Fifth Dimension\\" and \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\". I probably just bought it to fill out my Byrds collection while hoping that it had a good tune or two, like \\"The Ballad of Easy Rider\\" or \\"Dr. Byrds and Mr. Hyde\\" has. I got much more than I bargained for, because it is one of the greatest efforts I've heard in all of rock-n-roll. It has become more and more special and significant with time. This would be one of my \\"Desert Island Discs\\", even if I was only allowed 10 albums, this would make that list, simply because it sounds so timeless and it never gets old.     From a marketing standpoint, it is not that well positioned in the pantheon of Byrds albums and singles. There is no hit single, and the album's cover doesn't really hint at the treasures that lie within. Combined with the album's title, someone who doesn't know any better might think it would sound more like \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\", or not know what to think at all. This book cannot be judged by its cover, my friends. The only faults with this album may only be the packaging. However, as a fan, I would not change a thing. I only wish David Crosby had been allowed to finish this record before he was fired by Chris and Roger. Dave makes great contributions to this record, and the last track on the new expanded CD has a shocking glimpse into their studio world, exposing much unrest and friction in the group. Michael Clarke sounds like a royal pain-in-the-butt, and only in the Byrds for the money, and he refuses to play properly like a spoiled brat. Poor Gary Usher, the producer, probably had a hard time babysitting this guy and keeping everyone from killing each other.     Out of all the confusion and animosity, the end result is just pure magic. Was it accidental?  Or was it very deliberate? It was everything the Beach Boys' \\"Smile\\" was supposed to be. It was America's best response to \\"Sgt. Peppers\\", and it more than met the challenge, albeit after several years.  (At the time of its original release, the record was a commercial failure and was overlooked and underappreciated.)   I wish teenagers and young adults who love rock-n-roll would listen to this record. There is nothing \\"oldie but goody\\" about it. I feel it has stood the test of time even better than \\"Sgt Pepper\\".    It also may be an accidental concept album. The sessions for this record obviously started on the heels of the psychedelia craze, but was completed and packaged right as the Byrds were leaning towards country music. It also makes for a nice history lesson by being a fine example of how fast things were moving and changing back in '67-'68. To imagine that the Byrds would be playing the Grand Ole Opry a few months later is astonishing! This record really captures the Byrds doing a 180, and reinventing themselves. You hear these changes unfold right in front of you.     This album is so technically beautiful and full of wonderful harmonies, instrumentation, orchestrations, sound effects, and that wonderful chang-a-langing 12-string Rickenbacker. I think of this album as one long song, because each track blends in with the next so smoothly, and dreamlike. It feels like a very intelligent psychedelic journey with occasional hints of country and bluegrass music. It's hard for me to listen to one or two tracks alone, I normally just play the whole thing. The only track I sometimes skip is the first one, \\"Artificial Energy\\". It's a good tune, but if any track fits in the least, it's that one. The transition from \\"Natural Harmony\\" into \\"Draft Morning\\" is wonderful, and the latter is a beautiful tune with many things happening, like a mandolin, thumping bass, classic Byrds harmonies, a smooth political message, and great sound effects of guns in war.    This album also features two amazing Goffin/King tunes done to perfection. The version of \\"Goin' Back\\" is lyrically powerful and \\"Born To Follow\\" has wonderful phasing effects. \\"Change is Now\\" is another song with wonderful harmonies and a hypnotic bass line and beat. It's psychedelic, but not in an \\"Iron Butterfly\\" way. There is nothing hokey or dated about this album. It all sounds so fresh and modern to this day, and the last two tracks really close it out on a peaceful note. The whole record is like a journey. It will take you to different places. It clearly is the Byrds at their Best. The Byrds gave it their best effort and were successful. Their early potential is fully realized with this effort.  They did it.    I would encourage everyone who loves rock music to buy this CD. Hey, send me an e-mail and we can talk about it! I love talking about this record and recommending it to friends. This is not only the best of the Byrds, but also the best of the Sixties.
B0000029DD|5.0|When I first heard this album, I burned a copy for friend with a note that said \\"If you don't like this CD, we're not friends anymore.\\"
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I feel that this Album, Arcade Fire's debut proper, is overated. the hype surrounding these Montrealers, actually a Haitian and American transplant( husband and wife Win Butler and Racine Chassagne), is HUGE! I'm sure Montrealers are dancing in the streets because they got us Americans, and probably everybody else, to praise thses 4 \\"putton\\" eating guys...and gals! Sure it's the best \\"indie rock\\" album to come along in a good long while, but the hype is just a tad too MUCH! It's not a 5 star album and they are not a 10 on the original scale, bottom line. But that aside thse guys are the future of rock and roll, or indie rock, or whatever you wanna call it today, and thats just PLAIN n SIMPLE! They play sad melodies and then rev it up to get all the hipsters pogo-ing and swaeting. The fact that they sold out MONTHS in advance their NY shows is testament to the fact that they are MAGIC live. And perhaps, like The Grateful Dead, their magic lies in their live shows! The Dead comparison is only in the live shows as there is NO connection between Jerry G and Win Butler...although i can see them doing BONNAROO a year or 2 from now!! The great thing about Arcade Fire, and about this album is, is GROWS on you, and I've only listened to it a few times granted, but I know they can surpass this. Actually, their rare self titled EP is much better than this, it is a shame that they went BACKWARDS at leats on vinyl. As far as publicity and praise and live gigs go..the sky is the limit for these puttons eaters!! Hahaha why mention putton? That mushy Quebecois food which I've never eaven eaten?  Well, I'm sure it is a staple in the Arcade Fire diet, I mean SHEESH they sell it in Mikey D's up in jolly ol' Quebec fer Chrissakes! Gastronomy aside these relative newcomers to the music game are FIRMLY planting their feet and letting us \\"Americains\\" know that Canada, and Seperatist Quebec specifically...is about to put it DOWN!! This is highly recommended if you like \\"indie rock\\" especially bands like Modest Mouse, Roxy Music( well not in the leats bit indie rock, they pre date it by what 20 yrs? but they are the grandaddies of it) Franz Ferdinad etc etc. The EP is where it's at in my opinion but this is a VERY ADMIRABLE debut and again...see em live if you can even get tix!! They go for $150 on ebay and I'm sure they put on a SHOW and a HALF!!
B00008EY9G|1.0|Simply Horrible. <br />If you need an explnation see the movie. <br />If you don't agree, you deserve this tripe of a film.
0765310015|1.0|While i did enjoy some aspects of this book, i must say that in the end it is just not worth it.<br /><br />The book jumps from scene to scene, character to character, and twirls you around in circles. And what do we get in the end? A battle that would make Godzilla proud.<br /><br />Gods speak to mortals, people come back from the dead left and right, and every single character in this book can single handedly destroy all of Middle-Earth with their magic.<br /><br />If you enjoy super powered characters running all over the place like a video game or movie then this might book might appeal to you. But theres plenty of other quality fantasy out there.

0553260111|4.0|Yes it is a long tale, which Ludlum book is not?  Fast paced in the telling of the action scenes; but, the standard Ludlum fare throughout.  If you can get through 500 plus pages (some of my attorney friends can not) you will like this read and marvel at the differences to the film which is also quite good. Take this book on vacation and enjoy the ride!
B00005JMYI|3.0|But watch it just to hear the non stop stream of idiocy will ferrell spews throughout. truly inspiring. <br />...p.s. <br /> <br />   Elf, not funny.
0930289234|4.0|Of course this is a very good book, almost everyone in the comic genre raves about Watchmen, depressing and dark but hey if you are into dark emotions this will do the trick.  Artwork is good but not great, dialog is OK.  Points are made with the intricate story lines and the feelings this book emotes within the reader.  Spend the $18 and buy a copy to for your collection  Not James Joyce but its only suppossed to be a graphic novel.<br /><br />One of the best of its kind, not as good as Swamp Thing.

0670033375|5.0|Diamond is a brilliant expositor of everything from anthropology to zoology, providing a lucid background of scientific lore to support a stimulating, incisive historical account of these many declines and falls. His book debunks an enthralling, and disturbing, reminder of the indissoluble links that bind humans to nature. Diamond is well-informed. His book is a pleasure to read, even though to some, its style may seem a bit dry. If you are not into these kinds of books, this one is certainly worth a try. This is my first review here on Amazon, and hopefuly this will compell others readers to give this book a try. I never heard of this author until I read about him in Canyon News a few weeks ago as the Star Gazing book pick of the week. I will also read his other book.
B0006399FS|1.0|And could U2 save the day, no, they put out an awful album lack of any passion or selective taste. <br />The biggest dissapointment in the history of U2, they might not have one after this. <br /> <br />I can't see how anyone would go to a concert to see these songs played live. <br /> <br />
B00005U2JL|1.0|How can I begin to say how bad this is. What is shown is not a concert at all. What is shown is live audio edited in with thousands of different video shots from different cities. I can understand having one song shown from say New York and the next from Japan. But not one song shown from 10 different cities.  I actually emailed the company and told them how bad their product was. Look on ebay for bootleg editions that would be a way better product. Damn I feel like I was jipped. DO NOT BUY THIS, DO NOT BUY THIS, DO NOT BUY THIS DO NOT BUY THIS.
B000068QY7|5.0|After two albums that dissapointed everyone, Oasis came back with a new 21st century sound. <br /> <br />The most important band in the world, everyone else can piss off!!!!
B0002JJBZE|3.0|Oh, dear, it's all a bit dated, isn't it? I watched two episodes back to back with the same plot. \\"Oh, my God, the universe has disappeared! (again.)\\" I chose them because I like those space trumpets that sound up whenever the giant menace approacheth. I assume they're space trumpets, they sound like nothing on earth. In the former episode, it's a long blue turdy thing with a design flaw so obvious that you wounder why they even bothered  building it. I think they call it planned obsolescence. Every doomsday weapon has one. The lads are also threatened by some over-acting from a commodor that has to be seen to be believed. The average commodor in Star Trek is always pompous and inept, so as to make Kirk look good. Anyway, Kirk and a couple of crewmen are stuck onboard the USS Intrepid, Valliant or Sooperdooper or whatever, when they get a call from the Enterprise that the transporter is now working again. \\"Right\\" says Kirk. \\"Beam back Scotty and I'll follow by the seat of my pants in the dying seconds before this starship blows up.\\" Haven't you forgotten something, old chap? Like that other crewman whose name escapes me and you too, it appears. \\"Captain? Scotty? Where the **** is everyone? Oh my God, AAAAAAGH!\\"    In the latter episode the space boyos are menaced by a giant amee...omeab..(in space, nobody can see you spell.) Anyway, it's a giant blob that sucks the life out of you. Captain Kirk already looks the worse for wear in this second series. His hair is greyer, he's lathargic and looks pained. I guess that guy who used all those fancy filters on series one had left. Is he suffering from piles? The notorious lack of a toilet on the bridge can't help while you're being detained by yet another universe cruncher.    Is this the set that has Scotty getting plastered with an alien? Very funny scene that. Apart from that, it's hard to imagine who this box set is aimed at. Old people who remember it from childhood will find themselves too old for it and younger audiences will find it too cheesy. Don't get me wrong, it was good in it's day, but this is one to hopefully get in your Christmas sock, rather than open your wallet for.
1881273156|5.0|I read this book while single and with no one in mind.  It is meant for couples so that they can better understand one another, but the ways of looking at relationships and how to express love in a way such that the other person will know is applicable to all relationships like friends etc. <br /> <br />The five love languages are;  physical touch, gifts, words, acts of service, and quality time.  The theory behind the book is that each person will have one or two primary love languages.  When they want to express love to someone then they will do it in the way that most resonates with them.  Likewise they will feel loved when someone else is \\"speaking\\" their love language. <br /> <br />The Five Love Languages was easy to read but at the same time had very good information.  It is written by a marriage counsellor speaking from a christian perspective.  He brings in examples of couples he has seen who loved one another but felt mutually unloved, because they were expressing that love in their primary love language and not their spouses.  His way of working with them involves teaching each person to express love in their spouse's love language and to recognize when their spouse is expressing affection in a way that they may not notice. <br /> <br />Chapman spends one chapter on each love language and explains what he means by it.  This is good information that one wouldn't neccessarily guess from the term he uses.  For example if someone's love language is gifts then it is just recieving the gift that resonates with them and not the monetary value of the gift.  So leaving notes or bringing home something small a few times a week would be more warm and fuzzy than buying one expensive gift and then doing nothing for a month.  Understanding these love languages has helped me to see what others mean when they act and to better love those around me. <br /> <br />This is a really neat way of looking at love and it's expression.  It is from a christian perspective and is forcouples, but others would benefit too.  If you are curious about this way of looking at love then this book is worth investigating.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Come now, how can we have Agamemnon killed during the Trojan War? Anyone who knows their ancient legends knows that he was killed later by his wife Clytemnestra for bringing Cassandra back with him, not to mention sacrificing their daughter for favorable winds.<br /><br />That aside, the editing on this movie is so bad, I'm surprised anyone was willing to release it. There are more than a few cuts that make little or no sense and serve no apparent purpose. Editing is one of those things that you only notice if it's bad, and I noticed it BIG time in Troy.<br /><br />Soundtrack: The producers be damned for this one. The original score was beautiful; haunting yet epic, very ancient. Took the original composer something like a year to write. Petersen made the mistake of showing the rough cut of the movie to the production/studio execs, which is never done. Now we know why. For some ungodly reason, the producers didn't like it, so the composer didn't get paid. Instead, James Horner came in and scored the movie in less than a month. And it showed.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about this one, get back on the other side, it's not worth your money.
B000094FGO|5.0|Ok, so lots of people have a problem with Evanescence because they're not 'real' metal ... OK, they aren't metal ... so what?! A band does not have to be metal to be good! They could be classified as goth-rock ... but who cares? This band has introduced many people to better (I think) bands like Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil and, of course Nightwish. Isn't that a good thing?<br /><br />About the album itself; yes, it does get slightly repetative, and, while I don't like 'Taking over me' and 'Imaginary' at all; 'Going Under' and 'Haunted' are AMAZING! My all time favourite song has to be 'Tourniquet' (the reason the lyrics are 'strange' are because they're about suicide, and whether or not that's a sin) although 'Whisper' is also good.<br /><br />So, Evanescence, maybe more mainstream than most, (personally I think that's a good thing - who really wants more Britney clones on the radio?! Or Avril Lavine? *shudder*) but still a great band who have gone unrecognised for too long. And what's with all these people saying they're scary? SCARY? Get real.<br /><br />And check out Nightwish and Within Temptation!
0345452577|1.0|I usually enjoy the author's works, even the non-Alex Delaware ones, but not this one.  I agree with the other reviewers that the characters were flat, some of the plot lines were never tied together well, and that the setting hints that this was a discarded attempt from the past that Kellerman rescued from the trash can...<br /><br />But my main beef with this novel is the language!  In some of his Alex Delaware novels, Kellerman turns off my interest with his grandeose architectual descriptions (I often think if he hadn't been a psychologist he would have been an architect), but this book is STUFFED with pompous, over-the-top language.  I chuckled out loud at the reviewer who said he/she had multiple English degrees but still had to constantly run to the dictionary to look up Kellerman's obscure word choices.  Kellerman's descriptions and dialogue during the secret dinner with Jeremy and the old eccentrics was just plain laughable.<br /><br />One reviewer said it best when they said that they language was \\"forced, bombasic, and esoteric\\".  Trust me - this book is painful drudgery to read for such a small payoff.
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|I am a mythology fan, and I was really looking forward to this movie.  I became immediately alarmed at the slow beginning, and while I was entertained for the majority of the movie, something wasn't quite right and I didn't know what it was until the end.  WHERE was the MEAT of the STORY?  Sure, it was \\"explained\\" nicely, but I felt incredibly ripped off from the minimal portrayal of Helen of Troy and the CRITICAL role she played.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there are no gods in this film... they are mentioned and briefly shown in statues, but there are no live characters-- dissapointing. <br /> <br />That aside, there was some *excellent* battle scenes that I've been hungry for in a non-LOTR setting for a change.  Also, there was some really good acting from the supporting roles which really carried this film through.   <br /> <br />I normally would avoid comparing this to similiar films of this vein, however, the background music is so similar to that of Gladiator (which can take the Pepsi Challenge with this movie any ol' day of the week) I found myself reflecting back on Gladiator and feeling that Troy was a lesser film.  Much to my delight, some of the actors from Braveheart play important lead roles in Troy, so again, I felt myself yearning for strength in story that Braveheart had. <br /> <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I'm not an expert, and I don't know every CD of 2004 to tell you which one is the best of 2004.  And as a german my english is not the best, sorry.  <br />I don't even know, what Pitchfork is. And I don't like all these comparisons. A little bit Bjrk? Yes,I can hear it. Pixies? For sure! Roxy Music? Talking heads? Obvious!  As a great Bowiefan I got curious, because Bowie recommended this Band. But as I am not a sheep (hehe) I did not run and buy it immediately, but listened to the three free downloadable songs on the Merge-records-page.  <br />My first impression was not very good and I thought, nice band, but I prefer Muse (my other favourites at the moment)... it sounds not very special, seems I have heard everything already somewhere else (...Talking Heads, Pixies, Bjrk, Roxy..)...  but I burned the three Songs together with other stuff from my harddrive on a mix-CD  and so I listened to them again and again -  till the moment  I ONLY  listened to these three songs of my mix-CD and then clicked the repeat-button...  <br />Let me tell you - it needs time! Everybody here who says he can judge it after  two days or after listening to the amazon-snippets - forget it!   <br />You need the time to get into this deep and melodic music. And it is a matter of taste.  I can understand everybody who doesn't like the singer's voice or does not like such emotional music or violins and accordions in rockmusic. And sometimes it really sounds a little bit odd, reminding of old movies or chansons. But maybe it is especially that combination of old and new, slow and fast, wellknown melodies and strange instrumentation,  which makes it so interesting for me. <br />I listen to the whole CD now for one month, and I am still not yet tired of it! I never listened as much to Bjrk or Talking Heads or the Pixies ...ok, maybe to Roxy Music, my old favourites. Seems it is this special kind of synthesis, that gets me hooked to this album (thanx, Bowie), and I just hope the next one won'tbe disappointing.  <br />I also got two amazing bootlegs of live-gigs and so I am looking forward to their concert in Berlin next month ;-)
B000003TB6|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite Rap album of all time.  It's not the best album I have nor is it the best I've ever heard.  But, I can claim that since I bought it in 1994 it's the cd I listen to the most.  Even on a yearly basis, looking back at what I've listened to the most this album comes out on top.  That should say something to you about the quality of \\"Do You Want More\\" <br /> <br />Do You Want More, more than any of The Roots other albums, makes it obvious that they are playing their instruments ALL the way through.  They strayed away from this later in there careers, not necessarily a bad thing, but this album is the only one were they could legitimately play every song, front to back, all elements on stage.  Every drum beat, bass strum, sax riff, has that distinct authentic sound.  While \\"Things Fall Apart\\" musically constructed is their best, this album is defiantly more on the Jazzy tip. <br />Black Thought has only gotten better as time has gone by, but true Roots purists desperately miss Malik and Dice Raw's insane cameo's.  The last time the group was intact like that was \\"Things Fall Apart\\".  Sure having Talib and others on the newer albums is great... but no one complements Black Thought like Malik consistently and know one can put on as many show stoppers as Dice.  ?Luv even gets on the mic in this album.  The lyrical complexity is not as dense, but that brash improve is defiantly here.  I dare you to find a wack rhyme. <br />Do You Want More has everything.  A lot of laid back jams, live, improv, intense tracks with lyrics to match, experimental, funny stories, poetry, somber retrospectives... and it somehow all flows together perfectly.  And as usual all the intricacies of the album are told through the hilarious and informative liner notes, defiantly worth your time to read.  Here's how the album breaks down. <br /> <br />From the start \\"You are all about to witness some organic hip-hop jazz\\".  Is there a better self description of this album??. <br />There's Something Going On: the \\"theme\\" of the album... it's repeated musically all the way up until the conclusion of the album.  Ties in everything even more. <br />Proceed: the single for the album, nice laid back, sets the pace for the album. <br />Distortion to Static: Multiple track layers on this one (all the way to a laugh track).  Nice simple drum beat and background just allows Black and Malik to show off: <br />\\"Very relevant, plus intelligently managin' matter/ that's makin' tracks fatter, revolve around Satur-in like rings and brings swings, when I sings with bass/ Then distort up in your face like mace/ Bustin your dreams like gats with loaded magazines/ I'm on the rap scene, repellin fellas like a vaccine.\\" <br />\\"Mellow My Man\\": Smooth jazzy beat... even breaks down at times into a complete Jazz ensemble.  More of the same lyricism from BT and Malik with some back & forth play. <br />\\"I Remain Calm\\": Gets intense musically and lyrically (chorus consists of a woman in the background saying \\"WHAT the HELL is THIS!\\"). <br />\\"Datskat\\": Is basically Black Thought imitating a sort of Jazz/Skat style of singing and applying it to rap.  Along with the beat it works really well. <br />\\"Lazy Afternoon\\":  It's almost toooo laid back of a song.  Black Thought even plays the part of lazy rapping the same verse three times in slightly different ways. <br />\\"? Vs. Scratch\\" Drums vs. the beat-box for about 3 minuets. <br />\\"Do You Want More\\": Bagpipes?? Are you kidding me?  This has an insane beat... my only complaint is that Black Thought should have come back on for another verse, or rapped longer... or something, how often do you get to rip the mic over the Bagpipes? Seriously. <br />\\"What Goes On, Pt. 7\\"  Thought the Neptunes used the tongue-click thing first?  Great track with some great rhymes.  ELO the Cosmic Eye drops a nice distorted voice verse. <br />\\"Essaywhuman?!!!??!\\" is a great freestyle improv live track.  Black Thought and his band imitate each other through instruments and the audience responds as well.  This song has been flipped a couple of different times on their albums and this is the best version. <br />\\"Swept Away\\": excellent track musically and the way Malik & Black Thought flow along with the music is awesome. <br />\\"You Ain't Fly\\" is a funny take on the group's bad luck with women.  (?uest Luv on the mic!) <br />\\"Silent Treatment\\": a slow reflective track.  Musically once again the Roots really put together an intricate song about lost love (light-years better & not corny like today's typical Thug Luvin' song).  To be followed later by tracks of similar breed (\\"You Got Me\\", \\"Break You Off\\") this is defiantly superior and defiantly more genuine.  Black Thoughts lyrics get pretty complex and deep at times.  It's a treat to see this performed live as well (that is if BT hasn't lost his voice by that time in the tour). <br />The Lesson, Pt. I: The Roots break it down to the essence for the last music track. Rahzel doing some incredible beat box, one-take!  Black Thought starts off just ripping the track and if he would of kept going it would have been an excellent track.  But, Dice Raw makes is debut with a one-take 2:10 min hip-hop quotable.  Apparently he was a mere 15 at the time, one of my all time favorite Roots tracks (as well as one of ?Love's). <br />The Unlocking closes the album with Poetry read by Ursula Rucker and scored by the band.  It's a pretty graphic tale, but once you can get past that you realize the story is pretty deep and thought provoking, not just a simple X rated tale. <br /> <br />I can see this album being too smooth and laid back for some people.  That's the overall tone of the album with a couple of exceptions.  But, I can't imagine no one needing some down time music that's still of superior quality.  This is overlooked and probably will continue to be so for another 10 years.  Fact is it's my favorite album ever, and I've never had anyone tell me that they didn't enjoy it either... I guarantee it'll end up being a favorite in your collection.  I'd recommend `Do You Want More' to anyone and everyone I know, good music is simply good music no matter what genre it is.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I first listened to this album back in high school as I crammed for final exams. Having been a Pink Floyd fan even back then, I found Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking a departure from much of the work that came before but still a thought-provoking hallucinagenic tale accented by Eric Clapton's excellent guitar work. \\"Running Shoes\\", \\"Sexual Revolution\\", and \\"Every Stranger's Eyes\\" were highlights for me but I only understood the emotional content album on a superficial level <br /> <br />Its now 20 years later. I've been through college, graduate school, a postdoc, a failed marriage, and assorted highs and lows that come with the human condition. But when I recently found my old tape of Pros and Cons and played it, I no longer heard it with the ears of a 17 year old kid worried about grades, getting into college, and getting into the my then girlfriend's pants. I heard it with the ears of a cynical 37 years old bloke with alimony to pay, a ghastly mortgage, and a stomach ulcer. Now I understand the emotional content of Pros and Cons and it has gotten regular play on my iPod since then. <br /> <br />BTW, in \\"The Wall\\" film, Bob Geldof's character \\"Pink\\" recites the lyrics to \\"Moment of Clarity\\" as he wallows in drug-induced psychosis within a bathroom stall. Moment of Clarity, indeed.
B0000DD7LC|3.0|There is no doubt that Alicia Keys is a masterful piano player and dynamic vocalist capable of superb range.  Having said that, while I enjoyed both of her albums, I truly believe they each sound like 60 minute songs.  Basically, all of her songs sound alike.  Every song she touches, including the ones she writes and produces for others, sounds the same.  Besides that, I don't think she's as lyrically \\"deep\\" as some others might believe. <br /> <br />To sum it up, if you've got her first album, you've got her second album.  (The best songs off of each of them are the ones played every day on every city's \\"Alicia Keys & Usher Hour After Hour\\").  Buy it if you think she seems like a nice person and you want to help boost her record sales.
6305784078|5.0|I don't know what all the people above are complaining about.  Aristocats is one of the great, fun, non-mainstream Disney movies that I loved as a child & still enjoy.  Much better than the formulaic, unimaginative movies of the early 90s.
006092988X|2.0|I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic.  As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it.  I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed.  It was a miserable story and pointless.  It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them.  This novel needs more character development to be a classic.  I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|This album was somewhat of a disapointment. The fact that it only has 10 songs makes it hard to bear. But Badu always deliver no matter what. Songs like The Grind, Back In the Day, Danger, Think Twice, and the hypnotic interludes of \\"World Keeps Turnin'\\", won't stray you away from the true genius of Erykah Badu.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is probably the best hip hop ever recorded, ever!

B00005JH7D|3.0|Marcus Miller is probably the first musician I fell in love with. I first got turned onto him through his work with David Sandborn...in particular his \\"Straight to the Heart\\" album from 84. When a live studio video of that performance was released I ran out and got it. It has some of the best Marcus bass playing I've ever heard...plus I got to SEE him do it. I started running out and buy everything I could find him playing on: <br />Luther Vandros, Grover, Grusin, Sample, Benson, Miles, Tom Scott...and I was rarely disappointed.  <br /> <br />Unfortunetely Marcus appears to be one of many outstanding musicians who's best work will always be on other peoples albums (think Larry Carlton). There are some very nice moments here...particulary on Cousin John and Lonnie's Lament but his over use of synth, drum loops and his strange obsession with the bass clarinet drags his albums down. His song writing is outstanding, but would be better realized with a tighter, more focused band(Omar Hakim? Joe Sample?). I'm not sure if Poogie Bell once saved him from a burning building before...that's the only reason I can see him not going out and getting a more accomplished drummer. He's not in Marcus' league. Dean Brown does appear worthy however. <br /> <br />Alas I'm sure I will still continue to buy Marcus CD's on the day that they are released hoping that he will put together that classic that I know he has inside him. Where is your \\"School Days\\" Marcus?
B0002B15WE|5.0|This movie is great! it is nearly all action and shooting and stuff. If you don't know it is about a NY Cop who goes to a building for a party with his wife(In LA) or something and when he is in his room, terrorists take over the buildings and he is the only one they haven't got in hostage, so the movie is him killing them and trying to save the hostages, anyway this is one of my favorite movies, so watch it.
B000002MX7|3.0|Chaka Khan is one of my most favorite female contempary singers of all time...she may in fact BE my favorite (sorry Joni and Aretha). So how can it be that a collection of her so-called best has me reaching for the \\"next track\\" button more than the volume button?  <br /> <br />I discovered that the reason for this is that most of Chaka's best efforts have come on Rufus albums, side projects with jazz ensembles, and as guests on other peoples CD's. (Check out \\"Who Do you Love\\" from Lenny Whites \\"Present Tense\\")  <br /> <br />Most of the songs here are the ones that the casual Chaka fan will recognize...I Feel for you, I'm Every Woman, What Cha' gonna do for me, etc...and those are all fine soul/pop ditties but where Chaka shines best is where grunting out funk numbers on Rufus jams and ballads like Don't Talk to strangers, or her projects with the likes of Chick Corea. <br /> <br />This is not a bad CD...in fact I'd say it's pretty good. But I guess I was expecting something a little more diverse from someone with the range, skill, and following of Chaka. The duet with Me-Shell N'deocello is a high point as well as \\"Ain't Nobody\\" and \\"Tell me something good\\", which are both off of Rufus albums by the way.
B0000039PW|5.0|From da moment i played this I knew it would be tight, the intro is kinda like different stages of BIG's life of something, \\"Things Done Changed\\" is about changes in life and is tight, the next track is \\"Gimme the Loot\\" about a robbery and is great, then is \\"Machine Gun Fun\\" oneof my favourites on the album. \\"Warning\\" is a tight song about people coming to kill Biggie. \\"Ready to Die\\" is bangin' and \\"One more Chance\\" is aight. Then after the f___ me interlude is \\"The What\\" which is dope. Next is my favorite song \\"Juicy\\" about Biggie rise from bottom to the top.\\"Everyday Struggle\\" is tight like \\"Me and my B*tch\\" and \\"Big Poppa\\" which was a hit and is tight. \\"respect\\" is tight. \\"Friend of Mine\\" is too, \\"Unbelievable\\" is aight. \\"Suicidal Thoughts\\" is a song about death and is a good way to end a classic album.<br /><br />Buy this if you are into hip hop or anything cause it is tight.<br /><br />RIP Biggie
B00004W55E|5.0|I saw Rachelle perform at the Newport jazz festival around 93/94 when she was promoting her first CD. I was impressed with her voice and her singing, but outside of a few forgettable originals she was just rehashing standards I've heard a thousand times before. From that point on I never really thought about buying any of her music...but I respected her as a singer and performer because of her talent.  <br /> <br />A couple years ago a friend of mine (who is more into vocalists than I am) recommended this CD to me and I told him my opinion of Rachelle. He then told that \\"If that's the way you feel then you should DEFINITELY run out and by this CD\\". He was telling me that this CD was a statement of independence from her previous record contract that was forcing to just use her voice to rehash old standards and go for that gimmicky appeal of her multi-octive range (think Stanley Jordan on guitar). This CD, on the other hand, was all about the music SHE wanted to make...hence the title \\"Individuality(Can I be me)?\\" <br /> <br />I decided to give her another shot and boy was I glad I did. <br />The kind of music she wanted to make is exactly the kind of music I like to listen to! The vocalese, the instrumentation, <br />the songwriting, and the arrangements are all stellar. Add in the outstanding recording quality and it's also a great CD to test out your audiphile equipment.  <br /> <br />Can you Remember and Mess it All up are my personal favs...but there is plenty to love here. Hopefully her future projects will focus on the type of music SHE wants to perform and not have to appease clueless self centered record executives. <br /> <br />Can you imagine how much music we would have been denied if Stevie Wonder hadn't taken the same stand against Motown in the early 70's? Ditto Ray Charles, Thelonious Monk, et al. <br /> <br />If you like this type of music I can also recommend Peace Beyond Passion by Me'shell N'deocello. Also an outstanding recording. Her politics maybe abrasive to some...but who cares?! It's all about the music! Dionne Farris' solo album <br />also come to mind.
B0002Z0EYU|2.0|This is a very minor movie, but it benefits from its Parisian setting and will resonate with anyone who has met up after a long time with someone who was important to them and finds the conversation flowing as if their relationship had continued during that time.  The makers wisely confine the movie to 80 minutes, any more would have been overblown.  There simply isn't enough here to last any longer.  I find it hard to understand the 5 star awards that some amazonies have bestowed on this movie.  I can only conclude that they identify so strongly with one of the main characters or with their situation that they simply fail to see the movie's limitations.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|By far one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I can take most comedy but I have to have a plot.  This movie had none.  It made for a boring and unpalatable movie.  I thought Pauly Shore was bad but this made me want to gut myself or someone close to me.  Stay away!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|Take a look at the 4 stars this album still gets despite all of your feeble attempts to berate it. You are probally some kind of washed up 80s metalhead, numetal puke, and/or another clueless douchebag trying to make the ultimate cool pose by rebelling against the most well known rebellious rock statement made in the 90s. Oh, and please have your facts and language together before you post a 1 star critique... No one gives a s%$* about what an idiot like you thinks anyways. Nevermind is overplayed and overhyped, but the songs still burn white hot. It may not be your cup of tea but this s*&% sounds like molten soul fire to my ears.
B00005JN0T|3.0|I'm sorry. I don't believe that the Directorial Staff and writers of I, Robot really wrestled much with the purity of Asimov, Bradbury and Heinlein. When you watch the credits of a movie based on a book like, for example, Lehane's Mystic River, you'll see a reference, ' . . . from the book,' or '. . . based in part on . . . ' And then there's '<br /><br />. . . from an idea . . .'<br /><br />This is even more of a reach then that. Will Smith is actually a remarkable actor growing from a humble, 30-minute humorous quips (Fresh Prince) TV background. Now you can even say, 'he's the man.' And additionally, going back to the Ali days, he spends a lot of time in the gym. Because he is most assuredly,  buffed.<br /><br />But that's it. Not a serious examination of AI, interesting dialogue (and that's all) between Moynahan and Smith, and a Lassie like slobbering grin from the Robot Character \\"Sonny\\" that we are left to assume (yes, theologians) has a soul.<br /><br />Great special effects. Boring, predictable dialogue. The usual tedious quips the writers force Mr. Smith to make instead of just letting him act. NOTHING ELSE. 3 stars. Larry Scantlebury

B00000099Y|5.0|Even though my interest in Tool is somewhat moderate, I am still proud to have Aenima and Lateralus in my collection. What I find most endearing about Aenima is its ability to be straight forward in its lyrics yet highly evolved and intelligent in its music. While there is hidden subtext in the filler tracks, like \\"Die Eier Von Satan\\", Maynard does not pussy foot around with those listening to his words. In \\"Hooker with a Penis\\", he's venting against the nay-sayers who criticize so-called \\"sellouts\\" yet continually buy records. In the title track, he explains how he wants this sordid world we live in to be flushed down a toilet, and goes on a delicious tirade of apocalyptic proportions. The only downside to this album I'd say is the final track, \\"Third Eye\\", because with its over 15 minute length, grows immensely tedious with each listen. This is a must have album for anyone who wants to see an underestimated point of view on society through unique music.
B000089RVX|5.0|evanescence is one of the best bands ever,especially for it's genre of music.I got this cd over a year ago and i still love listening to it!in fact i am listening to it as i write this review!!The singing,writing,and instrument playing on this cd is absolutly amazing!this is the kind of cd u'd expect from a famous band known for good music writing their next album,and this is only a debut!!i am so excited for their new cd,which i know won't be copming soon because of the bands approach to making a cd,they do not want to rush to get out a cd soon enough to satisfy their fans,they will take their time and make a memorable album,i agree with this approach!here is a review of each song!<BR>Going Under-great song and start to Fallen.-9-<BR>Bring Me To Life-great song,but i kinda got tired of it after my sister and cousins continuesly sang and played the music video off the daredevil dvd.-8-<BR>Everybodys Fool-great song,great music video!-8.5-<BR>My Immortal-One of my favourite songs ever!I love playing this one on the piano!-10-<BR>Haunted-this song scared me when i first heard it,i am kinda used to the intro to it now!-9-<BR>Tourniquet-sounds like a train at the beginnin!lol!great song!-7.5-<BR>Imaginary-this song is wicked!i love it!-9.5-<BR>Taking over me-love this one!-8-<BR>Hello-my fave song on the album and of all time!!:D:D:D-10-<BR>my last breath-another one of my faves!-9.5-<BR>Whisper-a great end to the album!i love it!-8.5-<BR>so check out this album and don't judge it by the cover or genre of goth,because only 2 songs on the album are&quot;gothish&quot;and the cover can scare people away!lol!no just kiddin,kids in my class judged it by the album,then heard the songs on the radio and then loved it!
B00005JN2Z|1.0|Unfortunately I saw this movie in theaters and paid the full ten dollars. This movie I do not even consider rent worthy material, it was terrible.

0385510454|4.0|A considerable number of people where asking themselves the question show in the title of this review six years ago, with the subject in question being Joel Backman, the Broker. Nowadays he is in jail serving twenty years for treason, but his luck is about to change. The outgoing president, Arthur Morgan, is in the final hours of his mandate after suffering a catastrophic defeat in the recent elections. Now he is deciding which pardons to grant and is receiving pressure from the CIA to liberate the Broker. In the narration of these early events we get a first glimpse of what Grisham is capable of achieving, since he catches the reader's attention through the use of a couple witty jokes and the portrayal of the corruption associated with the process of granting pardons. In this case, the CIA is interested in releasing the Broker to see who kills him after they relocate him and provide the possible assassins with the information on his hideout.<br /><br />Upon his release, the Broker is transferred to Bologna, and Grisham spends a considerable amount of time describing the Italians, the life in this beautiful country, the luscious food, impressive scenery and seductive language. I perceived this as a break from the author's usual pattern of fast-paced action, when the level of suspense is high at all times. In this case, he focuses more on providing the reader with a comprehensive vision of the main character, allowing us to understand what drives the Broker's actions and how his previous experiences have changed the man. The interesting descriptions found in this part of the novel add a very particular flair to the story and help create a level of eagerness on the reader, who will be looking forward to the point in which the action will rush towards the end.<br /><br />The other important difference this novel presents compared to other works by Grisham has to do with the genre. The author is characterized for writing thrillers in a legal setting, but in this case we are in the presence of a book that belongs in the espionage category. Grisham tried to change genres before, for example with \\"Bleachers\\", where the main topic is sports, but in my opinion this attempt was not successful. But Grisham will not give up, and it seems to me that he is trying to prove to himself that he can write great books in other categories. In this case even though the quality is not excellent, as it was in \\"The Firm\\" or \\"A Time to Kill\\", Grisham delivers a powerful novel that will satisfy those that are looking for something more than nonstop action. The only reason why this novel is not excellent in my opinion is that I felt the ending was a little rushed. If this section of the book had been better developed, the experience would have been even more satisfying.ence of a book that belongs in the espionage category.

031218087X|3.0|Compared to his other work, Digital Fortress felt like Mr. Brown was writing this story with a screen play in mind.  This was not the level of complexity and character development that readers get from his other works.   <br /> <br />Of his non-Angel&Deamons/Da Vinci works, read Deception Point,  it is a much better book.
B0006FFRVG|4.0|British mope-rock is alive and well, as Brit-pop trio Keane makes their debut with \\"Hopes and Fears.\\" Strong, soaring vocals from Tom Chaplin are backed up by some solid piano-based pop and rock. Despite constant comparisons to Radiohead, Travis and Coldplay, Keane shows plenty of promise as a unique new band.<br /><br />It starts off with a strong piano solo in the quiet \\"Somewhere Only We Know,\\" followed by a stream of catchy pop like the thoughtful \\"Everybody's Changing\\" and the shimmery \\"Bend And Break,\\" and gossamer ballads like the melancholy \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers\\" and soaring \\"She Has No Time.\\" It wraps up on a strong note with the plaintive \\"Bedshaped.\\"<br /><br />As a dualdisc CD, this also has a DVD side if you flip it over. It includes several music videos of okay (though not great) quality, including one that is different in the U.K. It also contains a special photo gallery and song lyrics, which are a pleasant accompaniment to the CD itself.<br /><br />If any British band breaks the rock mold, it seems to be labelled as a Radiohead/Coldplay wannabe. On some superficial levels, Keane sounds rather like those bands. But it manages to remain a bit apart, rocking a bit harder and sounding a bit more straightforward and simple. It's hard to truly classify Keane as really being pop -- the lack of guitar and the prevailing piano seem to edge its catchy melodies closer to classical pop.<br /><br />The first thing to know about Keane is: No guitarist. At all. Ever. Don't let it scare you -- the mix of rippling piano and gentle percussion are enough to make their melodies catchy without electric riffs. At the same time, they take some musical risks. Psychedelic piano-pop? Believe it or not, Keane does that.<br /><br />Tom Chaplin's vocals are the strongest point of Keane's lineup; his solid, high soars along with the shimmery music. At times his vocals get a bit TOO high, like when he sings the title line of \\"She Has No Time,\\" but most of the time he manages to sound like a heartbroken guy exorcising his breakup demons. The songs themselves aren't terribly complex or insightful, but they can be quite poignant: \\"And if you have a minute why don't we go/talk about it somewhere only we know?/This could be the end of everything/so why don't we go/somewhere only we know?\\"<br /><br />Keane needs to distance itself more from the other Brit-mope-rock bands before it can blossom into true greatness. But in \\"Hopes And Fears,\\" they have succeeded in the basics: bringing forth some beautiful, sometimes heartrending music.No Time,\\" but most of the time he manages to sound like a heartbroken guy exorcising his breakup demons.

B00009V7T2|5.0|I don't even know where to begin with this piece or art. It is probably one of the best arranged, written, and performed piece of musical art I've ever heard, if not THE best. The album is like one big epic painting of different musical tones and harmonies, never one moment of complete silence. Each song blends into the next, leaving you asking, \\"What? This isn't the same song? When did tracks change?\\" You may need time getting used to it, but I promise if you give it a couple few times through, you'll agree with me. I STRONGLY believe that this album is within the top 10, probably even top 5 of all time. It's that good. And I'm not conceited by any means, but I have pretty good taste in music (knowing that classic is great like Zeppelin, Hendrix, and that lots of new sh*t is industrialized and molded to the \\"rock star\\" life and making money) and I'm asking for your trust when I tell you this is SUCH a great work. The beginning is an intro to the first song, leading up to a hard hitting opening song, \\"Inertiatic ESP.\\" Then it trails off into the third track \\"Roulette Dares (the Haunt of)\\" which is a collective work, having it's easing parts, along with high-energy, odd-timing melodies. Working through six other tracks, finally ending at a true masterpiece (in my opinion one of the best songs on the album), \\"Take The Veil Carpin Taxt.\\" This song is a 8-plus minute song that ends the album with it's complex and truly talented guitar playing, it's heavy and off-time signiture drumming, his heartfelt crying vocals, and the complex and intricating bass lines. This album is in (my opinion) the top 5 greatest albums ever written for sure. Pick it up a.s.a.p. and get lost in these truly talented musicians' masterpiece works.
B00003CX8U|5.0|Brilliant and reckless, self indulgent and obsessive, Bob Fosse's self destructive masterpiece of a semi-autobiography fuses the genres of the musical and the horror film in a flame of black magic. ALL THAT JAZZ, while far from perfect, demands viewing if for no other reason than it holds no punches while it stares its subject bluntly in the face. And the face in this case is none other than one of the maddest geniuses the American Theatre ever produced- the choreographer enfant terrible- Bob Fosse.     Webster's Dictionary presents these definitions of the word \\"horror:     - intense aversion or repugnance   -a state of extreme depression or apprehension   - and as an adjective- calculated to inspire feelings of dread     ALL THAT JAZZ inspires all those feelings as it intoxicates, infuriates (the steaming and sexy airline number is so overlong- but that is the point!) and wallows in the grotesque, while offering not a single apology along the way.     Fosse dares to take his audience deep into his soul and stare it down with unstinting rage against Dylan Thomas' \\"dying of the light\\". His cinematic alter-ego \\"Joe Gideon\\" (expertly played by Roy Schieder- a good actor absolutely brilliant here) is a egomaniacal pig. He uses, abuses and discards all around him- including his very soul. His devotion to \\"show business\\" and art is singular. Fosse captures the Everests and Canyons of the creative mind. But he does not romanticize or glorify the mercurial creative muse. He is too intelligent an artist for that. The creative genius can be a deal with the devil and Gideon (and Fosse?) eagerly signs his life away.    The dance numbers are magnificent- filled with Fosse's unique style of movement. The much vaunted opening \\"Cattle Call\\" sequence is a brilliant example of editing and color.  The climatic \\"Bye-Bye Life\\" number in which Fosse morbidly films his own death deftly induces both euphoria and repulsion. Fosse's perfection and sense of rhythm intoxicates and seduces aswe weaves beautiful bodies in and out of the frame. His choreography celebrates the venal and the holy in a marriage between the organic and the technically precise. There will never be another like him.    Yes, the film is dark. A cautionary tale to be sure. This a unique film that is not only a musical drama, but a horror film- a horror film where the monster is the creator himself.     Historically speaking, it is fascinating that ALL THAT JAZZ came out the same year as that other mad masterpiece- APOCALYPSE NOW (also a true horror film). In man ways ALL THAT JAZZ is the musical version of APOCALYPSE NOW.    Maybe not for all tastes, but a genuine work of art worthy of repeated viewings and analysis.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|A fantastic show.  And not just for chicks: I'm a guy.  Probably won't want to let your buddies on the softball team know that you're watching this show, but it's really a funny and interesting show.  It's a television show for people with brains.  The references to pop culture, hisorical figures, and literature remind me of similar references in The Simpsons.  Not kidding.  Pick it up at this great price and catch up with a season that you might have missed.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|If I was to use one word to describe the lead singer of Dream Theater , I'd say EXHILERATING. If I had to use one word to describe the drummer , I'd say CRAZY and the guitars would just make me fail on the number of adjectives I'd be using. Welcome to DREAM THEATER's new NO LIMITS YET CONTROLLED AGRESSION music.By far one of the best albums I've heard in the 00's. Its inspiring,straight forward mean,run up hills scream until your lungs cant take more. Stop/Start/Repeat....<br /><br />Yes your right I've been listening to Train Of Thought ever since I first heard it. I always thought their vocalist was limited compared to the other talents the band posseses. Quite honestly, I think Mike Portnoy is as per me the best drummer in the world.<br /><br />Track 1 \\"As I Am\\" made me feel like a juvenile delinqent. The music was just breathtaking. It reaches a certain level that I cant describe. Whats more shocking is the fact that the vocals only lead the music all the way. Its absolutely the best vocally driven song I've heard in a long time. To lead a song of the class of AS I AM requires some major throat.<br /><br />\\"This Dying Soul\\" and \\"Stream Of Consciousness\\" are just epics in their respective musical characterisation levels.\\"Honor Thy Father\\" is just pure aggression.<br /><br />I used to think \\"Home\\" introduced the level in music which I thought could be attained only by no other band in the world and it was the only song of its kind. I think I was right about both my point of views. However, as vague and untrue as it sounded to me \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" simply smashed me into bits. With lyrics that speak to your soul and music that creates a storm,an army,an absolute anarchy in your brain the song introduced a new level of music to me. I think the word perfect seems like an unwanted adjective when I use it on Endless Sacrifice. It contains 11mins25seconds of absolutely mega-epic music.<br /><br />Train Of Thought is a life experience of a record. I think their last 2 albums before TOT were absolutely fantastic too.<br /><br />Train Of Thought is the sort of album that I would expect from Metallica. However, it only proved one point to me. Dream Theater are untouchable , larger than life and absolutely more granite crushing solid than ever!t 2 albums before TOT were absolutely fantastic too. <br /> <br />Train Of Thought is the sort of album that I would expect from Metallica. However, it only proved one point to me. Dream Theater are untouchable , larger than life and absolutely more granite crushing solid than ever! <br /> <br />
B0006OBPTA|5.0|The original Karate Kid will always have a special place in my life. It is a great snap shot of life in the 80's and the struggles some of us faced as teenagers. This movie made me want to start taking Karate lessons. Now I'm a 6th degree black belt in Okinawan Karate. Thanks for the motivation Daniel san. <br /> <br />Clint DuPlechian,Sensei
B00005JN0T|5.0|I rented this a couple of weeks ago, and i had low expectaions for it. I thought it was going to be just another formula robot movie, with nice CG. Boy was i wrong, the movie was really good, and i especially liked how instead of saying \\"based off of the book\\" they say \\"suggested by Isaac Asimov's book\\" i thought that was really special since the dudes that made it, knew that they couldn't make a true movie out of the book. They made it so people would understand the laws, then they made a story based off of that.<br /><br />The acting in the movie was really good for the most part, there were some parts of the movie that i was like, \\"so he just all of a suddent changed his mind about this robot after years of hating robots\\" but i thought about it and figured out that he didn't hate robots, he hated the part of himself that *spoiler* was a robot, and the overall fact that the robots don't have a conscience about matters that would significant to us.<br /><br />overall a good, fun, movie; with great special effects, and a great ending.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album absolutely blew my mind away.  I was fortunate enough to see them open up for A Perfect Circle in April when they came to Seattle.  They were absolutely incredible live, and the cd was by no means a dissapointment to their amazing show.  This cd is full of beautiful enigmatic sounds pulling u left and right that have u guessing what will come next. 2 thumbs way up for this band
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill is a very blessed individual. She has one of the most distinctive voices I have heard in a long while. Lauryn can rap and sing extremely well without giving up her integrity or profound lyrics.  This album is ecletic, soulful, but yet raw and edgy as well. The Fugees were successful- but I don't think anyone could have anticipated Ms. Hill's debut album.  Loved by critics and fans alike, this album is certified classic by almost every music lover.  There is not one track that is filler material... simply not one.  This is one of the first albums I knew like the back of my hand. I could recite her album acapella even with the interludes!  As a songwriter/singer/writer myself I am amazed at Lauryn's talent. She makes it look effortless and real.  She can come across edgy and street but politically intelligent and poised. She is a real BLACK WOMAN.   Standouts: X-Factor, Zion, Used to Love him, Nothing Else Matters, and practically every track.  5 star album.  Lauryn Hill If you could grace the music industry we fans would love it. You have us wanting more.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I didn't think it was going to stand up like the rest but it did. It felt like I was reading the book throughout the whole movie, I love it and I can not wait for the next one.
B0002OERI0|1.0|i just searched for \\"crap\\" on amazons search for all products and this is the first one that came up. I thought this bad was british until i saw them on the telly and realised they themselves are american idiots. this album was part of the wave of bands going mainstream with the popular political oppinion. and band that does that is not very good indeed.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I love Green day. <br />They have songs that make me wanna DANCE! <br /> <br />
1400032717|5.0|When we readers crack open a novel, for the purpose of education and enjoyment, we are clearly setting out to avoid yet another dumbing down process.  We don't want to approach it with a naivete similar to watching Bambi one too many times.  We do not want to try digesting something so detached from reality as an alchemist trying to find a way to manufacture gold from lead.  We want a solid, believable protagonist, no matter what direction that lead character may be coming from, and not surrounded by a group of supporting characters who all seem like they are only delivering pizzas to each other. In sum, none of us wishes to be merely taken for a ride down a cul-de-sac (a dead end). #####  With such a beautifully developed, totally \\"original\\" story, Mark Haddon's Curious Incident circumvents all these usual reader entrapments.  And, with style, grace, and charm.  Autism probing an emotional world.  Think about it. It's pioneering, speculative.  It's marvelous.   #####  Three cheers for such a refreshing breath of \\"originality.\\"  May equally captivating themes emerge in force, and, in more future novels, snow us all under in a storm of such creative brilliance.
0780021967|5.0|This isn't so much a review of Hitchcock's movie as it is of Mariane Keane's commentary track. Let me say up front that the movie itself is a wonderful masterpiece as has been attested to already. Now to Ms. Keane's commentary.  I watched the Criterion version of this movie and the next night played it again with her commentary.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I had never heard her before. The previous week I had watched \\"Murder, My Sweet\\" and listened to the commentary on that, by someone else, which I found very thin.  So I was very pleasantly surprised by Ms. Keane's insightful observations, so much so that I went looking through all my Hitchcock DVDs to find more with her commentaries on them.  I found a couple and I will be ordering \\"Spellbound,\\" both because I like the movie and because it has a commentary by Ms. Keane.  If this sounds like a plug for Ms. Keane it is.  And no, I don't know her, I've never met her and never even heard of her before listening to her commentary on \\"The 39 Steps.\\"  But I was so happy to discover her I thought I'd write this up.  The five stars are for both the movie and the commentary.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Pop is one of my favorite albums. Each track on the album has the ability of conjering up different emotions, and by the end, the emotional wirlwind leaves me dizzy. The album's central theme of encountering genuin beauty in our world of technology, yet being unable to shake a certain feeling of unease, comes across perfectly. It attempts to send the message that you don't have to be compliant all the time: treasure your individuality, don't let anyone take it away from you. At least that's what I got from this album, which brings the point across beautifully with it's layered sounds and melodic, peircing, and haunting songs. I'm genuinly moved by this album everytime I listen to it.  <br /> <br />This masterpiece is best listened to while relaxing with a set of headphones on. It tends to put me in a contemplative trance, and with an open mind, it may do the same for you. In my view, the music is brilliantly unique, and as I said before, is very difficult to compare to anything else. This is musical experimentation at its best. it's where the musical crossroads juxtaposed and became not only a synthesis of different sounds, but also a completely new musical statement.  <br /> <br />If I were to live in a Desert Island forever, this would definitely be the album I would take with me to listen. Pop is breathtaking, stunning, worthy of adjectives not yet created. Wheres a poet when you need one; I'm at a loss for words !!.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005YW4H|5.0|Sometimes all the stars line up and everything goes perfectly. (Rumours, Dark Side of the Moon, Thriller, etc.) That's what happened here. Perfect voice, perfect songs, perfect collection, and perfect recording to boot. One of the great--and most beautiful--albums of all time in any genre. And it never gets old.

B0001EFTVA|5.0|1. The directing was absolutely fantastic. Never thought that a japanese director would direct in such a marvelously way without showing any meaningless killings and tons of blood like most of the anime do (or meaningless, slow paced various scenes that most of the japanese-chinese movies have). The directing was too much for an anime and together with the state of the art technology the final result of both directing and anime was great. <br /> <br /> 2. Really funny, and humorus made me laugh more than a few times and again I laugh very hard with the \\"eastern asian\\" humor. This was clever and right to the point. <br /> <br /> 3. Nice dialogues that meant something and told the story correctly. <br /> <br /> Overall this anime exceeded by far my expectations and I am looking forward to seeing more movies coming from this director. The last but a bit embarassing thing is that I hate the good christmass movies. I do so because they make me shed some tears (e.g Scrooged with Bill Marey etc). Imagine how embarassing is to shed tears with an anime. I am not even a girl damn it!!! <br /> <br /> Bravo!!
B00005Y7GQ|4.0|This movie isn't your typical family movie but wow...is it ever a hoot! Blending Kung Fu, soccer and more than a bit of mysticism into a perfect (and hilarious) action movie.<br /><br />  Basic plot: Former soccer champ, poor and disdained, discovers a guy with real potential. From there they form a team and try to win a championship and achieve fame and glory.<br /><br />  But describing the basic plot is like trying to describe the color \\"blue\\" to someone who can't see colors. It is the subtleties, humor and just plain weirdness of this one that make it a standout! Don't expect realism but a blend of fantasy and wish fulfillment...and, oh yes, soccer like it has NEVER been played before.
B00005T30L|5.0|Based off of the comic book, here we have a movie with two best friends Enid and Rebecca fresh out of high school and their futures lying wide open in front of them. Except they don't know what they want to do. Both disgusted by society, people and world around them they are cynical and annoyed by almost everything. Enid develops an unlikely relationship with Seymour, who they prank called on a fake blind date, and followed him to his house. That doesn't work out, and like before Enid is left with an unknowing sense of what to do. Enid and Rebecca's friendship drifts apart throughout the movie because they are obviously going in different directions in their lives. But as it always seems in life, Enid has no resolution for her problems.
B000641Z90|5.0|Phil Collins has always graciously bothered to record a \\"memento\\" show to document his successful world tours...Berlin in 1990, Paris in 1997, Dallas in 1985.  A nice reward for some of us who got to see them in person.  His 2004 \\"First Final Farwell Tour\\" was no exception.  If anything, this DVD reminds me how disappointing it is Collins has chosen now to \\"retire\\"; he has always packed his shows with top-notch production, both in visuals and sound.  However, this couldn't always be captured on VHS (or even DVD rereleases of VHS).  This DVD does capture it though.  DVD technology has caught up to him...and now he's leaving!<br /><br />Still, he has left us something truly wonderful on this DVD.  Filmed in Paris in June 2004, the musical performances are fantastic, most notably topped with great sax solos by Gerald Albright.  Helmed by director Hamish Hamilton, who worked wonders with Peter Gabriel's \\"Growing Up Live\\" DVD in 2003, the video footage is likewise sweeping in its scope, covering the massive stage, loads of band members, and the vast audience present.  Collins is enjoyable to watch, but so too is everyone else around him.<br /><br />The DVD is also packed with bonuses.  A few performances from the concert come with the \\"multi-angle\\" feature and it is used here to good effect.  Most tracks are also accompanied by their original music videos, which are nice to finally have in a digital format.  There are also several other rare live performances culled from the archives that really make this DVD a must-have for all Collins fans.<br /><br />Great visuals and great music, along with tons of extras, make this DVD a great buy.  Sadly, Collins is part of a slowly-disappearing class of musicians who combined stunning visual styles with musical substance and produced fantastic rich shows that never tire on repeated viewing.  Yet, thanks to great DVDs like this one, the show will always go on.
B0002858YS|5.0|I grew up in the 1980's, so I will always be warmer to that style of music than what's come out since. <br /> <br />In the early part of the decade, media shoved a bunch of grunge clones down your throat that these were \\"the next best things\\", and honestly, I never really was won over by any of those bands.  Then I heard \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on the radio and for the longest time wanted to know who the band was... and then I heard the entire album and loved it.    I am a big fan of 80's synth music, it reminds of my childhood.  I think this album is a great mishmash of 90's guitars, 80's synths and 00's vocals.  It rocks.   Yes, it doesn't replace early 80's Cure... but isn't it nice to find something CURRENT by a new group that you can listen to?  Don't get me wrong, I listen to so much 80's music it hurts but it's great to find a new artist I can listen to with the same intensity. <br /> <br />I also agree with those who consider this album and \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" as nice companion pieces, but I would give \\"Hot Fuss\\" the edge.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I bought this cd on a whim, in an attempt to expand my musical horizons; increase my knowledge of jazz. I am always very hesitant about buying discs labeled as \\"jazz\\" because being a major square, I like songs where I can hear the melody, and many jazz cds are too experimental for me. I heard a few snippets of the songs in astore and liked what I heard enough to take a chance on it. I rarely buy music these days, unless I'm overseas and see something I won't find in the US.  <br /> <br />Madeleine Peyroux blew me away. She is absolutely phenomenal. I don't know how I did not heard of her sooner. It is rare for me to like most songs on a disc, but with \\"Careless Love,\\" the challenge is for me to recommend a favorite. I did not need time for them to \\"grow on me.\\" There are tunes for every mood: giddy and in a new love and full of hope, loving some one with trepidation because you know the person is not good for you but you are so stuck, hearache of losing some one you love, despair at never geting some one you love, embracing the comfort of a secure love, ect. In one way of another, life is all about love, and this cd is all about life.   <br /> <br />As many comment, she sounds much like Billy Holiday. Much emotion and maturity in her voice. Every song sounds rich, even when it's a carefee track. I love the fact that he words are clearly articulated, and it's easy to learn the lyrics form listening to her, even in French, because you will want to try to sing along to these beauties.  <br /> <br />I was shocked to learn that the singer is so young. One would never tell from hearing her croon. It's great though, becuase it means that she has many years left to sing; she's just begun to enchant us. The music is a great generation bridge too, in the sense that I am in about 30 and I love it, my youngest sister in her late teens loved it, and my parents love it too - what a rarity in today's music market.
B0006SSOHM|4.0|Aside from all of the negative reviews, this movie is a stylish, suspense/thriller with a gory edge and a twisty turny plot which you wouldn't be able to guess, until it's revealed in the end. It's been compared to Seven, and said that the director, James Wan has seen it too many times, and is trying too hard but fails to deliver. Well, if you love horror/suspense/thrillers and are in the mood for something besides the typical emotionless masked killer stalking random people and hacking them up, then give this a try. It makes you think, and has an underlying uneasiness about it. It shows the extremes some people would go to to save their own lives, and what they would do in these horrific situations. The victims are people that the \\"killer\\", which as you will find out really doesn't do any of the killing, has chosen because of sinful things they've done, because they don't value life, so on. It makes you think, and plays around with different concepts like: What would you do to save your own life? Is the \\"Killer\\" really responsible for the murders, even though he didn't actually kill anyone? It delves into the darker and smarter side of the human psyche. Some would say to extremes, others would say it fits.
B00005U2LM|3.0|Wu-tang is my favorite rap group of all time but this album isnt all that great. Most of the beats suck and its too mainstream. Wasnt much raw material. ODB couldnt record with them also INS was in the background most of the time, leaving U-God and Masta Killa to do more than him. What the hell. Nothing can match up to 36 Chambers and anyone who says this is better than 36 Chambers, Wu-Tang Forever and The W must be silly in the mind. <br /> <br />Worse Tracks: Dashing, Soul Power (worse wu beat of all time - what was Rza thinking) <br /> <br />Best tracks: Iron Flag (until it gets to the next song in the track), Yall Been Warned, Rules, and Uzi was ok - had to grow into that song.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Make no mistake about it, this is the most powerful mini-series to have hit television.  It is certainly the finest television I have ever seen, and easily joins with Roots, Holocaust, as one of the seminal works of television.  It is impossible not to follow this series and garner respect for the men being portrayed in Easy Company - and all soldiers of this and every war.   <br /> <br />Although billed as a mini-series, it really is a ten hour film of such sweeping power that words practically fail me to describe the overwhelming emotions I experienced while watching Band of Brothers.  From boot camp through the end of the war, we get to know these men, see their hopes and lives dashed, the promise of living unfulfilled in too many cases and just what the ravages of war cost us all.   <br /> <br />The battle scenes are terrifyingly realistic in their reenactments, the acting, direction, attention to every detail nothing less than perfect.  While each episode is a masterpiece, for some reason episode 6 \\"Bastogne\\" seemed to especially resonate for me and it was impossible to watch this episode without viewing it through tears.   <br /> <br />There's not much more to say than \\"Band of Brothers\\" may be the finest film, television, whatever you want to call it that I've ever seen.   <br />
B00008K7AM|5.0|I must say that the acting in this movie was superb. Rob Schneider plays both roles rather well. The story line was also well crafted. Overall, this movie was funny from beginning to the end. Please don't eat popcorn while watching this movie, you just might choke yourself laughing.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is one of their harder albums. After ATYCLB the band was revived with music that was closer to their roots.  This on the other hand sounds like its from the 70's.  I regret that some songs (\\"All Because of You\\")are a bit predictible.  But the huge sound emiting from the guitar makes up for it.  Like all of thair albums its not so much the music but the lyrics that make make the album.  They talk about real subjects and are incredibly deep.  If you like poetry this is it.  Underneath the surface these songs is a new life with every different interpretation.  It is truley amazing to listen to what they have to say.  And if poetry isnt what you are into I would still recomend this album due to its powerful music and electrifying sound.  For the long time fans there is still a hint of their previous work imbeded into some there tunes.  Especially the lighter songs such as \\"All Because of You\\".  This album may not be considered their best, and even if you thought it was their weakest album. This is solid, and highly recomend HTDAAB.  It is well worth $15
B0006IIKS0|5.0|During the first ten minutes I felt pretty much like turning it off, which, is pretty much how I've felt about Metallica for more than a few years.   Something compelled me to stay with it and 15 minutes into it I was riveted by watching the inner machinations of a shattered phoenix trying to pull itself out of not ashes, but muck and mire.   <br /> <br />Enter Shrinkman (sorry boys) in the form of a psychiatrist named Phil who starts opening doors the boys seem intent on keeping shut . . . indeed, James slams a few shut.  Like voyeurs we're invited to watch egos dashed, pretension shattered, raw nerves at the fraying point and more than a little whining, self-pitying and prima donna posturing as the Metalliboyz grow older and are forced to cope with an ever changing music industry as well as life itself. <br /> <br />One of the most moving moments is a confrontation/reconciliation with Dave Mustaine.  A misty eyed Mustaine lays out plain and simple the pain he endured in the years since he (literally) got thrown out of the band.  Watching an uncomfortable Lars try to come to terms and his full comprehension and realization of that decision - for good or ill - is stuff that cannot be scripted, cannot be acted it is life.   <br /> <br />To their credit they come out alive, stronger, wiser and full of hope, acceptance and promise.  What this remarkable documentary captures is akin to watching the dead come back to life.  This is raw, inspiring, powerful stuff, and in its own way, something of a miracle.   <br />
B00005YUNY|5.0|Lots of people have said lots of different things about this DVD - individual performances, the role of the orchestra, the sound mix etc, so I'm not going to go over that all again. <br /> <br />I've been a Yes fan for over 30 years (I started late!).  Of all the Yes material that I own, CDs, DVDs, VHS tapes, THIS is the one that I come back to when I REALLY want to unwind at the end of the week, with a glass (or two) of wine and allow myself to be transported away from the hassles of the world.  It soars, it rocks, it thunders, it whispers and it moves me.  They're all great, even the orchestra, and I NEVER tire of it.  When it finishes, I feel better.  Can anyone ask more from a group of artists? <br />
B00006L9ZT|5.0|The Met's now classic Ring has been lauded to the heavens and criticized for its lack of innovation.  It's a personal thing, I believe, and I believe this is a Ring to stand the test of time.   <br /> <br />Traditional doesn't need to be a bad word, and this Ring resounds with glorious performances from the opening of Das Rheingold through the destruction of Valhalla and the flooding of the Rhine.  It's a glorious, operatic adventure of a lifetime. <br /> <br />Some may quibble that Hildegard Behrens isn't a true dramatic soprano, but her fierce will, and often lovely voice, combined with an intensity that is electrifying make this a Brunhilde to treasure.   <br /> <br />James Morris's Wotan, Christa Ludwig's Fricka, Matti Salminen, and the rest of the cast offer big committed performances under James Levine's baton.  The production values are not stinted on here and we really get a sense of Wagner's \\"gesamtkunstwerk\\" or \\"total work of art.\\"   <br /> <br />Worth every penny! <br /> <br />
B0002234LS|4.0|Am I the only person who felt a bit of deja-vu at the end of this movie, being a big fan of the movie \\"Fight Club\\"?  I found the movie to be very creepy and suspenseful and my only complaint was something someone else mentioned, namely that they showed a couple of flashes of that \\"secret window\\" in his house and never gave enough detail about it.  Perhaps that was because it was just a simple idea he had - she once looked out that window and commented about putting a garden outside, and he rode with the idea. I wonder how his Secret Garden story originally ended!
B000002U9Y|5.0|A Saucerful of Secrets is an album that all too often goes unappreciated. The album's main problem is, of course, that it lacks in one of the most important traits of a classic Pink Floyd album: focus and structure. While the band were going through a continuing stage of transition from the departure of their original lead vocalist, Syd Barrett, to the creation of their masterpiece, The Dark Side of the Moon, and every album created during that time is filled with experimentation and hesitation, none can be said to be as transitional as 'Saucerful'. It was during the recording of this album that Syd's drug problem and mental illness were getting worse to his eventual dismissal from the band; his playing can actually be heard on three of the seven tracks of the album, while on the others he is replaced by the new guitarist David Gilmour. <br /> <br />What 'A Saucerful of Secrets' really is, is a selection of different possible directions for the band's future. With two different lead guitarists, three lead vocalists and three songwriters, there is not a chance for the album to work as a whole like 'Dark Side' or 'Wish You Were Here' (or, for that matter, 'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn') did. While 'The Piper at the Gates of Dawn') was a psychedelic masterpiece, this second album is an uneven and often messy blend of psychedelica, avant-garde, progressive and classic rock. As such, it's a fascinating piece of history and essential for Pink Floyd fans; and, despite its flaws, it's one of their finest albums in more than one aspect. <br /> <br />With Syd out of the picture, bass player Roger Waters took on most of the songwriting chores for the album, and he's certainly come a long way from his contribution to the first album, 'Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk' - though he has a long way to go to get to 'The Wall', too. 'Let There Be More Light' and 'Set The Controls for the Heart of the Sun' are easily the strongest, most developed songs on the album, and they're signs for great things to come from Mr. Waters. 'Let There Be More Light', particularly, though it lacks somewhat in focus and sound, sound a lot like his truly great pieces from 'Dark Side' and 'Animals'. His third offering, 'Corporal Klegg', is an often underappreciated piece that should not be neglected; it's the first sign of Roger's macabre sense of humor and his bleak, sarcastic political views, and it can show us where 'Animals', and songs like 'Brain Damage' and 'Free Four' come from. It's a hilarious little song with a depressing message. <br /> <br />Richard Wright should not be forgotten, either; he contributed two songs to this collection (sadly, he would never again have such presence on a Floyd album). His songs are clearly closer to Syd's writing than anything else on the album; no member of Floyd was as influenced by Syd as Richard. Both of his songs are classic pieces of psychedelica, and one of them, 'Remember a Day', is a Floyd classic, and an honest-to-god beautiful song. <br /> <br />The Floyds' search for direction shows most of all in the title track, the 11 minute long instrumental epic 'A Saucerful of Secrets'. It's also closest to showing the direction they will take in the future, in the masterpieces 'Atom Heart Mother', 'Echoes' and finally 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond'. 'A Saucerful of Secrets' is the first sign of Floyd's fascination with classical music, and though it may take a few listens to get accustomed to, and not as easy on the ears as 'Shine On', it's a perfectly structured piece of avant-garde music that would influence modern artists from Brian Eno and John Cale to Sigur Ros and Godspeed You Black Emperor. I would recommend watching this masterpiece performed live in 'Live in Pompeii', it would blow your minds. <br /> <br />It's Syd, though, who gets the final word on the album, with 'Jugband Blues', his last contribution to Pink Floyd as singer and songwriter. It's a dark, haunting, intimate piece, and it's the one that stays inthe listener's mind after the album is over. A big problem with 'A Saucerful of Secrets' is that most of the best tracks can be obtained elsewhere; 'Remember a Day' can be found on 'Relics', 'Set the Controls' and 'A Saucerful of Secrets' are performed live both in the Pompeii recording and in 'Ummagumma'. But the ending that is 'Jugband Blues' makes the listening experience very worthwhile. This album is not for inexperienced listeners, but for Floyd fans it's a must.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Finally, new ideas delivered as well as the old death metal ideas have been. You know what i mean, one example is that after 'gore metal', exhumed, the gore metal genre had nowhere to go. Behemoth has a new genre in this kind of music, technically it might just be a few different ideas with normal death metal filler, but there is something about behemoth, there is so much energy, conviction, conviction, this is by far the most intense death metal i have ever heard, never mind hate eternal, nile, deicide,etc, those bands are great, and im not saying that behemoth is better, but this band has done something that no other band has done, i cant really put my finger on the perfect word for it, but conviction is close, it sounds like they care about the music, and because of that they sound just heavier and crazier than other death metal, even though musically the genre is the same. The lyrics are spiritual, thelemic spirituality that is, not just satanic or about killing people, although there are hints of both, when it comes down to it, no matter what else i say, at very least behemoth is just an exceptional all around extreme metal band. period.
B0002RNXNM|5.0|Though released in late '04, this disc will get all of its mainstream attention in early '05 and I'm making an early call on this being the top disc of the year.<br />Without getting over my head in detail, the first six tracks are all pure hits and the last four are defintely listenable. If you're Madchester fan in any form, buy this disc.
B000007WNN|5.0|This is a rocker! Stealing riffs by the Stones sometimes sounding like 'Start me up' in so many ways! But with the driving guitar from the man, Billy Duffy and his sanded down Gibson Les Paul Custom! I saw them live and when they did cuts off this album, they were fawkin' great! This is a killer album! One of the best of the 80's!
B000001EMW|3.0|OK, so I like all kinds of music, from classic rock to classical, Celtic to Heavy Metal, emphasis on the metal.  I'm a big fan of Metallica, so I thought I'd give this a try.  While it is OK, it's not great.  Yes, the bass parts are reproduced well, and a fair job was done on the high end, but overall the music wasn't what I would call cohesive.  Looking at Metallica's music, most of their work just gels:  The rhythm section is tight, the lead and vocals play off each other and the rhythm, and the music flows well overall, even on their debut album.  Not like Apocalyptica's renditions (or, for that matter St. Anger, but that's another review):  While the playing is technically great, it just sounds, in many cases, like four guys playing four pieces.  What results is a cacophony of sounds which occasionally sync up and sound good.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|UGH, At times i thought i was watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  Then at others the Wizard of Oz.  The only enjoyable part was when Gwyneth took her last shot and i shouted \\"how gay!\\"  If you must see this bring plenty of scratch off tickets cause you might as well feel lucky.
B000005JA8|5.0|I listen to a lot of experimental music, and I don't like it all. What surprises me about this particular album, is that it does evoke negative effects in people. I didn't neccessarily become angry and offended like many of the one-star reviewers, but like those reviewers, I was confused a bit. I was also physically ill. Yes, this album made me dizzy and gave me a horrible stomach ache on more than one occasion. <br />I gave it a chance quite a few times because I like Captain Beefheart's other material. Eventually, my copy of Trout Mask Replica became scratched up and irrepairable. <br />Three and a half years later after putting it off (the memory of the stomach aches and dizziness didnt help), I re-purchased this album. To my surprise, the effect wore off, and I could hear the music for what it is. <br />For those who claim that this is not music, you have NO IDEA what non-music there is out there. After 100 Merzbow albums, Trout Mask Replica is about as \\"difficult\\" as ABC. <br />THIS ALBUM IS DANCABLE AND EVEN CATCHY! <br />The demo recordings and subsequent performances of the album material proves that this isn't a joke album, and that it isn't jam-session stuff. Sure, the musical ideas are looser (I don't know anything about time signatures, but I don't buy it completely), but they're original and sturdy tunes. <br />The poetry is more than what some reviewers have called the musings of stoned adolescents. They're vivid conceptual and visual paintings/stories. My favorites are on Pena and My Human Gets Me Blues. It's not normal, and I suppose one does have to develop a taste for it, but once the headache wears off, it's completely enjoyable. <br />My only complaint about this CD is its length, and that goes for any CD that exceeeds 4-50 minutes. This CD is over 79 minutes long, and I admit, a mild headache sets in at the 70 minute mark with headphones. ITS TOO MUCH FOR ME! <br />This CD is not for beginners, and it's true it may not be for everyone. You aren't going to DIE if you don't listen to this album, and it's completely understandable if you don't like this album. Hell, how can you like music that invokes vomit? <br />Well, I guess it's just unique like that. It would be much more convenient if it didn't get such a response. An important record, but it's not essential listening, especially if you wish to spare yourself any negative side-effects. That's the most I can say about this album without being long-winded.
B00000099Y|5.0|I first of all would like to thank NICK from KY.If you do not knoo who i am referring to , its the guy with 244 helpful votes one of them being mine. The first Tool CD i listened to was \\"undertow\\" amd i have no complaints, rather a new source of great music and a favorite song along with more of the worlds more interesting song writing in which i got to read. I bought this CD 3 weeks ago not knowing anything about Tool, rather then they were on my pool hall jukebox. Absolutely great music. This guys voice is awesome. How many artists actually have their own sound to where you can actually call them \\"artists?\\". Not many these days, everything put out these days usually is relovant music back to Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Which are also great bands mind you. Tool has there own unique sound that simply cant be ignored if you have any taste. Im a huge music fanatic, i listen to everything from Luther Vandross to The Eagles, to 2pac along with Metallica. The undertow CD was an awesome CD, i just picked up Aenima today. I really dont have much else to say. Have a good day. This CD deserves 5 stars. Work with me to resurrect where it should be. Calling all Tool fans <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B002O3Z50Q|1.0|Very bad movie.Besides the too many to list discrepancies with Homer's original, the movie was painful to watch. Poor acting, poor plot, poor dialogue. Most of the cast unsuited for their role.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|This movie has become hip to watch, due to most of popular culture openly embracing it. I found it to be a very expertly shot and acted movie, but not enough to merit all these 5-star reviews. I'll start off on the good leg first. The cinemtagrophy is simply beautiful, the final shoot out scene is brilliant, the plush red interiors compliment the bloody shoot out perfectly. De Palma does an excellent job of capturing all the excess and decadence of Stone's great script and the real jewel of the film is Pacino. Al Pacino embodies Tony Montana with a realism that is frighteningly superb. The charisma practically radiates off of Pacino all throughout the movie and the rise and fall Montana suffers is mirrored with great success in Pacino's performance. The action sequences, especially the final shoot out, are simply great. De Palma caught all the explosive brutality with an uncanny ability. Often times I am reminded of that glorious last stand in the Wild Bunch when watching Scarface. These two films boast two of the greatest gunfights ever. Now, the negative aspects of this glossy film. The score is absolutely horrendous. The plasticity of the synthesizer not only dates the film but its doesnt even serve its purpose to enhance the mood of the film. There is also a song featured during the quick shot sequences of Monatana's rise to fame that is horrible keyboard dominated 80's trash that definitley takes a toll on the movie. Another glaring negative is the film's total length, 170 mins. Perhaps De Palma and Stone felt this runtime had to be used for audiences to see the whole picture, the rise, the living high and the descent. I believe that many scenes could have been cut and the same desired effect would have been achieved. These two minor flaws are what keeps this otherwise genius film from getting a perfect score. Scarface is still one of the better films of the 80's and definitely a superb gangster/mafia flick though.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was just discovering Led Zeppelin properly around the time of their concert in Knebworth UK back in 1979. I owned virtually all their albums until 1984 but sold all my vinyl back then-eighty five albums including a Japanese version of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" <br />Well,I subsequently repurchased every Zep album on CD and had heard rumours of a new live album. I was fortunate enough to hear Jimmy Page being interviewed on Radio 1 at the time of it's release and heard \\"Black Dog\\" I was blown away! <br />A purchase soon happened and can confirm it is simply the best live album in my collection. It encompasses most of the tracks which made Zeppplin so huge. As for the sound quality, I don't know what incantation Jimmy Page chanted but whatever it was it worked...STUNNING CLARITY,sounded like is was recorded yesterday. <br />Sadly, the packaging didn't quite match the quality of the album. A limp cover design which should have included shots of the concerts in question. <br />That is the only moan, this album is perfect otherwise and worth ten times the asking price. <br />Why oh why Mr Page did you keep me waiting 25 years!
B0006A9FMI|4.0|This is without a doubt the most amazing animated film that I have ever seen - and I don't even like Japanese Anime, neither had I seen the first installment before going to see this one! Ghost in the Shell 2 is an intelligent mix of 3D animation with traditional 2D animation that works surprisingly well; throughout most of this film my mouth was hanging open! Visually it's incredible. The story too is very thought-provoking and keeps you wondering even after watching it, although almost every other sentence is a proverb of some sort. Now that's over with, I only gave this 4 stars because of the DVD problem. <br /> <br />The English subtitles are for hard of hearing, so you have to put up with the frequent (dogs barking) (helicopter approaching) (crash) but after a while you get used to it (the French subtitles don't suffer the same fate, for any other Francophones out there). It is annoying, but despite what others are saying, the font DOESN'T take up a third of the screen, they're the usual subtitle size, and I and the others I showed it to didn't find the film any less enjoyable. As for there being no English dub, if it really bothers you then it's best to wait for an inevitable 'special edition' release. I love this film and was in no way disappointed; the DVD could have been better but it's not a complete disaster. If you've got patience wait for the next release, otherwise I think this is still a worthwhile investment.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I purchased the original album back in 1979 after hearing snippetts of it on a local radio show. I was just getting into rock and quite honestly had never heard of UFO. Absolutly awesome and was my most played album. Well a lot of things happened since then and in 1984 I sold my entire Vinyl collection (SOB!)- UFO were no more! <br />Well back in June 2004 I finally purchased a PC,discovered Napster and started rediscovering some long lost treasure which included Strangers in the Night. It came up fresh as a daisy-just as good as back in '79 when I first heard it. <br />After much searching I finally located the \\"Expanded Edition\\" and paid just under 20 for it. <br />Listening to it, I noticed the improvement in quality over the well worn vinyl I had and the two extra tracks were certainly a bonus.Hot'N'Ready is superb. <br />Sadly, I wasn't over impressed with the packaging-an awful lot more could have been done here regarding photos,sleeve notes and presentation and I'm still getting my head around the revised running order. I would agree that the original running order was more coherent and why not present it in hybrid SACD Format? <br />These foibles aside, this represents UFO at their awesome best. There isn't a single bad track on it, the remastering has delivered eye-watering clarity and is in my opinion an essential buy even at twice the price I paid for it.
0345475674|3.0|This 3.5 star story is set in the region around Pompeii just a couple of days before the volcano Vesuvius buries it.  The protagonist, an 'aquarius' - works for the water department in Rome and is sent to investigate a problem with the aquaduct system near the city identified in the book title.    He encounters disgruntled laborors, corrupt city officials, scholars, and a love interest.      Harris does a good job of describing the lives of people from various stations of life in the Empire, especially the 'lower' positions.  He portreys things that are different - technology, food, views of the worth of the individual - and the things that remain the same - greed, snobbery, government bureaucracy, violence and powermongering.     I found it even more interesting for the picture of ancient Rome that it paints than the plot, but the story moves along well, keeps you turning the pages and comes together quite well.
B000002NJS|5.0|I'm sorry and I will probably upset a lot of people when I say I hated most of Madonna's material but every cloud has a silver lining...<br /><br />This is Madge at her absolute awsome best. Not a bad track on the album and an acheivement which has never been equalled by her before or since.<br /><br />I would like to see \\"Ray of Light\\" re-released in Hybrid SACD format giving it the sound quality it deserves.<br /><br />Sadly her later material reverted to her mediocre form but \\"Ray of Light\\" has to be a compulsory purchase.<br /><br />BUY IT!!!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|It is fantastic to finally be able to have MacGyver on Dvds, twenty years after the episodes were done ! <br /> <br />And to comment what people have said about the image quality, the quality is fair, really, especially since, as I said earlier, this season was shot 20 years ago, back in 1985. You couldn't sincerely hope for much better. <br /> <br />About the commercials ... that may sound annoying to certain, but they are about other (old) funny shows, so it's not bad to see 30 seconds of them at the beginning of the first dvd. Also, let's not forget that it is partly thanks to them (and the cost they represent) that such an event (the release of MacGyver on dvds) has been posible ... <br /> <br />Finally, about the no bonus, extras thing (and the people who say the dvds cost too much for just that) ... well, the dvds only cost $27.29 ... That's amazing for six dvds ! Even six empty dvds (to burn) cost less than that ... Let's face it, this is a great deal ! <br /> <br />MacGyver is the best !
B000005ALN|5.0|Regardless of how corny you might find some of George Michael's Wham! work to be, it's totally obvious even on the first Wham! album that he had an incredible knack for catchy/ tuneful pop-rock songwriting. George had released some music in the time between 1990's \\"Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1\\" and this album, \\"Older\\", which was finally released in 1996--he contributed 3 tracks to the various artists \\"Red Hot + Dance\\" CD, plus there was the release of the \\"Five Live\\" EP which found him teaming up with the surviving members of Queen--however, this period is notorious for Michael's lawsuit with his record company, Sony/ Columbia, which he ultimately lost. To put it a certain way though, \\"Older\\" certainly was worth the wait because Michael really outdid himself here--this is a truly superb album. Overall, the album is very, very mellow and frequently haunting/ contemplative; don't get the wrong idea though thinking that mellow is synonymous with boring--with so much great melodicism, elegance, and tastefulness, plus with George being in absolutely terrific, expressive form vocally, the album ends up being captivating, piling up great track upon great track. Beyond that, \\"Older\\" is a deeply resonating album, very emotionally moving. A bunch of the tracks find George picking up where the song \\"Cowboys and Angels\\" left off--\\"Jesus To A Child\\" & \\"You Have Been Loved\\" are lush, reverb-heavy ballads that are both beautifully sad and incredibly soothing; and the yearning \\"To Be Forgiven\\" is really good also. \\"Fastlove\\" is an infectious dancefloor tune while at the same time capturing a feel of romantic desperation to chilling effect--you've got to admit though that George was rather crazy to think he could get away with lifting the main hook from Patrice Rushen's \\"Forget Me Nots\\" whole cloth without giving credit and get away with it (the song's break is also blatantly reminiscent of the one in \\"Forget Me Nots\\")--nevertheless, a brilliant song. \\"Spinning the Wheel\\" is a superbly soulful tune with a great swinging, jazzy feel and excellent falsetto vocals from George. The super mellow, starkly arranged and reflective \\"It Doesn't Really Matter\\" is another soothing gem (notice his near quoting of \\"Always Something There To Remind Me\\"). George also proves he can totally pull off a lounge jazz-style tune with the ultra-catchy \\"Move On\\" which finds a unique balance between being downbeat and uplifting. \\"The Strangest Thing\\" is a strong tune with a cool otherworldly/ atmospheric feel to it, and the ranting \\"Star People\\" is fun. You've really got to hand it to George Michael for what he accomplished on this album--he really managed to capture an essence here, one that reminds of me of what makes so much R&B and soft rock from the 1970s and early '80s so great, and certainly there are musical influences from much earlier as well, and it's an extremely winning blend.  The fact that George convincingly pulls off the one-man-band approach--he plays all of the instruments on several tracks--just further demonstrates what an extremely talented artist he is.  \\"Older\\" is an essential album--it's one of the best albums of the '90s.
0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is phenomenal!  His research into the subjects in his books is staggering.  I was very intrigued by Blink, as to how we have a \\"gut feeling\\" about important decisions we make.  I liked this book a lot, but it is not as strong as the Tipping Point.
0312263120|4.0|Absolutely brilliant job done here by Dan Brown!! I agree with someone here saying \\"ppl writing bad reviews didnt actually understand the plot\\". how very rite. <br />Well I have my own other reasons for loving this book. It motivated  me back into writing crypto algos and network security...  <br />and I am so glad!! :) <br /> <br />thanks Dan!!
0671027344|5.0|Usually the hype surrounding a book/movie/song usually ruins it for me. I'll hear people raving about this and that I'll have high hopes expecting something great. What usually happens is I am incredibly disappointed. Which is sometimes unfair to me and the author because I might have liked the book/movie/song if I did not have the input of other people. (It's hard to dismiss other people's opinion no matter how hard you try to put it out of your head...) <br /> <br />What I basically want to say is I knew before I bought the book that it was popular and many people liked it, but I wanted to read it anyway. Maybe, just maybe, the 'hype' surrounding the book would be true for once. <br /> <br />This book is fantastic in every way. Charlie writing his letters to you helps you connect to story and make it feel that you are an essential part of the plot. His choice of words, his 'innocence,' the way he felt for Sam, his mix tapes, the way he worried about everyone and everything around him makes you fall in love with him. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. I plan to re-read it soon.
0060594888|5.0|Jack Canfield takes his wealth of knowledge about success and shares it in one amazingly well-thought-out book. It would be difficult to read this book and NOT benefit in some way from it. You could buy 100 books on the topic or just this one...it's your choice!
B000002BFL|5.0|OK, first let's not compare this album to Born to Run, or even Human Touch, this is different. It's a folk (for lack of a better term) type album. Compare it to Nebraska and for my money it is even better. I love Bruce when he rocks but I also like this Bruce who accomplishes what I see as comparable to Steinbeck set to music. This CD moves me the same way Grapes of Wrath moves me.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|. . . it doesn't capture the energy they have live. They were playing so hard I expected instruments to break or one of them to drop dead, and they were only the opening act. <br /> <br />Buy the album, and try to see them live!
B000002LJW|5.0|Reviewers can spend a great deal of time talking about what is right or wrong with a CD. I just know that when I look at my Clapton collection and pick out a CD to play, more often than not this is the one. It has his blues roots, it rocks, and it is pleasing to the ear. After all why do we listen to music? Forget all the analyses in the other reviews. Listen to this CD. I think when all is said and done it is one of his best.
0316172324|4.0|Blink is just as well written as The Tipping Point, but doesn't deal with as relevant a subject matter. <br /> <br />That said, I read it in one evening.
B000002MTU|5.0|If you like the type of thing Clapton does on a CD like Pilgrim then this is not the Clapton for you. However if you love the blues roots that Clapton draws his soul from then you'll love this. This is the Clapton that blues fans waited years for. He takes these old blues numbers and puts his own distinctive style on them.<br /><br />For my money this is a better CD even than Me and Mr. Johnson. Although I too am a big Robert Johnson fan I would rather hear an artist put their own spin on a tune than to just try to sound like the original.
B000002AS3|4.0|I got hooked on the song \\"Live Forever\\" straight away when I heard it back in 1994, so I bought the album hoping to find more songs like it.  Well, it was quickly apparent that I wouldn't be disappointed!  I was, and still am, totally into each powerhouse of a song on this CD.  Noel Gallagher's confidence driven lyrics coupled with Liam's arrogant vocal delivery and a pounding, heavy sound make up the Oasis formula for song writing.  Though they stick to this obviously successful formula, the disc doesn't present itself as samey.  Each song is an entity of its own. <br /> <br />The Beatles influence is evident in the lyrics, but musically I think they sound more like the Rolling Stones.  But, to be completely accurate, they sound like, well, Oasis.  Not particularly helpful I know, but give this CD and their latter ones a listen and you will know what I mean. <br /> <br />Live Forever, Shakermaker, Up In The Sky, Supersonic, Cigarettes & Alcohol, and Slide Away are probably the tracks that are the strongest and most addictive, but I like all of the tracks. <br /> <br />For anyone contemplating buying an Oasis CD for the first time, I would recommend this one.  It may be their first, but I think it is their finest.  It certainly seems to contain the most tracks that sound like they could have been singles. <br /> <br />Oasis may not have made it in a big way here in the US, but they are massively successful all the same.  Give them a listen and see why!
B00000255F|5.0|I may not agree with many of Bruce's political views, however this is simply the best rock and roll album ever!
B00000I8UJ|5.0|There are those who think the history of the jazz saxophone begins with Charlie Parker and ends with John Coltrane.  They are entitled to their opinions; but such a narrow viewpoint leaves out far too many originals.  Dexter Gordon for one.  GO! was recorded along with SWING TIME in the later summer of 1962-just before Gordon's fifteen-year \\"exile\\" in Europe.  Much has been made of Gordon finding Europeans more relaxed in racial distinctions and more hospitable toward jazz musicians in particular.  I suppose this is all true; but New York's \\"performance tax\\", his two previous prison terms for drug use, and the shrinking number of outlets for \\"live\\" jazz also must have played a part.  I also have to wonder if the Cuban \\"Missile Crisis\\" which followed these recordings provided an addition boot out the door.<br /><br />The most important point to made of all this is Gordon left the United States just a few steps before the major social upheaval of the 1960's occurred.  Gordon missed the sea change that transpired in popular culture as the baby boomers began to take the stage both literally and metaphorically.  The United States Gordon came back to fifteen years later was a much different place than the one he left.  While developments often went in parallel between America and Europe, the political and social upheavals had different meanings and outcomes.  It is not as if Gordon stepped into a time capsule when he went to Europe to live; but expectations of him as an artist were different.<br /><br />More interestingly, Gordon bypassed the \\"fusion\\" experiments in jazz and returned to the scene just as many were looking for a more `authentic\\" voice in jazz after enduring the bells and whistles of the \\"next big thing\\".  Since his return and especially after his appearance in the movie `ROUND MIDNIGHT, there has been renewed interest in Gordon's back catalog.  GO! is one of the most prominent albums in this popular revival.<br /><br />The liner notes give one the impression that these recordings were made under somewhat rushed circumstances.  If that is so, they don't sound like it.  From the very first notes we are treated to a very keen and snappy set of six pieces.  Jazz saxophone albums sometimes have a reputation for being slow and sad affairs-more suited to rainy afternoons of quiet introspection.  There is none of that here.  Gordon and company catch your attention with a high-spirited gallop appropriate for an evening of joyous dancing.<br /><br />In \\"Cheese Cake\\", \\"Second Balcony Jump\\", \\"Three O'Clock In The Morning\\" and even Cole Porter's \\"Love For Sale\\" throws one back to times when people danced to jazz instead of sitting down in quiet contemplation.  Indeed, such is the tempo and attitude displayed here that there is something about these performances that reminded me of the 1940's instead of the early 1960's.  Gordon's sax playing is bright and warmly assertive to the point that it rises to the level of graceful singing-not just honking out notes.  Sammy Clark matches Gordon's fiery displays with sharp articulation on the piano that threatens to steal the show at every turn.  If you haven't discovered what an absolutely wonderful drummer Bill Higgins was on Charles Lloyd's last few CDs, check him out here as he shows that even as a relatively young man he knew how to let you marvel at his talent and yet throw the spotlight on other players.  Anchoring all these is the steady and solid upright bass playing of Butch Warren.  Bass playing is often an unheralded role in any ensemble and in the presence of fantastic fellow band members it must be tempting to play at a level of just \\"good enough\\".  There is no \\"good enough\\" effort with Warren here.  Instead Warren rolls, rises and dives in tandem with Higgins with a sensitive ear toward Gordon and Smith.<br /><br />Even the two \\"ballads\\", \\"I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\" and \\"Where Are You\\", are taken at a clip that is just under the excitement of the four faster pieces mentioned above.  The melancholy normally associated with these songs gives way to a cool and confident reading that only slows down the pace of the album a bit.  \\"Where Are You\\" is a song I typically associate with Frank Sinatra and if I'm not missing my guess Gordon is taking his reading from Sinatra himself.  In both versions the actual music resembles more the lilting, gliding motion of a feather drifting through the air.  It is only in the very lyrics themselves the hearer perceives the broken glass of dashing hopes.  Gordon's playing shakes the song's normal mood from its sadness and pumps it up into a vehicle of high altitude grace.<br /><br />Finally, this is an outstanding recording sonically.

The melancholy normally associated with these songs gives way to a cool and confident reading that only slows down the pace of the album a bit.  \\"Where Are You\\" is a song I typically associate with Frank Sinatra and if I'm not missing my guess Gordon is taking his reading from Sinatra himself.  In both versions the actual music resembles more the lilting, gliding motion of a feather drifting through the air.  It is only in the very lyrics themselves the hearer perceives the broken glass of dashing hopes.  Gordon's playing shakes the song's normal mood from its sadness and pumps it up into a vehicle of high altitude grace. <br /> <br />Finally, this is an outstanding recording sonically.

B0006IUDXA|5.0|Good ol' Mac was my hero...just like my dad.  They have something in common; they can fix anything, with a little household stuff and some ingenuity.  I once got myself back into my house from the back door, with a paperclip, thanks to an idea I got from MacGyver! May he live forever on DVD!
B00001OH80|2.0|David Bowie got lazy with his follow-up to 1983's smash album \\"Let's Dance.\\"  I remember as a teenager being excited about FINALLY getting a new Bowie album - only to be disappointed. <br /> <br />Bowie relies heavily on covers for this entire album. My original opnion has not changed in questioning why the album was divided as all slower tunes on side 1 with the upbeat material on side 2. <br /> <br />Everything is not bad here; it just lacks \\"that certain something\\" that the powerful Bowie albums deliver. His rendition of The Beach Boys' \\"God Only Knows\\" is gorgeous with David showing off his strong baritone voice. There's great pop appeal to the energy in \\"Blue Jean\\" and I get a guilty pleasure out of  the goofy \\"Dancing with the Big Boys,\\" but the touted duet with Tina Turner on the title track is ruined by poor production choices. Turner is barely audible and the mix makes her sound like a background singer.  The 1985 live version the duo did in Birmingham, England had the song (and Turner!) shine; it showed what the song could do. \\"Loving the Alien\\" is hauntingly memorable but most of the rest of tracks are, at best, lame and forgettable.   <br /> <br />\\"Tonight\\" - Not quite the turd of Bowie's fine recording catalog that \\"Never Let Me Down\\" is, but it's not too far off.
B000002GFC|5.0|i have not personally listened to this cd so i cannot attest to it's sound quality.  some say it's good and others say not so it must be all in the individual ear. i have however heard 85% of the songs included in this compilation.  for anyone not familiar with cream i'd say it's a good intro to the band for the reason that it includes most of my favorites.  but the most important aspect of a cd such as this is for people to hear bands who start out with a mission like eric clapton.  he after all these years has had staying power because of his singing, and writing talent and ear for excellent musicianship( he's an inspirational soloist and master of the lead in many musicians eyes).   and musically, eric has been searching all of his life but one thing has remained a constant in his search and evident - that being his love and committment to the blues.  maybe you'll find yourself wanting to listen to the blues because of eric's recorded love of the blues.  this cd would have accomplished your intro to the blues.  i think you'll agree his blues mission shows in this particular collection.  and if you can't hear eric singing the blues above bassist jack bruce then in listening to jack bruce you can almost hear eric.  their voices appear to be almost interchangeable.   jack bruce is one of my all time favorite singers and if you can't hear it in \\"born under a bad sign\\" or \\"deserted cities of the heart\\" then maybe you'll hear him in \\"white room\\" which i heard him say was his favorite of all the songs he has recorded.  or maybe the next time he's in town, you might go see him or eric because you've heard this cd.  or possibly you'll want to hear more of ginger baker.  what i'm trying to say is buy this cd as a good beginning to someone who constantly strived(s) for perfection and then maybe you'll find yourself wanting to hear all the other cds he has been a part of because eric clapton and all of the talent he has played and recorded with over the years is mesmerizing.so is his committment to the blues.
B000006TZ8|4.0|After the release of their disappointing sophomore effort \\"This Is the Modern World\\", The Jam bounced back in a major way a year later with this razor sharp collection of pop-punk gems. Weller, while still in his early-twenties at the time, ably demonstrates his growth as a songwriter, lyricist, and guitarist on this album. Perhaps their strongest set of songs.
B00006RCNW|5.0|It is great so see such great tv at my own pace. I also have volume two and I am on the list for Feb. release of volume three. <br />I wish I could give more than 5 stars!
B000006045|5.0|I won't waste time repeating what others have said about this album. I discovered this record in 2001 and I couldn't believe what I had been missing for 3 years. This is just one of those CD's that just opened my eyes and made me look at music differently.     This album is dark, intense, intelligent, and original. It is art.
B00049QQHI|4.0|I reallllllly can't stand Leonardo he couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. Time and again I found myself being forced to watch the trite turned out by this no talent,but now I can say this guy has something or had something this is an earlier film before he blew up into the hollywood monstrosity. This one and only this one is worth seeing,But that may have more to do with the story direction and script than Leo.Good Flick!
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Starring George C. Scott (Gen. George S. Patton) and Karl Malden (Gen. Omar Bradley), this impeccable war movie describes the impact that General George Patton had on the U.S. Army after 1943.  Following the disaster at Kasserine Pass, in which American armor and strategly was thoroughly outclassed by the Germans, the Americans realized that a new commander was needed to command their armored units.  Patton was chosen, and his impact was felt immediately by the Germans, and he didn't let up until he was relieved by General Eisenhower. <br /> <br />From 1943 until the surrender of Germany in May, 1945, Patton and his vaunted 3rd Army group harassed the Germans from Sicily to France.  He is responsible for driving his group one hundred miles in two days to rescue the trapped 101st airborne troops who were surrounded at Bastogne, and he led his troops on a brilliant drive through France and into Germany itself. <br /> <br />This film does an excellent job of portraying the flamboyant Patton.  His numerous run-ins with his rival British General Montgomery are well-portrayed, and his battles with the press and his American superiors are explained in great detail, as well.  Perhaps the defining scene of the movie is when Patton is visiting a field hospital and he encounters an American private who is suffering from battle fatigue.  Patton slaps the soldier across the face and has him removed from the hospital and sent directly back to the front.  Word of this action eventually got back to Eisenhower, and Patton was made to apologize to the soldier and his entire Army.  This event followed Patton for the rest of his career. <br /> <br />George C. Scott and Karl Malden give excellent performances in their roles as Patton and Bradley.  Scott's portrayal won him an academy award for best actor, while Malden's portrayal of Bradley, the \\"soldier's soldier\\", is the perfect antithesis to Scott's fiery portrayal as Patton.  The evolution of the friendship and mutual respect that developed between Patton and Bradley is handled extremely well, also.   <br /> <br />This is one of the greatest war movies I've seen.  Scott's acting is impeccable, and the historical accuracy, right down to Patton's ivory-handled pistols and his intense hatred for not only the Germans, but the Russians as well, is told with a remarkable flair that will keep the viewer glued to their screen.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how one man personally changed the course of the war against the Germans.
6305428387|5.0|This is one of my favourite movies that I have seen. The people in the movie are very hilarious. The characters are all very funny, especially Sanka Coffey. It is fun simply because it is full of Jamaican accents. No matter how many times I see this movie, this movie will still be very funny. If you have never seen this movie before, you should see it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have all of Green Day's albums and I must say this is definitely the best one. I've grown up with them, back when Dookie came out, I identified with the lyrics and feelings and angst. Now with American Idiot it's the exact same thing!
B0000844IT|1.0|Before you read this review, of course I give this movie five stars. I am putting down one star here for a reason. Fox and Miramax are notorious for the double dipping. They release a movie, and then four months to a year later, they release a \\"special edition\\" with extra bells and whistles, leaving hard core film fans having to spend additional funds on the film they love.<br /><br />When it comes to the double dip, Anchor Bay puts them to shame. For instance, there is their five different releases of the original \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", and three releases of \\"Day of the Dead\\".<br /><br />With \\"Army of Darkness,\\" first they had a theatrical version of the film released on DVD. Next, they came out with a \\"limited edition\\" release of \\"Army of Darkness\\" packaged with both the theatrical version and the Director's Cut. Third, they release the \\"Army of Darkness\\" DVD with a new cover, not bothering to put on the case which version of the film was contained within. Fourth, they release the \\"all new 'Army of Darkness: Special Edition' with new commentary,\\" which turned out to be the exact same as the \\"limited edition\\" version. Fifth, we got the \\"Army of Darkness: Director's Cut\\" boasting new scenes, when, in fact, it was the exact same as theDirector's Cuts in the previous releases. Sixth, we got the \\"Bruce Campbell vs. The Army of Darkness (The Official Bootleg Edition)\\", which was the exact same as the previous four director's cut releases.<br /><br />Now, we get the Seventh release, the \\"Army of Darkness (Boomstick Edition)\\" which is no different from any of the other editions. I think somewhere along the way, they added THX sound to the DVD, but for the life of me I can't tell you which version that was. The sad thing is, I (almost) enjoy the regular version of this film a little better. In the extended version some of the cuts are worse, the final battle goes on a little too long, dialogue is changed, and all of the aditional scenes are on bad film and look horribly out of place. Still, the new ending and the windmill sequince are still far better scenes in the \\"director's cut.\\"  Then again, I really do enjoy the ending in the theatrical version, just because we get to see Ted Raimi working in S-mart.ew ending and the windmill sequince are still far better scenes in the \\"director's cut.\\"  Then again, I really do enjoy the ending in the theatrical version, just because we get to see Ted Raimi working in S-mart.
B00003CXI0|5.0|What a sensational family movie!  Daniel Radcliffe stars as Harry, a rather pitiful orphan, who lives with his mean aunt and uncle. On his 11th birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard and happily leaves home for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  There, he makes his first-ever pals - classmates Ron and Hermione, and their friendship is the heart of the story. We follow the trio as they go through their first year at school attending magic classes, finding adventure, and even solving a mystery that puts Harry face-to-face with the dark wizard who killed his parents.<br /><br />Radcliffe captures the innocence and sadness of Harry, as well as his daring-do and sense of fun. Rupert Grint, as his sidekick Ron, delivers most of the comedy lines and is very appealing. Emma Watson plays Hermione with a heart of gold underneath her bookish bossiness. They are supported by a stellar cast, including Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman. There is lots of action, fun special effects, and some sweet, poignant moments as well.<br /><br />All ages can enjoy this movie, even if you haven't read the book. It's wholesome family entertainment that will leave you feeling good and looking forward to the next film in the series.<br /><br />Kona
B00006AG5N|5.0|It is great to have so many of my favorite Elvis songs on one cd. The only exception is \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" is not on here, but still a good album none the less.
B000002MNR|4.0|If you're a fan, buy the individual soundtracks. A lot of great tunes are left off of this one. On the other hand, if you're just checking Knopfler out for the first time or so, you should check out the albums under his name first. My favorites are Sailing to Philidelphia and Shangri-la. Also, you may like the Dire Strait's albums better than the soundtracks. My favorites of those are Dire Straits and On Every Street, the first and last of the bands studio efforts. Along with those, look up the album he did with Chet Atkins and the one with the Notting Hillbillies. Then, if you still like this music, check out the soundtracks, but don't buy this disc. I you are still interested after all of those albums, you deserve the individual soundtracks. You probably like every track on those productions, but I made several long mixes of the tracks that I like from those albums.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I absolutly adore this cd. Even though the songs are repeats from other cds, it is still great to be able to have most of their number one songs on one cd. It has so many great Beatles songs you couldn't ask for more.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Absolutly amazing! Volta has so much talent in the music they produce because it means something to each and every band member, and at the same time, can relate to people like you and I. I recomeend this to anyone no matter what form of music you like.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Ready for an album unlike any you've never heard...Then pick up this bad boy. This album is for those of you that appreciate the bands out there that are breaking new ground and paving the way for an era of music that will not soon be forgotten.  Cedric's new vocal stylings will leave you in a pile of euphoric mush...begging for more! Buy this album and you won't regret it.
0060574216|4.0|He really puts things into simple terms, he makes it so you understand and really grasp what he's trying to point out. I liked the book so much I made my boyfriend read it, and now we have a new appreciation for eachother, and when we dont seem to have things under control in certain situations, I just tell him to remember one part in the book and we talk about it like the author explains. I really recommend this book, even for teenage relationships - most books base it on &quot;marrage&quot; or many years of being with one person.
B00025ETIW|3.0|Sure, MCR makes fine music, but people saying this is 'New Music' is wrong. There are many a band that make similar music, but ten times better. Don't get me wrong, MCR is good, but there's better out there. <br /> <br />Try: Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, Bright Eyes, etc.
0425188809|5.0|Im a teenage girl, and I've read this book more than once. I think that this book is amazing and the journey that Dean Koontz takes you through in the plot is so sudden and you never really expect it. I liked the way he would switch back and fourth between the two sub plots, and how in the end it all came together perfectly. Im a sucker for puppies, so this book made my day.
B000002UZ1|5.0|This is one brilliant collection of songs from The Beatles in there later days. If you are a Beatles lover, this 2 disc box set is a must buy. It features some of the best hits of the Beatles, and also contains a few of their lesser known tracks that never got the praise that they deserved. There are no weak songs in this album and belongs in any rock n' roll lover's collection.<br /><br />Best Songs:<br /><br />Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds: A fabulous psychedelic track that is known and loved by all Beatles fans.<br /><br />Come Together: A huge hit off the album \\"Abbey Road\\", this track has a classic bass riff.<br /><br />While My Guitar Gently Weeps: A beautiful rock song, with a wonderful guitar melody. It has been covered by bands like the White Stripes and The Jeff Healey Band. An all time classic hit.<br /><br />Here Comes the Sun: A George Harrison classic with a magnificent guitar tune and compelling lyrics.<br /><br />I am the Walrus: The best song lyrically ever written by The Beatles. The song writing here is sensational.<br /><br />A Day in the life: My favourite Beatles song of all time. I can't get enough of this track. It has a glorious piano intro into a beautiful ballad, and then it eventually turns into a quick moving song and back again to the original sound. Wonderful.<br /><br />Overall, you can't go wrong with having all the best hits on 2 Discs, unlesss you own the majority of their studio albums.This is wonderfully compiled and is a great buy for someone knew to the Beatles' music.
6302914191|3.0|Please let me know-- crowescooter@aol.com--  if this has all episodes 1-29.  and is the pilot a must have to episode 1-29.      I remember watch'g the TV series ,I kick my self for not tape'g it.  LOL
B00000IN5G|2.0|More like 2 1/2 stars.  I had high expectations for Children of Bodom after reading all the 5 star reviews, but this album is a letdown.  Yeah, the musicianship is spectacular, technically speaking, with the guitar work being a real highlight and very good drumming too.  But there's just no drive or power to the music, it's very thin and slicing instead of gut pounding.  The keyboards are annoying and don't add any atmosphere.  The singer's black metal vocals are incredible, I just wish he would stick to them instead of alternating with this embarassing half-ass would-be death growl that sounds more like a cartoon monster voice.  There's also a lot less darkness than their image leads you to expect.  Overall they seem more like a heavier version of Stratovarius than any death or black metal band.  I'll pass on their other albums.
B00006GFAB|3.0|I love KISS, but Universal (KISS's old parent record label) is just issuing as many compilations as possible. Check out the number of comps in the '20th Century Masters' Series. Decent compilation of songs, nothing groundbreaking.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I got this C.D A couple of months ago not too long after it came out. I already knew I would love it! This a awesome greatest hits album. I do have to admit that it is kind of soon for  Britney to be releasing a Greatest Hits album but, I still love it! This album has 14 of Britney's biggest hits Even though some of her hits did not make it on to this album like Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know & Her Remake Of I Love Rock & Roll. Plus this album has 3 previously unrealesed songs also including her new hit & remake of Bobby Brown's My Prerogative.This album also comes with a great booklet full of amazing,rare & sexy pictures and bonus disc with 5 amazing Remixes! You also get to here Britney Sing with one of her friends who has written some of her songs,Pharrell Williams from N.E.R.D. They sing together on Boys The Co Ed Remix which Pharrell Wrote. Britney has definately grown up a lot since she first came out in 1998 & you can tell when you listen to all of her songs how her music has changed. Britney is definately a great artist with talent regardless of what any one says. If you are a Britney Spears fan or enjoy her music then you got to check out her Greatest Hits:My Prerogative Album it is great collection of Britney's Music history. Don't miss out! If you listen to this album & enjoy it then I recommend to you: Britney Spears Greatest Hits:My Prerogative DVD,The Best Of Mandy Moore CD & DVD.
B000002BBY|5.0|It was just one of those odd moments. A beautiful day, and I was walking down the street listening to this album for the first time on my CD player, when I heard them sing: \\"Another sunny afternoon / walkin' to the sound of my favorite tune...\\" - and, in that final multiplication of weirdness, that song, Morning Glory, did soon after become one of my favorites as I fell hard for this incredible album. <br /> <br />(What's the Story) Morning Glory? is an expression of raw musical talent. The songs are loud, direct and unapologetic; the lyrics are ambiguous, but sung with real feeling. The tone shifts from the sunny Hey Now! and hard-driving, almost fierce Morning Glory to the more introspective Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova, but even in its introspection, (What's the Story) is loud, direct and unapologetic. She's Electric, the only comical song (and pretty darn funny too), somehow doesn't break the mood. <br /> <br />Wonderwall, of course, is - Wonderwall. You could buy the album just for that song alone. When I think about it, though, I sometimes forget Wonderwall is even on here, the same way the rest of Talking Heads' Remain in Light shines seperately from Once in a Lifetime. Wonderwall in (What's the Story) is like the star on top of a Christmas Tree. <br /> <br />It's hard to compare Oasis with any other band from their era - at least, any other good one. Blur was more cerebral and affected, Suede was more sensual, and Morrissey's solo career was in transition. Whether or not Oasis was _better_ than any of those acts is a matter of opinion, but their broad appeal certainly doesn't make them any worse, either. Personally I think they had something many of those other acts lacked, a kind of sincerity. There's something about that old-fashioned brand of rock - songs that just wear well, that bear listening over and over, chorus after ecstatic chorus. <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|4.0|Let's step back, put aside the religious debate for a second, and acknowledge that \\"Passion of the Christ\\" is a milestone in mainstream cinema. <br /> <br />I sat down with \\"Passion\\" ready to sneer, laugh, and belittle. Granted, when the credits rolled I was laughing, but not for the reason you think. <br /> <br />Think about it! <br /> <br />What director and actor Mel Gibson (\\"Braveheart\\") has done is nothing short of mesmerizing and laudable: he has pulled together what amounts to a TWO HOUR snuff film involving no less than Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Mystery made Flesh, the King of Kings, Emmanuel, meaning \\"God is with Us\\". <br /> <br />Think about that for a second. I'll be here when you get back. Seriously, it takes wee kegs of steel to make a snuff film with JC. <br /> <br />Awright, for those who don't know, \\"Passion\\" is all about the final 12 hours of JC, referred to as the \\"Stations of the Cross\\" by Catholics: we follow Jesus from Gethsemane, where he's praying (wait...he's God...who is he praying to? I'm confused...nah, never mind) all the way to Golgotha, and on the way JC does a whole heap of dying.  <br /> <br />I'm not kidding. That's what the film is about. Now, I know a ton of Christians---including Mel---who will argue until they're blue in the face that this is about Christ's suffering, and what He did for us. And yeah, for sure, it's about his suffering, alright. But that doesn't quite grasp the nature of the beast, if you'll allow me the license. <br /> <br />It's not about the message of Christ. It's not about belief. It's not about miracles, or God, or mercy---it's about a 1st century AD Jew being folded, spindled, and mutilated by the Romans and their Jewish subjects---and when they get done folding, spindling, and mutiliating him, mind ya, they're just getting going.  <br /> <br />You've got beating, gouging, flaying alive, flesh ripping, spear-thrusting, thorn of crowns head ripping! And to top it off, when the blood can't run any thicker or redder, the Romans get bored and nail JC to the cross. Sissies. <br /> <br />Now, I'm an action guy, so this is where \\"Passion\\" lost a star. I got tired of the sissy Romans and Pharisees picking on Jesus. After a while, you think---if there is a God, a *just* God, he would give his Son full permission to jump down off the Cross and do a little \\"Raiders of the Last Arc\\" number on his executioners. But no, doesn't happen, no spoiler here---we don't get a happy ending; JC believed in peace, which is why I ain't a Christian.  <br /> <br />What we *do* get, though, is gore. Oh, and gorgeous cinematography by Caleb Deschanel (who did the camera-work for \\"Being There\\" and \\"The Patriot\\", among many other flicks), solid acting by all the players (James Caviezel as JC made me actually *want* to believe), including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, the whore. That was a stretch for her, I'm sure. Oh, and we get Latin and Aramaic as the *only* languages available (don't worry morons, subtitles). Sweet. <br /> <br />In the end, twisted, unwashed, heathen, stinking unbeliever that I am, I sorta enjoyed \\"Passion of the Christ\\". I'm big into gore: I love splatter, love the sicko films of H.G. Lewis, love the Japanese gore \\"Guinea Pig\\" flicks, you name it. Basically, this was a snuff/gore/splatter flick with the Son of God as its subject, which, again---well, that's pretty ballsy, Mr. Gibson! <br /> <br />We don't get the Resurrection (think of the Special Effects on that one, baby!). We don't get any sex scenes, which at least Martin Scorcese threw into his JC film. We also don't get any cool battle scenes, but I guess that's to be expected (someone---Ah-nold, mebbe? or Stallone?---should have shown up to rescue Jesus). Anyway, this film is like life: raw, brutal, nasty, pathetic, ultimately pointless. But it's still worth checking out, cochise, if only to see how a true Man (JC) faces death. You'd whine and cry like a baby. He didn't. Street creds, man. <br /> <br />It also helped that I saw \\"Passion\\" as a double feature with \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" (2004 remake). Seeing the one after the other made it seem like, you know, a sequel. We didn't get the Resurrection, but Christ *does* rise from the Dead, and so by the time 2004 rolled around, everyone was infected. In that light, JC was the O.Z. (Original Zombie).  <br /> <br />Peace out, dawgz. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />A whole unfocused and reeks of taking the easy road to success once again.  <br />They didn't realize that most of U2 fans did not approve of what they did on \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" - because of that album sales - so they did the whole same cocktail for this garbage. This album had tons of hype before its release. But I don't think it lived up to any of it. The songwriting skill exhibited on this album is nothing compared to U2's past. This songwriting is just terrible. <br /> <br />For worse, Bono's awful singing is truly untolerable ( listen to the pitiful track 3 at 3:18-4:36; the annoying track 4 at 2:37-2:46 and 3:01-3:13; the crappy track 6 at 2:12-3:16; the WHOLE filler track 7; track 8 at 3:45-4:01; the awful track 10 at 1:17-1:28, 2:46-3:50; and the lame track 11 at every time that Bono sings the word 'Yahweh' ). <br /> <br />This mainstream album is more than not (ab)used as a quick means of fulfilling contractual obligations, or padding the record label's fourth-quarter budget. Sometimes it's better to be thought of as a washed out band than to release a crappy album and remove all doubt. At times, this bulls**t sounds like a band in their studio singing out whatever comes to mind - 'Vertigo' for example, and just banging on instruments randomly, repeating the same kind of songs that they used in \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\". I guess they were too busy pretending to be 'the biggest band in the world' and all that silly hype. <br /> <br />PLEASE U2 RETIRE NOW ! We don't want any unnecessary 'Vertigo Tour DVD' nor another \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" re-issue. You're disgracing your glory past ( 1980-1998 ). Thank You <br />
B000063JDE|5.0|In a world of plummeting standards, mindless violence, and gratuitous sex, it's refreshing---and entirely rare---when you come across a major motion picture that the whole family can enjoy.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for that kind of film, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is the mother lode.  <br /> <br />\\"Blue Velvet\\" is David Lynch's masterwork, a real slice of life in small town America from the director who brought you the heartwarming, mesmerizing Disney hit \\"The Straight Story\\". Granted, for all of its heartwarming innocence, \\"The Straight Story\\" had a more deliberate tone which---to be totally honest---put little Tony and Suzie to sleep at my house. What to watch for a family sit-down that will keep the kids entertained but not drive Mom and Dad crazy, then? <br /> <br />Crisis averted! \\"Blue Velvet\\" is just as family-oriented as that film---only more so, and with a quicker pace that calls to mind a more finely-tuned Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mystery.  <br /> <br />High school senior Jeffrey Beaumont (the boyish, wholesome Kyle MacLachlan, who starred in the family flick \\"The Flintstones\\") lives with his parents and elderly Aunt Barbara (veteran actress Frances Bay, who appeared in \\"Twins\\"). With his father hospitalized after a massive heart attack, Beaumont stumbles across a mystery at the heart of sleepy little Lumberton. <br /> <br />Beaumont teams up with high school sweatheart Sandy Williams (Laura Dern, \\"Jurassic Park\\") and Sandy's father---a Lumberton detective---to delve into the mystery that has their little town on edge, and ultimately to snap the cuffs on a gang of dastardly baddies (headed up by Dennis Hopper in a stellar role as the villainous Frank Booth).  <br /> <br />Isabella Rossellini serves up a particularly memorable role as singer Dorothy Valens, menaced by Booth and his rowdies, who manages to keep up a fighting spirit and lift everyone's spirits with cheerful, all-American musical standards. Grandpa and AMC-fans will particularly get a kick out the film's 1950's musical score, including golden oldies like Roy Orbison's \\"In Dreams\\" and Bobby Vinton's yesteryear hit \\"Blue Velvet\\". <br /> <br />Flawless cinematography by Frederick Elmes (who did the camera-work for 2003's \\"Hulk\\") shows off the green gables, rose gardens, and white picket fences of an all-American town to perfection. I don't think any director has realized the zany human cosmology of a small American town since Sam Wood's 1949 version of \\"Our Town\\". <br /> <br />While \\"Blue Velvet\\" heads over to the seamier side of town to plumb the more mysterious goings-on, don't fret---Lynch keeps rein over the more frightening elements of this salute to the Heartland. Like any Hardy Boys outting, things may get a little tense, but there's nothing too rough for the tots here, and good wins out in the end. Lynch proves you can put together an American classic and *still* have a happy ending.  <br /> <br />\\"Blue Velvet\\" is a classic made for the whole family: like \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Finding Nemo\\", it's certain to be a favorite in your house. Be sure to watch your kiddies, and savor the gleams in their eyes as the mysteries of life become clear. <br />
B00068IOWC|1.0|<br />A whole unfocused and reeks of taking the easy road to success once again.  <br />They didn't realize that most of U2 fans did not approve of what they did on \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" - because of that album sales - so they did the whole same cocktail for this garbage. This album had tons of hype before its release. But I don't think it lived up to any of it. The songwriting skill exhibited on this album is nothing compared to U2's past. This songwriting is just terrible. <br /> <br />For worse, Bono's awful singing is truly untolerable ( listen to the pitiful track 3 at 3:18-4:36; the annoying track 4 at 2:37-2:46 and 3:01-3:13; the crappy track 6 at 2:12-3:16; the WHOLE filler track 7; track 8 at 3:45-4:01; the awful track 10 at 1:17-1:28, 2:46-3:50; and the lame track 11 at every time that Bono sings the word 'Yahweh' ). <br /> <br />This mainstream album is more than not (ab)used as a quick means of fulfilling contractual obligations, or padding the record label's fourth-quarter budget. Sometimes it's better to be thought of as a washed out band than to release a crappy album and remove all doubt. At times, this bulls**t sounds like a band in their studio singing out whatever comes to mind - 'Vertigo' for example, and just banging on instruments randomly, repeating the same kind of songs that they used in \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\". I guess they were too busy pretending to be 'the biggest band in the world' and all that silly hype. <br /> <br />PLEASE U2 RETIRE NOW ! We don't want any unnecessary 'Vertigo Tour DVD' nor another \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" re-issue. You're disgracing your glory past ( 1980-1998 ). Thank You <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JKNF|1.0|Just Death.  <br /> <br />I went into this expecting mystery, atmosphere, surreptious class warfare, guerrillas manning the barricades between Upstairs and Downstairs---something to enthrall while I immersed myself in the rich, ribald atmosphere of Edwardian England.  <br /> <br />You know what I got? Sheer, ruthless boredom.  <br /> <br />This is perhaps the stupidest, most pretentious, most godawful piece of rubbish every vomited out by director Robert Altman, who once upon a time could work a camera (when you need to pay rent, you better be good), but now realizes that his white, middle-class liberal audience would happily eat a turd if he offered it to them on a silver platter, handsomely mounted.  <br /> <br />Altman makes a point of criticizing George W. Bush. But at least, in the field he's in, Bush delivers to his audience. Altman throws talented actors like Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith, and Michael Gambon---and a lotta gorgeous English scenery, including a stately manor home, all of whom/which deserve better---into a cinematic blender, and his \\"puree\\". <br /> <br />\\"Gosford Park\\" is \\"Clue\\" for middle class, pretentious, bourgeois morons. Now hit the \\"unhelpful\\" button and go watch it again. <br /> <br />
B000001EAQ|5.0|<br />We all feel alienated by society/technology/lovers/family. This album really captured a certain feeling at the time. It may have not been universal, but the fact that it may have not been universal makes it more important, as it might enlighten some that some people are not thrilled by instant gratification or instant information.  <br /> <br />I'm just annoyed by the people and critics who gave it a harsh review on many web sites because it seems more people actually like 'All That You Can't Leave Behind' and all that overhyped s**t. Then they mock people for thinking they are cool for listening to U2. Morons. These are probably the same type of people that buy any type of mainstream successful music because its just that. They think they are so \\"cool\\" for buying into that. Good for you. I bet the same sellout U2 2000 you love are laughing at your sorry ass all the way to the bank. <br /> <br />Pop has a rich, multilayered texture of sounds, awesome lyrics, and innovative play with instruments. All in all a ground-breaking CD. Pop is an album that resists categorising, is intentionally uneasy and non-listener-firendly, has no standard verse/chorus/verse formula, and is remarkable for its originality of form. This lack of traditional structure means the album never loses its impact or grows tired. It's one of only a handful of albums I honestly never get sick of listening to. No CD collection should be without this album, it truly is that great. <br /> <br />A definitive masterpiece, this gem is just is haughtingly beautiful, and bombastic at the same time, and imaginative beyond description. <br /> <br /> <br />

B0006399FS|1.0|Another Horrible CD from this greedy, self absorbed corporation. <br />I don't know how the hell this sellout band pretend to be 'U2'. These men are hung up on making money.  <br /> <br />Extremely unoriginal and worthless, this is the poorest excuse for an album they've ever made. The lyrics are horrible, the songs all sound the same and Bono sings like s**t, he strains his extremely rough crappy voice, really annoying. You will be sick of this album by the end of the painfuly repetitive Ipod Anthem 'Vertigo'. All of these 11 commercial songs are lame and tiring to listen to. Just listen to those awful 'doo doo doo' at the end of 'Original Of The Species' - the most annoying U2 song ever. This sellout band has tarnished their legacy on this worthless effort... it really shames me that a great band that wrote the songs they did in the 80s/90s have turned into this. <br /> <br />It doesn't matter what it sounds like. Just slap your name on it and sell millions of copies. U2 has proved it is that easy.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMYI|1.0|It's strange to see how other people thought this move was hilarious when I considered it a waste of time (and rental fee) to watch.  I'd watch Will Farrell in Elf or on SNL and laugh out loud but this movie just didn't strike me as funny.  To each their own I guess.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|You may take my review's headline any way you care to.<br /><br />I think I would have liked this movie better had I not been put off by an opening text, not to mention ambient music provided by a wailing woman, that should give the producers of \\"Gladiator\\" grounds for copyright infringement.  I won't go so far as to call this a rip-off -- I have too much respect for Wolfgang Petersen -- but studio execs do prefer repetition to innovation. At least this is a genre that deserves a rebirth.  (So when are Steven Pressfield's \\"Gates Of Fire\\" and \\"Tides Of War\\" going to make it to the silver screen?)<br /><br />The casting of Brad Pitt as Achilles may have put the derrieres of young women in the seats of theaters, but he still comes across more as a male model who practices Pilates than a great -- in fact, the greatest -- warrior of Greece.  In his opening scene, it was hard to distinguish his fluid figure from those of the women he was sleeping with.  The Thessalonikan champion was a hoot -- I had no idea franchises of Gold's Gym, not to mention anabolic steroids, were available in ancient times.  (Again, in comparison, the undefeated champ that Maximus faces in Gladiator is much more believable -- big, muscular, and paunchy, a la George Foreman.  And he has been retired for five years, undoubtedly to start his own brand of indoor grills.)<br /><br />Orlando Bloom was a perfect choice for the love-struck Paris.  His youthful demeanor lends inself to adolescent impetuousness; his brother Hector (the actor's name has just flown out of my head) at least sports a beard and a believable British accent; my money would have been on him to kick the living daylights out of Brad's way-too-pretty-for-a-warrior, uh, warrior.  Not to harp, but Pitt might have been better cast as Helen; even to a dedicated heterosexual (me), he impresses as being more beautiful and ladylike than the  actress' face (again, memory fails me as to her name)that might have caused a trailer-park redneck, armed with chewing tobacco and a shotgun, to launch his bass boat, but not, in my book, a thousand warships.  Besides, everybody's in near-drag right out of the chute.<br /><br />O'Toole is at his understated best (\\"I'm not a Trojan king, I'm a movie star!\\"), and Cox, who brings a leonine fierceness to Agamemnon is very well cast, although Sean Connery in \\"Time Bandits\\" was a more avuncular fellow.<br /><br />The cliche of the rebellious hero (\\"Hey Mav, we're goin' BALLISTIC!\\") is a tiresome theme in American cinema.  Even Kevin Costner's Elliot Ness in \\"The Untouchables\\" doesn't become a real hero until he commits murder (re: Frank Nitty on the rooftop).  And Achilles' motivation -- to be remembered in history -- again, the talk of \\"eternity\\" sounds hollow next to that of Russel Crowe's Maximus, who, like E.T., really only wants to go home -- makes him a vainglorious simp who would have been more convincing as a member of Ben Stiller's Viper team in Dodgeball.<br /><br />Still, overall, this is an entertaining flick.  As an afficionado of the history of ancient warfare (and, yes, I've read Herodotus in ancient, Ionian Greek, thank you), it's pure fun for me to root for everybody in sword-wielding, arrow- and spear slinging mayhem; war, after all brings out the best, as well as the worst, in humanity.

B00005U122|5.0|This is an excellent video. The excitement and power came shining through loud and clear. Roger certainly has assembled a top notch band of musicians for this performance. I felt the same way about \\"The Wall-Live in Berlin,\\" which has left me with the opinion that Roger was without a doubt the driving force behind the great ensemble that we know as Pink Floyd. I have written a review of David Gilmour's live video and there is simply no comparison as David came across as very dull and boring, there wasn't a trace of enthusiasm in his video whereas Roger breathes new life into this material with every ensemble I have seen him perform with. Breathe deep.............and enjoy a thoroughly entertaining video.......but remember to just breathe deep or else this video has the potential to take your breath away. It had me riveted to my seat the entire time, excellent work!
B0006GAI6O|5.0|Glad I never saw the earlier version of this movie and have no bias in comparison. This is a excellent movie with middle age stars!  It makes me want to dance and live. If you want to escape the cheap thrills of Hollywood and see a movie about real people, this is the movie for you.  It is refreshing to see a movie where the characters are actually good people for a change, instead of twisted souls going through predictable mid-life crisis.  I am tired of all the men flicks about their self absorbed mid-life crisis.  This one, however, is actually good. Why do men think their mid-life crisis is of interest to the rest of us?  Would anyone want to see a movie about the perils of menopause?  At least it would be a fresh idea.  Buy this movie and watch it with the love of your life.  Then, go dancing together and let it lead you to each other.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|No offense to those who live happily in Idaho. For the first hour I couldn't exactly pinpoint what year in the 80's this movie was reflecting. With trapper keepers and caboodles and wacky t-shirts and off color matching wardrobes, I was sure it was 85 or 86. Only to come and realize near the end that Napoleon Dynamite ( every high schools nerd ) and all his friends weren't actually living in the 80's but only in Idaho and anytown that hasn't exactly progressed with the rest of America. It is a hilarious and completely unique funny film with mostly unknown actors ( which just adds to it's believability )<br /><br />and there is no profanity, no nudity or sexual references, all the humor lies within an open mouthed, eyes wide shut when speaking teenager, a shy girl, Deb who promotes herself door to door and offers to take \\"glamour like shots\\" for a discount at up to 75% off. Pedro, a simple English speaking kid who dreams of asking out the popular girl Summer and becoming school president.<br /><br />It's fresh and honest and sometimes just real for we've all been to those dances and we all remember those kids.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite is a celebration to all nerds and idiots alike...everywhere and anywhere...who ultimatley succeed in this world.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|From thedigitalbits.com:<br /><br />\\"The Dune: Extended Edition will be released in a metal snap case. 2 versions of the film will be included... the 137-minute theatrical version, and the 177-minute extended edition. BOTH will be available in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen (which would mark the first time the extended edition was available in widescreen). The theatrical edition will feature both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 audio, while the extended edition will be Dolby Digital 5.1 only. Extras will include never before seen \\"behind-the-scenes\\" footage, documentaries on the special effects, visual design and costumes, deleted scenes, original photographs and artwork from the set (newly resurrected from personal collections) and more.\\"<br /><br />This is some great news....however one question remains at the time of this writings (2/4/04).  The only version of the extended edition that has ever been available has been a 4:3 version because it was only ever aired on TV.  So the question is, will this new 2.35:1 anamorphic version be a true 2.35 image, or will it be a cropped 4:3?
B0001Z363W|5.0|Mr. Wylde comes to prove there's still more to do in rock music. <br /> <br />This album shows a more mature sound than the previous BLS, and goes back to something between the works of Zakk's friend, Axl Rose, the Old Sabbtah and Book of Shadows... By the way I think the closest Zakk ever was to find his own sound was Pride N Glory , but who knows the more I listen to BLS the more I get the idea, Im not a headbanger though, I am a bohemian, so this album is definitely my call...
0553212737|5.0|Emma by Jane Austen is truly a very enjoyable novel dealing with the upper-middle class women of the Victorian Era, and it gives us an illuminating insight on the way of life of the people of that time.  Emma is a comedy in the sense that the novel ends on a happy note with three marriages and also in the sense that it gives themes such as marriage an exaggerated importance.  Also, the novel as a whole in conceived in a spirit of irony - irony in incidents and irony in characterisation.  In the novel, Jane Austen depicts her view of people as social animals who live by a social code based on a set of moral values.  Thus, in Emma, Jane Austen shows, in a good-natured way, the disastrous consequences caused by human follies and stupidities, leading to the violation of the social code. <br />The very fact that Emma is looking for `would-be' grooms for girls she takes a fancy to is undoubtedly a trespass of the social norms existing at that time - a clear example of a folly.  Emma's other folly may be said to be her excessive pride.  Her pride leads her to dominate, and to see the lives of others as extensions of her own ego, and therefore deny the other characters their human autonomy.  Ironically, we see that she, who delights in using others, discovers that she, in turn, has been used, or more correctly, duped. <br />Emma also deals with the follies of arrogance and self-deception.  While reading the novel, we find Emma adopting what may be called a `know-all' attitude.  She is utterly self-important and presuming.  She pays no heed to Mr. Knightley's advice either with regard to Mr. Elton or with regard to Frank Churchill.  She thinks that she can successfully handle the affairs of others, and the high regard the Highbury society has for her only makes matters worse.  Hence, through the character of Emma, Austen warns against the dangers of influence and interference.  Emma, through her actions of meddling in everybody's affairs, finally achieves nothing good, and even causes harm to her own self. <br />Also, Austen gives marriage such an undue importance that the title character, in her pursuit of husbands for others, overlooks social norms existing at that time and gives more value to marriage rather than crucial human relationships.  Thus, in a comic way, Austen depicts Emma's greatest fault in breaking social norms and overlooking crucial human considerations in pursuit of petty things such as marriage. <br />Comedy also emanates from the narrator's treatment of Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates as \\"comic characters\\".  But through these characters, Austen explores another facet of human follies.  Through the character of Mr. Woodhouse, we are brought to see the negative aspects of indulgence - indulgence of the same kind that has caused harm to Emma.  And the character of Miss Bates, while depicting the pitiable state of unmarried women, acts as a kind of test for Emma's power of responding to `socially inferior' people.  Mrs. Elton is another comic character, amusing us greatly by her airs of self-importance and her social snobbery.  She has too high an opinion of her own elegance, accomplishments, and social charm that she thrusts herself upon everybody without inhibition or hesitation.  She also breaks the established social rules by calling Mr. Knightley \\"Knightley\\", not giving him his gentleman's worth.  In fact, we may say that Mrs. Elton is used to portray the very evils of Emma's character in a somewhat extreme way. <br />Hence, as we have seen, Austen deals in an intellectual way the follies and stupidities of humans.  We learn particularly through our understanding of Emma's faults, and by learning above all, how significant and fundamental these values are.  For Emma's aloof relation to others, her willingness to treat other characters as toys - these become significant betrayals of human considerations.  The social and moral universe of the novel takes a greater significance because it provides a context in which Emma's faults are not minor ones to be treated lightly, but total violations of a whole established system.  The agents of retribution in this world are Mr. Knightley and Austen herself as the narrator. <br />Thus, Austen condemns certain human foolishness such as snobbery, excessive pride and a disrespect for established moral and social values.  These are the human stupidities which are purged, through Emma's process of self-analysis and redemption.  It is only at that time that Austen makes her heroine rise above such human foolishness and stupidities to become a more moral and less petty human being.  Hence, it may be said that the novel persuades us, through a very entertaining and comic plot, the importance of self-knowledge, a true regard for self and others, and also to consider every human action as a crucial, committing act of self-definition.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This album....blew my mind. The first song i heard of it was Son Et Lumiere, and the last was Take The Veil, yeah, i listened to it straight through, twice. I have been a longtime fan of they parent band of At The Drive-In, and was relativly skeptical of The Mars Volta untill i gave them a listen. <br />I grew up with my father playing Pink Floyd on our way to wherever, and as such, i have an engrained love for them. When i listend to De-Loused in the Comatorium, i could definitly hear some at least 'Floyd-ish' trends. Not to say that the entire album is a rippoff, its not. It is its own unique style of music. As the band themselves say, they are making music for them, not us, but they are glad we like it.  <br />To recap: this album has amazing energy, great talent, and unrivaled originality. I give it the highest possible reccomendations to any and all who are willing to expand their musical horizons past the dulldrums of nomality.
B000002J1S|4.0|sheduled for the 2004 30th. anniversary of this masterpiece. today i give the album 4 stars and when it finally comes out in 5.1 surround sound i am sure i will give it 5 stars. i just brought the \\"video collection\\" by genesis, absolut fantasic remastered in 5.1. i can't wait to hear the older genesis albums in surround sound, they truely deserve the widescreen effect in sound like pink floyd and yes. bring it on genesis and get back together, i miss these guys
0380002930|5.0|This is my favorite book outside of the horror genre. It is full of social and political undertones, beautifully described, and well researched into the nature of wild rabbits.<br /><br />I tend to avoid most animal books because they usually focus around one or two animal heros that meet some tragic untimely doom and their human owner or whatever cries and buries them, etc. etc. you get my point. This book has it's share of death and tragedy but it also has it's share of triumphs and rescues. It is a saga of short lived creatures, so in rabbit terms - it's practically generational. Tragedy befalls us all at some time or another. This book deals it's blows in natural doses. It's easier to take that way.<br /><br />If you are considering reading it, please do. I don't even think of it as a childrens novel, though I supposed they could read it if they were intelligent enough to understand the underlying themes.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|i am a huge fan of Eternal Sunshine's writter, Charlie Kaufman. he has a mind unlike any other.

0316172324|4.0|This is a great book for anyone intersted in the mind, thinking, and decision making. It is not exhaustive in these areas, but entertaining and thought provoking. It is filled with interesting studies and info. that make you think and consider your ability to \\"blink.\\" If I were to rename this book, I'd call it \\"Instinct and Behavior: A Few Case Examples.\\"   I really did like the book. It made me think about my own instincts and unconscious thought and how real the hypothesis forwarded in this book may be. I am still considering it.    I did not like two particular things about the book: 1) It never really tells us how to get a hold of our unconscious thinking, i.e. to be better at it; 2) A few of the case studies seemed... not on target (i.e. they required insightful discoveries to see their applicability).   So, if you want some fun information about the mind (in the form of case studies) and our split-second decision capacity, buy it. If you want to walk away a better instinctual decision maker, with great understanding of the human psyche, don't buy it.    To fully enjoy this book, INTROSPECTIVE READING AND UNDERSTANDING IS NECESSARY. Don't like to have to think about what your reading to understand it? Run from this book.

B000002H33|4.0|First, \\"Kill 'Em All\\" introduced us to thrash/speed metal and the beginning of a great metal band. \\"Ride the Lightning\\" showed us that bands/artists improve with their sophomore effort. And now \\"Master of Puppets\\" comes, which should be hailed as the greatest metal album of all time, and as Metallica's best album. With this album, they've found the sound they've longed for. It starts with a very cool Spanish-guitar melody, then jumps into their traditional heavy metal sound. The songs \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" in my opinion are the greatest Metallica songs ever. Most people may disagree and say that this isn't Metallica's best, but we all have opinions, don't we?
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido has the most tender, expressive, understandable,  entrancing and powerful voice of any modern singer.  Didos music has true-to-life edge and her raw energy cuts through.    Dido's band are a professional, focussed, tallented   and the attention to detail shows how much they care   about their music, the emotions and the performance.    I feel comparisons to other artists unfair on Dido,  she has her own style, and vocal quality and lyric   subjects are handled uniquely.      Dido is a beatiful person and she exudes positive   energy to all, and everyone performs to their best   as a result.     Dont boggle your brain with the reviewers words...   do yourself a favour and open up to the tracks [...]    This is truly one of the best albums of all time...  And so is \\"Life for Rent\\".    Absolutely Brilliant!
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is probably their best showing balance between hard rock and excellent composition. Songs like \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" and \\"Fade to Black\\" shows how great Metallica's musical knowledge used to be. Before the death metal and poser metal of today there was a band named Metallica, and its sad that many people hear \\"St. Anger\\" and are to busy putting on black makeup going to some \\"metal\\" show in some city, never hearing about this album, and discriminate what was one of the bands that created this genre. The whole album shows hard riffs, acoustic/metal blending, and musical knowledge of the metal bands of the 80's.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Its a good way to introduce people into hard rock, but i dont recommend it to real Thrash Metal lovers out their, if your looking for an awesome thrash metal band heres a few recommendations: <br /> <br />Slipknot:Iowa <br />Devildriver:self titled <br />Kittie:Spit <br />Pissing Razors:self titled (name sounds punk, its not) <br />Bleeding through:this is love, this is murderous <br />Scars Of Tomorrow:rope tied to the trigger <br />testament:the gathering <br />Amon Amarth:Fate of norns <br /> <br />many others, check my store, i tried to make it as accurate as posible
B000002H6C|5.0|\\"...And Justice for All\\" is yet another Metallica classic, #3 on my list. The songs, like the album titled song \\"...And Justice for All\\" and \\"One,\\" are about how messed up our society is. A very powerful album with much heavy sound and anger coming from James. And yet some people complain about each songs' length. If you don't like it, you're not a Metallica fan. It may have a thin sound, but once you listen more to each song, you realize that it's just as heavy and hard sounding as their previous albums. And with the tragic loss of Cliff Burton, these guys showed that they can still kick ass and this album shows.
6304602979|5.0|Oh, what a film this would have been if Quentin Tarantino had taken the reigns of his own hard-boiled script.  That said, we take what we receive and it is an interesting viewing experience indeed.  Central to the film is the lovers-on-the-lam plotline of Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette.  Wrapped around it are a series of comic and violent vignettes featuring practically every actor in Hollywood too numerous that I forgot they were in this film.  What resonates with me are three high-tensioned stand-off scenes.  The first involves Slater and Gary Oldman as Arquette's pimp that is accentuated by pulsating rap music and the overhead lamp that Oldman swings around.  The second, which is now classic, involves Dennis Hopper who plays Slater's dad and Christopher Walken as a mob lawyer.  Let your imagination run wild.  Another involves James Gandolfini as a mob thug tussling with Arquette in a motel room.  The first time I saw this film was before \\"The Sopranos\\" entered the public vernacular.  Now that Gandolfini has a certain public persona this scene now has more resonance.  Then of course we have the Mexican stand-off at the end of the film in the hotel room that is something of a homage to John Woo.  All said, this film is a joyride from start to finish but a rewarding one at that.  Isn't that Brad Pitt playing the slacker?
B000002H33|5.0|I would rate this album as a five.  <br />The Sound. <br />Metallicas sound at this point has evolved and eveloped alot since their debut, Kil em all, but it is still good hard thrash. They go from power ballads like Sanatarium to full on fury, like Battery. They have moved into more modern thrash, with deeper and heavier sounding distortion. The solos aren't as wild as in previous albums(though there are some kickArse ones), and the drums are just to prportion with the music, especially the fills in master of puppets(the song). The bass is scarcely heard(since when have you heard the bass in bands such as slayer, anthrax an pantera?), but it is a nice surprise bass solo in Orion. The riffs are very good and catchy, and mix well with the solos. The chorus of Master of Pupets(song) wont be forgotten soon, nor will we the power of leper messiah. The songs have increased in length, but that only makes it so you dont have to repaet the song over and over again to get the full goodness of pure metal. The vocals. Well, you can never really say metal vocals are good, but James sounds the best on this album. He is most coherent(hardly any metal albums have a coherent vocalist, but hey, is that what its all about?) on this album. The lyrics are ok, but little frases like \\"chop your breakfast on a mirror\\"(Master of puppets) were kinda funny.  <br />The songs <br /> <br />Battery <br /> <br />This was one of the fastest, and it was about how you can some times lose control of yourself in a rage. <br /> <br />Master of puppets. <br /> <br />The center peice, was about a drug addiction. <br /> <br />The thing that should not be. <br /> <br />This was a slow, and calm peice, about a monster in one of HP lovecrafts books. <br /> <br />Welcome Home(sanatarium. <br /> <br />This was the power ballad, and one of my favorites, it is about patients in an insane asylum breaking out. <br /> <br />Disposable heroes <br /> <br />This was a fast song, about how the military molds you intoperfect fighting machines, then disregards you completely. <br /> <br />Leper Messiah. <br /> <br />This was a slow, but very heavy song about how religious figures can become corrupt. <br /> <br />Orion. <br /> <br />This was an instrumental peice, which had a heavy and a soft aspect to it, with a very noce and sedate riff in the middle. It gave the impression of something drifting along in space. <br /> <br />Damage inc <br /> <br />This was thte fastest, and heaviest song. It was about how gangs can become your life, and destroy you. It has the fastest solo, and always keeps you awake.
B00005JKCH|4.0|\\"Spider-Man\\" has to be viewed as the first chapter of a continuing saga.  My reaction to having seen it originally that it was okay for a first film in a continuing series but I was hankering for more.  \\"Spider-Man 2\\" filled in the blanks from the first film, therefore, this film should be seen in conjunction with the second for a more rewarding experience.  Just think about the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy before it's cycle was completed or \\"Kill Bill:Volume 1\\" before the interminable wait for \\"Volume 2\\".  That said, \\"Spider-Man\\" does a terrific job in exploring the origins of Peter Parker's evolution to the legendary web-spinner.  It's only the film's main plotline involving the Green Goblin that get's short-shrift here.  If the filmmakers were allowed to expand their work beyond the prescribed two hour time limit it's possible that this story would have been developed better.  Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man as does Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin.  It's good to see that an actor of Dafoe's calibre was chosen for this part instead of a \\"star\\".  Kudos to Dafoe for having to act wearing that ridiculous looking green armor.  Kirsten Dunst is fetching as Mary Jane Watson.  This character truly comes into her own in the second film.  James Franco broods effectively as Harry Osborn.  Indications seem to be that this is a character to look out for in future installments.  It was good to see an old hand like Cliff Robertson deliver a solid turn as Uncle Ben.  I will admit that my familiarity with Spider-Man is limited to the cartoon series from the 1960's.  For a novice like myself this was a satisfying viewing experience.
B000024D4R|5.0|Awesome, i love Pink Floyd. David Gilmours' guitar work is phenominal as always. I dont know how he can pump out the vibes he does. Roger Waters gives you that live on the edge fear nothing mentality again. Love the hidden disguises in here. Dog's, Pig's, and Sheep, they are one of who bands to take a stand to the stiffs out there and live hwo they wanna live and do what they wanna do. The best way to stick it to the \\"Corporate American Stiff's\\" is to do it in a smart way where unless you are intelligent you wont understand. Pink Floyd is a very intelligent band. They can reach parts of your soul that nothing else can.
B0000025T6|5.0|Wow.  I've been studying this album for more than a year.  I've always been a fan of Springsteen's.  But this album goes farther than just popular music.   Each song is a story that resonates with all of us.  The opening harmonica lick on \\"Nebraska\\" chills me to the bone, and the story is so well-rendered.   It just takes you back to 1950's Nebraska as you ride along with Charlie and look inside his mind for a few minutes. <br /> <br />My favorite song is \\"Highway Patrolman\\".  The way that Bruce tells the story of one brother on one side of the law and his brother on the other side...it just draws you in.  \\"Nothin' feels better than blood on blood, taking turns dancin' with Maria, as the band played 'Night of the Johnstown Flood'\\"  you can feel the desperation. <br /> <br />Bruce weaves a thread of society's dark side throughout this album. It's not pop ear-candy, its engaging storytelling.  The stark instrumentation throughout really enhances the brutal honesty of the storytelling. <br /> <br />This album has had a profound effect on me, as it has on other people judging by the other reviews.  I am fan of other singer-songwriters as well as Bruce, but this album stands alone in many ways.  Never have I heard and seen anyone get their point across as pointedly and as perfectly as what Bruce did on Nebraska.  The tracks have real blood on them, and when I listen to them I feel like I'm sitting in the room, and Bruce is telling these stories.  Its like the rest of the world is somehow irrelevant at that moment....

B00008OWZC|5.0|Well put together cd of two concert series that makes one big concert experience to the listener.  All classic stuff that rocks as only live music can.  Not essential but highly recommended to the LZ fan.
068987474X|5.0|oh what a fantastic book!  I read it from cover to cover in one evening and boy did I learn a lot. <br /> <br />I finally learnt that the guy I have held a torch for is just not into me, and I was surprised at how little it hurt me to find this out!  On the contrary, I felt relieved afterwards to just be able to walk away from him, and tear up that little valentine card I intended to send him next week. <br /> <br />But as well as showing me the excuses a guy can make when he is simply not interested in a certain woman, and taking those on board for the future, the book taught me that it works both ways.  In other words, there are so many men that I am just not into.  The chemistry is simply not there.  It doesn't make that man a bad person, or unattractive to other women.  And now, when I am pestered by men who just do not press any of my buttons, I can use the book to my own ends and not feel guilty when I don't return phone calls or emails.  No longer do I need to limp along trying to find a nice way to let a man down.  If I am just not into a man, then that is that.  C'est la vie, as they say. <br /> <br />Thank you Greg and Liz for such a wonderful book, so cleverly written. <br /> <br />Lindsay Cullen aged 49 and still learning <br />
B000002IQW|4.0|Has it really been 14 years since this heavy rock masterpiece came out? I actually first heard this epic via that god forsaken idea called a cassette. Yes kids, we used to buy new albums on crappy cassettes. Before that was vinyl records and some ancient idiocy called 8-tracks and reel-to-reel tapes. Anyway, Skid Row's second album was so surprisingly heavy metalish that it even caught my tape player offguard that wonderful day in 1991. I popped in the first song, \\"Monkey Business,\\" and within one patented Sebastian Bach scream, the tape was eaten. With a little reconstructive surgery, the tape was eventually salvaged and so was my hope for the future of rock and roll in America.  <br /> <br />Skid Row could have easily followed the fool-proof corporate path on SLAVE TO THE GRIND by writing an album's worth of friendly rewrites of \\"I Remember You\\" and \\"18 And Life,\\" but instead the New Jersey rockers (plus Canadian born lead singer/screamer/entertainer Sebastian Bach) dug deep inside themselves to unleash a 12-song lead pedal to the heavy metal masterpiece. Reportedly, Atlantic Records executives were nervous as hell about the newfound heavier direction of SLAVE TO THE GRIND at the time. When the album debuted at #1 in the country, it was obvious the original fans were happy. And so too were the most ardent of Metallica fans. The second album had that much bite to it.  <br /> <br />Opener \\"Monkey Business\\" has an Aerosmith meets Metallica groove and intensity. Following in wealthy and ripping abundance are the wicked title track \\"Slave To The Grind,\\" \\"Psycho Love\\" and \\"The Threat.\\" The band even squeezed in a few radio-hopeful bit slower tempoed songs, the best of the bunch being the peculiarly-titled \\"Quicksand Jesus,\\" but even these types of tracks were delivered in an unorthodox rocking manner, the band sprinkling in some not so subtle splashes of power. <br /> <br />Skid Row was one of the heaviest and most rocking of all the 1980s and 1990s hair metal bands. What a glorious and partying time it was. Glad I was there and sorry all you youngens missed it.
B0000C9ZSV|4.0|Lavishly packaged archive performance CD release. Twelve track disc of a gig that was recorded on May 30, 1970 during the 2nd gig,the 10pm show. Nicely done cover - actual flyer of the concert itself. Since I've never had ANY Hendrix bootlegs before anyway, I honestly believe that I was even MORE so thrilled to snatch a copy of this legit pressing. As always, the line-up is a trio, on 'Live At Berkeley',we have Jimi - guitar & vocals, Billy Cox - bass and Mitch Mitchell - drums. The setlist is good, with several memorable of Hendrix's anthems, FM staples; call 'em what you will. I was most impressed with \\"Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\\", \\"Stone Free\\", a tune that he didn't write, but made it a 'head music' classic \\"Hey Joe\\", \\"Foxey Lady\\", \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\" .Comes with a superb 24-page full color booklet, sort of like a mini-program. Recommended.
0385510454|1.0|I am not a smart man!!!  I continue to buy new Grisham novels in hopes that an improvement will be seen. The result...another wasted 20 bucks (plus shipping!!!). Gone are the days of books like \\"The Firm\\" or \\"Pelican Brief\\".  Those fast-paced thrillers have been replaced with books like his new one,..\\"The Broker\\".  This novel, which is about the happenings of big-time lawyer Joel Blackman, is a cross between a thriller (though not very thrilling) and a tourist's guide for Italy.  I will concide that the book started off well, but, after 100 pages, it was work just to pick it up. It is difficult to symphathize with a lead character that wants to sell out his government for big bucks. Regardless of my opinion of the characters, the slowness of the plot was the most difficult to take. It didn't take long to lose interest, and when the end did come, it wasn't soon enough!  John Grisham is one of the most talented \\"court room\\" writers in the market.  He should go back to that genre and leave the espionage to the likes of Clancy.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|The movies a classic, I bought it just for the fact that it was on DVD and the Tapes I have are dying. Haven't watched the Features though. Have one downside, on KKP2 there is said to be an interactive dvd-rom game on the back of the case that holds the KKP2 dvd (not the box that holds all the dvds) Unfortunately I haven't been able to locate this game, and Unsure whether they just removed it and forgot to reprint the dvd cover. Still a great buy, suggest if for anyone.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Hey, I bought the Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD from Amazon this past Christmas & I must say it is amazing. When I first heard about the festival, I thought it was just a rumor, but when tickets went on sale, I rushed over & bought tickets right when they went on sale. <br /> <br />Highlights include: Cocaine, Steamroller Blues, Oklahoma Borderline, After Midnight, Jingo, City Love, Sweet Home Chicago, The March, I'm The Hell Outta Here, Rocky Mountain Way, I Shot The Sheriff, Tush, & Layla.   <br /> <br />I hope that a volume 2 is released with lots more songs & hopefully some backstage footage & more interviews.
B00005QAPK|5.0|Toby Dammit is the best thing I've ever seen Fellini do and I'm a HUGE Fellini fan! Truly, it is the only reason to watch Spirits of the Dead. Vadim's segment is tedious and boring although young Jane Fonda is always a delight to behold.  I'm not a big Malle fan.  His segment, although much more interesting than Vadim's, is hugely misogynistic.  However, it's Fellini's Toby Dammit that is the crown jewel of Spirits of the Dead.  Fellini's dreamlike hyper surrealism is perfect in a scary movie context.  It quickly establishes a nightmarish scenario and never lets up for a second.  Terrence Stamp is sexy and perfect as Toby. Fellini uses subdued lighting and a subtle color palette instead of his trademark Technicolor kaleidoscopes. The run time at 40 minutes is the perfect length (length is one of the tiny faults in many Fellini films). The highlight definitely is the high-speed race through the streets of Rome at night and there are so many influential elements that it's astounding, everything from aphex twin's scary grinning face to Sweet Charity's outlandish costumes to the opening of David Lynch's Lost Highway to the creepy ghosts from The Ring or The Grudge. There is an incredible velocity to Toby Dammit that I've never seen in any other Fellini film. If this is your first foray into the phantasmagorical world of Fellini, you may be disappointed with his other works.  Usually his films meander along, slowly unfolding like a lovely dream.  It only makes me wonder what Fellini could have done if he ventured into making scary movies.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I will often try to get my wife to listen to the CDs that I love -- she can't stomach 90% of what I listen to.  She absolutely loves this CD.  Why?  Is it to keep up with the readers of Pitchfork or other MP3 sites?  Nah, she's never read a page of any of them.  She likes the music and I like the music as well.    <br /> <br />Haters take notice, trashing this CD / band is so totally unnecessary.  If this music doesn't appeal to you, that's fine, move on - if this CD just isn't your taste, thats fine, no need to post a 1 star review; even if you do, odds are it is going to be ignored anyway.    <br /> <br />I saw Arcade Fire live in Boston last night -- they played about 15 songs and I could not pick a favorite out of the pack -they were amazing, they all played with such spirit, such energy, no irony at all.  True performers and musicians - each band member played at least 2 instruments at one time or another.  The female lead singer Regine played keyboard, drums, guitar, and accordian on various songs.  I was overwhelmed by the band to the point of shedding a few tears of joy - to quote Morrissey \\"And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump In the ocean \\"  Well I was shocked in such a way last night.   <br /> <br />I have seen hundreds of bands over the last 20 years, am I crazy / stupid to say that without a doubt this was one of the 5 best shows I have ever seen?  Not on your life.  (Other 4 for those interested:  Neutral Milk Hotel, Belle and Sebastian, Drive Like Jehu, Fugazi)  Is this CD as good as their live perfomance, no. I will say something negative about this CD, it does not effectively capture these songs and how they were meant to sound.   <br /> <br />This band is so exciting, so real, so absolutely entertaining, I don't want Amazon readers to be swayed away from this band or CD by reading the BS and backlash from the haters.  Don't put up bad reviews without even listening to this CD.  It's lame to writea bad review in hopes of trying to p!$$ people off. Go to messageboards if that is your thing.   Haters, hate now and regret it later, if you are a fan of indie/alternative/rock this CD just might win you over someday.   If you are on the fence, there are a ton of free MP3s out there on the web -- download a couple and give this band a try for free.
0060958324|5.0|This is one of the great pieces of modern literature. Any critic of note agrees, as did the book reading world when it was published. Its success was a bit of a surprise, as it is a deep philosophical ramble for the most part, not your typical best seller. I am both a motorcycle rider and a student of Eastern religions, so this was made in heaven for me. No interest in either of those subjects is at all necessary to love this book, needless to say! More Western than Eastern philosophy here, both are presented brilliantly, and the final stop is pure enlightenment. The extraordinary mental journey that takes place in this book, the agony and seriousness of the author's search for truth, the philosophical heights, the madness, and the epiphanies along the way are all examples of the author's unique genius. The ending has an impact one would not expect of this book. It explodes. This is not one of your typical \\"Zen and the art of this or that\\" deals. This is one of the best books ever written, period. Not an easy read, but more than worth the effort.
0743201140|4.0|After Marcus Buckingham wrote \\"First, Break All the Rules,\\" my favorite management book of all time, he was beseiged by people asking him one question.  \\"You told us to focus on our reports strengths and our own strengths, but how do we figure out what they are?\\" <br /> <br />This book is his answer to that question.  The book includes the password to a website that allows you to take a clever little test that tells you your five primary strengths (out of 25 or so) or those of your subordinates if they take the test. <br /> <br />In reading the book, you learn about the different attributes, what work best fits the various skill sets and how best to manage people with the various characteristics.  This really is a very useful book, but Buckingham's first book was so strong that this one suffered a little bit by comparison.

0312853238|5.0|Personally, Ender's Game is the best science fiction book I have ever read. From the beginning all the way to the end, the book is smart, it is exciting, and it is hard to put down. I think the book is so successful because people can relate to the main character, Ender. He is a young genius being used like a tool as a military commander. The future, set about a hundred and fifty years from now, is believable and lacks many of the scifi luster that plagues many books. Ender is taken to a school in space that trains children to become officers, however, his training is different and special. The book is sad, because Ender nearly destroys himself to ensure that he never loses. The antagonist in the book is superficially the buggers, the aliens that have attacked Earth twice. At a different level, the antagonists are the adults that are ensuring Ender never loses his edge. And, ultimately, the antagonist is Ender himself.  <br />Enders Game is a book that I would recommend to anybody. It is deep, and for some reason it appeals to people that don't normally read science fiction. Be warned: if you read it once, you will probably read it again.
0783229011|1.0|I just got done watching this movie and am really disgusted.If the writers intention was to make  kids and adults cry and be horrified, well thumbs up.After giving each animal personality, they got killed off.this movie went from bad to worse.The kids were so upset by it, i turned it off 3/4 of the way through and tossed it in the trash.I kept fastforwarding over sad parts, thinking it had to get happier, only to have something more awful happen next.It had potential to be wonderful, with the animation and scenery, but they made it a movie that animal lovers can not stomach.
B0002YLC24|4.0|Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy work magic on screen.The two  movies are meshed together very well. It's interesting to see how the old lovers  have changed yet  are still the same, and how their  chance meeting 9 years earlier in Vienna impacted their lives .In my opinion Before Sunrise is  still the better of the two movies , but  Before Sunset  stirs up  many of the same memories, and emotions . The  outcome  is once again left  up to you...would you make the same mistake twice....Rent or buy both movies you wont regret it
0783114893|4.0|To this day I feel the Hitcher is one of the most bizzare films I have ever seen.  It's a film with basically no sympathetic characters in it that leaves you quite unsettled with its sheer violence and black-hearted spirit.<br /><br />C. Thomas Howell plays Jim Halsey, a young man taking a driveaway car from Chicago to California to deliver it.  Along the way on a desert road he makes a mistake by picking up a hitchhiker John Ryder (Rutger hauer).  Ryder admits to having just killed several motorists.  As soon as he his able, Jim manages to dump him out of the car but now finds himself persued by almost superhuman means by this homicidal maniac who seems to always no where Jim is.<br /><br />Ryder Kills several more people including local las officers and Jim is blamed for the murders.  yet inexplicably Ryder actually rescues Jim from the police when he's capture, killing them as well.  To Ryder it's one big game of cat & mouse an no one, not even the police are going to get in his way.  Neither is a girl Jim befriends played Jennifer Jason Leigh, who suffers the films most diabolical fate.<br /><br />The Character oh John Ryder is one of the most complex and curious in horror history.  A man who is at once devoid of emotion yet seemingly in need of a symbiotic relationship with Jim.  Almost a demonic being who shows Jim the dark delights and takes him under his wing as an apprentice.  It's obvious he could kill Jim many times but doesn't, choosing instead to kill everyone else around jim, driving him to madness.<br /><br />It's almost impossible to define this film.  Thriller, horror, suspense?  It's a film which is largely one of those where people really love it or hate it.  i stand in the former.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|Even if your are not a heavy metal fan, METELLICA SOME KIND OF MONSTER (Paramount) is an absolutely mesmerizing epic documenatary that looks at 20 years of the ups and downs of this iconic band.  Over 10 hours of extras.  This is what documentary filmmaking is all about.  And it sounds as great as it looks.  Unrated. 140 minutes.
1400049628|5.0|Being a fan of Zombie films this book came out of nowhere to me and was quite a surprise.  Author Max Brooks has compiled a thoroughly researched and altogether hilarious spoof of zombie culture with his survival guide.  And who knows...if Zombies ever really do walk the earth someday, you'll be mighty happy you have this book.<br /><br />While based in the lore of George Romero's zombie films, Brooks expands it further past film and fiction and explores real life zombies.  For the first time we get and in-depth description of the virus that causes this plaugue and a well-thought out, step-by-step breakdown of how the virus attacks the body and what exactly happens.  I love the medical analysis Brooks provides about the zombies sense of smell and taste, making you realize full well that you could NEVER disguise yourself as a zombie by shuffling down the street as they did in \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".  The zombies would pick up the scent of your living flesh and tear you to pieces!<br /><br />While quite humorous this book is really written rather seriously as if it was an actual text book and Brooks never lets down his guard and you become immersed in the text, making you wonder what would happen if the world were overrun by zombies.  You'll get all the tips you need on battling and surviving zombie hordes with suggestions on the safest places to take refuge as well as weapon selection.<br /><br />For any fan of Zombie films, The Zombie Survival Guide : Complete Protection from the Living Dead is an absolute must read...because you never know...
B00064AM6C|5.0|If you're a fan of the White Stripes, this concert DVD is a must-have for your collection. The band plays a good number of tunes from each of their albums as well as a number of improvised blues songs. Many of the songs have been sped up and/or re-interpreted here, so don't expect to fork out $20 to hear the same old renditions as on cd. From the oldest to the newest song, Jack and Meg inject a great deal of life into their performance. Some highlights include the heart-wrenchingly passionate, 'Jolene', and the blistering 'Death Letter' which will leave fans drooling as they watch. The concert was filmed with Super 8, so the film has a grainy feel that certainly adds to the live experience. The show has also been edited superbly, with numerous camera angles and lots of great close-ups that give you the feel that you're right on stage with the band and yet right in the middle of the screaming crowd. The audio quality of the performance is pristine, and before viewing you should choose the audio setup that suits your entertainment system best (DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2 speaker stereo)- believe me, it will make a huge difference in the quality and brilliance of the sound. So, what are you waiting for? Pick this DVD up and enjoy the show.
0385510454|1.0|Well, there's a survival Italian Kit phrasebook, many tips for Tourists ( for instance, don't drink Cappuccino in Italy if you aren't early in the morning ), and many descriptions about Bologna. <br />What will you miss, are photo, that are an obvious asset, when you purchase a Guide, a plant of Bologna, and the plot itself ( you understand everything from page 1 ). <br />I think there aren't many monographies about Bologna in English, and I appreciate the effort of the author ( warning! Law have strictly changed, and yuo aren't allowed anymore to smoke in a pub, otherwise you will be fined, up to 250 Euros ). <br />Everything is accurate, save the fare in Eurostar from Bologna to Milan, that is far less than 50 Euros, even in first Class. <br />Well, if you are interested in Bologna, purchase it; but you must have a city plant with you. <br />If you are interested in legal thrillers, look for something else.

B00005YUPO|4.0|LOVES it!  We have Mozart, Newton, Neighborhood Animals and Discovering Water and this is by far his favorite!  But it may be just for the time being.  A friend lent this to me to try before we buy and my 9 month old seems to be glued to it much more than the others.  I don't know if he's just maybe tired of the others or what but I DO know that he LOVES this one.  However, it is very annoying to me -- Ms. Clark's oldest daughter, who is the \\"star\\" is such a complete HAM who seems to have her 8 year old ego stroked every time she opens her mouth, the room roars with laughter.  But...my son loves it and that's what counts and it does allow me to get some things done while he's watching!
0060531053|5.0|This truly is an excellent guide for starting the hobby.  It certainly was my first brew book.  Although my first homebrew store gave me simpler instructions with my first purchase, this book gave me the understanding of what those instructions meant.   <br /> <br />The author is very laid back and is a knowledgeable guy that does not want you to quit the hobby because of petty details.  Good brewing comes with time.  After 11 years of brewing, I realize that this is a hobby, not a job. This is why the author repeats the phrase \\"Relax, don't worry, have a homebrew.\\"   <br /> <br />Being pretty savvy with both biology and chemistry, I was the typical case of a worry wort (no pun intended to all grain guys). <br /> <br />My first two brews, when I was too clueless to know what to worry about, came out better than the next 5!   <br /> <br />Take this from a decent brewer:  You will always want this book in your home.  Although I normally use a bit more advanced guides (Designing Great Beers, and New Brewing Lager Beer), there is still some good stuff in this book.  I would hardly call it only for beginners.  I would say since almost every home brewer bought this book first, it is perceived to be a beginner's book.  He has excellent all grain and whole hop data.  He has excellent dilution data in case your wort is too concentrated.  He hits on some topics that even the more advanced books don't.   <br /> <br />This book is for beginning and experienced brewers.  After all, after brewing for 11 years I picked up the third edition and found some new stuff I never saw before (hop growing and such) <br /> <br />You will like this book.  Trust me, and relax don't worry....... <br /> <br /> <br />Hint:  If you don't understand the terminology of your new hobby at first, use the glossary in the back of the book or an online site such as www,beertown,org or www,howtobrew,com <br />
0553802534|5.0|Lisa Gardner takes a seemingly \\"normal\\" crime scene and turns it upside down.  A police sniper shoots and kills a husband that had a gun in his hand with his wife and child present in the room.  In State Trooper's Bobby Dodge's view, the killing was justified.  The facts and the secrets slowly come out that make you want to say who's to blame here?  Bobby Dodge's life starts to unravel when the parents of the \\"victim\\" decide to sue him. At the same time Catherine Gagnon is calling him for help.  Catherine was a victim of a pedophile 25 years ago who is unexplainably released early from prison.  People close to Catherine are murdered and fingers start pointing at Bobby.  You feel for her helplessly sick son and are shocked further when a secret is revealed.  Did she know what she was doing? How to get the SWAT team to her house that night?  It's left up to you to decide.  Alone moves rapidly along, so pay attention to the details.
B000002G9S|5.0|I recently caught up with \\"Fire and Water\\" after a gap of about 30 years and was amazed that it had lost absolutely none of its soulful, emotional power. For those who know Free, this review will be preaching to the converted however, younger rock/blues fans who are unfamiliar with the band must get hold of this album. Every single track is brilliant, from the title track opener, with Paul Rodgers' smouldering vocal, Paul Kossoff's powerchord riffs and police siren lead, through to the close of the band's anthem, \\"Alright Now\\". \\"Oh I Wept\\", \\"Heavy Load\\", \\"Don't Say You Love Me\\" are all slow paced, moving soul ballads, the latter two building steadily to concluding crescendos of Rodgers' desperate, Otis Redding-like pleading twinned with Kossoff's crying leads - glorious, heart-rending songs. \\"Remember\\" and \\"Mr Big\\" are both slow-paced, powerful rockers, the latter climaxing in a breathtaking guitar duel between Kossoff's lead and Andy Fraser's bass. This is such a brilliant, mature album that it is impossible to imagine that all of the band were teenagers at the time and that this is the same Paul Rodgers who would later churn out so much tedious corporate rock with Bad Company. Although Free's last three albums, \\"Highway\\", \\"Free At Last\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" would all have sublime moments and are all worth getting hold of, the band's internal tensions and Kossoff's drug problems would prevent them from ever fulfilling their true potential or from putting together a work so consistently superb as \\"Fire and Water\\". This was when it all came together for Free, resulting in what is surely one of the top ten all-time great rock albums.
0743454537|5.0|My father brought this novel home for me to read yesterday morning, and since I have finished it and started to read it again. The storyline is close to my heart, as though I have never dealt with anything as life threatening as cancer I have seen the inside of a hospital room often.  <br />The main character, Anna, has a voice that perfectly captures the essance of a thirteen year old who has had to grow up before her time and the other narrarators have voices that keep them different and keep the story going. <br />There is so much to offer in this book and I don't quite know how to describe it, the ending is unexpected yes, and perhaps seems wrong to some but I think it solves the books main problem well, because where else could she have gone with it without making it too \\"happily ever after\\"?
0385510454|1.0|I have read most if not all of John Grisham's books.  This one begins with interesting characters, exciting locations, and plenty of promise in the would-be victim pursued by assassins from four international intelligence agencies.  When I neared the end, with strings still unraveled, I wondered how, in the few remaining pages, the author could possibly reach a logical, exciting, and satisfactory ending.  He didn't; he fell flat.  This book reminded me of a reality show, with many fascinating characters but no serious crisis, no denouement, a lethal Chinese agent who, described in ominous detail, never materialized, and a soft ending.  His Italian scenes and language lessons were entertaining and showed good research; on the other hand his portrayal of the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency as a 60-year-old Major showed an astounding lack of research and understanding.  Knowing that my wife had shared my great expectations, I reluctantly handed the book to read.  I'll let her draw her own conclusions.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Today Charity Concerts are very common in the music industry.   But when looking at a Charity Concert - the Worldwide July 13, 1985 Live Aid Concert has to be the Granddaddy of them all.    It boasted the greatest lineup of musicians ever assembled for one effort.   Prior to Live Aid, Woodstock was considered the greatest lineup ever assembled for a concert.   Live Aid would far surpass Woodstock.    Live Aid would primarily take place from two locations - Wembley Stadium in London and JFK Stadium in Philadelphia.   There would be other feeds from several other countries.    The feeds for all of these shows would be synchronized to create one big concert to both the TV audience as well as to the fans in attendance at the venues.  I remember the Saturday in July when this show took place.   In the United States, the coverage would be split between Cable and Network TV.    I think many of us took this for granted - because that would basically be the only day this would ever be broadcasted - and we didn't see eveything.  Unless you had your VCR running, this would be it.- until 19 1/2 years later when the \\"Live Aid\\" 4 DVD Set would be released. <br /> <br />According to the liner notes, Band Aid Organizer Bob Geldof - for legal reasons, did not want the Live Aid Show recorded or shown again.   However, the fact remains that recordings did exist and thus this DVD set was assembled.   This 4 DVD Set consists of about 10 hours of Concert and associated extras.   The important thing to note is that this is NOT the whole Live Aid Show.   There are many parts of the Live Aid Show that are not included.  The official reason for things not being included is the claim that the footage doesn't exist.  Therefore things are missing - most notably, the Led Zeppelin Reunion,    But still there is plenty of good stuff on this concert and there is enough to give you a good feel for both the atmosphere and flow of the concert from all the venues. <br /> <br />Here are 10 great momentsfrom Live Aid that are included on the DVD: <br /> <br />1.U2, \\"Bad\\": This established U2 as an incredible live act.   Watch carefully at the end as two young girls literally climb over the crowd at Bono's invite to join him on stage. <br /> <br />2.Beach Boys, \\"Would it be nice?\\":  They might be past their prime, but I thought this was an incredible performance. <br /> <br />3.Dire Straits & Sting, \\"Money For Nothing\\".  Live Aid was the place that put this song on the map.  It's probably the only place where you can hear Dire Straits and Sting perform this live - incredible stuff. <br /> <br />4.Queen:  All six songs.  This was probably one of the last great hurrahs for this band.  Freddie Mercury and Co deliver a most passionate performance.  Watch how Mercury has complete command of the crowd with \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"Radio Gaga\\", and \\"We are the Champions\\" <br /> <br />5.Paul McCartney, \\"Let It Be\\".   Great penultimate song to the London set.  McCartney will be joined by Pete Townshend, David Bowie, Bob Geldof, and Alison Moyet.   You can see the audience is exhausted at this point.  McCartney and Townshend will lift Geldof over their shoulders. <br /> <br />6.Band Aid Finale:  The performance may be out of sync, but its true improvising as you see the London performers perform \\"Do they Know It's Christmas\\".  Why wasn't Freddie Mercury given a solo bit in this song? <br /> <br />7.Thompson Twins/Madonna/Nile Rodgers/Steve Stevens, \\"Revolution\\".   Live Aid gave many artists a chance to work with others they hadn't worked with before.  This was one of the more interesting combinations of artists performing the Thompson Twins remake of the Beatles classic. <br /> <br />8.Teddy Pendergrass/Ashford and Simpson: \\"Reach Out\\": One of the most emotional moments of the show was Teddy Pendergrass' performing for the first time after what was near fatal car accident.  Very few dry eyes for this song.   This is included as an \\"extra\\" on the DVD set since the footage was extracted from MTV at the last minute. <br /> <br />9.Mick Jagger: \\"Just Another Night\\":  The Philadelphia Crowd was exhausted, but Jagger manages to fire everyone up with this solo hit. <br /> <br />10.Bob Dylan/Keith Richards/Ron Wood \\"Blowing in the Wind\\":  While I don't care for this song - especially for a penultimate song for the U.S. show, I thought it was one of the great moments when Bob Dylan's guitar string breaks and Ron Wood gives him his guitar to keep the performance near seamless. <br /> <br />There are so many other moments and performances in this show to enjoy as well - too many to list.   There are a lot of great extras.  There are moving  BBC Documentaries on the Famine and about the Band Aid Project.  Both documentaries were very interesting.  There is a section that shows several of the International Feeds.  This includes the Pendergrass performance, INXS from Australia, and the feeds from Austria, Germany, Japan, Russia, and Norway.  The Austria performance is very passionate.   You also get the \\"Do They Know It's Christmas\\" video, the \\"We are the World\\" video, and Mick Jagger and David Bowie's \\"Dancing in the Streets\\" video (that debuted at Live Aid). They also chronicle Phil Collins transcontiential journey from the London Show to the Philadelphia Show - although I thought that footage could have been better. <br /> <br />Another thing that is really good is some of the camera work.   You get a good sense for some of the stuff and people who are backstage - this really is seen well at the Philadelphia venue. <br /> <br />For the most part, the quality of the audio and video on this DVD is excellent.   . On the negative side, the missing footage is a lot to overcome.  I would have preferred the International Feeds and Pendergrass performance to be inserted in the actual order of the show to give a real sense of the performance.  Overall, this is still something for all music fans - highly recommended.
B0000004V2|4.0|I bought the stones roses second album \\"Second Coming\\" before I got their debut.  I had read all the hype about how it was the greatest album of all time by some pious music journalists and even a few amazon shoppers, but I had to listen to give my two cents.  I thought this album would rock more but its quite mellow and the guitars remind me of shoegaze acts like my bloody valentine and the jangle of Johnny Marr.  The vocals are quite hushed but each song flows into each other quite perfectly. This is an ablum that gets better with repeated listens but it just doesn't rock enough in my opinion.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I normally don't buy greatest hits albums from artists that I already own the albums for but I had to make an exception in this case.  20 different songs (there are 2 versions of Party For Two making the complete 21 song cd) is what I'd call a complete cd.  Normally artists take their 10-12 biggest songs plus one new song and call it a greatest hits album.  Amazingly enough a year or so later they put out a second greatest hits album that you have to pay another $15 for to have the complete hits collection.  You have to respect Shania for giving us, the fans, a great value for our money.  I would recommend this album to anyone interested in getting a Shania cd as every song is a gem.  For those curious, both of the version of Party For Two are great.  I won't try to describe them as I'll trip over myself.  Whether or not you have all of Shania's albums or not, pick this one up as either way, you get what you pay for: all of her best songs in one place.
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya had been on a roll for more than a decade when \\"A Day Without Rain\\" was released in 2000.  Up to that point all of her studio albums had sold millions of copies in America alone, and all had been certified multi-platinum. <br /> <br />The song \\"Only Time\\" had been featured on the \\"Sweet November\\" soundtrack, which I had purchased because it contained a new Stevie Nicks tune (\\"Touched by an Angel\\").  I soon came to love \\"Only Time,\\" which my local easy-listening radio station had been playing nonstop since the song was released as a single.  It's album, \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" came out and was a certified hit; it sold its immediate million copies or so and was certified platinum.  No surprises there.  But then the album disappeared from the charts and its sales dwindled.  This wasn't much of a surprise, either.  It was the 21st Century, and many of the stars of the last few decades experienced dwindling sales, like Madonna, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston.  So the Enya issue was no surprise, really. <br /> <br />Then the entire September 11th thing happened.  The easy-listening station began giving \\"Only Time\\" heavy airplay once again, and more and more people began calling to request the song.  It was nothing short of a catharsis; people needed some kind of comfort music and Enya was their answer, simply because there was no one else out there that had a soothing, loving sound like she does.  \\"A Day Without Rain\\" quickly re-entered the charts and bounded back into the Top 10.  By the end of 2001, it had shipped more than six-million copies and was certified multi-platinum.  Enya wound up the second-best-selling artist of the entire year, beating both Britney Spears and Madonna for best-selling female artist. <br /> <br />The most extraordinary thing that happened was that the song, \\"Only Time,\\" had crossed from adult-contemporary radio over to mainstream pop.  Two other versions aside from the original could be heard: a remixed version with something of a techno-dance beat, and a version that featured 9-11 newsreels dubbed over the song.  The techno-dance version actually became Enya's ONLY American Top 10 song (#7).  \\"Orinoco Flow,\\" ten years earlier, while a hit in Europe, only managed #20 in America.  The easy-listening radio station also gave airplay to \\"Wild Child,\\" which, with more promotion, could easily have become another pop hit. <br /> <br />The sad part about this album is that had 9-11 not occurred, it would have disappeared into obscurity, and Enya's career might be over about now.  The album, which easily pleases devoted fans (like myself), does nothing to attract new listeners, as there's nothing cutting-edge or \\"new\\" about any of the songs.  And at just over 30 minutes, it's not very adequate for the 20 or so dollars that the majority probably paid for it.  But Enya has her devoted five million+ North American fans, and perhaps that's more than adequate.   <br /> <br />All-in-all the album is VERY pleasant and very special for those fans ... but falls just short of excellent because it's MUCH too safe.
0596007124|5.0|This book is certainly fun to read and it makes me smile quite often. We were told that this book (and this series) \\"using casual language, instead of lecturing\\". Well, I believe this book does deliver very good lectures and this is the magic. However, it is not like giving lectures by a book. Reading this book is more like to attend a lecture in a classroom. And it is given by one of your most favorite lecturers. This lecturer does not repeat the textbook. He/she explains it intuitively and supports the discussion with examples. This lecturer often put a piece of code on the whiteboard, underline the important part, cycle out mistakes and make recommendations. He/seh even dare to leave homework to make sure you understand. The language and diagrams are conversational and engaging. This lecturer also summarizes the important principles in a way you will never forget. Even better, this lecturer is quite funny. Look at the classroom; most of the students are smile while in a software course. This is incredible. Many lectures crack us into thinking we are not that smart. This one cracks us into smile and feel we have leart something important instead.     Isn't this the lecture you will enjoy to attend? Go ahead to buy this book. It is a must.     I recommend this book to everyone who is new to design pattern. This is a good book to start with. The discussion of this book is based on Java. If you only program .Net, you will not have too much difficult to learn the essence and I still consider this the best book for you to get start.     I am not new to design pattern; but I enjoy reading this book very much, not just for the jokes, but also, more importantly, for the stimulating and serious coverage of the subject of design pattern.     Since reading this book, I have made recommendations to friends and librarians. I have not bought this book yet. I read it at the caf of a nearby bookstore during several weekends. I feel it is the optimal way to read this book. I evendid not sit next to a desk; I read it while sitting on a sofa, not as a couch potato. Isn't it wonderful?    I will fulfill my obligation to buy a copy of this book to reward the authors and the publisher for making such a wonderful book. The bookstore has made money from the coffee I drank and from all the music CD's I bought while I were at the happy mood after read a couple chapters in a sunny afternoon.     (...)
B00005Q5WC|5.0|This package, the 'deluxe' edition of the masterful 'Exodus' album by Marley and the Wailers, finally includes the complete nine minute and eighteen second, original version of the Lee Perry/Bob Marley collaboration 'Punky Reggae Party', recorded over two months in July/August 1977. (The single disc edition of 'Exodus' which includes 'Punky Reggae Party' says 'long version ' but it is not, lasting only six minutes before it is edited to a close, before Marley's chilling jazz scatting is complete). For this gem of collaborative brilliance alone this 'deluxe' package is worth the high price.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the many reasons I try to avoid Fox: they get great shows (like this and Family Guy) and absolutely screw them up. Instead of the great two-hour premiere that introduced all nine characters and the setting very well, they showed a one-hour, \\"more action-packed\\" episode to try to hook the audience. It didn't work.  <br /> <br />Enough about Fox's screwup, though. This series is absolutely brilliant, for many reasons: <br />1. The setting. Combining science fiction technology (spaceships, lasers) with a Wild West setting ends up working better than you might think, especially because the writers take care to emphasize both points quite a bit. <br />2. The characters. Nine of them, all representing different viewpoints, from the preacher to the fugitive doctor to the comic-relief pilot to the \\"companion\\" (i.e. prostitute). What's really great, though, is how they react differently to each other when different people are present. For example, the preacher is much more open to the companion than to the rest of the crew for some reason. <br />3. The filming. Firefly isn't filmed cleanly, like a lot of science fiction. Zooms, pans, and lens flares are used a lot to give it a \\"you are there\\" feeling. The special effects are also incredible for a TV series. <br /> <br />Personally, \\"Firefly\\" was the best $40 I ever spent on a DVD, and I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B0001CCXY8|4.0|I find it funny that most \\"metal fans\\" get on here and write reviews, bashing bands for sounding the same all the time. How many times have you heard \\"Vader and Cannibal Corpse keep putting out the same album every year, its getting old\\". Funny, but the minute one of these bands go out and change their syle or sound, you will also be the first to say, \\"THEY SOLD OUT\\". So tell me kids, witch is it? Do you want your band to stay true to their roots, and not become mainstream, or do you want them to go soft like Metallica? You see, bands like Cannibal corpse and Vader keep putting out these type of albums, because thats what made their fans love them. They are not trying to reach out to the \\"band wagon kids\\", or the casual fan like you. I once loved Metallica, but when i heard that Load ablum, i said thats it, they have died in my eyes. Metallica forgot who got them there, who their real fans were. They wanted MTV and pop success. True they make more money, but the hard core fans are long gone. They have no loyalty now, just kids who will listen for a while , then jump to the next big thing that comes out on MTV. Cannibal Corpse and Vader will always have their legions, no matter what, because they did not choose to sell out. So understand kids, these guys arent trying to convert anybody over, they already have fans. So, if you like them, you will enjoy this album. I dont give it 5 stars only because they should have just put out the special edition, witch is outstanding with the dvd and worm infested included, and not this version. Once again though, these guys are legendary for a reason, if you are a death metal fan, you should respect their place in history, if nothing else.
B000000OUJ|5.0|This is a sick album. I have never read any bad reviews on this CD so you know that it's worth buyin.I like tracks 2 and 7 the best but its all good. It's got some pretty tight beats but I just wish ppl could rap lyrics like this these days. Wu-Tang Forever, Peace
B000062YAZ|5.0|First of all, im a biassed person when it comes to this band, so if you are deciding whether or not to buy this cd, take that into consideration. Now, i must say two things, slayer is my all time favorite band, and Reign in Blood (in my opinion). is the best cd ever made. If you love metal, you cant tell me that when you hear Angel of Death start up, that you dont want to explode out of your seat in fury and go tear somthing the \\"F\\" up. Growing up in the 80's and 90's, i was around for the inception of thrash and its affect on all other metal. When i sit down and listen to Vader(another great band, check them out too) i cant help but hear slayers influence. As good as Hell Awaits, and show no mercy were, Reign in Blood broke all the thrash molds when it came out. From beginning to end, this cd is super sonic fast, and lyrically brutal and satanic. Also, if you are young, and have only heard say, diabolous in musica, or god hates us all, you need to get this cd for another reason as well. Dave Lomabardo! Nothing against Bostaph, or whatever his name was, but lombardo is really what drove this band back in the late 80s and early 90's. To me, he is one of the top 4 drummers of all time. But i digress. Go out, get this cd, and get an education on real metal. this will cure your emo and nu metal afflictions.
B000002HJA|4.0|One of the top 5 best days of my life came the day this record was released. What happened? Well, I had been working 12 hour rotating shifts all summer at a book factory when I heard on the radio that Kyuss was playing at Merriweathers opening for White Zombie. So I left work, picked up my girlfriend, stopped by the local record store to pick up something for the 2-hour drive there.Guess what. New Kyuss. Perfect.Unexpected.Jammed all the way there. My girl actually loved the tape! We had to tickets but proceeded there anyway. There were 4 of us that day. We were in line for G.A. tickets when we were approched about 4 pit tickets for sale. Guess what. In the pit. Kyuss.Zombie. Crazy sex later. perfect day. Thank you!

B00005AQF7|5.0|This is a classic cd from Snoop fo shizzle. Every track on here is off the hook and is all tight. the first track is \\"G Funk Intro\\" which is tight, then is another rap classic \\"Gin and Juice\\" which is one of my favorite songs of all time. \\"Tha Shiznit\\" is well...tha sihiznit,yknow. Lodi Dodi is like a storytellin rap or somethin' its still dope. Murder was the Case is another favorite of mine its just pure dope. Serial Killa is another favorite of mine and has DOC, RBX and Kurupt on it. Who am I is another of my favs. For all my N*ggaz and B*tches is alright. Aint no fun is tight and has nate dogg and others on it. Doggy dogg world Is good. GZ and hustlas is dope. Pump Pump is aight.<br /><br />Get this if u want Snoop's best great productuion and a great CD<br /><br />And thats all I have to say about that
B000000OAA|4.0|As i have said before, Queen was THE best group of all time. Now, i know this next comment will infuriate BUT: This isn't much different from Hot Space. IN THE SENSE: that it has many different styles on the album. NO THERE IS NO DISCO OR FUNK. But there is alot of styles incorporated into this approx. 45 minute album. <br /> <br />Songs: <br /> <br />Brighton Rock: Dreadful on the album, it is nice to have a studio version of THE Brian May solo. But The singing in my eyes is atrocious. Freddie's high voice on this sounds like he is screwing around or they used the wrong take. SOUND: ROCK <br /> <br />Killer Queen: Their first big hit. Not much to say about this one, if you havent heard it, you havent heard much Queen. One of their top 10 defining songs. SOUND: POP <br /> <br />Tenement Funster: The first Roger Taylor song worth mentioning in the Queen catalog. (Modern Times Rock & Roll is OK, Loser in the End is awful) Great song with a segue into the next song. SOUND: ROCK <br /> <br />Flick Of The Wrist: The flip to Killer Queen (Supposedly a double a side but unlike Fat Bottomed Girls/Bicycle Race, you don't hear both cuts on classic rock radio) A heavy nasty song written by Freddie. Some harmonies and heavy rock combined makes this a must have song. SOUND: HEAVY ROCK. <br /> <br />Lily Of The Valley: Finish to the trio of songs (beginning at Tenement Funster) Also released as a flipside (b-side of Now Im Here) short like Nevermore and like Nevermore has some lyrics and harmonies that make your spine shiver. SOUND: SLOW SONG <br /> <br />Now I'm Here: The other single on the album. A good song, most times better live. I think a better second single would have been Stone Cold Crazy or Lap of the gods Revisited. SOUND: ROCK <br /> <br />In The Lap Of The Gods: One of two songs with this title on the album (save a Revisited tacked onto the other) Otherwise there is NOTHING similar in the songs. An interesting one, especially with Rogers PIERCING ah's. Another goodsong. SOUND: POP/ROCK. <br /> <br />Stone Cold Crazy: Why past reviewers say thrash is beyond me, Maybe they havent heard this version much lately. It is definately a heavy metal sounding song. one of Brian May's better guitar solos too! SOUND: HEAVY METAL <br /> <br />Dear Friends: Another short piano piece like Nevermore & Lily Of The Valley. Great song, pity its barely more than a minute long. SOUND: SLOW SONG <br /> <br />Misfire: John Deacon's first songwriting credit in Queen. Another short song but this poppy ditty is pretty dirty if you listen to the words. \\"Don't you misfire and fill me up, with the desire to carry on\\" Sounds like sa good jingle for Viagra or Levitra. Good song though. SOUND: POP <br /> <br />Bring Back That Leroy Brown: A wierd one that only Queen could get away with doing on a rock album (Later they would do other peculiar songs like Good Company & Seaside Rendevous) Mercifully when they did it live they did a short instrumental version as the lyrics leave something to be desired. SOUND: RAGTIME <br /> <br />She Makes Me: Alot of Queen fans do not like this slow Brian May composition. I personally do, Brian sings this one (one of his first in Queen (Only Someday Oneday precedes it) I also like the ending with sound effects like the sirens and heavy breathing. SOUND: SLOW SONG <br /> <br />In The Lap Of The Gods Revisited: Great song, good singalong ending with the WHOA WHOA LA LA LA. Always a live favorite. SOUND: ROCK <br /> <br />BONUS TRACK: Stone Cold Crazy Remix: Basically the same as the original version. They should have done the Trent Reznor version. <br /> <br />All in all a great release, you can see further progression to the sound ultimately achevied on A Night At The Opera and songs like Bohemian Rhapsody & Somebody To Love. <br /> <br />Please read all my reviews and rate them! <br /> <br />
B000002UAU|5.0|Whisper along in a mogwai meets maynard meets tori amos meets system of a down whisper  to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band and am given chills, thrills. <br /> <br />this album picks up moreso later on. <br />when you're done trying to figure out how it is 'themed' - it's not - just be amazed that these songs are love letters from England to the U.S. <br />just say 'thank you' in your lonely heart. <br />RIP George + John
B00005OM4N|5.0|To me, this is Britney's best. I find myself listening to the songs on this CD the most when I am in the mood for Pop music. While many say she doesn't have a great singing voice I happen to like it for the type of music she sings. <br /> <br />     <br />1. I'm A Slave 4 U: I am sure you've all hear this single. I like it. The lyrics are a bit repeative but overall this song is good to dance to. It's super catchy. <br /> <br />2. Overprotected (Featured In \\"Crossroads\\"): Another upbeat song perfect for dancing. <br /> <br />3. Lonely: My favorite Britney song of all time. Another upbeat song. I love the lyrics. And, to me, her voice sounds great. Amazed this wasn't a single.   <br /> <br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (Featured In \\"Crossroads\\"): I am sure you have all heard this one. It is slower than most of the other songs on the album. Lyrics are a bit cheesy but nice to listen to overall <br />   <br />5. Boys: Another single I am sure you're all familiar with. Produced by Pharrell of the Neptunes so you can imagine what the beat sounds like as many of his songs have the same elements. Good for dancing. <br /> <br />6. Anticipating: Fun clubish song. Not my favorite.   <br /> <br />7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll (Featured In \\"Crossroads\\"): Remake of the classic. I personally like it better but that's not to say it's the best. I find myself skipping this track most of the time.  <br /> <br />8. Cinderella: Love it. Another upbeat tune. Voice sounds great. <br />   <br />9. Let Me Be: Love it. Another upbeat tune. Voice sounds great. <br /> <br />10. Bombastic Love: Love it. Another upbeat tune. Voice sounds great. <br /> <br />11. That's Where You Take Me: Slower song. Pretty lyrics. <br /> <br />12. What It's Like To Be Me: Love it. Another upbeat tune. Voice sounds great. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall I would say this album is a must for Britney fans. Or even those who just like her singles, as this has many songs that everyone who has ever listened to a radio orwatched MTV will know.   <br />
0790729628|4.0|Warner Bros had a downer on this film just prior to its release. Test audiences were inconclusive in their verdicts and Warner Execs insisted that Ridley Scott edit the film, considering it far too downbeat for mainstream audiences.<br /><br />The result was the voice over narrative which apparently Harrison Ford tried to make as unconvincing as possible so that the Execs at Warners would drop it - he failed. Scenes were deleted, and the upbeat flying sequence at the end of the film was added.<br /><br />The film opened to ok returns in the US but did huge business in Europe. In the UK release, it filled cinemas nightly for weeks with many people choosing to make return visits.<br /><br />The early 1990s saw the release of the Directors Cut which was minus the narrative and the upbeat end sequence. It saw some scenes such as the Unicorn sequence restored. Although a limited<br /><br />release, fans turned out in droves, particularly in London's West End.<br /><br />I must confess that I enjoy both versions as different approaches to the same film. I have recently ordered 'The International Version' which apparently is an augmented version of the first release so I will pass comment on that when it arrives.<br /><br />Set in the future, it sees Los Angeles as a rainy, polluted, and totally cosmopolitan metropolis. Mankind has colonised other worlds and uses synthetic humans known as replicants, with superhuman abilities to carry out the dirtier work that doing this involves. Being superhuman comes at a price, as the lifespan for a replicant is only 4 years. The plot revolves around a former cop (Harrison Ford) who specialises in hunting down replicants. Known as a Bladerunner, his task is to eliminate any replicants setting foot on Earth where the punishment for doing so is death or 'retirement'to quote the jargon of the time.<br /><br />Ford's character has quit the job but is blackmailed into hunting down a particulary dangerous group of replicants who have made it to Earth. Their leader is played by Rutger Hauer, who together with his companions are on a dangerous quest to find an end to their limited lifespan.<br /><br />Visually the film is stunning with its depiction of a gaudy and seedy futuristic metropolis. Flying cars, huge neon signs, and advertising blimps dominate the skyline. Life is cheap and violent in this future, and the point is not lost on the viewer that this is a highly likely evolution of our society.<br /><br />The replicants hunt for more life reflects that of humanity's generally, and Ridley Scott's depiction of a replicant meeting his cold and heartless maker, mirrors ongoing theological questions that ultimately we all have to varying degrees.<br /><br />The drama plays out in the style of a classic detective/ Film Noir story, against a superbly realised Sci Fi background.<br /><br />A sequence that could have been cut is the sickly symbolic scene with the dove (which apparently was Rutger Hauer's own suggestion). It detracts from the film and is cloying.<br /><br />What prevents me from giving the dvd 5 stars though is the lack of 5.1 sound on any discs that I have viewed so far.... This film is not so great in Pro logic sound, someone please give it a full digital soundtrack so as to do it the justice that it received in its cinema release!<br /><br />See it though for what it is, a superbly staged Sci Fi Film Noir which reflects on the human condition, and the future that probably awaits us.layed by Rutger Hauer, who together with his companions are on a dangerous quest to find an end to their limited lifespan. <br /> <br />Visually the film is stunning with its depiction of a gaudy and seedy futuristic metropolis.

B00005JNBQ|3.0|It's fairly safe to say, this far into the 21st century, that the decade of '00' seriously lacks a cultural identity/movement of its own, at least in contrast to the past five decades: the war years of the 40's, the isolationist Americana of the 50's, the Aquarius Ideals of the 60's, the decadence and disco-tinge of the 70's, the Me-Decade excess of the 80's, the angst and 'alternative' option of the 90's.  Thus, over the past couple years, an increasingly wistful, decidedly kitsche assimilation of the styles and media-motifs of the immediate-past has crept into the mass-consciousness, especially for those of the '00' youth, inexperienced and adrift on the ripple-shock tides of a simultaneous informational over-abundance and widespread social repression/reactionary meme in the wake of 9-11.  The ridiculous visual hubris and innocuous ignorance that seem intimately tied to the 70's and the 80's have become attractive to those seeking career revitalization (Gwen Stefani and Outkast being prominent recent examples) and for those wishing to ape a personal neo-retro style that, in equal measure quirky and twee, turns back from the sterile fashions of futurism, the devastating deconstruction of knowing too much, too soon (or, perhaps more truthfully, knowing too much and not nearly enough).  To wit: so chaotic and complex is our contemporary social animal, that retreating into golden-hued nostalgia, as propagated by VH1, is incredibly seductive to the scions of the Post-Cold War Information Era, a womb of unrepentant confidence and social ideal so sorely lacking in these trying times.  You know, back when our plutocratic-puppet president was actually a ~good actor~; back when men teased their hair with aplomb and were considered the macho quintessence; back when the cultural identity was safe, with easy pickings for either path of conformity or rebellion.  \\"Things were better back then\\" - which is all nonsense, of course, like most nostalgic reflection: despite the more fantastical Hollywood archive of the 70's and 80's, that era was plagued with just as much uncertainty and threatening factors as we are now: AIDS, Nuclear Holocaust, economic depression/inflation, Iran-Contra, corporation corruption and drug-addled inner city denizens...  The Grass is always Greener two decades past.    Thus the timely release of *Napoleon Dynamite*, a movie that capitalizes on this retreat into the past, reveling in unabashed kitsche and resurrecting the hoary Revenge of the Nerd archetype within a firmly-80's teen-comedy structure.  The look of the film is carefully, meticulously crafted: fashion from the late 70's, video cassette players from the early 80's, the fake-organic interior decoration made popular in the 60's; complete with knick-knacks and kitsche of any era, including plastic green toy-soldiers and the random thrift-store sai.  Yet late-90's elements insinuate themselves into the film, defying our attempt to define it to this or that era: chat-rooms and the music of Jamiroquai and the Backstreet Boys inform the audience that the environment of *Napoleon Dynamite* is actually that of a time-warp Idaho local, past and present intrinsically woven via cultural artifacts, verbal expressions and the overall ambience of the film total, much like Wes Anderson's uber-quirky exegesis *The Royal Tenembaums*.  Past and the just-past merge; the threatening cloud of the future is utterly banished in this ugly-duckling fairy tale.  In this regard, I find *Napoleon Dynamite* to be a brilliant example of our retro-seduction, a borderline-exploitative wish fulfillment juggernaught with the ability to tempt the kitsche-craving of any age or temperament.     And yet, as a film, I found Napoleon Dynamite sadly lacking, ineffectual as entertainment and about as deep as anything else stamped with the MTV seal of production, a somewhat boring affair that only incidentally rises above its trend-conglomeration ethic to produce a surprised chuckle.  Obviously I'm in the minority here, given the glowing reviews both on this page and from most mainstream critics; to give further example, this film was recommended to me from a high-school work associate who claimed he'd watched it four times in just two days.  It touched him, quite deeply, for reasons I suspect are congruent with my beginning-paragraph thesis.  I, however, struggled with this movie.  Napoleon himself is an unsympathetic caricature of the everyman geek; the fact that he so obviously \\"lacks skills\\" means that almost all comedic triggers associated with his actions and attitudes are a matter of laughing ~at~, rather than laughing ~with~.  Even worse, Pedro is the ultimate construction of a stereotype, tiptoeing around offensiveness.  Why does he want to be class president? Even Pedro doesn't know.  More interesting are Napoleon's brother, the grandmamma's boy seeking soul-mate status, and his uncle, a football-jock relic lost in the glory-days of `82.  Nearly all of those surprised chuckles I mentioned before stemmed from these two characters, but even they are not enough to sustain the movie as a whole.       Now, it may seem that I'm being overtly harsh with this film, but I couldn't escape the notion that a good deal of *Napoleon Dynamite* was crippled by artistic laziness, an inescapable developmental ~complacency~ in regard to the core material.  Again and again, moments of potential humor lose substance; doubtless profound connotations are laid waste by the need to be clever.  This could have been a five-star classic, instead of the naval-gazing faux-indie anticlimax it ends up being.  Alas.    I rate this movie three stars for its (un?) conscious attempt to epitomize the facile neo-retro trend that has so-far dominated '00'; its occasional moments of earned levity and undeniable clever faade; and for that final dance-sequence...dat boy has got some moovez, yo!
B0002MB7QW|2.0|I'm a big FX movie fan.  Normally, my first reason of buying dvd is the special feature.    This DVD said on the backcover that it has behind the scene in DVD-rom.  However, it should have a warning for those who use Macintosh!! (Luckily, I'm PC user)   The DVD-rom won't work on Mac platform, and if you can't install the software in this DVD-rom, you are UNABLE to see the \\"over hour of behind the scene\\"!!!    Moreover, after installing software, you need to have internet connection! It'll play the \\"behind the scene clip\\" via streaming!!  What???  What if I don't have hi-speed internet?  And what if I want to see it but I'm not available for the internet???    This is the most ridiculous function in DVD that i've ever seen!!    Some might say it's the movie that for sell, not special feature.  But why they put it in the DVD and make it useless?    I won't say much about the moive.  All I can say, they did the great job for the images!  I was stunned to cold when I watched it, but the story is.... so so... ,maybe.   I don't like the script and the ending.  It's like \\"What? It's ended already??? I'm about to enjoy it.  How come???\\"
B00006LWSF|4.0|Good music here. I still get chills in the song 'Rap Game' when 50 does the chorus....He sounds so tight in that song. Oh, and 'Places to Go' is my favorite song by 50 Cent, it fits his voice perfectly.
B0006SNK9E|5.0|FANS OF SWEET. I ALREADY HAVE THE 1999 RELEASE OF THIS CD. BUT THOUGHT I MIGHT GIVE THIS A TRY AND HOPEING IT IMPROVED FROM BETTER TO EXCELLENT. IT DID, MORE CLEARER, CRISPIER AND ENHANCED. I WAS AMAZED HOW IT IMPROVED FROM THE LAST REMASTER. THE ONLY THING I DID NOT LIKE ABOUT IT. NO PICTURE DISC OF THE COVER. BONUS TRACKS: BLOCKBUSTER AND ROCK 'N' ROLL DISGRACE. A BIG TURN DOWN. BUT THE OTHER BONUS TRACKS TO ME. A HIT.
6305428042|5.0|It's hard to believe this movie wasn't an immediate success, because it is so enjoyable and is so well acted. The story begins in Old Salem with the execution of the Sanderson Sisters, three witches who, at the time of their execution, cast a spell to ensure that they will come back to life one Hallowe'en when a virgin lights the black candle. Enter one hapless teenage boy (Omri Katz) from California who has just moved to Salem, is not so happy that he has, and upon exploring the Sanderson house, lights the candle, and the adventure begins. The three witches, played by Bette Midler, Kathy Nijimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker, plot to lure the children of the town to concoct a potion to keep themselves young forever and thus live on while the one who brought them back to life, together with his sister and girl friend try to stop them and undo the spell. <br /> <br />While the story sounds not so much fun on paper, the action on the screen keeps the audience spellbound. The tension remains high, and there's plenty of entertainment along the way, including one song performed by Bette Midler at the Hallowe'en Ball. Great script with lots of unforgettable lines. Fun entertainment for the entire family.
079073804X|5.0|I like this movie a lot.  It had some great scenes and a good story line.  I reccomend watching this BEFORE reading the book (if you do plan on reading it) because then you can't tell what will come next, and it just comes out a whole lot scarier.  And the book goes into more detail so you will still have more to look forward to. <br />If you are athiest or don't believe in possesion this probably isn't the movie for you.  But if you like any kind of monster flick you should like this.  It was very unique, I hadn't seen a movie like this before.   <br />Remember though, just because a lot of other people say it is the scariest movie doesn't mean you will think it is.  Even still, I would give it a shot.  If you do end up liking it you will have found a great horror story, if you don't you will have something to make fun of later.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Section 9's chief assigns Bato and his partner to investigate a series of murders involving robotic companions who end up killing their owners. Despite the manufacturer's recall and claims the androids are fine, the two agents uncover a scandal involving the gynoid's manufacturer (Locus Solus corp.), violent Yakuza gangsters, manipulative hackers as well as corrupt politicians and bureaucrats.   Ultimately, how I took the film's message is that it addresses a human being's will to survive while being critical of many legitimate and illegitimate elements of society. Overall, the film's massage is a commentary about humanity and individuality (which is the underlying message of both Ghost in the Shell movies).   I went to see this movie twice in the theaters and was very glad to pick it up on DVD. While I understand where the critics of the DVD are coming from, I disagree with many of their comments about the captions used in place of subtitles. To me, it makes no difference what is used for interpretation since ultimately you watch a movie for the cinematic experience not necessarily for the purpose of reading words on the bottom of your T.V. screen. None the less this film is certainly, as one reviewer put it, the 'gold standard' of anime since the animation is absolutely beautiful while the story itself is good with a neat philisophical twist to it. I was very impressed with the way the makers of this film were able to blend the 2d and 3d animation they used.   Overall I loved this film and recommend everyone see it on the DVD presently out and add it to your movie library despite its obvious flaws. I also felt Dreamworks did a good job of preserving the overall feel of the movie on the silver screen.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Groundhog Day was a Harold Ramis-Danny Green script that Ramis ingeniously shot in a freezing Woodstock, IL for a 1993 release. All the film critics at the time noted it as a cute romantic comedy with no particular accomplishment. Everyone I know who has seen it, myself included, liked it and smiled on their way out of the theatre. Groundhog Day is on the American calendar, and the film is often played on that day in mid-winter where those of us in colder climates are dreaming of Spring.  Today Groundhog Day is considered one of the great American Films of the late 20th Century.  Danny Rubin created the concept while Harold Ramis, co-writer of Animal House and Caddyshack broke away from his previous gross-comedy productions to direct his Opus Maximus.  That's how Jonah Goldberg of the National Review described it in the February 2005 issue of the Conservative magazine.    I read the 2003 New Yorker piece about Ramis.  Ramis is a Chicago born Jew with no religious training.  He is a Hollywood director, actor, and comedy scriptwriter.  He is presently studying Buddhism with his second wife. I don't know anything about Danny Rubin other than his version of the script had Andi MacDowell also reliving Groundhog Day along with Murray's Phil, the slimy weatherman for a Pittsburgh TV station.  Ramis made the necessary changes and the rest is possibly the greatest non-secular religious experience in American Cinema.  The fact that Rabbi's, Ministers, and Priests are showing this film to their parishioners all over the world is a testament to the film's masterful Aristotelian philosophy of redemption and rebirth.    There are so many classic comedy bits, lines to remember, and moments of hilarity for a short review but often overlooked is the theme of rescue through learning.  Adults are cursed to make the same mistakes over and over again.  Every Freudian shrink has heard his patient's repetition of behavior.  Every man is trapped by his wiring.  Then, sometimes, maybe because of a catastrophic event, a religious insight, or an intelligent evaluation, there is an epiphany.  We can't be sure how the application of intelligence, talent, or luck can establish great work, but we must appreciate it when we see it and be the Groundhog.
0385334206|3.0|This is the third Vonnegut I have read and I still can't figure out if I like the guy or not.   <br /> <br />It is a story(or is it?) about two insane lunatics who eventually cross paths.  One of these men is a science fiction writer named Kilgore Trout who can only get his work published as filler for pornography magazines.  The other is a wealthy widower who goes on a rampage because of Trout at the end of the story.  I'm not giving anything away by telling you this because Vonnegut tells you himself at the begining of the book. <br /> <br />The book is quick and simple to read, vulgar and laugh-out-loud funny.  It features crude drawings by Vonnegut and introduces many of its male characters by revealing the length and width of their penises.  It certainly is entertaining in a Farlly brothers kind of way but is it literature as many regard it?  I guess it could be a judgement on our culture but I certainly don't think he deserves the same respect as Thomas Hardy or Mark Twain.  His books really don't stay with me like Hardy's or Twain's do.  The only time I really recall them is when I see them sitting on my book shelf and think,
0553266306|4.0|''It was a cold October morning in Paris and even colder for a man about to be executed by the firing squad''.<br /><br />Thus begins the opening lines of an all time great bestseller and a benchmark as far as thriller writing is considered. Frederick Forsyth is one of my favourite thriller writers after Alistair Maclean. Read this novel and you would understand why.<br /><br />The book starts with a group called OAS, who plan to assasinate Charles de Gaulle. A bunch of fiercely committed French nationalists, they have never forgiven de Gaulle for this role in granting independence to Algeria. After the first abortive assasination attempt on De Gaulle, which results in the capture and execution of many of the group members, they decide to hire a professional mercenary to do the job.<br /><br />  And the man they find is an unknown, shadowy and ruthless mercenary called The Jackal. In fact none even knows what his real name is. But this guy has no idelogy nor associated with any ism. He is happy as long as he gets paid. And now starts the best part of the book. The Jackal liasions with a photographer to get a fake passport and identity. After getting which he promptly murders him. And soon the French police manage to get a lead on this. They track down a Polish guy who acts as a go between the gang and the Jackal. On interrogating him they learn the truth.<br /><br />And then starts the cat and mouse game between the cops and the Jackal leading to the climax.<br /><br />  The planning by the Jackal, the strategy adopted by him, and the investigation by the French cops are brilliantly describe in this book. And the climax is a real heart stopper. To enjoy all that you must read this book. The best thing i love about Forsyth's novels is the topicality he brings to his novels. Every minor detail is so brilliantly captured and he gives a real insightful look into the world of espionage and international politics. Once you read this book, its difficult to put it down. It grips your attention from the word go. So to all people who love thriller novels, read this book. Just dont miss it.tion from the word go. So to all people who love thriller novels, read this book. Just dont miss it.
0915811774|3.0|This is the second book by this author and I am enjoying this awakening experience.  Soul Love opened my eyes to reflecting on love, how to love even those I have not had positive experiences with, and much more.  This book helped me to see the love that is within myself and how to express it outwardly.  There were exercises to help one get in touch with what is within, unfortunately, for me, this exercise was repeated in its entirety in most every chapter.  I found myself trying to skip through and felt that perhaps it should have been just explained once or twice, then referred to or directed to thereafter.  Overall, this book was very enlightening and I look forward to reading more in this series.
B00078XGRO|5.0|But this--this movie turned me from being a casual Trek fan into a huge Trek fan. I saw this movie in the local theater at a formative age, and I remeber being amazed not only by the remarkable visual effects and perfect dramatic pace, but also by the intelligent story and rich character study. It has been noted that Star Trek movies can often turn into long episodes you have to pay to watch, but this movie certainly can't be accused of that--it's bold, daring, and exciting, not to mention nearly perfect. Nearly--there are a few minor logical flaws in the plot, but this movie truly is space opera, and as with most opera, you have to suspend your disbelief a little.    The movie revolves around Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) battling the Borg physically and psychologically. After foiling a Borg plot to assimilate Earth, the Borg go back in time to stop a pivotal moment in Earth's history from occurring, thus making Humanity an easy target. So, it's up to the Enterprise crew to a) get history back on track and b) defeat the Borg. It could easily have been standard-issue thriller material, but it is intelligently handled, emphasizing the characters rather than the action. We see Picard go from the stoic renaissance man to revenge-obsessed Ahab, and Data from loyal officer to Sampson (with the terrific Alice Krige supplying the Delilah as the sensual Borg Queen). The planet-side sequences have their moments, too, but like all the Next Generation movies, this is the Picard and Data show, and for good reason--the actors' obvious talent at making characters they had played for near a decade come up with new facets to explore. It's certainly a trip.    Of all the Next Generation movies (heck, all the Trek movies, excepting Wrath of Khan), this movie is the most evenly paced and best plotted. Considering that this movie underwent half a dozen different shifts in what it was meant to be about--at one point it was going to take place in the middle ages and be calledStar Trek: Renaissance--it's a testament to the actors and writers that the material never gets away from them--a temptation that proved all too powerful in the next installment (Insurrection). On the technical side, the direction from Jonathan Frakes (a.k.a. Commander Riker) is superlative--he manages to draw out Patrick Stewart's most complex performance as Picard, and the lighting, camerawork, and sound are all impeccable. The special effects, of course, are still impressive a decade later, thanks to George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic studios (this was the last Star Trek film they did). The Enterprise-E looks fabulous, and thankfully, there are no trips to Bronson Canyon in this movie (why do all the deserts in the Star Trek series look similar? Well...). Although it doesn't quite beat out the slightly more literate and philosophically dense Wrath of Khan for the title of Best Star Trek Movie, it finishes a solid second in my book. If you only buy one Star Trek movie, buy Wrath of Khan. But if you buy two, buy this one in addition to Wrath of Khan. You'll be really glad you did.
B0000640VO|5.0|I really don't have too much to say other than this movie was fabulous. In a period where movies are becoming less and less original, this was one of the most refreshing spins on a love story. You have to watch it to see it's simply remarkable.
B000001ELP|4.0|Wanna hear the sound of failure?  C'mon you know you DO!!!  This is one of those records, people.  I love it.  Kiss really were out of their depth on this, they tried SO hard. But I think it was the last great thing they did, even though it's horrible.  <br /> <br />I highly (hehe) recommend smoking weed and listening to it.  Just try not to crack up at the first track (when Paul's vocal comes in \\"In a far off galaxy..\\")  They were obviously trying to jump onto that George Lucas gravy, they have admitted many times that their demographics had shifted to a much younger audience at around Dynasty or so.  As so many Hollywood films pull out the tired \\"Chosen One\\" routine again and again, Kiss does this, too. I was about 8 or 9 when I first bought this thing, and even then, I was like WTF?! But I'll throw it on about once a year, purely for sh**ts and giggles.   <br /> <br />Buy it and be sure to play it for other people, and watch their reactions!
B00004XQP4|3.0|I haven't heard this album in its entirety yet so I'll just assume, like most Green Day, its a fun and conscise pop-punk record, with catchy riffs and great bass lines, but nothing thats going to change the course of rock and roll.  The real reason I'm writing is not to review the album.  Actually, I just want to ask if I am the only one that immediatley realized that the first track, \\"Warning\\", is a complete rip-off of \\"Picture Book\\" (from the Village Green Preservation Society) by the Kinks?  For the uneducated, thats the song on the HP digital photography commercials.  It's the same song with different lyrics.  Come on guys, P. Diddy already tried that, and God knows we don't need more P. Diddy's in the world!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|In brief... this is a wonderful PMG work. Reminds me of \\"Speaking Of Now\\" more than anything else, stretched to the next logical landscape. Many moments will have your mind wandering off into the PMG mythology, and many other places, but that's true of a lot of PMG work. Bravo!

B0001Z37HM|3.0|Though Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Kalidor in this movie rather than Conan, I always think of this movie as the third Conan movie.  Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman, who played Valeria in \\"Conan the Barbarian\\") takes an orb from a sort of temple of all women who plan to lock it away forever, coincidentally at the same time that Queen Gedren has come to steal it.  The orb has the power to destroy, and if left in the light too long it has the power to destroy the Earth.  We are introduced Red Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen) whose sister was one of the women in the temple and who has taken on the task of retrieving the orb before it can be used to destroy the Earth.  Naturally this quest is also Kalidor's, so though the two take separate paths, they all eventually end up in the same place.<br /><br />Along the way to Gedren's kingdom we encounter Prince Tarn (Ernie Reyes, Jr., \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II\\" and \\"Surf Ninjas) and his bodyguard and servant Falkon (Paul L. Smith).  Unfortunately, these two characters are the comic relief and while there are a few moments where they are at least humorous, it only takes a while for them to become tedious.<br /><br />The foursome travel to Queen Gedren's kingdom, all the while she continues to make the glowing orb more and more powerful.  She is also aware that Red Sonja and her party are on the way, and tries to prevent them from reaching her kingdom.  One of her attempts involves a giant wind-up toy that makes funny noises and swims in circles, often towing one or more characters from the movie.  Naturally Prince Tarn was part of the reason they encountered the beastie, and no matter how many times I tell him to go back, get out of the water, it just never seems to happen.<br /><br />Ultimately the crew reaches Queen Gedren, there is the obligatory big fight, and things mostly resolve themselves as you would probably expect.<br /><br />There are several remarkable and not-so-remarkable scenes in this movie.  In one of the better scenes the party travels across the backbone of some sort of ancient monster.  When Arnold encounters Red Sonja she is completing some sort of test to prove that she is ready to graduate from the \\"Funky Japanese Guy with Stuff Coming out of His Shoulders School of Mystical Sword Work.\\"  The arena in which she is fighting is cool, but for some reason they put a guy squatting over the entrance that looks to me like someone attempting to perform a bodily function, and I laugh every time I watch it.  The temple of warrior women at the beginning of the movie where the orb is located is also well done, both the interiors and exteriors.  I also thought Queen Gedren had a reasonably well-done castle.<br /><br />This movie has good points and awful points.  The fighting is generally well-done throughout, but there are the usual stupid points.  For example, the warrior women are surrounding the glowing orb, which they plan to lock in the dark forever.  It would seem to the average warrior that a lookout would be advisable.  Second, once the locking procedure started, followed by the attack, all one of the priestess-warriors had to do was kick the key into the same deep pit the orb was going to go into, and the orb would have been closed up while the fighting was going on.  Of course, that would have ended the movie and what fun would that have been.<br /><br />Another problem is that Queen Gedren had this orb with all kinds of power, along with a castle filled with soldiers, and yet she allowed Red Sonja to live, with more than a hint of Gedren's sexual orientation.  Given her megalomaniacal tendencies, you would have thought that Gedren would have summarily disposed of the group.  It just seems like you can't predict the behavior of psychopaths in movies (ever notice that?).<br /><br />Arnold movies usually introduce humor to keep the movie from being too serious, but this time some the humor was ill-timed and often ill planned.  Ernie Reyes, Jr. plays a comedic character, and detracts too much from the plot line.  Similarly, Paul Smith as Falkon was often for comedic effect, and it was too much like watching Laurel and Hardy do Conan rather than a typical Arnold movie.<br /><br />This movie ends up being a movie of contrasts.  The movie begins with an excellent premise.  Portions of the movie are fun to watch.  However, the campy portions drag down the good portions, and all of the potential of the movie is squandered in silliness.  Arnold Schwarzenegger was an excellent Conan, and this movie could easily have been a third Conan movie, particularly given that the two Conan movies were much better done than this movie.  I will recommend that you watch this movie, but do so as a rental rather than a purchase; you'll be happy you did.c character, and detracts too much from the plot line.

B0001O3YD0|5.0|Crash landing on a dry planet, a motley crew of space travellers have to band together and find a way of getting a convicted criminal (Diesel) to use his amazing speed and fighting skills to get them off planet. <br />A very enjoyable prequel to The Chronicles of Riddick.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|uve gotta smoke a lot of weed before watching this absolutely hillarious spoof on real movies. all of the characters are so absurd! the protagonist has a thick british accent and his tone is always stupidly calm in the most tense of situations. the woman, notoriously overrated bad actress g. paltrow, is a complete moron and says such garbage that makes you wonder if she has a head injury. you will want to strangle her 10 minutes into the movie, but that passion will only grow more intesne as she continues on her idiotic escapade. every time she says something it will feel like nails running down a chalkboard. i began immagining very horrible things happening to her, like some scissors flying out of nowhere and digging into the side of her neck, drilling through her soft, perfumed and makeuped skin. she is the worst actress in a recent major motion potion, and her character is amazingly annoying. but her hair never gets messed up, and her designer high heals are in top shape, and she always has some dumbass thing to say. also, they never eat, sleep, use the restroom, resupply... s really a relief when she shuts the fcuk up for a couple minutes. the guy with the british accent is stupid and annoying too, but hes also quite entertaining. he is quite good at fighting off big metallic robots with his bare hands! one of the german scientists gets electrocuted to death, but suddenly reapears, and does not speak english, and the other scientist turns into his interpreteer! finally at the end of the film, the brit punches the biatch in the face for her own good. from then on is a series of events that cannot be explained or described. if you want to feel a lot dumber, watch this sober. if you have a lot of high quality weed then this is will be one of the funniest movies you'll ever see. utterly ridiculous, but so so funny.

It's incredible and beautiful!
B00005JN2Z|4.0|When I get a Tom Cruise movie, I expected it to be well acted, to have a good story, and to be flawlessly made. I got my money's worth with Collateral.<br /><br />Cruise is a great villain, ruthless and human in the space of the same second. The interaction between him and Foxx is worth seeing as they ride around in a taxi, unseen and unremembered. To top it off, the ending is the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me; don't miss it.<br /><br />An upcoming actor who is worth seeing is Mark Ruffalo. He started as Jennifer Garner's boyfriend in 13 Going on 30, and then he tried his hand-and succeeded-in unrated territory with In the Cut, to be back in the role of the tough, good-hearted cop in Collateral.
B0002Z0EYA|1.0|This film is the most gargantic lump of human-secreted filth that has ever graced anyone's presence.  Greek myths are not stories that I enjoy seeing butchered by naked hasbeen Hollywood hunks and new emotionless pretty boys.  The actress who played Helen was quite unstunning, and the raving reviews I've heard about this film disgust me.  This film disgusts me, and if you like it, YOU ALSO DISGUST ME.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly unique film. Not just because of it's subject matter (drug use is hardly infrequent in films these days), but because of the feeling it gives the viewer during and for a long time after the film has ended. <br /> <br />The best word to describe Requiem is 'heartbreaking'. It is shocking, disturbing, moving and heartbreaking. I won't give too much away but the feeling you get once the film has ended is one of extreme emptiness. I didn't know how to feel after the first time I'd watched it. I cried like a baby, but I felt more than just sadness. The second time I watched it, I watched the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the last fifteen minutes. The contrast is incredible, and it was this that made me feel so empty. <br /> <br />The acting is amazing. Marlon Wayans was excellent in a serious role, Jared Leto was perfect as Harry, who wants to do right by his loved ones and get rich at the same time. Jennifer Connelly portrays strong-willed Marion, who ultimately loses her dignity to get her fix. One of the most shocking things other than the film itself is the fact that Ellen Burstyn was overlooked for the Best Actress Oscar. How the Academy could have thought anyone gave a better performance that year (or any other year for that matter) is beyond me. Her portrayal of Harry's desperately lonely mother is the key to this film being so powerful. <br /> <br />Requiem for a Dream is a tragic film that grabs your emotions from the very beginning, takes them on a roller-coaster, then squeezes the life out of them before battering them to a pulp. The most incredible, breathtaking and ultimately heartbreaking film I've ever seen, and one that will remain at the top of my favourite films list for a long time to come. You may not be able to watch it more than once but I urge anyone to rent it out and give yourself the cinematic experience of a lifetime.  <br /> <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I think the operative word for Pat and Lyle's latest offering is \\"symphonic\\". This is a large, sprawling epic that is full of twists and turns which continually offers surprises with repeated listening. There are sounds and sound effects that, honestly, I've never heard before. I think that what may make some listeners uneasy is that there really is nothing to \\"grab on to\\" throughout the recording. Earlier Metheny recordings (i.e. the white \\"Pat Metheny Group\\" album), are full of memorable hooks and melodies that, like so many Beatles songs, can instantly be remembered and carried with you. This latest offerring has very little, if any, memorable melodies and musical \\"hooks\\". However, this is not, I beleive, how this CD should be approached. Rather, it should be seen for what it is, which is an aural landscape, a musical journey that carries the listener along for the ride, a ride that is at times gentle and at other times fast paced and energetic. It is as if you are on a river boat, being carried swiftly along with the current, watching the changing cities and landscapes pass by as if they were memories. In a way, it makes more sense to approach this from a classical music point of view, and see it  as a large, continuous composition rather than radio-ready attention grabing songs. If Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays were to \\"write\\" a musical autobiography, this would be it. Enjoy!
B00003CWL6|5.0|A film like this not only entertains while you're in the theater but also drops subtle questions in your head about the nature of human behavior and the gulf between fantasy and reality. After watching this movie, viewers will think long and hard about their own lives as well as the lives of people around them. The movie spells out the social disillusionment phenomenon everyone experiences but can't really grasp. <br /> <br />American Beauty reminds us that, like Lester, we really have no idea what we really want. We're not rational creatures as economists assume we are. Our instinct might lead us to perform one action, yet our brains might tell us to perform the complete opposite. We may lust after material belongings, yet how do we know we will still treasure those material belongings once we obtain them? Lester may lust after Angela, yet once he feels her in his hands and finds out the truth about her sexuality, an entirely different feeling comes over him. <br /> <br />Ricky Fits, the drug-dealing boy next door, is able to look beyond conventional notions of attractiveness and find beauty in non-promiscuous, solemn girls as well as in plastic bags floating in the wind. When many criticize the movie, they say, \\"Where's the beauty in a plastic bag?\\" And that's the point. We live in a world of aesthetic subjectivism. What one person finds attractive, another may find repulsive, yet the urge is there for people to assume aesthetic absolutism. \\"It's just a plastic bag! How can there be beauty in it?\\" Well, a human being is just an aggregation of tissues, bones, and blood. How is that attractive? It depends on how you look at it. Reality is shaped by perspective. <br /> <br />Some people criticize the Ricky Fits character because he records his life experiences on tape and doesn't actually experience them. But time moves inexorably in one direction. Time cannot be stopped. In a physical sense the past and the future don't exist. We are only conscious in the present. Everything we do, everything we achieve, every bit of happiness we experience -- they are all eventually buried in the past by time. Recording subjective beauty is a means by which one can attempt to salvage beauty from the past into the present because time eventually destroys all beauty. If you don't believe me, walk into a pre-school and then walk into a nursing home. Remember that all the old men and women in the nursing home were once little kids. <br /> <br />Another profound element of American Beauty is in the tag line: look closer. An individual's behavior is not independent of his environment. Humans are conformists by nature, and humans will modify their behavior to assimilate into existing social categories. If any individual dares to stray from the category to which he has been assigned, he is shouted down and ostracized. No one can resist the urge to conform, so why bother? Everyone is nice in public, yet on the streets they blare their horns, scream, and swear. Some boys I know pretend to hate American Beauty because on the surface it seems like a \\"chick flick.\\" They force themselves to watch gory horror movies and show off to others how they can stomach intense violence and excessive sex scenes. In American Beauty, Angela acts like a total slut, as many girls seem to nowadays. In the end, however, she is not what she makes herself out to be. Colonel Fits tries to act like such a man, yet in the end it's all just a giant facade. Civilization is but one giant movie, and members of society must start acting their parts if they want to belong to this civilization. Otherwise, they're outsiders. Try walking into a job interview without a tie. You'll be thrown out. That is the power of convention. <br /> <br />What if I asked you this question: What do you want in life? Most people would say, \\"happiness.\\" But is happiness worth deluding yourself for? Carolyn Burnham shields herself from sadness by adopting a positive-thinking philosophy, a philosophy of self-affirming mantras and harsh self-discipline. Positive thinking may help you attain your goals, but positive thinking also blinds you from reality. Is it wise or moral to change the channel when you hear about mass starvation in Africa so you can enjoy moments of fleeting happiness from a cheap romance movie? Self-help is just a euphemism for self-deception. All humans need some complex fraud to distract them from the harsh and nihilistic realities of life, whether it's religion, money, or even love. <br /> <br />In spite of American Beauty's greatness, there are problems. Characters are stereotypical, but viewers will hardly notice unless they're ultra-critical. Anyway, exaggeration is essential in satire so that certain points are made obvious to viewers. Furthermore, Alan Ball's original screenplay is slightly edited. The ending is more optimistic and doesn't quite fit in with the movie's overall nihilistic themes. Ball's true message, therefore, is slightly blurred because we don't know whether his message came from his heart or from the portion of his brain that maximizes profits. <br /> <br />Problems aside, Sam Mende's debut movie is one of the greatest I've seen. Not only is it entertaining but it is also filled with ideas you can think about. It's an important film for society because there's so much society needs to learn. One girl I knew refused to watch American Beauty because, as she said, \\"I'm not gonna watch a movie with a name like that!\\" <br /> <br />Look closer. <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|I am serious when I say this cd is awesome. Some of you have probably seen the I'm not okay video on MTV or Fuse or something but that is their lightest song. Everyother one is hard solos, awesome riffs and depressing lyrics. I cant stop listening to this cd. I got this cd and had it for three months and when i bought the used cd which i listened to once and put this cd back in. You need this cd if you like stuff like this and if you dont (like i didnt) try it out.
B000002GW5|5.0|I played this record so much,I had to buy another one untill CD's came out.Not a day goes by that you don't hear \\"Running on empty\\"or \\"Stay\\"playing on the radio,but there are so many other great cuts,\\"Rosie\\" being my favorite.\\"I got to Hand It to me\\"GREAT LINE,and GREAT CD.
B0002OERI0|5.0|At the beginning of 2004, my favorite cd was Blink 182.  Towards the summer and middle of 2004, I was really into Yellowcard.  Now, at the end of 2004 and beginning of 2005, I LOVE GREEN DAY.   I think they are my favorite out of all of them.  I bought their Superhits two days after getting American Idiot.  This is the coolest cd i've ever heard.  Even if you like President Bush and you like this music, you will like this cd, because i don't have a problem with Bush.  The music and lyrics are soooo good. <br /> <br />1. American Idiot   8/10 <br />The title track is a good song that you have probably heard on the radio.  It is a cool song and fun to sing along to, but i found that it gets old fast. <br /> <br />2. Jesus Of Suburbia  10/10 <br />This is nine minutes of one of the best songs ever.  From the up-tempo pop rock sound of Jesus of Suburbia, to the piano rock of City of the Damned, to the harder rock sound of I Don't Care and Tales From Another Broken Home, and even the almost acapella Dearly Beloved, this is one the coolest songs I've ever heard.  MAKE A VIDEO FOR THIS SONG! <br /> <br />3. Holiday  9/10 <br />The intro riff of this song is awesome.  It has a good beat and is fun to sing along with.  Awesome song. <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams 100000000000/10 <br />If anyone doesn't like this song, you might as well jump off your roof because this is the best song ever.  Hands down.  Un-freaking-believable.  No words can describe.   <br /> <br />5. Are We The Waiting      9/10 <br />This song reminds me of a song that you would wave a lighter to at a concert.  Slow and mellow with great background vocals.   <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy  10/10 <br />This is a classic punk sound.  Fast drums and power chords.  It has cool lyrics and is a good song. <br /> <br />7. Give Me Novacaine  12/10 <br />Don't even get me started on this song.  It's my second favorite, next to the best song ever written (Boulevard of Broken Dreams), it's a nice acoustic sound that goes into a more rock sound and has cool lyrics. <br /> <br />8. She's A Rebel  10/10 <br />This is another punk song, but is more pop punk than St. Jimmy like Blink.  It's a really good song though. <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl 9/10 <br />This is probably the most poppy song on the album.  But it's still a good song, with catchy lyrics and melodies. <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb  8/10 <br />This song did not really catch my interest.  Good song though, of course. <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends  10/10 <br />This is the song Billie wrote for his dad who passed away in his childhood.  (This is what I heard anyway)  It is an amazing song with heartfelt lyrics and a cool sound. <br /> <br />12. Homecoming   9/10 <br />Green Day's second nine minute long song.  Not nearly as good as Jesus of Suburbia. <br /> <br />13. Whatsername  9/10 <br />A cool song with cool lyrics, but not the way i would have ended the album. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is well worth whatever it will cost you.  It had no dissapointing songs and is and will be one of my favorite cds.   10/10 <br /> <br />

B00068IOWC|1.0|U2 were surely among the best musicians during those 80s and 90s years. And now what? Is this the best that they can do? Aren't they ashamed of themselves? And what about you, U2 fans?

The reviewers whom seem to agree with me are right, you are trying to persuade yourself it is.

Secondly, they lack ideas and inspiration. <br /> <br />But, more importantly, the quality of their music has so clearly decreased, because songs like 'Vertigo' and 'All Because Of You' do NOT have the \\"sound that made them one of the worlds biggest bands in the eighties\\", (how can some fans say that 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' is the 'One' or 'With Or Without You' of this collection, that is almost criminal).

B0002OERI0|4.0|Emerging gently (albeit not too subtly) out of the studio and back into a direly parched music scene, Green Day have awakened from their four-year hibernation to crank out and polish a freshly slick album which goes back to the pop-punk roots with fast, catchy melodies and exsertile bar-chords. Taking (...) and giving it both a social agenda angrier and more epic than that of its predecessor, Armstrong, Cool and Dirnt have slowly graduated from the beginnings of sarcastic bursts about teenage boredom and issues, to the somewhat encompassing premise of social alienation, entropy and deceit, seen through the eyes of the fictional character \\"Jimmy\\", who appears throughout many (if not, all) of the songs on American Idiot. Whether he is supposed to be an actual person or merely a scapegoat for the politics Green Day are trying to tackle, the formula seems tight and works in equilibrium with the music itself.    The idea is a little intimidating, given the sudden move Green Day have chosen to make, but it helps to make listenable and enjoyable tunes out of songs that may not have suited the usual Billie Joe treatment. Armstrong has done some incredible work with the lyrics, straying from formula and showing absolute command and mastery of his craft. As many bands do in the latter years of their prime, Green Day have brought a twist to the genre they helped to create by spicing up the record with varied instruments, synthesized effects, intricate song work and experimental harmony; the tendrils of this powerful album extend into pristine, crisp sound delivery and something of a wonderfully produced record.    This latest effort is a relief; it's both a throwback to their earlier works (and many by other artists), and a clean take on a concept that's often difficult to pull off tastefully.    Speaking of which . . . a star taken for the stinker:  Pulverize the Eiffel Towers, who criticize your government.

B0006GAI6Y|3.0|This movie is not really bad at all...sort of predictable in my opinion...so you know what is going to happen and why it happened. It was a good natured film, I would recommend it for anyone...even the kids...even though it is a Pg-13 rating, I see no problem with a kid under 13 watching this film, and I am a father of a 9 year old...great choregraphy in the film as well.  <br />Wish I could have seen a better acting performance from J Lo.  <br />Blonde lady in the film is really funny!!!
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 were surely among the best musicians during those 80s and 90s years. And now what? Is this the best that they can do? Aren't they ashamed of themselves? And what about you, U2 fans? I've been checking out some of the reviews here, and I sit in disbelief as I read lines like \\"back at their best\\", \\" great album\\": what are you talking about? Can you compare this stuff to Achtung Baby, The Joshua Tree or Pop?. Do you really believe this s**t is good?. The reviewers whom seem to agree with me are right, you are trying to persuade yourself it is. Because it's not.  <br /> <br />Firstly, it's too commercial, and that's proved by the huge financial investment on videos, aimed to target those persons who form their music culture by watching MTV (the same ones who think Britney Spears, Blink 182, Maroon 5 or Robbie Williams are the best musicians around). Secondly, they lack ideas and inspiration. <br /> <br />But, more importantly, the quality of their music has so clearly decreased, because songs like 'Vertigo' and 'All Because Of You' do NOT have the \\"sound that made them one of the worlds biggest bands in the eighties\\", (how can some fans say that 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' is the 'One' or 'With Or Without You' of this collection, that is almost criminal). Here are a bunch of insipid tunes which meander about without ever really finding a decent melody. 'Vertigo', 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own', 'A Man And A Woman', 'Love And Peace Or Else', 'One Step Closer' and 'Original Of The Species' are perhaps the most undertuneful worst songs ever made by U2.  <br /> <br />This latest \\"effort\\"is frankly insulting. A low-octane rehash of the ideas on the lame All That You  Can't Leave Behind. None of those commercial tracks stand out and slap you in the face at all. Moreover, it's absolutely irritating to listen to Bono straining his thin voice to hit the high notes. <br /> <br />Yet some people pretend to like this album because it is U2 and no matterwhat they ever release it will be liked... Sheeps.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the dregs of At The Drive-In regroup to create The Mars Volta, a band who you can listen to and never hear another band like it. Beautiful lyrics, constant changes, and brilliant instrumentals, all come together to form this unique sound, but you walk away from De-Loused asking yourself, \\"What does this stuff mean?\\" That, my friends, is the mark of brilliance, it leaves you guessing.
0553573403|5.0|If you are worn out with the typical fantasy story, but find yourself going back to the genre because you like the whole good vs evil thing, this book will be a pleasant suprise for you!. If however you are easily offended, some of the laguage and sexual content may put you off. Let me reiterate, this is not a book for your kids. This is a book that keeps you guessing, people die, good guys, bad guys and pets. This is just the begginning of a very long and uncompleted story, but a very rewarding read.If you want something different,that still has swords, horses, politics, love, hate and hope, try this one on for size!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Modern life tends to both alienate and artificially insulate middle-class kids. It would help if everybody were required to watch the movies Napoleon Dynamite, Rushmore, and read the novel Catcher in the Rye. <br /> <br />These three works, more than most any others, put you in the skin of similarly alienated and isolated adolescents, and make it clear that whoever you are, all you can do is your best (like Napoleon and Rushmore's Max Fisher, unlike Catcher's Holden Caulfield). <br /> <br />Speaking of Napoleon Dynamite specifically, let me just say that while far from a perfect product, this film restored my faith in the System to find and reward the efforts of those who ignore the big studio gate-keepers and star-driven, formulaic, Hollywood pablum machine. <br /> <br />I hope others with similar vision will be encouraged by the success of this film and take a chance -- and that those with the resources will take a chance on them.
B00004TDTO|4.0|From all the hype surrounding this cult classic, I thought this would be the scariest movie ever.  Boy, was I wrong!  Sure, it's entertaining enough, but in a more \\"shark in the water!\\" than a genuine scare-your-pants-off way.  Not to say I did NOT enjoy it, but I've seen much more \\"I'm never gonna go to sleep again\\" movies.  Jaws is indeed a classic ~ but not a horror classic in my opinion.
B000068MKZ|5.0|You don't need to speak French to understand this one.  <br /> <br />Norah Jones is about the closet thing I can think of to compare this CD to. If you like Norah, you will like this. <br /> <br />It's like getting a massage from a European Supermodel who doesn't speak English.  <br /> <br />A beautful woman with a beautiful voice that breaks in all the right places.
B00069YE0W|4.0|This CD took a couple listens and after that, I liked it more and more. Some songs were instant standouts such as 'The Past Recedes', Ascention, and 'Leap Your Bar'. Some tracks take a minute to get going, such as 'Anne' and 'A Name', but when they do, they become standouts as well. Some classic Frusciante playing on here ( 2:22 into Anne ) and that piano on Leap Your Bar is haunting and hits hard. I'm sad to know this is the \\"last\\" release in the series. What a year for John and his fans.
6301966015|4.0|I first saw this movie several decades ago.  I only recall that I came away thinking, \\"What the heck was THAT all about?\\".  I decided to give it another try and I'm glad I did.  This movie has its' faults which include the dated surroundings.  One gets the feeling that it starts out as another Austin Powers movie.  It's too 60's not to be at least somewhat distracting.  The movie is disjointed, the interpersonal interactions seem so phony, and the plot is too haphazard.  The problem in assessing these later points is in determining whether it is the fault of or the purpose of the director that they end up this way.  The point of the movie (that was lost on me the first time I saw it) is the emptiness of our lives and their purpose.  We certainly get this impression (at least if we watch the movie a second time) but could the movie have been more fluid in presenting its' message.  I believe it could but I'm not sure that Antonioni was the director who could achieve that.   <br /> <br />This is a colorful movie that appeals to the eyes.  I was focussed on a particular scene where all building were a bright shade of red for blocks and blocks.  I think that this was another message from the director that the facade may be appealing but that doesn't mean that there's anything of substance within.  There are a lot of hipsters (ala 1960's style) who also demonstrate this point quite effectively.  Their mindless pursuit of the moment ultimately conveys a sense of pointless boredom.  My favorite scene was the one in which the Yardbirds were playing.  One of the band members (if I were really hip I would have recognized him by name) got fed up with some equiptment problems and busted his guitar.  He then threw the neck of the guitar out to the audience who tussled over it until our \\"hero\\" got is and dashed off pursued by other who desperately wanted that souvenir.  After he made his escape, he tossed it aside as though it were trash.  A bystander picked it up and, after looking it over, tossed it away as well.  What a comment that was about our fleeting sense of values!  One moment an icon, the next moment junk. <br /> <br />There actually is a sort of plot but, although it creates additional messages, is the sort of thing that leaves us (intentially?) unfulfilled.  The ending gives us a view of the phoniness of our lives.  Given the opportunity to be merely an observer or a participant is the choice that we seem to be left with.   <br /> <br />I think that all of this could have been done in a different format.  The points could still have been made even if the movie were allowed to flow better and the plot were allowed to consummate itself.
B000050FEN|5.0|Pitt,Freeman,Spacey, and Paltrow...not to mention the rest of this ensemble cast of actors and actresses.  People, this is the most effed up ending to a story ever written.  This movie isn't exactly your \\"cliche\\" murder mystery ending.  The movie grabs you right from the beginning with that darky, gloomy backround and rainy weather.  I was anticipated to see each deadly sin unraveled throughout the story.  Each sin was maginficently presented in a specific fashion.  Take for instance..Lust.  That was so crazy when Pitt and Freeman went to this underground nightclub/nude bar and loud techno music was blaring in the backround when they saw the dead prostitute and a delirious guy screaming.  The ending was brilliant.  Nobody can ever write a better ending to a story.  The ending pulled me in and never pulled me out.  The movie did something to my head psychologically speaking that I can't ignore.  Pitt unwinded in a frenzy which unfortunately I haven't seen him do in any other films.  In conclusion this isn't a popcorn movie with your girlfriend, nor this isn't a movie you watch with Dad and Mom on a Tuesday night.  This movie is geared for a stormy/rainy/cloudy day and you're in for a thriller.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|The Way Up defies mere words. Perhaps only Haiku can describe its beauty and brilliance, and the intangible complexities of its layers.    Listening to The Way Up is like driving along Highway One in California. The sheer magnitude of the work is almost beyond human comprehension. We stand in awe, from a distance, wanting to understand but never really knowing.    While I love almost everything the PMG produces, this album will bring tears to your eyes. The only thing better is to see it live. Then, you may cry like a baby when it's over.    If you are privileged to stand, humbly, before the magnificent musicscape, you, too will bask in its perfection.
B000002MP2|5.0|My first album was American Idiot and I thought it was the best album I have heard in a long time... I thought I had to listen to GD old stuff so I bought International Superhits, Shenanigans and then Dookie...and of course once I get enough savings, I'll splurge on Warning, Insomniac and Nimrod.  <br /> <br />However, after listening to Dookie, I realised how much faster GD used to be... and GD used to be more light-hearted. American Idiot was already a 5 star album and this deserves more than just 5. Though the songs begin to sound like the same thing after some time, it was still stuck to my cd player because Dookie is just so great to listen to while sitting in the bus to go to school. <br /> <br />My personal fave songs from Dookie are Burnout - a great way to kickstart a punk album, then Chump+Longview.. I love how they fused together, and I keep anticipating for the last track and I refuse to fast forward to it... All by myself sounds so cute and I always laugh to it. <br /> <br />Buy it. It's a must! The only bad thing about this album is that, I wish it could be longer...couldnt get enough of Dookie even after weeks of playing it.
B0000024K1|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite albums.  Aside from Chuck D. actually rhyming about things that matter, Terminator X's work on the wheels of steel is more original than almost anything else that's been in the mainstream (with the exception of DJ Hurricane on the Beastie Boys' \\"Paul's Boutique\\" album).  I have spent a very long time trying to get all of the samples, and I have recognized a bunch of them so far (Queen's \\"Flash,\\" Run-DMC's \\"Sucker MCs,\\" Kool & the Gang's \\"Who's Gonna Take the Weight,\\" the Temptations' \\"I Can't Get Next to You,\\" etc.)  Based alone on the influence that this album has had, this album deserves to be among the greatest albums of all time.
B00005R8GU|5.0|All the song on this album are awesome.  And Muddy was a giant - no one else quite like him.  When I first heard his music, I didn't have real appreciation for his craft, but after I made another pass, I started really falling in love with Muddy's music.  Next thing you, I couldn't stop listening.  Granted, I am a blues fan and listen to lots of blues, and I have known who were into rock, and they loved Muddy's records.  This album has Muddy at his peak, giving it his all.  Like another reviewer here, I was totally taken by the LIVE version of \\"Long Distance Call\\" recorded at Super Cosmic.  You really cannot turn up the volume on this song enough!  The guitar work, Muddy's howling, the audience's (due) wild response, and the grand finish...  This recording is in a whole class by itself.  Buy it.  I also recommend Muddy's full 2-disc anthology.
1592400876|4.0|The author makes some mistakes, true, but this book is badly needed when it seems punctuation is hardly taught in some schools any more.  <br /> <br />If it is not the perfect book on style (That would be Strunk and White's timeless little classic \\"The Elements of Style\\")it is still a great deal better than nothing and makes many good points.  <br /> <br />Bad style and punctuation are not small and pedantic issues - ultimately they affect out ability to both communicate and think. Bad writing leads in the end to a culture of morons. <br /> <br />Lynne Truss writes from England, where with a rotten and collapsing education system things are pretty bad, but this book is needed all over the English-speaking world. She quotes this from the allegedly high-brow British paper, The Guardian: <br /> <br />\\"The society decided not to prosecute the owners of the Windsor Safari Park, where animals, have allegedly been fed live to snakes and lions, on legal advice.\\" <br /> <br />That's one of the linguistic barbarities she skewers. There are plenty more.  <br /> <br />Please, if you have aspirations to be any sort of writer, master what is said here - criticise it after that if you like. <br /> <br />
0060594888|2.0|Though Canfield makes some good points and presents some important information in this book, there's just too much here, a lot of it unnecessary, even boring.  Many anecdotes, personal stories, and stories of others could have, and should have, been left out.  While reading the book, I often felt as if I were simply just indulging Canfield while he talked about himself.  The book is also suspiciously similar to the Har-Money Cards, which have been out for at least ten years.  If you want 64 prosperity principles presented simply and eloquently, get the Cards, and don't waste days with Canfield's book.
0670033375|5.0|I'm not sure if I agree with everything in this book but it is so full of interet I'll give it five stars anyway. The subject of how societies Choose to fail or Succeed is one we need to look at pretty searchingly today, with \\"failed states\\" littering the third world and deepening crises in much of Europe, and the author, in the tradition of his earlier books, has done a thorough and thought-provoking job.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Save your time and your money.  Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a waste of both.  Clearly Gibson recognized the lesson of James Cameron's Titanic; people will layout big bucks to see a well-known story made \\"real\\" by applying the visuals.   <br /> <br />Banking on the fact that the world's Christians would pay to see the passion made \\"real\\", Mel has cranked out an evil and ugly movie; dark, haunted and brutal, backed by a dissonant rock music track.  I assume the point was to show Jesus' suffering in a manner that would enhance the faith of the viewer, by allowing us to witness the suffering first hand.   The film requires that one know the story.  Without a Christian background, it is completely disjointed and out of context. <br /> <br />The tragedy of the final product is best understood if one tries to see the film as a nonbeliever.  I suggest this approach, because the believer sees a confirmation of their faith, not the actual film.  They see the film as a historically accurate portrayal of the story they know.  It is anything but that. <br /> <br />The inaccuracies begin with language.  While the Hebrews of the period did indeed speak Aramaic, the official administrative language of Judea was Greek.  Pilate would have addressed the Jewish crowd in Greek. <br /> <br />There is no scriptural evidence or indication of the mysterious relationship between Jesus and his Mother; nothing that says she knew he was imprisoned below ground, nothing that says she was present when he was scourged, much less mopped up his blood. <br /> <br />The books of Matthew and Mark say simply, that He was \\"scourged.\\"  In Roman law this was typically done with a reed, which is consistent with the Gospels.  The varieties of implements used in Gibson's portrayal are a choice he made to make the scourging more brutal and therefore more \\"real\\".  There is nothing in the scripture that indicates the Roman guards took such delight in beating him and nothing that indicates that they had to be ordered to stop. <br /> <br />The Bible says, they mocked Him, spat on Him and put the crown of thorns on His head.  There is no scriptural indication that they were beating Him at every step on the way to Golgotha.  These are dark fictions. <br /> <br />Dark fiction may, after all, have been the point.  Gibson's most disturbing contrivance is the constant presence of evil, personified as an androgynous Satan.  He is present at Gethsemane, he is present throughout Jesus suffering, mocking, almost gloating.  At one point he/she mockingly appears as a Satanistic parody of the Madonna and Child.  In the garden, when Satan reaches for Jesus with a serpent, its head is crushed, but to no avail.  As the movie progresses, time and again, the images of evil triumph.   <br /> <br />In the end, Mary is seen kissing the foot of Christ on the cross; His blood on her face, in her mouth and she almost licks her lips!   <br /> <br />This is why I suggest trying to see this work through non-Christian eyes, because in doing so, absent the context of the rest of the Bible, this is a story in which evil triumphs. <br /> <br />Your money and your time would be much better spent on a copy of Ishtar with Warren Beatty. <br />
B000069HPL|5.0|I Love this Movie and all the Characters in it.  I recommend this to anyone who loves good Comedy.
B0006AZMFM|5.0|The problem with online reviewing is no one has to see you or actually hear the words coming out of your mouth. If any of you with negative things to say heard what you were actually saying, would it still matter as much? Music is music. It's there for fun, for feeling, for depressions, for relaxation. You people spend too much time worrying about the personal lives of you so-called favorite celebrities to actually concentrate on the music. so what if Delta is depressed? It's her right to be so. And why should it matter to you? If the music doesn't get you through a hard time, make you feel better, then don't listen to it. No one's forcing you.  <br />Take some advice. Turn off the TV. Put down the tabloid magazine. Concentrate on Music. Concentrate on the voice, the band, the lyrics. And if you can't do that, you shouldn't be writing a review for anything. <br /> <br />ps - Delta rocks!!!
B00005JMUA|3.0|Apparently, Tarantino had too much material to make one movie. However, it seems that there isn't enough to make two movies. Although the film has some great moments, and a fantastic soundtrack, it ends up being drawn out in places. Obviously, the interest in seeing this film, to most people, is to find out 'how it ends'. The last scenes between Thurman and Carradine are positively soporific. Too much small talk. Personally, I feel that Tarantino could have achieved just as much by making one epic volume....and cutting out the trivia of the second film.
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|If you like old-fashioned epics with casts of thousands and a storyline full of heroes, this 2004 film is for you.  It's almost three hours long but the time does fly.  There are battles and swordsmanship and characters spouting lines that are so overdone that I burst out laughing.  But who really cares about historical context in a film like this?  And if the nuances seem a little modern for this 3000-year-old myth by Homer, it doesn't really matter. When he wrote it, little did he know that it had all the makings of a Hollywood spectacle, including a romance at its core. This is when one of the princes of Troy, after a couple of nights of stolen passion, whisked away the beautiful Helen who was married to the King of Sparta.  Later, Troy would eventually be destroyed because of this and everyone watching the film probably knew that but yet, it's great fun to see how it all plays out.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is cast as Achilles, a warrior for the Spartans who is having second thoughts about the wisdom of serving his king. It's obvious he's been to the gym because of his defined muscles and a body shape crafted by a personal trainer and vitamin supplements. He's also been trained in swordplay and there is one scene in which he is teaching his younger male cousin to fence which might be viewed as homo-erotic.  However, there are other scenes in which he defines himself as a man who loves women, especially in the scene in which he seduces the young female cousin of the King of Troy.<br /><br />The performance of the woman cast as Helen and her Prince lover plays like amateur hour.  However, Eric Bana, an actor I have never seen before, is cast as Hector, the prince's older brother.  His performance is masterful and his presence dominated every scene he was in.  But as far as I'm concerned, the very best performance of all was by Peter O'Toole, cast as the King of Troy.  There is one scene in particular, in which he begs Achilles, who has just murdered the king's son Hector, for the right to give his Hector a dignified burial.  Shakespearian in nature, this is a scene I will long remember.<br /><br />This film can be enjoyed only if you don't think about historical reality and just relax and watch the forces of lust and revenge and warfare and pomp and glitter let you forget that this film is downright silly.  Of course Troy falls far short of my highest recommendation, but frankly, I recommend you see it anyway.  It's a pleasant diversion and an evening's entertainment.Hector, for the right to give his Hector a dignified burial.

B000002KIE|5.0|Never Mind the Bollocks is the complete antithesis to Sgt.Pepper. And thats the point. No other punk album defined so clearly the attitude and paradigm of the punk's rejection of the failed counter-culture revolution then Bollocks. Though other bands covered more ground musically and socially over time than the Sex Pistols, none captured the frustrated and radical spirit of the era more precisely. When I first heard Bollocks all I heard was a wall of noise. But wantonly the pattern emerges from the chaos and a masterful portrait of mutation in underground culture is heard. No musical library is complete without this album.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I am just so stunned by this music; it moves me so powerfully that I am nearly speechless. Pat and Lyle and the band have become one instrument; the integration and balance of their voices is effortless yet taught with surprise and anticipation. There is a level of harmony here that is overwhelming at times, playful, intensely intellectual, melodies that only Pat Metheny can breathe life into.  This is the jazz opus of the year and of his career. Pat Metheny is the modest Mozart of the modern jazz era. Pure genius.
B000060P79|5.0|You all coming cretesizing Simple Plan's music and song topics but then again are Korn or Slipknot better? making noise instead of music and singing about death and about the end of the world?

B0002WYS6S|5.0|The king of all bands, Dream Theater, managed to record on April 26th, at the Budokan, their best live show ever. There are some key aspects that make this DVD so special. <br />1) The most important point, John Myung can be heard. Dream Theater has never released material in which you can clearly listen to Myung's mad bass playing. I don't know why, but they are the only progressive band I know who does that. Other similar (but never as great as DT) bands like Symphony X and Spiral Architect DO give various opportunities to their bass players to show what they can really do. If I am not mistaken, Dream Theater has only given two solos in their studio albums which is an irrespect to such a musician. <br />2) LaBrie's singing is flawless. He has always been criticized because he can not hit some high-pitch notes in their live presentations. Well, in Budokan, he proves all of those people wrong.  <br />3) Instrumedly. Definitively a highlight.  It is a fusion of all of the instrumentals Dream Theater has ever done, plus Paradigm Shift and Universal Mind from Liquid Tension Experiment. Majestic. <br />4) A down-side. The Japanese crowd is cheerful enough.  Don't expect a Rush In Rio type of audience. This one is disciplined, attentive, and respectful, which reflects the culture of Japan.  <br />In conclusion, I would have changed the repertoire a little bit. I mean, why play New Millenium over Fatal Tragedy, and other specific cases. The John's, Mike, and Jordan are impeccable. So is LaBrie. The second DVD is full of enterating material. The camara job is superb. The direction, done by drummer Mike Portnoy, is as good as it gets. <br />The bottom line, Live At Budokan is \\"one hell of a show\\" (James LaBire).

B0006OBPTA|4.0|If you're like me you'll be buying this mostly to get the first film in widescreen. Or if you're not like me you're buying this because you're a big fan of \\"The Next Karate Kid\\"!!!  Seriously though the main appeal of this set for me was to get the first film in widescreen. I wasn't however, expecting the running commentary to be as fun as it is. Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita and the director and the writer are all on hand to provide insight. What makes the commentary so great is that unlike some commentaries they are able to laugh at certain scenes and point out things that even they thought were unbelieveable (the scene with the bottles on the truck). Morita and Macchio clearly formed a strong bond making the movies and their admiration for one another shows in the commentary. Since it is the first film that will be the draw here, that is the disc with all the bells and whistles. The other three films have no extras to speak of. By now everyone knows the story of Daniel and Mr. Miyagi and the powerful friendship they build. I was 13 when the first film came out and watching it again after 20 years it still packs a punch or should I say a kick! You'll want this set for the first film and maybe the second. I've never seen the third or fourth so I can't comment on those two. But it is a nice set and a great film of believing in oneself and the power of friendship.

The film is extremely violent with loads of gore including exploding heads, mutilation, eyeball ripping to more that nearly got this movie an NC-17 rating.

B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater's third studio album is also arguably their best. It is over 75 minutes long and really complex, but if you give it a chance it is very rewarding. Many have said that this is a heavier side of Dream Theater, but that is not true. In fact, it isn't much heavier than \\"Images and Words.\\" What is noticeable is that it is more of a dark album; there's nothing like \\"Another Day\\" to be found here.<br /><br />The album starts out with \\"6:00,\\" a somewhat strange song with excellent lyrics by Kevin Moore. Moore also takes center stage, delivering the only two solos in the song (Petrucci has one at the very end that is less than 10 seconds). \\"Caught in a Web\\" and \\"Innocence Faded\\" are thought-provoking and are both good songs. \\"Erotomania\\" is an instrumental that isn't really that good, but will definitely appeal to fans of Liquid Tension Experiment. \\"Voices\\" is different than anything I have heard Dream Theater do. It light at times, but also heavy, featuring a spectacular guitar solo and great lyrics. \\"The Silent Man\\" is a decent acoustic song, but probably won't be enjoyable to fans of the metal side of Dream Theater (like me). \\"The Mirror\\" is the heaviest and most complex song on the album, which leads directly into \\"Lie.\\" One of Dream Theater's best songs ever, \\"Lie\\" is the true metal song of the album, with an awesome riff and two jaw-dropping guitar solos. It goes well joined together with \\"The Mirror,\\" but can also be enjoyed by itself. \\"Space Dye Vest\\" is the work of Kevin Moore and is dark, yet powerful at the same time.<br /><br />James LaBrie is excellent again, especially in \\"6:00\\" and \\"Lie.\\" This time around he mostly uses what can best be described as a \\"snarl.\\" It works very well with the music, and I found this to be his last spectacular performance, although he was really good on \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\\" I think part of the reason that the vocals have declined is Dream Theater's insistance of using Portnoy and Petrucci on backing vocals. Petrucci is decent, and will sound great on his solo album, but Portnoy uses this annoying falsetto that completely ruins any part that he sings in. They should go back to using LaBrie for backing vocals, like they did for the chorus of \\"Pull Me Under.\\" Petrucci sounds great on guitar throughout the eniter album, I wish that he hadn't stopped using Ibanez, because I haven't heard him do anything like his solos in \\"Lie\\" ever since. Portnoy is spectacular as well, not feeling the need to pound 1,000 drums a minute. Moore and Myung hold up well, and Moore's lyrics (as well as his songwriting influence) were sorely missed and DT's albums after this were never quite as good. Don't make your decision on whether you like this or not based on the first listen, because after I listened to this for the first time I hated it. Highly recommended for both progressive as well as heavy metal fans.i is decent, and will sound great on his solo album, but Portnoy uses this annoying falsetto that completely ruins any part that he sings in.

B000067JG3|5.0|For me, this film remains as one of the greatest musicals of all time.  It has warm, self deprecating humor, drama, and beautiful, beautiful music.<br /><br />It's hard to beat the opening scene with Maria (Julie Andrews), the young woman in training to become a nun. spinning with youthful exuberance, on a stunningly gorgeous green hill in Austria.  Then, the beautiful words, \\"The hills are alive with the sound of music....\\"  For me, only Julie Andrews could capture the wit, the whimsy and the spirit of Maria.  Though, Mary Martin was wonderful in the staged production, Julie added her own touch of class, mischief and flamboyance to the role, along with that gorgeous, gorgeous soprano voice.<br /><br />This wonderful, delightful and poignant story of the young Maria, who has too much spirit to stay within the confines of the convent, is sent out into the world to be a governess for a widower and his seven children, remains timeless, irresistable and very entertaining.  Amazing to imagine that it is now forty years old!!! The young actors and actresses, cast as Baron Von Trapp's (Christopher Plummer) children, dance and act wonderfully.  Also, even though I have heard stories that Christopher Plummer refers to this musical as  THE SOUND OF MUCOUS, he managed to pull of his role as the gruff Baron, whose heart melts after coming to know the irresistable Maria, with class.  (Though, I swear , there are some scenes where I swear he is trying to keep from sneering, and doesn't always succeed!)<br /><br />This film is filled with some of the most well known tunes from musical theatre repertoire (\\"Edelweiss,\\" \\"Do Re Mi,\\" \\"Climb Every Mountain,\\" and \\"My Favorite Things,\\" among others).  Also, the cinematography is gorgeous.  You feel like you are in the Alps with Maria and the children, and can almost smell the dew in the grass.  Perfect for the family, and essential for every film buff.  Even if you aren't a fan of musicals, I think almost everyone can find something to love about this movie.ething to love about this movie. <br /> <br />
B00005YW4H|1.0|Come off it folks! This over-hyped product is a album people will have comprehensively forgotten in a couple of years!<br /><br />Norah Jones has very little talent and her voice is dull and expressionless. You know it is!<br /><br />Let's get real - there is very little to talk about here. Norah Jones has been allowed to make an album an it is a crime that really talented and exciting young singers and musicians don't get opportunities like Ms Jones. Of course, having the great Ravi Shankar as your father does help!<br /><br />I wonder how many people who raved about this album have now changed their minds?
B000002BDB|2.0|I bought this awhile back, and I wish I hadn't.  The music, of course, cannot be over-praised -- five stars just aren't enough.  I am infinitely grateful that this music graces our planet, and my life.  Thank you, Miles and Gil and company!   <br /> <br />So what's the problem?  This package (Columbia 67397, $110 at this writing) is awful.  It's at least sixty percent alternate takes, rehearsal fragments, and studio chatter.  If that stuff interests you, great -- I just want the core music.  The physical package stinks, too.  The discs are in cardboard sleeves, difficult to extract, and the book can't be read at all unless it's removed from the binding (and, in my opinion, there's very little of interest in the book).     <br /> <br />All four original discs, with the same remastering and all the significant alternate takes, can be purchased right here at Amazon for $45.  The only new (previously unreleased) material, \\"Time of the Barracudas\\" is included on \\"Quiet Nights,\\" so you're not missing out on anything.  Spend the $65 difference on more music, not pretty packaging and filler.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I watched \\"Rodger and me\\" a few months ago, and sometimes found Moore to be a bit too biased, so I really didn't really know what to expect from this movie. True, he sometimes draws a bit far-fetched conclusions on pretty loose facts, but rather than dismissing the film as propaganda, we should take this as an encouragement to think for ourselves! Beliefs that cannot be questioned are not beliefs, they are myths. From my point of view, Michael Moore has made a brilliant documentary, which despite some far-fetched ideas essentially comes down to be just so true. In this fantastic world of precision bombing, war seems to be just another videogame. You just have to watch the last 20 minutes to get to know what war is REALLY about.

That makes this one of my least favorite small group Mingus albums once he really hit his stride, but I could not sleep with mice elf if I thought a single Mingus had to go without a star.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Laughed so hard I cried.  My wife and daughter got a kick out of watching me laugh for 20 minutes after the movie ended.  And, I'm still laughing.  I love a great comedy, but unfortunately, think that they are few and far between.  This one makes it to the top of the list.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is an awesome technical achievement that's pretty to look at, but unfortunately not a very good film. The characters are two-dimensional at best, and the story is nonsensical and uninteresting. It is effectively a live-action rendering of a very unsophisticated comic book. The film is overwhelmingly computer-generated imagery, the first film to combine live action footage of actors with CGI on this scale. It took about 2 years to make, with all of the live action filmed within a month in front of blue screens on a soundstage. The film is composed of over 2000 computer generated shots that combine live action footage, some still photographs, and mostly digital animation, by one hundred or so in-house digital artists plus outsourcing to about a dozen other companies. So \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\", written and directed by Kerry Conran, with production design by his brother Kevin Conran and produced by Jon Avnet, gives post-production a new meaning. Filming was only a small part of this production.<br /><br />The film takes place in Manhattan circa 1940. The story features technologies from that era combined with sci-fi technologies inspired by the movies of that time as well. Intrepid reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is investigating the disappearance of 6 eminent scientists. Just as she receives information from a seventh scientist, who fears for his life, that it all has something to do with a secret project they all worked on before the start of World War I, orchestrated by a man named Totenkopf, Manhattan is invaded by giant robots, as tall as buildings, who make off with the city's underground generators. Authorities call upon Sky Captain (Jude Law), a daredevil aviator and leader of an elite mercenary army that can get the job done when conventional armies are unable or unavailable, for help. Just as he has pinpointed the source of the transmission that controls the robots, Sky Captain's engineer, Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), is abducted. Polly is determined to get the story on these robots who are stealing energy sources around the world. Sky Captain is determined to find out who is controlling them and rescue his friend and colleague. It happens that Polly and Sky Captain are ex-lovers who split years ago amid mutual accusations. So they set off to solve the mystery of the robots and missing scientists, still bickering about their own relationship.<br /><br />\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" was actually created in black-and-white, then colorized by digital artists, who chose a style that alludes to classic film noir. So the colors are subdued, and CG lighting director Michael Sean Foley and his team have created some impressive chiaroscuro lighting entirely on computers. This is an interesting film to look at: a combination of photographs, CGI, and several visual styles express a vintage comic book story. I'm sure the story isn't supposed to be believable on any level, but the film's many continuity problems look like sloppiness nonetheless. I don't think artists can get away with being that \\"creative\\" with story elements, even in a cartoon. But the story and characters are a bigger problem. Just flat. Completely without substance. The style is the substance here, and that's not enough for an hour and 45 minutes of film. Film buffs and animation aficionados will definitely want to see \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" to have a look at the potential of CG film, but don't expect to be very entertained.<br /><br />The DVD: The extras answer some, but not all, of \\"how did they do that?\\". Bonus features include a making-of documentary in 2 parts, a featurette about the film's production design, the original 6-minute short film that got the funding and support for the feature length film, 2 audio commentaries, 2 deleted scenes, and a gag reel. \\"Brave New World\\" is about making film and has 2 parts. Chapter 1 (28 minutes) is about the conception of the film, making the 6-minute short, storyboarding, and shooting the live action. Interviews with director Kerry Conran, production designer Kevin Conran, producers Jon Avnet and Marsha Oglesby, and various visual effects artists are included. Chapter 2 (23 minutes) is about creating the computer generated imagery and putting the film together, which was done over the course of 2 years by a bunch of dedicated, enthusiastic, underpaid digital artists of various specialties working in a warehouse in Van Nuys, California. There are interviews with many of the same people as in Chapter 1. In \\"The Art of The World of Tomorrow\\" (8 minutes) production designer Kevin Conran talks about the visual style of the film and the design of its elements. \\"The Original Six Minute Short\\" took Kerry Conran 4 years to make, but ultimately convinced producer Jon Avnet to support the film. The audio commentary by Jon Avnet discusses the genesis of the film and his role as producer, including the technical constraints and challenges that had to be dealt with amid increasingly high expectations as the production advanced. He doesn't comment much on specific scenes, but instead on what it took to make the film from the producer's point of view. The second audio commentary is by writer/director Kerry Conran and some members of the visual effects crew: Production Designer Kevin Conran, Animation Supervisor Steve Yamamoto, and Visual Effects Supervisor Darin Hollings.

B0006Z2LCE|5.0|Yes we get another Greatest Hits Collection.  We will continue to get several more Greatest Hits as Donna Summer doesnt own the rights to her songs.  Universal Music owns the rights and will continue to put out these collections to make money off of her.  This is a great collection, Very similar to 1993 Anthology, However, it is nice to see some added tracks that never gets included on any DS Greatest Hits \\"Dinner With Gershwin\\", \\"Loves About to Change my heart\\". While other tracks were omitted like \\"Woman in Me, Rumour Has It, and Cold Love\\" to make room for the more recent recordings like \\"Dream a lots Theme\\" <br /> <br />This collection is still top notch from a top notch recording artist.  Remastered tracks sound great.  Lets all hope Donna Summer comes out with a new product soon.  Besides, we need a new song to go on the next Greatest Hits Collection next year :-) <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love everything about this movie...it is HILARIOUS. most of the characters have little to no personality, and are really dry..and thats why it is hilarious. the one liners in this movie are so memorable you just cant stop quoting it. everyone should see this. flippen' sweet.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Both the torture of Jesus and the torture of the movie-goer.  This guy lost more blood that the human body possesses but kept on going (oh that's right, this isn't just ANY human being).<br /><br />The movie really failed for me because there was so little character development.  Peter and Judas got a little bit of play, but there were far too many non-entities in this movie.  And what was with Mary, the mother of Jesus.  She had the same look on her face the entire time.<br /><br />This movie to me was terribly depressing.  Focusing on the death of Jesus rather than his rise, his torture rather than his life, it was a morbid movie to say the least.  The message I think Mel Gibson was trying to convey was that because this Jesus fellow suffered so much, that we owe him (errrrrh, the church he supposedly founded through Peter) alot so I guess I'd better straighten up and fly right.<br /><br />I will give credit to the director on one account.  Jesus in this movie actually looked JEWISH! A far cry from the Fabio Germanic Jesus that adorns the walls of so many who call themselves Christians.  That in itself was worthy of a couple of stars.<br /><br />This movie will strengthen the faith of those who already believe.  However, I don't think it spoke to any non-catholic whom Mel hoped would start revering the mother Mary or her son. But maybe that is just me.
B00004X01U|3.0|Well, i hate to say it, but Madonna is running out of material.  The few nice things I can say about the album is its different, original, and distracting at best.  Seems like shes using effects to extend her \\"talents\\" which is interesting, but not necessarily a good thing.  Hopefully she will go back to making pure music again.
B00064MW6A|1.0|On one of the featurettes on this DVD one of the producers of 2004's Catwoman states \\"I think everyone will forget all the other Catwomen when they see her (Berry's) portrayal.\\" WRONG! This complete failure of a movie shouldn't even be compared to any of its Batman predecessors, television and film included. For one, Halle Berry's performance is much more inferior than Michelle Pfeiffer's classic Catwoman performance in Batman Returns. Two, this has nothing to do with its Batman origins. Remember how Batman Returns ended? Why couldn't they have done a movie that showed what Catwoman did after Batman Returns? That would've been so much more interesting than just a stupid, horribly executed, weak storylined spin-off-but-not-really-a-spin-off piece of crap.<br />Aside from all that, all the acting in this movie completely sucked, Halle Berry included. The only moderately okay performance was from Sharon Stone, and even that wasn't that great. I couldn't stand all of Catwoman's horribly cheesey one liners, and there were some seriously ridiculous scenes in the movie that just made me laugh at the stupidity of it all. The scene where Patience (Berry) is rubbing the catnip ball all over her nose. I hope to God Halle realized how stupid she really looked when she saw the final cut. That seriously should've been a deleted scene. And the basketball scene. Don't even get me started there. But the most ridiculous scene was where Patience becomes Catwoman. A magical egyptian cat breathes his Cat Powers into her mouth after she was killed? Have all the writers in Hollywood gone retarded? Of course the scene is equipped with some overly dramatic music. Quite hilarious actually.<br />The only thing this movie had going for it was its sleek and fast visual style which was hardly enough to compensate for everything else that just sucked immensely.
091581112X|5.0|This practical book teaches you how to connect with the wisdom of your Higher Self - with the Light and bring it into your daily life - by living it and expressing it.  The process brings you into a state of Oneness and you being to live your life from this awareness, divinely guided and expressing the will of God / the will of your Higher Self - rather than the will of your human ego.  You merge with divine, like a drop of water merges with an ocean and are then able to express infinite love, power and wisdom of your Divine Self.  When you do live from this state of consciousness, you become centered.  Non-attachment, which is also dealt with in this book - becomes in a way a natural side-effect of the entire process - because the only thing you desire, the only little prayer that you have is \\"Thy will be done\\".  When you live your daily life fully aware of, and feeling and expressing the presence of your Greater Self, you don't need to hope or believe that it is there - you KNOW it, and you TRUST it wholeheartedly - you know that it is your best friend and that it has your best interests at heart - so you let it express through you freely - and you know that it doesn't matter what may come or go out of your life - whatever you may ever need will be always supplied to meet all of your needs.  In this way, your begin living an effortless life.  You neither have any need or desire to manipulate others, nor are they able to manipulate you any more - because you are now true only to your Greater Self (to God) and all that you desire to do - wholeheartedly - is let Its will express through you and your life, because through your own experience, the moment you surrender to Its guidance, you very fast learn that that's the better way, and the easier way to live one's life.  Why struggle through life like an individual drop of water, when you can have an entire ocean take care of you.  And how could you possibly not love it more than anything else in the world, when it is always there for you to do everything for you, to fill all of your needs.  In the process you become so deeply and madly in love in God (your Greater Self) - not because some book suggested that you should do so, but because you have realized that it truly is your closest and your best friend - that it is Your Very Own Magnificent Self.always there for you to do everything for you, to fill all of your needs.

0316172324|4.0|I applaud the way this book is written, it is the only reason why I finished it as there is nothing here that anyone of High School qualification should not already have a handle on. What makes the book worth 4 stars is the approach, and the editors enhancement. For example this author states that your ability to make a right decision without thinking to much about it depends on your education history or data bank of general knowledge. Are we slipping so far into naiveness in the 21 century that we need to be told this? Brilliant deduction. Two chapters in the book SB 1 or God by Karl Maddox, \\"Turning, and We Test Ourselves\\" delves much more into the human mind and decision making processes, than this entire book does.
B0000024YL|5.0|What can you say about Simon and Garfunkel.  Excellent melodies, beautiful harmonies and meaningful lyrics.  Simon and Garfunkel have put together some wonderful songs that every music collection should have.<br /><br />I've played this particular CD so much that when I hear Simon and Garfunel on the radio, I expect the applause that is on some of the pieces.  Sounds of Silence, The Boxer and Bridge over Troubled Water are three pieces that are among my all time favorites. Great stuff.
B0000640SA|5.0|Like a classic book, Momento is a simple story masterfully told with meticulous attention to detail. <br /> <br />Awesome movie - the story is really quite simple (I'm not going to spoil anything), but it is told/shown such a unique matter that it keeps you intrigued from start to finish. The sooner you catch on to where the storyline is taking you the sooner you want to rewind and start over. <br /> <br />Guy pierce is excellent- his portrayal of this strange character is memorable. The writing is also wonderful: he is witty, smart, yet at the same time oblivious to the nth degree. And thus he is vulnerable and taken advantage of by people around him.  <br /> <br />The film is also quite funny. Lenny suffers from a strange and unique condition, where he is incapable of making any new memory after he had an accident. So his mind hits the reset button every so often (sometimes quicker when his mind is racing).  <br /> <br />There is a scene where he is being chased by someone and in the middle of the run \\"Ok, what am I doing here? Aha I'm chasing someone\\" after a gunshot at him \\"No, I think he's chasing me.\\" He is constantly talking to himself trying to make sense of his surrounding. <br /> <br />I guarantee that this is one movie you'll have to watch twice. It's not very long (like and hour and half) so it's no big deal. You have to watch very carefully, paying close attention to the usage and morphing of the colors in the movie. Analogously: It has the same feel as the matrix, with better writing, better direction and the lack of superfluous action scenes.  <br /> <br />I can't promise that you will put it on your top ten list, but you will be thinking about it after the film for a while. And be sure you will recommend it to others. <br /> <br />In My Humble Opinion <br />John G !!!!! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Having listened to PMG since the late 70's, and having been to many PMG concerts, I can hardly be objective: PMG's music is truly woven into me. But, in my view, 'The Way Up' is a remarkable achievement, and ranks as one of the group's finest works. I have listened to this album over a dozen times (as of this writing), and every listen reveals something new, much like my experience with previous recordings (notably 'Speaking of Now'). When I take a moment to appreciate that every articulated note in this sweeping opus is actually scored, I almost fall over with amazement. There are multiple staccato thematic elements that weave in and out over the course of the entire piece... echoing, lurking, repeating, and calling... all to remind you of where you have been. It's as if 'The Way Up' points you in the right direction from the start, but you don't realize it until you reach the very end. 'The Way Up' is PMG's way of reminding us all of a simple truth: that music can be an uplifting and emotional experience that puts us in direct touch with who we are. Sometimes this is an unexplainable phenomenon and, in my view, 'The Way Up' falls into this category. All the players are superb. Sanchez's rhythmically complex drum set and cymbal work is stunning; he is clearly the glue that holds the whole piece together with Rodby, always solid. Mays is brilliant, and has several sweeping solos that remind me a bit of McCoy Tyner. Vu creates such unusual sounds out the trumpet that you won't recognize the instrument. Maret's harmonica is so soulful it will send a chill through you, particularly in the early stages of Part Two. When the voices (Bona, Vu) enter in Part Three, it's wonderful. And, of course, there is Pat, who provides soaring solos and wonderful sonic complements to Mays. The combination is just incredible. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone who hasn't got time to really listen to it. Frankly, you won't get it nor enjoy it. Like much of PMG's work, the joy is never in the immediate hit, though it's there. The joy is in the slow realization that you just may have stumbled into one of the most impressive works created by any modern jazz ensemble. If you give 'The Way Up' a way in, you won't be disappointed. I have my tickets. Enjoy...
0915811774|5.0|This book teaches you how to connect to that deeper (higher)part of you that is always aware only of love, and to bring this love into your daily life and let it flow through you - through everything you think, say and do.

B000001ELL|4.0|While not up to the standards of previous KISS releases, DYNASTY was no slouch. Ace contributes more than ever. It's sad to know that this would be the last time they would perform together on a recording of new material until 1998's PSYCHO CIRCUS. This was a band coming apart at the seams. But they got together and rocked one last time. I do not like the fact that this album was labled as KISS' \\"disco\\" record. It is nothing of the sort. The only song on the record that would even come close is \\"I was made for lovin' you\\" which did have a disco flair. But by 1979 disco was on the way out. And the musical diversity of this album was mis-interpreted by critics and fans alike. Like most bands with multiple superstars, they were exploring other avenues in creative sound. And thank god for that! KISS, especially in the case of Mr. Gene Simmons, was hurting for new ways of musical expression. I mean, there are just so many times you can get away with rhyming the words \\"knees\\" and \\"please\\". I was happy to see Mr. Simmons back off and let the others contribute more to this effort. His contributions were getting stale, and his themes were always the same: \\"See what a big rockstar I am! My tallywhacker is so big! It's too much for you! I'm god's gift to groupies!\\" Really Gene, have some diversity, will you? His solo LP reeks with this stuff. Somewhere around \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" Gene started to be much too full of himself, and he continues to be the sex driven power and egomaniac to this very day. They say that Peter and Ace left the band due to drug and alcohol problems. If I was forced to work with Mr. Simmons in his state of mind...I'd probably take to the bottle too! Dynasty is still a great record. It's worth a spin.
B000069AUI|5.0|I don't like to buy many cds and when I do, I listen to them a couple of times and put it away, this cd doesn't get old. Beautiful lyrics combined with enchanting sounds. This is one of the best CDs I've ever heard; the lyrics are immensely thoughtful and metaphorical, you want to listen over and over again to catch something new. Really fresh sound, and the lead singer is amazing. <br /> <br />They make great use of the most beloved instruments of perhaps all time: guitar and piano. The entire band has wonderful chemistry. The combination of all these things makes for great cd with great tracks. Here are some sample lyrics: \\"I'm going to buy a gun and start a war, if you can show me something worth fighting for...\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Look it earth from outer space, everyone has found a place, give time and give me space, give me real and don't give me fake, give me strength reserve control, give me heart and give me soul...\\" <br /> <br />What I really loved: Politik, In My Place, God Put a Smile on Your Face, The Scientist*, Clocks, Daylight, Green Eyes, Warning Sign, A Whisper, A Rush of Blood to The Head*, and Amsterdam. The other tracks aren't all that great. :) <br /> <br />If you enjoy mellow and soothing music about life, love, and inner strength, then give this cd a try. If I was somewhat affluent, I would buy this CD for anyone who was remotely curious or had it on their wish list; maybe in a couple of years I can make this offer. <br /> <br />Overall, excellent... what else can I say... give it a try and see for yourself. <br /> <br />In My Humble Opinion <br />
B0006OBPTA|4.0|I hate double sided discs! The 3rd and 4th films should be on their own with separate packaging. At least the movies are in widescreen.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I have never been as dissapointed with a director as I have been with George Lucas in the last few years. I consider my self a Star Wars purist having seen each of the original Star Wars Series movies in their original form several hundred times. Lucas has disappointed me twice in recent years. The first time was with the release of the horribly acted Episode II. Mind you I forgave him for Episode I which many considered equally flawed. I let it go with the expectation that he was building to something. And yet that \\"something\\" never truly materialized in Episiode II.  While there were certainly outstanding special effects (ala fight sequence with yoda) and Natalie Portman's on screen chemistry had improved, the addition of Hayden Christensen (or at least his acting or direction) was a complete dissapointment. His incessant tantrums as the young Anakin Skywalker were WAY over-dramatized. I don't know if it was poor direction or he simply couldn't act, but I am guessing poor direction since he clearly had other scenes which were less dramatically distasteful. And then there was the dream sequence where Christensen is moving around in bed, apparently sleeping nude, in what vaguely resembles an excercise in self-pleasure rather than a distrubing dream. This recieved well more than a few chuckles form the audience when I saw this film opening night. Some people fell out of their seat laughing. Even portman had some ridiculous scenes like when her character falls off a craft in the sand dunes and moans a little then jumps up and says something like \\"I'm fine\\" and runs off. So was she intentionally faking being hurt or was it just bad acting/direction??? then there was the infmaous fireplace scene where Amidala and Skywalker are eating dinner and the scene abruptly cuts to a dimly lit room with a roarig fire and the two on the couch looking like they are about to get it on. While portman brought much to the role this time, Christensen's chemistry was virtually absent andhis acting left much to be desired. Lucus, if you are listening, with all due respect, you are not a romantic film director. Leave that to the professionals or get some help on your next project, PLEASE!!!! <br />And let's not even get into the introduction in Episode I of the annoying character JarJar Binks, who I can only assume Lucas wanted to be the equivalent to C3PO form the original series in terms of comic releif. But the otherwise lovable C3PO was only annoying to the characters in the film , and this played well with movie goers. Jar Jar, by contrast, was annoying to the audience as well, and this is a no no. By the the second introduction of Mr Binks, the audience was already jeering him and by the third it seemed many people hoped Obi would strike him down with the lightsaber already. Lucas apparently may have realized this and reduced Jar Jar's part in Episode II, but he was one character we could have forgotten all together. <br /> <br />We have come to associate special effects with Lucas films, but all the special affects in the world will still not make up for poor acting performance. Special effects are not the only important thing in making a movie. <br /> <br />This brings me to the second and equally, if not more dissapointing, faux pas on Lucas' part. With his release of the newly remastered triliogy, Lucas has butchered what was a phenomenal cult classic. He didn't simply enhace flaws (which might have been forgivable). Instead he made obvious and distracting additions to what was already a phenomenal movie which had the effect of making it less phenomenal. <br /> <br />Just a couple examples... <br /> <br />1.) The addition of Hayden Christensen to the scne at the end of Return of the Jedi when Yoda, Obi-wan, and Vader are shown as apparitions.  While yoda and Obi-Wan are seen as they appeared at the moment of their deaths, Vader is now seen as the young anakin Skywalker (Christensen's face is digitized over the original Anakin). Perhaps thiswas symbolic since anakin \\"died\\" when he started to turn to the dark side. But if that is true then he was also \\"reborn\\" at the end of Jedi, when he turned away from the dark side. <br /> <br />2.) The Music for the Creature Cantina (Episode IV) and the scene at Jabba the Hut's Palace (Return of the Jedi) is DIFFERENT. As someone who has seen the originals many times before, this was extremely disruptive because I remeber the original music. Not to mntion there are ton of newly digitized  characters. <br /> <br />But there are many more examples including adding characters or backgrounds that weren't inthe originals, changing voices, etc. <br /> <br />Perhaps the only true \\"enhancement\\" is the addition of Ian McDiarmid's voice to Empire Strikes Back. Since he was already voicing the Emporer in the original Retunrn of the Jedi, this served to increase continuity succesfully. <br /> <br />I realize these digital \\"enhancements\\" for the DVD, many of which were initially introduced by the Star Wars Gold Editions, may have been what Lucas originally envisioned, however, they are highy distracting to purists who remember things a different way. It's a lot like watching a pink elephant walk accross the screen while you are trying to enjoy a rerun of a favorite old film. <br /> <br />In fact what perhaps what Lucas should have been striving for is a way to make the new films seem more like the old films where the acting was good and the sets seemed real and not just like an over budgeted blue screen production. Think back to the original land speeder sequences, and the days when X-wing fighters actually looked like they had been used in battle and not just like silver bullets whisking throught the sky.  If we want a glamourous obviously fake space ship movie we can watch the Star Trek movies.  Star Wars has always been unique in that, despite the fantasy, there was a sense of realism. A sense that what is on the screen might actually be happening. <br />Or how about the cinematography of a real desert (without the blue screen) which makes us think we are actually onthe planet tatooine. A veiwer could easily get lost in the story and forget that it was not real. With the overboard remakes of the new Trilogy DVD and poor acting in Episodes I and II, it is hard to forget this is not real be cause we are always distracted by poor acting and/or direction, or things that are OBVIOUSLY digital. <br /> <br />At least with the Gold Edition VHS release, viewers had the OPTION of buying the original unaltered VHS movies instead. I waited for the DVD thinking the same option might apply. Unfortunately it does not.  So that very significant piece of my child hood that I remember so fondly, and invested so much time and allowance money into, is no longer what it once was. I realize I can't go back and re-live my childhood, but movies used to be one of the things that were left untainted by the progress of time. With remakes like these, it seems even movies are no longer sacred. Its a good thing George Lucas doesn't own the rights to the Declaration of Independance or other historical treasures. If it were up to him he would probably airbrush some of davinci's paintings and dress the figures in more modern or even futuristic attire just because he could. <br /> <br />While it is hard to be optimistic given his recent track record, let's hope Lucas gets it right with Episode III.  My advice to him... Go back to what made Episodes VI-VI the phenomenal cult icons that they were (before you destroyed them). Good story line, good acting, SUPPLEMENTED and NOT REPLACED BY special effects, and make us forget what we see is not real. And PLEASE (if you have ANY concern for the feelings of fans who have contributed and continue to contribute so much in adoration and revenue to your films and merchandise) release the original UNALTERED Trilogy on DVD.
B000001F2X|4.0|This is a good album consistent with J.J. Cale's earlier works.  One note to J.J. Cale fans, the distributor has changed track #10, it is not Katy Kool Lady (one of my favorites on the album).  For some reason, they have replaced it with a mystery track.  Not a bad song, just disappointed that it is not true to the original album.
B00068IOWC|1.0|This soup offers nothing new to the current music scene, presenting weak compositions that lack originality and innovation. It certainly doesn`t deserve all the overexposure it got, since it has been awhile since U2 created something truly remarkable and cutting edge (I agree with those ones whom say their last worthy album was Pop, in 1997). Far from stunning, this mainstream album has nothing remarkable, most of the moments are just banal pop tunes and far from memorable. Plus Bono's voice here sounds too strained.  <br /> <br />What's more, a couple of the tracks on the disc are positively atrocious (the vapid 'SYCMOYO' (possibly getting my vote as the worst U2 track ever, with ATYCLB's 'Grace' coming 2nd) and equally trite and embarrassing 'OOTS'). The remainder of the tracks on the disc range from below average to forgettable. For worse, the limitations in their song writing ability is becoming ever more evident. Listen to 'Vertigo': we've all heard countless times, and yes it grows more annoying with every listen. The chorus line pretty much sums up Bono's lyrical empyness for the album - downright lazy and easy.  <br /> <br />What happenned to the adventurous band, their intriguingly good lyrics, the expect-the-unexpected feel of their albums. Achtung baby, Zooropa and Pop were amazing because of these qualities.  <br /> <br />This crap doesn't push much of anything - except U2's unit shifting status in the biz. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006284JQ|5.0|I think I had it of all this pathetic britney-haters wannabes, I mean it's obvious you have nothing to do with your time, otherwise you wouldn't make 10000 reviews bashing britney for stupid things like her marriage, She was and still is a pop music icon around the world, ohhh and about her so called falling career, a lot of people have said that practically since she first started back in 1999, and we're already in 2005 and she is one of the most succesful female artists everywhere, actually I kinda feel sorry for all those people, because they wish britney is no longer what she is today, a young woman who has proved she is strong enought to stay in the music scene for more than six years when everyone said she was only a one hit wonder, and she's going to keep doing that for many years to come.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an extremely well-made and entertaining series.  The plots and characters are excellent!  I cannot wait for the movie.  Fox should bring it back - like they brought Family Guy back!
B00005JNBQ|2.0|I, like many others before me, did not have the chance to see the movie in theaters, and was caught in the DVD craze when the movie was released. Everyone was urging me to see it, claiming it was the \\"funniest movie ever!\\". So I succumbed, (no, not agreed, SUCCUMBED)and saw the movie. <br /> <br />It generally started off slow, and then took a gradual dip in pace- before stopping completely! This movie was awful. Horridly filmed and acted(even for a dumb movie) with a slow, boring pace, and a script pockmarked with failed humor. <br /> <br />I tried to laugh, I really did, but nothing came out. I just couldn't. Something was missing, besides a plot and a good joke. <br /> <br />Now, this review may prompt you too see it just so you can witness how dumb it really is, but even that is a waste of time. This movie is a disgrace to the film industry, and fails even as a movie trying to be dumb. It's worse then dumb: it's bad. <br /> <br />To give you a taste of napolean dynamite, I'll give you a fan favorite: Napolean is in the office on the phone, begging his brother to pick him up cause \\"His lips hurt real bad\\". Har har. Whover wrote this script probably thought: I'll make tons of money by glamourizing a typical seventies nerd, and presenting the movie as an \\"independant film\\"( the fact that it was independant appealed to me because I had never seen an independant comedy).  <br /> <br />In this movie you'll laugh at the tone of his voice, (if even that) and nothing more.

B0000009RX|5.0|This album is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.  This is the ultimate anti-hippy album.  However, this is definately NOT the first FZ album you want to start out with, as it is a tad dated (though that is totally outweighed by this album's historical importance) and the avant-garde and experimentations are all around.  The album opens by asking that timeless question, \\"Are You  Hung Up?\\" and that segues straight into \\"Who Needs The Peace Corps?\\" - that song's meaning should be self-explanatory.  That is followed by the superb \\"Concentration Moon\\" - with lyrics like \\"American way/How did it start?/Thousands of creeps/Killed in the park/American way/Try and explain/Scab of a nation/Driven insane\\" FZ obviously not only attacks the Summer of Love ideals, but also the American way of life itself.  This is followed by the foreboding, tragic, and very serious \\"Mom & Dad\\" - about the Kent State University incident, with such powerful lyrics as \\"Mama! Mama!/Someone said they made some noise/The cops have shot some girls and boys/You'll sit home and drink all night/They looked too weird...it served them right.\\"  Then comes the one-two punch of experimentalism in \\"Telephone Conversation\\" and \\"Bow Tie Daddy\\" -  the latter telling the older generation to just kick back and take it easy!  Then comes the interesting \\"Harry, You're A Beast\\" and then they ask \\"What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body?\\" - not your nose OR your toes, but your mind; and then the song continues to explain that all the children are poor, unfortunate victims of systems beyond their control and a plague upon the parent's ignorance.  Then comes \\"Absolutely Free,\\" which teaches you to discorporate and leave your body - obviously a parody of hippy ideals.  This is followed by \\"Flower Punk,\\" a faster-paced  yet obviously similar sounding to the take on Hendrix's rendition of \\"Hey Joe\\" - FZ had respect for Hendrix as a musician, but despised what he represented (remember, this was 'Are You Experienced?' eraHendrix, not when he started becoming a serious musician).  Another one-two punch of experimentalism follows on \\"Hot Poop\\" and \\"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\\".  This is followed by the bizarre \\"Let's Make The Water Turn Black\\" - a  very humorous song, nonetheless.  This is followed by the also very funny \\"The Idiot Bastard Son\\".  The next song, \\"Lonely Little Girl\\" is the album's \\"other\\" serious song, and is in some ways a continuation of \\"Mom & Dad\\".  \\"Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance\\" can be seen as both the ultimate parody of hippy ideals, but also seen as a hopeful outlook on the future.  Then comes the \\"What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body? (Reprise),\\" which like it's predecessor is great.  Next up is the anthemic \\"Mother People\\" and the album closes with the Kafka-esque experimental \\"The Chrome Plated Megaphone Of Destiny\\".  All in all, a true masterpiece.  However, as I said before, there are other more accessible FZ albums (I point you in the direction of 'Over-Nite Sensation', 'Apostrophe (')', 'Joe's Garage Acts I-III' for what are in my opinion, his most accessible).  So get one of those before you decide to take on this monster of an album.

B0006GAI6Y|4.0|When asked to name the sexiest scene I have ever seen in a movie I usually answer the \\"Shall We Dance?\\" sequence from \\"The King and I.\\"  Most people acknowledge that the more you see of two people having sex the less sexier it is.  Well, two people fully clothed and dancing is pretty far removed from triple-X nudity sex, but you will not see a more powerful look than the one Yul Brynner gives Deborah Kerr at the end of that dance.  You do not have to understand metaphor, but in the 2004 romantic comedy \\"Shall We Dance\\" Jennifer Lopez's character explains exactly what is happening during such dances when she calls them \\"the vertical expression of a horizontal wish.\\"  There are few things more elegant and sensual than a dance of seduction.<br /><br />This being said, it is all the more interesting that \\"Shall We Dance\\" is about passion but that it is actually about dancing more than it is about sex.  But it certainly plays with our assumption that the two are inexorably connection, whether we pick up that notion from Fred Astaire or \\"Dirty Dancing.\\"  John Clark (Richard Gere) is a lawyer stuck in a routine both at work and at home.  He gets from one to the other via the L train and on his way home he see a woman sitting in the window of Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio.  He sees her sitting there again and then catches a glimpse of her dancing.  The next thing he knows he is getting off the train, walking up the stairs, entering the dance studio and signing up for lessons.<br /><br />The obvious conclusion is that John is drawn out of his lethargy by this tantalizing woman, whose name is Pauline.  This is especially true because Pauline is played by Jennifer Lopez.  But even if it takes him a way to come to the realization, John is not there for the woman: he is there for the dancing.  His confusion is understandable because it seems everybody at Miss Mitzi's is there under false or at least misguided pretenses.  That includes John's classmates, the oversized Vern (Omar Benson Miller) and the homophobic Chic (Bobby Cannavale), and his co-worker, Link (Stanley Tucci) who dons a wig to transform himself into a dancing fool.<br /><br />With John coming home late every Wednesday, making strange body movements when he thinks he is alone, and having perfume on his shirts, his wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon) has to face her suspicions and her fears.  This involves hiring a sympathetic private detective (Richard Jenkins), who is clearly smitten by the lady, oblivious to his strange non-verbal habits, and impressed by John's secret.  Beverly learns her husband's secret and comes to a rather different but actually compelling reaction.  Meanwhile, all of the film's plot threads are going to come together at the big ballroom dancing competition that is the big moment but not the film's climax.  \\"Shall We Dance\\" has more than one of those, which should not be surprising.<br /><br />The character of Pauline is caught in limbo for most of the film.  When we first see her, sitting in the window of the dance studio, she is a silent siren.  But when John actually talks to her I was suddenly thinking that she was a Sandra Bullock girl-next-door sort of character.  Then she turns cold and distant until we get a quick glimpse of passion when she explains the correct way to dance the Rumba before she shows John how it should be done on the dance floor in the film's hottest \\"sex\\" scene.<br /><br />Director Peter Chelsom (whose 1995 comedy \\"Funny Bones\\" takes place largely at Blackpool, the Mecca of Ballroom Dancing) and writer Audrey Wells (\\"The Truth About Cats and Dogs\\") had to face the daunting task of coming up with an American (and Americanized) version of the 1996 Japanese film \\"Shall we dansu?\\" by writer-director Masayuki Suo, one of the most successful foreign films of relatively recent vintage.  I watched the remake last night and the original this morning, and if my preference like so many others is for the Japanese version it has to do with the profoundly different way that culture views ballroom dancing more than anything else.  This being said, both films are enjoyable.<br /><br />But I actually think the remake suffers from the casting of its three stars.  It is not surprising that Richard Gere cuts quite a figure on the dance floor, but it seems strange that a woman can resist his charms or that he is leading a life of quite desperation.  Jennifer Lopez is so dynamic that you keep thinking her character is slumming by hanging out at Miss Mitzi's Dance Studio.  As for Susan Sarandon, it is rather hard to believe she is not more pro-active in dealing with the situation she has discovered.  Consequently, I can make the case that the casting is too good for this movie, even though watching Gere dance with his leading ladies are the high points of the film.  With Gere as the lead you still end up thinking the rich are getting richer, as opposed to the idea that every worm has its day that you get from the original.<br /><br />Still, \\"Shall We Dance\\" is quite enjoyable, especially if you like your romantic comedies to be cute.  This is especially true of the supporting cast of aforementioned characters along with the charming Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), the bombastic Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter), and the quotable Scott (Nick Cannon).  The story manages to avoid all of the standard scenes we usually get when a husband is not having an affair, and actually comes up with some rather creative responses to the unusual situation.  True, these are mostly from Suo's script, but given the proclivity of American studios to stick to conventions being this faithful to the original is a rare treat.  Plus, there is all that dancing.do with the profoundly different way that culture views ballroom dancing more than anything else.  This being said, both films are enjoyable. <br /> <br />But I actually think the remake suffers from the casting of its three stars.

This is especially true of the supporting cast of aforementioned characters along with the charming Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), the bombastic Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter), and the quotable Scott (Nick Cannon).  The story manages to avoid all of the standard scenes we usually get when a husband is not having an affair, and actually comes up with some rather creative responses to the unusual situation.  True, these are mostly from Suo's script, but given the proclivity of American studios to stick to conventions being this faithful to the original is a rare treat.  Plus, there is all that dancing.
B0002IU988|5.0|This album rocks. Thats right...it rocks. Myles Kennedy is the next great vocalists in Creed's original band. Although I'm waiting for what tricks Scott Stapp (Creed's Original Singer) has up his sleve, his band I think did incredible with the new lead singer. The electric guitarist, Mark Tremonti, shows us a little bit heavier side to his music that I know hes been dying to dish out. The Bass player, Brian Marshall, is also back to turn up the heat while the drummer, Scott Phillips, knocks down the rest of the beat. Myles just jumps in to deliver us a softer toned but yet new-aged voice that Scott Stapp could never give us. Although I do enjoy Creed's music I think Alter Bridge will soon become a very successful rock band because of already successful and professional players. I think they will deliver us great and astonishing music in the future. Thanks Alter Bridge....
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I recently bought Donnie Darko as it was suggested to me by a friend.  I have thanked that friend.   <br />Donnie Darko is a beautifully directed film, with a thick storyline that is compelling and completely unpredictable.  It's so different from any other film, there really is no way of classifying it.  This is an incredible film and strongly suggest it to all, although some parts may disturb younger viewers, but it is amazing. <br />I watch a lot of films, which means I now predict just about every second of each new, boringly predictable film.  This is completely different. <br />100% strange <br />100% beautiful <br />100% original <br />A true classic, must watch
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|I can imagine the difficulties in condensing Homer's Illiad into a workable film script. The story takes place over ten years, and though loosely based on the exploits of AChilles, in contains many divergences and side plots, which are suitable in Greek Epic but out of place in Hollywood movies.  <br />Troy is a complete failure. One may argue that the many digressions from the Greek original (It is surprising to see Achilles emerge from the Horse, for instance, considering he was dead before then) or the absence of Gods are the fatal flaws in it. While these do not help, it is the feeble characterisation and lack of any elevation of tone (such is in Homer) that are the real problems. Agamemnon, leader of the greeks, becomes a cheap hissable villian, as does his brother, the brutish Menelaus. The Trojans are likewise simplified and tirned into action movie cliches. Paris is a naive lover, Hector a gallant warrior and Priam is referred to by Achilles as a better leader than Agamemnon. So childishly simplistic is the representation that Troy could better be re-named Hector's House.  <br />In Homer's original and Shakespeare's later telling of the Trojan war in Troilus And Cressida the action starts In Medias Res (in the middle of the action). This demonstrates the difference between a skillful dramatist and the hacks responsible for this. We have a prolonged opening (about half an hour or more) which takes place before the war so by the time battle commences the audience are already bored. The actual war is truncated that it seems over in a few days not the ten arduous years in took in reality. <br />Still, the trojans, at least, have some  nobility about them, and thus, some proximity to Homer's epic. The greek invaders are a terrible horde of cut-throats. Is this meant to be a satire on American foreign policy? If so, it fails dismally in all the big action cliches and poorly drawn characters.  <br />Worst of all, is Achilles. Reduced from one of the greatest of allheroes to a stereotypical pouting mayerick, loose-cannon etc...etc...you know the type...he is shorn of all nobility and his love interest, a very minor thing in Homer, is made his chief motivation, leading to one of the yuckiest endings I've ever seen.  <br />This film is constantly referring to 'names that will live forever'. Sadly, this film does nothing to perpetuate them, and its own fate is complete and utter oblivion.
B00005B0PU|5.0|Many bands (the Beatles, the Beach Boys) at least dabbled in psychedelica, but the Zombies are often overlooked. For the 30th anniversary of \\"Odessey and Oracles,\\" the Zombies' best album was rereleased in a new form, proving that their enchanting psychedelic pop has aged exceeedingly well.<br /><br />The Zombies were unusually good at taking perky, sweet, lush music and wrapping it around a more serious song, such as the upbeat \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (guy writing to his jailed girlfriend), or the lovely \\"A Rose For Emily,\\" a poignant little song that tells of a lonely woman doomed to stay lonely. \\"And as the years go by/she will grow old and die/The roses in her garden fade away/Not one left for her grave...\\"<br /><br />But the Zombies aren't all sadness wrapped in happy music. There are perky songs about being happy in love, losing a love and hoping she'll return, and reminiscing about \\"golden days and golden summer nights.\\" The album ends on a reassuring note with the laid-back \\"Time of the Season,\\" which sounds like the ultimate hippie anthem.<br /><br />I have no memories of the 60s, since I was only born in the eighties. But \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" gives a rosy glow to that era,. Psychedelic flair minus the hazy, and every song is a gem. Though \\"Time of the Season\\" was the sleeper hit from the album, it's not the best or catchiest song on here -- it's just one of many excellent ones.<br /><br />Rod Argent was definitely an outstanding songwriter. He was able to create atmospheric and beautiful songs with very simple writing (\\"Brief candles in her mind/bright and tiny gems of memory\\"). Perhaps his finest moment here is \\"I knew he when summer was her crown/and autumn sad/how brown her eyes,\\" as a kick-off to a colorful look at a woman compared to all the seasons.<br /><br />Colin Blunstone's vocals were well-suited to the music: a bit husky, quite pleasant and mellow. The music itself was generally based on guitar, gentle drums, pretty piano, and wavering Mellotron, with a bit of accordian coming in in one song. There's a rich interweaving of many instruments, in all sorts of pop music. Some is almost classical in tone, some is uptempo stuff that is perfect for the radio.<br /><br />The Zombies were in peak form in \\"Odessey and Oracle,\\" churning out some of the purest pop music ever. As sweet and exquisite as it was in the 1960s.ering Mellotron, with a bit of accordian coming in in one song. There's a rich interweaving of many instruments, in all sorts of pop music.

B00005JLWN|5.0|I would have to say that Equilibrium is one of the best movies I've seen yet. I've got a DVD collection of over 500 movies and this is definitely on my top 10 Best. It's just abosolutely amazing how they came up with the idea of a \\"kind of\\" martial arts one would say with the exception that pistols are the number one technique. It is by far better then Matrix. It also doesn't have a cheap plot either. It was actually a right good plot that is somewhat understanding for a real-life occurence in the future. Though highly doubtful it actually made sense. Christian Bale plays an excellent role as the #1 Grammaton Cleric with his unique acting and incredible action sequences. I would recommend that if anyone enjoys excellent action movies, to BUY this DVD, not rent it.
0783225970|5.0|Scarface is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. <br /> <br />The film is ruthless and unforgettable.  Everything about the film is perfect.  The storyline, the music, the actors and the characters are all awesome. <br /> <br />Of course, for those who do not like violence, Scarface is possibly not the film to see, as it is somewhat gory in parts. <br /> <br />So please, if you don't mind violence, watch this film and I promise you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />Perfect.

B00025ETIW|5.0|So, I was watching videos on Launch and the I'm not Okay video came on.  I usually skip by videos when I'm not familiar with the group, but this time I didn't because the begining was intriguing and than it was so funny i kept it running.  That was the begining of my love for this band.  I listened to the song on Launch, heard some clips on Amazon and decided to buy the cd.  Without ever hearing more than one song, i started to regret my decision but when the cd came, I felt the farthest from regret.  More like regret that i hadn't found this band earlier.  A lot of reviews talk about how MCR is another pop punk emo whatever band, well, i find that to be very untrue.  I was pleasently suprised when I heard this cd because I was expecting the typical high voiced, whiney tunes that you get from the many many \\"pop punk\\" bands out there.  In my opinion, MCR has created a new type of music, it has such a nice mixture of slow melodies, hard edged rock, screaming, singing, whispering, growling, high pitched giggles...everything you coud want.  I've rarely found a cd where I love every single song.  There's normally at least one I skip over but not on this cd.  Every song is different from the next, very diverse and they just plain rock!!  Buy the cd, don't base your judgement on I'm not Okay, they are awesome and my new favorite band.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Metheny once said something to the effect that \\"we're not supposed to know about music\\" as though it were a bit of heaven on earth that God didn't intend us to have yet.  This work provides compelling evidence in support of that theory.  Don't flip it on while you are cutting the grass or washing the car.  This is probing music that requires some effort, as all the great works do.  If you're a big fan of Kenny G, Chris Botti, and Boney James, you can skip this one.  But if Coltrane, Davis, Mozart, Bach, are your thing, you'll enjoy this music. This is one for the ages, as was First Circle, Imaginary Day, and Speaking of Now.  In an age of easy pleasure and commercialization, I wholeheartedly applaud Metheny for being a good steward of his talent and treating music lovers with such respect as reflected in this effort.  Indeed, he chose a great title because music, and therefore humanity, is on \\"The Way Up.\\" <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|After reading the book, I anxiously awaited for the movie and was very pleased. Even though there are a few things different between the book and the movie, any hopeful romantic will only find them minor and appreciate this wonderful film. Get the tissues ready and cherish the love between Noah and Ally!
B00074CBMY|4.0|I've been listening to Joe Cocker since the 70s, and he could sing the telephone directory and I'd probably still find something to enjoy about it. Having said that, any longtime fan of Joe will know that the quality of his recordings has varied considerably, and some of his albums just haven't been all that memorable.<br /><br />I think \\"Heart and Soul\\" deserves to stand proudly among Joe's best albums, and I consider it to be his best since \\"Have A Little Faith.\\" He has selected a superlative set of songs to record, and I think he pulls them off well. Some of the songs suffer a bit from production choices, and I find myself preferring the songs that have more real instruments and less programming.<br /><br />Nevertheless, even where I'm not thrilled with the production approach, Joe's singing is as impassioned and soulful as ever. Very few singers could convincingly take on a song like Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On,\\" but Joe pulls it off and once again manages to make the song his own. Similarly, how many others could do \\"Chain of Fools\\" and not make you wish you were hearing Aretha Franklin's version instead? Again, Joe pulls it off beautifully.<br /><br />At the other end of the spectrum, Joe can also take relatively lightweight fare such as James Taylor's \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely\\" or Robert Palmer's \\"Every Kind of People\\" and have them seem right at home among the weightier material.<br /><br />I have a feeling that years from now, this is going to be one of the Joe Cocker CDs that I still pull out and listen to regularly. If you are a fan and, like me, are intrigued by the song selection, give this album a try.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I got this album after hearing the first single, Take Me Out, a very good song with a catchy guitar riff. When I first got the album, I wasn't that impressed, but it grew on me! My favourite songs are The Dark Of The Matinee and Auf Achse. Don't know how long Franz Ferdinand will last, but I hope they manage to get at least a few more albums out.
B0000013G9|5.0|I am not a TLC fanatic! But the CD is what made me fall in love with the talented trio from Altanta! I wasn't crazy about them when they first came out but CrazySexyCool turned them into sexy sophistacated women! They bragged about their sexual prowress, socially conscious themes, and plain fun! Everyone needs this CD if they lived in the 90's! <br />Favs: Creep,Diggin on you, Lets Do it again, Waterfalls, and Red Light Special.
B00005JMJG|5.0|If you have an open mind and are ready to see a movie that exposes the truth about love and loss, then \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is for you. One of the most truly genius and absoultely amazing films I have yet to see. Jim Carrey represents his character flawlessly, and Kate Winslet's portrayal of Clementine will leave your heart aching for more. For all film lovers, this is a must-see.
B000002WU9|5.0|Raekwon's debut (Ghostface gets just as much props as the Chef does for this), as said by many, is considered a rap classic. As the beats drift on, you'll start to realize that it is solid and even though some beats are not familiar with the term of \\"catchiness\\", as those on previous Wu-Tang joints, Rza had found a way to make the tracks suit the Chef and Killah's distinct flow. <br /> <br />I wouldn't say that the beats beat out any other Wu-Tang joints as that fact is clearly not true (see: Liquid Swords by GZA) but I would say that it is true that Raekwon's loungin' big-dick-style bravado is memorable (it's those looped Mr. Softee bells that take center stage on Ice Cream). When it comes to finalizing to the best cut, you'd best stick with Verbal Intercourse, as it features masterful lyrics by the Chef and Killah, and includes very SMART lyrics by Nas, perhaps even too smart for himself. If Incarcerated Scarfaces isn't considered crack-rock catchy, maybe the word needs to be redefined. And if this is considered the best Wu-Tang solo joint, maybe you need to check out GZA's Liquid Swords. <br /> <br />Personal favorite= Verbal Intercourse <br />Honorable mentions= Criminology, Incarcerated Scarfaces, Guillotine and Wu-Gambinos
B000069AUI|5.0|When I first heard Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, not long after it came out, I thought it was pretty good, but not great. But when the band released this follow-up, I was blown away! The music sounds better, and the melodies probably sound better, too! This is one of the best albums I've ever heard!
B000002B5L|5.0|The Score proved one thing in rap music- it did settle the score, with all the controversy and bullsh*t that was coming out back then. Like A Tribe Called Quest, none of the Fugees members were as good solo as they were together. <br />What really holds the album together is the tight and fiesty production, much props given to the man, Salaam Remi, courtesy of the Refugee Camp. <br /> <br />The \\"sick like salmonella\\" lyrics proved to be too smart for even Bill Gates to understand (see: The Beast and Cowboys). Maybe being influenced by Jamaican musicians was a way to come out for this trio. The lyrics in The Score played an incredible and undeniable role in making The Score one of rap's most thought-provoking albums in the 90s, while catapaulting Wyclef Jean into hip-hop's elite production circle. Recall a sly Lauryn Hill claiming to \\"play her enemies like a game of chess\\" in Ready or Not. <br /> <br />Personal favorite= Cowboys <br />Honorable mentions= Ready or Not, The Beast, Fu-Gee-La and No Woman, No Cry
B00008O31H|4.0|It would definitely be going to far to say that The Black Keys missed their stride with this album, but there is something about it that is just not as catchy as their debut \\"The Big Come Up\\", or their third album, \\"Rubber Factory\\". I think the album works if viewed as a slow burn rather than the blazing bonfires of their other material.  <br /> <br />Guitarist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney kick this one off with the heavy and ultra-fuzzy \\"Thickfreakness\\", the go to \\"Hard Row\\", a solid blues-rock number that again has echoes of Cream-era Eric Clapton. <br /> <br />Things don't really pick up until the fourth track, \\"Midnight\\", with its catchy guitar riff and smoky vocals. Next up is \\"Have Love Will Travel\\", another great old school blues number with a passionate chorus by Auerbach backed up with Carney's rapid-fire drumming. That's followed up by \\"Hurt Like Mine\\", which rounds out this triple-shot of hard-core blues numbers. <br /> <br />Next up is \\"Everywhere I Go\\", which, at 5:43, is easily the Keys' longest number. It's basically a nice, extended blues jam. It sounds like a bootleg of a performance in some hazy juke joint, and is testament to the ability of this pair to go beyond their usual bite-sized numbers. \\"No Trust\\", the next song, carries on with the juke joint feel, and its smooth stuttering riff and smartly-placed wah-wah would make it a sweet driving song. <br /> <br />\\"Hold Me In Your Arms\\" is likely the best track on the album. It starts off with a slow, measured blues riff, and then gathers speed as Auerbach kicks in with anguished vocals, adding some sweet slide along the way. Awesome song, easily one of their best. <br /> <br />The album ends with \\"I Cry Alone\\" pulling the listener back to that juke joint with an ultra-minimalist number marked by spartan cat burglar guitar plucking backed up by light cymbal-tapping and the occassional drum beat. <br /> <br />I briefly considered giving this album only three stars since I didn't feel it isas good as \\"The Big Come Up\\", which got four stars from me. But it's really an excellent album, just one with a different feel than their debut, which had several toe-tapping tracks that would not be out of place as radio singles. This is more of a mellow-out album that bears repeated listenings to fully appreciate.
B000023VR6|5.0|Firstly, let me clear some things up: 1) whoever dared to say this is beyond the original Chronic must be smoking too much chronic themselves. This will never come close to the original Chronic and 2) to the person who said Dr. Dre has been in the game longer than anyone else today, you're forgetting LL Cool J. I believe LL Cool J is the only one today who has been in it the longest. <br />With that out of the way, 2001 does lack a little more than what Chronic did and that is: 1) the skits and the sex skit are annoying. I guess Dre didn't learn anything about that area from the original Chronic, and 2) the album sounds too cluttered with all the extra guest appearances. Its great to see the likes of MC Ren and Snoop Dogg back here but we just don't hear enough of Dre by himself, Chronic suffered the same problem. <br /> <br />While Chronic relied on a smaller core of gangsta MCs, Dre turned the sequel, 2001, into a crowded West Coast block party. However, the funk-in-outer-space production that runs throughout the entire LP makes up for the extra unnecessary verse or two. One (or shall I say two) other things that this album provided was that it proved Eminem was capable of delivering more than a nasal flow and initiated the mainstream validation of Xzibit, taking him out of his underground placing. 2001 is time-tested and sure-to-get-you-high classic material. <br /> <br />Personal favorite= Forgot About Dre <br />Honorable mentions= The Watcher, Big Ego's, What's the Difference, The Next Episode and Some L.A. Niggaz
B000063WDH|4.0|Take a big chunk of blues rock, throw it in a sack with some Cream-era Eric Clapton, a bit of Jimi Hendrix, a pinch of Stevie Ray Vaughn and a hint of Creedence. Shake vigorously, deep fry until extra-crunchy. <br /> <br />Akron, Ohio duo The Black Keys followed just this recipe for their minimalist debut album, with results that are nothing short of amazing.  <br /> <br />Guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach's fingers canter up and down blues scales with ease, and his fuzz dial is obviously set to \\"11\\". His sandpapery pipes sound as if he's guzzled whisky and puffed filterless Camels for far longer than his 20-some-odd years would allow. This guy has no business be able to sing like this. <br /> <br />Auerbach is perfectly complemented by Patrick Carney's enthusiastic pounding of the skins, which is never, ever relegated to just providing a background beat. As producer, Carney is also largely to thank for the Keys's distinctive gritty bootleg sound that sounds as if you're spinning a dusty 45 unearthed in the back of some record shop. <br /> <br />The pair come barreling out of the gate with the very first track, \\"Busted\\", an energetic number that immediately gives notice to listeners that this band is about scorching, unapologetic blues. <br /> <br />From there, they move into the down-and dirty \\"Do the Rump\\" and on to the slightly Creedence-ish \\"I'll Be Your Man.\\" A few tracks later is another straight-up blues song, \\"Run Me Down\\", which leads into \\"Leavin' Trunk\\", an incredible song that sounds like it could have been an undiscovered Cream gem. Then it's into the ultra-fuzzed out \\"Heavy Soul\\". Their cover of The Beatles' \\"She Said She Said\\" is nothing short of amazing. It is the perfect cover -- reimagining a classic while remaining true to its heart and soul. <br /> <br />The album wraps up with \\"Brooklyn Bound\\", another masterful blues rock number that sounds like something you only hear on classic radio stations at like 2:00 a.m. Actually this is technically the second-to-last song, but the real last song, \\"240 Years Before Your Time\\" is just 4 minutes of slow, dreamy electric guitar noodling followed by 20 minutes of silence. I hate these kind of filler tracks, and thankfully it's a mistake the Keys didn't repeat in their next two albums. <br /> <br />There are several songs I didn't mention, but not because they are in any way bad. Indeed, there's not a shoddy number on the album (except the last pseudo-song\\"). You definitely get your money's worth with these tunes. The Black Keys are definitely one of the most significant recent music finds for this die-hard blues and classic rock fan. I thought they didn't make music like this any more. I'm glad I was wrong.

B0002O06N0|5.0|After an explosive debut album and a mellower sophomore effort, Akron duo The Black Keys roar back with \\"Rubber Factory\\", a passionate, catchy, masterpiece that proves these guys are for real.  <br /> <br />In their third album in as many years, the Keys press ahead with their revival of the long-sputtering genre of blues rock. Having rejected a major record label and signed instead with blues authority Fat Possum, the Keys stay true to their fuzzed-out demo-tape sound, recording the album in an abandoned tire factory, with drummer Patrick Carney producing the songs on his trusty 4-track (or did they graduate to 8-track by now?). Topping both their previous efforts, \\"Rubber Factory\\" does not have a single bad song. It is actually difficult to pick the best ones because they are ALL so good. <br /> <br />Unlike \\"The Big Come Up\\" and \\"Thickfreakness\\", though, \\"Rubber Factory\\" starts off in low gear with the mellow \\"When the Lights Go Out\\". Things get pumped up right after that with what is undoubtedly the catchiest song they've done yet -- \\"10 a.m. Automatic\\". This song is so fun and addictive it takes a conscious exertion of will not to just play it over and over. <br /> <br />The nice mellow ride of \\"Just Couldn't Tie Me Down\\" recalls a bit of the juke joint feel so prevalent on \\"Thickfreakness\\". The next three tracks -- \\"All Hands Against His Own\\", \\"The Desperate Man\\" and \\"Girl Is On My Mind\\" -- form a trio of catchy, classic-rock style tunes. Things mellow out a bit for a sugary ballad, \\"The Lengths\\", but get kicked right back up with \\"Grown So Ugly\\", a jammin' and hard-hitting rock number. \\"Stack Shot Billy\\" is a wonderful electric-slide resurrection of the outlaw song, and shows that these guys know their source material. \\"Aeroplane Blues\\" and \\"Keep Me\\" are other straight-out sonic assaults that will put a crooked smile on the face of anyone with an ounce of blues running in their veins. <br /> <br />The album closes with a real bang -- the energetic \\"Till I GetMy Way\\". The crunch of Auerbach's guitar and Carney's head-bobbing tattoo meld into some of the best jamming they've yet displayed.  <br /> <br />\\"Rubber Factory\\" is a nearly flawless piece of work that should have no problem standing the test of time. I hope these guys are having as much fun making this music as I am listening to it. I already can't wait until the next one...
B0000AFX64|5.0|There are actually three different versions of this, the pilot movie for Battlestar Galactica.<br />#1 The first version was  a full length movie that tested in Europe and Canada in 1978. This version has never been released in the USA.<br />#2 SAGA OF A STAR WORLD is the pilot version that runs in a 3 hour<br />time slot. It is the same as the #1 version but the ending was altered so that Count Baltar 's life is spared by the Cylon Imperious Leader. An added epilogue shows the arrival of three new Cylon Basestars, a \\"new\\" Imperious Leader, Baltar alive and the first appearance of Cylon Lucifer.<br />It premiered on US TV in 1978. It is available in the DVD box set. (The one with the Cylon head on it)<br />#3 (This version) Is the theatrical version that played in US theatres the summer of 1979 and was available on VHS for most of the 80's and 90's.<br />It is a much shorter version of #1. Several lengthy sequences, most notably the attack on Caprica, have been removed or shortened. It is in stereo and is letterboxed on DVD(but does not have a very wide picture) and features the original ending in which Baltar is beheaded (off camera) by the Cylons. It does not include the epilogue and is notable for moving along at an almost jaringly fast pace. Basically they just took the scissors to a print of #1.  Only of interest if you must have the stereo sound.<br />And in response to those reviewers who never watched Galactica until now.  WHAT KIND OF SUPER DORK WATCHED BUCK ROGERS AND V, BUT NEVER SAW BATTLESTAR GALACTICA???!!!!!!!
B0006399FS|5.0|I've been listening to U2's, \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" for over a week now and I'm glad to say that I'm very impressed. If your like me and enjoyed their last disc, \\"All that You Can't Leave Behind,\\" you'll love HTDAAB. The album kicks off with the iPod jingle, \\"Vertigo,\\" which is an upbeat rocker that will remind you of old times. Another highlight of the album is, \\"Love and Peace or Else,\\" which is another classic U2 jam. Other highlights of the record are: \\"Miracle Drug,\\" \\"Sometimes You can't make it On Your Own,\\" \\"City of Blinding Lights,\\" \\"All Because of You,\\" \\"A Man and a Woman,\\" \\"Crumbs from Your Table,\\" \\"One Step Closer,\\" \\"Original of the Species,\\" and \\"Yahweh.\\" As you may have notice, I just listed every song on the CD because there's not a dull moment from beginning to end. I would highly recommend picking up this CD. Believe me, you won't regret it!
B0002XDOBC|5.0|Best described as psychedelic hard rock...very hard for its day and a precursor of the heavy bands to come like Led Zep, Hendrix and Sabbath. This release is a remastered 2-disk deluxe edition with both mono and stereo versions of the album. It also includes seven demos including two versions of \\"Lawdy Mama\\" which is the exact same song as \\"Strange Brew\\" before Felix Pappalardi's wife Gail Collins came in and wrote new lyrics for it. Another strong demo is the bluesy \\"We're Going Wrong\\" featuring some nasty guitar interplay between Jack Bruce & Eric Clapton.  <br /> <br />In addition to the demos, this package includes nine BBC recordings including versions of the yet to be released at the time \\"Politician\\" and \\"Born under a Bad Sign\\". All the BBC tracks are excellent (or should I say groovy) and surprisingly concise (no drum solos!) for Cream. There is also an alternative version of \\"Take It Back\\" with Clapton on lead vocals instead of Ginger Baker. Of course this groundbreaking album also includes the hits \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\", \\"SWALBR\\" and my personal fave...\\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" which was written by Clapton and sung brilliantly by Bruce. Also included is a 20 page booklet with photos and some pretty good liner notes where I learned that Ahmet Ertegun dismissed \\"Sunshine...\\" as psychedelic hogwash and amazingly Disraeli was recorded in a mere six days!  <br /> <br />This edition is intended for the serious Cream fan only as it's very expensive and you can buy the original single CD version for a third of the price. I hope this reunion tour pans out because seeing this trio together live today would be incredible.       <br />
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie will make some laugh hysterically, others will find it mildly funny, but most who have the capacity to find the good in this far from perfect movie will at least be entertained. <br /> <br />These characters, who are socially inept, attitudinally challenged, or mildly delusional, bring to light some of the less attractive qualities of our race. Yet there is much to like in these characters, even with all of their flaws. <br /> <br />This movie speaks a lot of truth. I have known people in my life who resembled the people in the film. And the events that unfold are not all that strange. As far as the school election goes, I have seen a similar thing happen during my school days. <br /> <br />Rent this movie. If you don't at least appreciate it, there might be a part of you that is under developed!
B00008D1NF|5.0|I am enjoying this album so much it is hard to listen to anything else at the moment.  I bought it because I am a long time Marisa Monte devotee - but I was a little worried that combining her talents with 2 other artists might water down her intoxicating effect on me.  But I needn't have worried ... this album is superb.  Her soulful voice reaches the depths of your being as always, and there are marvellous Brazilian rhythms and other delights to surprise you.  A must have if you love Marisa and/or contemporary Brazilian music.  Just wonderful.
B000059TEP|3.0|If Woopy Goldberg was not in this movie I would not bother to see it!!
B000002GXS|5.0|You can't go past the early classic triology of [[ASIN:B000002GYR Closing Time]], [[ASIN:B000002GXS The Heart of Saturday Night]],and [[ASIN:B000002GYG Nighthawks at the Diner]].     Some of the best bluesy-jazz beatpoet ballads you'll ever hear, this was Waits at his finest, before he grew bored and reinvented himself.     Any of these albums will sit finely in any music collection, all of them deserve 5 stars. My tastes vary greatly, but I never can do without these albums, they are simply brilliant.    Go and buy it, put it in the player, turn the lights down low and enjoy with a couple of shots of your finest!
0060555661|5.0|One of the greatest business books of all time.  A \\"must have\\" for the library of any serious long term investor/businessman.  Ben Graham was Warren Buffett's mentor, and Buffett has always attributed his great success to the lessons/wisdom he learned from Graham.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat is a brilliant movie.  The cast is incredible (Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer, Judd, Sizemore, etc) and the directing (Michael Mann) and editing are top-notch.  But what makes Heat special is the story and characters.  This is no ordinary heist film, although the plot revolves around two robberies pulled off by De Niro's crew.  Heat is about much more than the crimes and the action scenes (which are stunning).  It's about loyalty, honor, obligations, betrayal, revenge, and the inability of obsessed men to do right by their loved ones.  Pacino is an LAPD cop who faces off against De Niro's small group of professional (in every sense of the word) gang.  On one level they are natural enemies - hunter and hunted, cop and robber.  Deeper down, however, they understand each other and their similarities.  Pacino, De Niro and Kilmer all have woman trouble too; how these situations are resolved under the stress that ensues is pivotal to the movie.  Alternately brutal and touching, disturbing and uplifting, this film satisfies in every way.  The scene with Judd and Kilmer towards is the end is classic.  Enjoy!
B000005RY7|5.0|For the Die hard fan of KISS this is a must have.  It has a lot of the hits to that point on it and it really rocks!  The four previously unreleased tracks are average, but with frequent listening they do grow on you.  This CD completes the Kiss fan's CD collection and is a must have!
B00000DGRX|4.0|In June of 1972 I was graduating from Chippewa Valley High School in Clinton Twp., MI (and lived in the same subdivision as Paul Feig, who created the 'Freaks & Geeks' critically acclaimed television series).  In that same month, Deep Purple saw 'Smoke On the Water' become their signiture song as it rose to number 4 on the national charts, and their album 'Machine Head', their sixth album, top the album charts.  In November of 1998 Rhino Records reprised the DP epic with this \\"25th Anniversary\\" (one year late by my figgerin'...) edition.  There are several treats that make this version of 'Machine Head' desirable, including extra tracks and not one, but two remasters of the master tapes.    Deep Purple is a band that had schizophrenic experiences on each side of the Atlantic.  In their homeland of England, the band scored hits with songs such as 'Black Night', 'Strange Kind of Woman' and 'Fireball', songs that never charted in the US.  Here in America the band was better known by their hits 'Hush' and 'Kentucky Woman', songs that never charted in England.  Even 'Smoke On the Water' did not chart in the UK until a live version rang the bell at number 21 in 1977.  One of the better tracks from this disc, 'Never Before', didn't chart in the US either, but reached number 35 in England.  This 25th anniversary edition includes the rare b-side from that single, 'When a Blind Man Cries'.  It's a nice blues number to have, even if it doesn't fit in sonically with the rest of 'Machine Head'.    There are several stand-out tracks on 'Machine Head', most notably 'Smoke On the Water', 'the rambunctious 'Highway Star', the highly entertaining 'Space Truckin', and the seven-minute plus 'Lazy', which develops itself as an instrumental for the first three-and-a-half minutes before breaking into verses lambasting the attitude of a slacker.  Not the usual line for rock lyrics!  'Never Before' is another winner, and unique in that it possesses a discernable melody, while all the othersongs simply rock and rattle you into the ground.  The remainder of the tracks, 'Maybe I'm a Leo' and 'Pictures Of a Home', are good support tracks, but don't approach the quality of the five aforementioned blazers.    We're also treated to the Quadrophonic mixes of 'Maybe I'm a Leo' and 'Lazy' on disc one.  Perhaps it's just my imagination (I'm not sure the differences can even be appreciated on a stereo playback unit) but the tracks do seem to deliver greater timbre.  A second disc is included which features bassist Roger Glovers' 1997 remixes of the entire album.  Each track seems to possess greater balance and differentiation between the instruments, and some feature different guitar and drum segments.  It's hard to say one version is better than the other, but since you get both it's really a mute question.     Recorded in 1971 in Montreux, Switzerland, most of the tracks run over six minutes in length, with the exception of 'When a Blind Man Cries' (3:33) and 'Never Before' (3:59), so there is a good deal of music from the expanded 8-track version offered here.  It is, in my opinion, the apex of their catalog.
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Well, that *poseur* looks like a genius next to these (...). Heck, I think I'd even listen to Fred Durst before this - at least he had the wherewithal to fail on his own terms, instead of simply ripping off everything he could get his hands on. I don't think I'd give these guys a ride if it was 20 below out... they'd probably steal the carpet from the backseat.
B000286RNY|1.0|I tried, really I did.  I managed to sit through 52 minutes and 14 seconds of this movie before I just couldn't force myself to watch anymore. <br /> <br />It started out really promising, and I was getting into it, thinking if it started out OK it might just get better as time went on.  It really had the potential to be hysterical, but it just got more and more absurd, and I was no longer amused. <br /> <br />Even my husband, who was certain beyond all doubt that he would love it, was begging me to turn it off. <br /> <br />Sorry if some of you will feel the need to slam me for this, but I'm just being honest.  I hated this movie.  I liked the first 10-15 minutes, and then I just HATED it.  Maybe I should watch the dubbed version instead of the subtitles... or maybe I shouldn't waste any money.  I rented this with a free rental coupon, and it's a good thing, 'cause I would have been pretty ticked to have lost money AND 52 minutes of my life.
B0000931QA|5.0|This is the defining point of Queensryche as a performing entity right here!  All bullsh*t aside.  Slap you in the face and let you stare off into oblivion.  Hands down their best effort then or now.  Compared to \\"The Wall\\" on so many occasions, but those two albums are night and day.  We don't have the special effects team in full form as we do on any Floyd opus, but that's not what Ryche's Mindcrime is about.  Continuity and storyline seem to be the main focus here, formed around the music.  It's creepy, it's brutal, it's politcally driven 1980's commentary.  Mindcrime remains pure, though some of the references my be dated.  Spruced up and remastered, a few live trax thrown in for good measure.  Welcome . . . to Operation:Mindcrime!!!!
B000002J1Y|4.0|Truly an amazing performace at the time, this recording is lacking in sonic quality. Vinyl does it justice and so does the original packaging. Jaded I'm not, but sorry the \\"re\\" mastering was not so mastered. Virtuoso, expressive Yes at their best, don't miss it. This is really good stuff for sure.
158799190X|1.0|This is a painfully bad book. Nassim Nicholas Taleb's observations are completely trivial, lacking any depth and conclusion whatsoever, and it takes you a while to understand that this book is not about randomness and the way the human brain is easily fooled when interpreting information.<br /><br />This book is about Taleb himself - one huge ego trip and at the end impossible to read. No one can criticize the intellectual message of the book - that humans make bad decisions because they underestimate the fundamental effects of uncertainty.  But Taleb misses to discuss the immense amount of research available in this field performed since quite some time by economists, psychologists, and others. In fact, the entire field of behavioral finance is devoted to the broad outlines of this book. It is one thing that there is absolutely nothing new in this book; it does not even provide a synopsis of interesting research or real-live implications or applications. What is more embarrassing even is that Taleb steals some of the best episodes in behavioral finance without feeling the need to reference his sources.<br /><br />What makes Taleb's book so unbearable is that he is so full of himself for knowing Greek mythology and all the philosophers while at the same time knowing about financial engineering. He tells us several times that he is working out. At the end of this book you will feel fooled by this guy for writing a book so irrelevant, worse yet, you will feel bad for having been fooled into investing time and money.<br /><br />If you are looking for intellectual stimulation, you are better off with some of the classics, such as J.A. Paulos' \\"Beyond Numeracy\\". Or I suggest you read G.A. Akerloff's \\"Market for Lemons\\" article, just a couple of pages long and written in 1970, a little masterpiece that is as powerful as it is simple.
B0001FGBL6|5.0|I hate comparing bands, but Epica definitely should be in your collection. This album is THE most rewarding and enjoyable.<br /><br />Mark Jansen has really left After Forever behind, this CD surpasses their best \\"Prison of Desire\\". A notable difference for me is the subject matter and atmosphere. You can't help feel an Islamic undertone rather than Catholic. I hope the average listener can appreciate a reaction to terrorism, and the beautiful art that comes out of this. In the least, expect a strong meaning and message behind great compositions.<br /><br />This CD is a relief because ANYONE can enjoy it, even those new to the genre.<br />+ Best writing I've heard in a B&B band<br />+ The singer Simone Simons is very talented, strong and capable for carrying the band further.<br />+ The chants, like the whole album, are light and calming, not fast and overused.<br />+ The high/low growls are fitting for the subject matter, set the tone for many songs, and as always illuminate the singer.<br />+ Memorable songs \\"Cry for the Moon\\", \\"Feint\\" and \\"Phantom Agony\\" (which took awhile to appreciate) among others.<br />- The only complaint is the poor word choice in \\"Seif al Din\\".<br /><br />I won't rate the songs because EVERY song is GREAT--BUY IT! (yes that implies supporting the band, not pirating)
B00007AJF9|3.0|Queen Elizabeth I of England is one of the most impressive figures in European history. She came to the throne in 1558 at the age of twenty-five, upon the death of her half sister, Mary I. It was a time of much political instability, and the young Queen's task was made even more difficult by the fact that her legitimacy was by no means universally acknowledged (many saw her father Henry VIII's marriage to Elizabeth's mother, Anne Boleyn, as being invalid, since he was never granted a Papal dispensation for the annulment of his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Mary's mother), and by the fact that Elizabeth was a Protestant. And on top of all this, many of the English people were far from jubilant at the prospect of another female ruler, after the disastrous reign of her sister Mary. The years immediately following Elizabeth's ascent to the throne, therefore, were fraught with uncertainty and danger. In order to retain her crown and win the hearts of her people, Elizabeth would have to become a strong, almost superhuman figure, and it is this formative process that the film \\"Elizabeth\\" seeks to show us.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film does not entirely succeed. Elizabeth reigned for 44 years, an extremely long time. Her maturation and the development of her status as a national icon were shaped by a series of trials, both political and personal, that took place over the course of multiple decades. It would be nearly impossible to accurately show all this in a 2-hour movie. \\"Elizabeth\\" suffers from the fact that the makers of the film simply tried to cram too much material into the 124 minutes they had to work with. It could be called a \\"Cliffs Notes\\" version of Elizabeth's story - the film provides a sketchy overview, but you wouldn't want to rely on this as your primary source of information. Many events are truncated, jumbled together, and even shown out of historical order, with the effect that they make very little sense. One would have to have considerable knowledge of Elizabeth's life before seeing the movie to really understand what is supposed to be happening in many of the scenes. The relationship between events is not readily apparent from the movie itself. But the problem, for those that come to the movie with previous knowledge if Elizabeth, is that they will also notice all the historical inaccuracies in the film. And there are many.<br /><br />For one, there is no evidence whatsoever that the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley was ever sexual, yet very early on in the film there is a sex scene between the two. That they loved each other very much is undisputed, but Elizabeth was rarely left alone, even in her private chambers, being almost constantly attended by her ladies in waiting, and there would have been very little opportunity for her to let the relationship go so far. Furthermore, Elizabeth would have been aware of the inherent risks in having a sexual relationship - primarily that of becoming pregnant. In addition, she knew she could never marry Lord Robert, for he was already married to Amy Robsart (and she did indeed know of this, though the film seems to imply that she was unaware of it prior to Cecil's announcement of the fact), and Dudley was also extremely unpopular with most of the members of court, and it is unlikely that Elizabeth would have risked her throne - a very real danger - by carrying out a sexual affair with him.<br /><br />Even more confusing, the latter part of the film implicates Dudley as a co-conspirator in a plot against Elizabeth. This makes no sense at all. Though there were times when the real Dudley incurred the Queen's displeasure, and fell temporarily out of favor, their disagreements were usually short-lived, and the two remained good friends their entire lives. Dudley's last letter to Elizabeth was a love letter, and when Elizabeth herself died years later, this letter was found on the table beside her bed. Another discrepancy is the fact that the Duke of Anjou shown in the film is the wrong Duke of Anjou. Elizabeth was indeed courted by Henry, Duke of Anjou, and he did indeed cross-dress, but he never visited her. Much later his younger brother Francis, who took on the title after Henry ascended the throne of France as Henry III, took up the suit of Elizabeth, and he was the one who travelled to England. But he was never known to cross-dress. The film also implies that Francis Walsingham conspired to assassinate Mary of Guise, regent of Scotland. First of all, it was Cecil and not Walsingham who was sent to Scotland, and secondly, Mary of Guise died of dropsy. There are numerous other, more minor inaccuracies, but it would be tedious to list them all here. For more information on the real Elizabeth, I highly recommend the biography \\"The Life of Elizabeth I\\" by Alison Weir.<br /><br />On the flipside, the film is saved by Cate Blanchett's magnificent portrayal of Elizabeth herself. Blanchett definitely deserved her Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and she alone is the reason I actually added this movie to my collection. She is also the only reason I would ever have even watched this movie more than once. Blanchett has a very strong screen presence, and really captures the intricacies of Elizabeth's character. She is the backbone of the film, without which it would undoubtedly have crumpled into a shapeless mess. The other actors - primarily Joseph Fiennes as Robert Dudley, Richard Attenborough as William Cecil, Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, and Christopher Eccleston as the Duke of Norfolk - do admirable jobs, but the ways in which the film skews their characters undermine their performances. The only other thing I would really commend this film for is its costuming, which is magnificent. Elizabeth's wardrobe alone is stunning. The DVD Special Features are decent, though not overly impressive. There are two trailers, two featurettes on the making of the film, a photo gallery, and information on cast and crew.film is the wrong Duke of Anjou.

0312330529|5.0|Best opening paragraph I have read since \\"Tale of Two Cities\\".  Having been to India a number of times it was wonderful to be able to almost smell the country in the way he writes.  His adventures are incredible and if he has done half of what he writes about he is amazing.  I highly recommend this book.
0553266306|5.0|Forsyth wrote this book, supposedly, in about six weeks. It compares favorably to works that have taken months, or years, and is more compelling than most of le Carre's novels. The \\"Jackal\\" is on a methodical countdown the day he will assassinate de Gaulle, and the French authorities frantically attempt to find and stop him. The best aspect of the book is that one can see from both the perspectives - Commissaire Lebel's manhunt, and the Jackal's preparation and execution of his plan. Great thriller!
B00005QAPK|2.0|As originally conceived by Fellini, the Toby Dammitt segment was, imho, the greatest work he ever committed to film.  Taut, lean, stylish and very effective.  I saw the film when it was first released and am fortunate enough to have this segment on an old beta tape. <br /> <br />Beyond Terrence Stamp's wonderful delivery, is the crucial element of the english actor being alone and isolated in Italy by his language, slowly pushing him deeper into surrender and madness.  All of this is lost in the current French dubbed edition. <br /> <br />(On the other hand, it must be a plus to have the first two segments,  overdubbed into English for US release, back to their original French.  However, these segments are competent, or somewhat interesting at best, compared to fantastic finale.) <br /> <br />Please let Janus know that they have broken trust by butchering a great artist's masterwork.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I got this album the day it was released and wondered like a lot of her fans, if Alicia could top SIAM and go diamond but distance and perspective have made me realize that diamond status of an album does not mean good music was produced because as we all know, plenty of mediocre and less than mediocre \\"singers\\"/entertainers or whatever they call themselves are selling enough albums to go platinum.<br /><br />A year later, the only songs that I still really don't like are Wake Up & Samsonite Man.  Wake Up has a nice beat/production and message but...not one of my favs.<br /><br />Otherwise the album is a solid hit - the standouts are the trifeckta: You Don't Know My Name, If I Ain't Got You & Diary.  The placement of these three songs back to back to back is incredible - all three are love songs that touched my heart and I never tire of listening to them.  I heard a lot of people complain that her speaking interlude in YDKMN was corny but it was a sweet throwback to the days when a breakdown was required in any love song.<br /><br />The other standouts to me are: Karma, Harlem's Noc, So Simple, Heartburn and Nobody Not Really.  Karma & Heartburn certainly surprised me with the funk factor - both are extremely catchy, fun songs that I love to hear and see her perform because I think they allow her to step out from behind the piano.<br /><br />Rounding out my faves are: Dragon Days, Feelin U Feelin Me - interesting interlude, wished it could've gone on longer & her remake of If I Was Your Woman/Walk on By.<br /><br />Overall I give this an A+ as a step up from SIAM - an excellent sophomore set from an artist who I expect to write/produce a album as important in the musical world as Stevie Wonder's Songs In The Key of Life one day.
B00009V7T2|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time. Not many bands make records like this anymore. Its trully a work of art, and id recomend you give it a listen. The album really is a masterpiece in its entirity, it flows together very well start to finish. This is not onw of those albums with just a couple good tracks, it really deserves an uninterupted listen. (listen for the first time with headphones!)
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This was the dumbest hour and a half of my life.  I literally fell asleep in the first ten minutes.  My friends forced me to watch it but I felt I was losing brain cells watching it.  Anyone who waste money on this DVD will live to regret it.  I was a waste of time for anyone who helped make this piece of cinema trash.  Don't waste your money.  Run leave this web page now and get a good movie.  May I suggest the witty satire \\"Saved\\"!!!!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Whether you like this movie or not, I give it 5 stars because it shows the Public what is going on. And for the people that say, don't believe what you see on this movie, well, Michael Moore doesn't use special effects. The footage of Bush IS actual footage. This may be propaganda but it is also and eye opener for the public, as to say that not everything is hunky-dory behind the scenes. There are things that are happening that you don't know about, and Michael Moore at least tries to make people see that. You don't have to agree with it, but there does need to be more awarness of what is actually happening with everyone on this planet. You may think that it doesn't affect you, but when Billions of dollars(your money) are going towards things that you might not even know about, then there is a problem. This film tries to show that, and I think it also tries to get people to speak up and say, that is not right, we need to do something.
0345350499|2.0|I just bought this book, intrigued by the ideas presented on the cover, and paid a pretty hefty price for it new.  I finished the book, despite just wanting to give up several times because I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I was sorely disappointed. <br /> <br />The novel starts off well enough, giving it's own 'true' version of the events as seen through the eyes of Igraine (Arthur's mother) and Morgaine (his sister), but quickly turned the entire beautiful legend into a battle between men and women, and worse yet Paganism and Christianity.  I felt betrayed, as though one of my favorite legends had been adapted to promote some personal agenda.  Nonetheless, as I stated, I finished the book. <br /> <br />The good points:  The writer had areas of very beautiful imagery though they became further between as the novel progressed.  It was obvious that Marion had studied closely the places involved in the myth, and how they fit in with the time period.  All in all, she seemed a fairly good writer. <br /> <br />The bad points:  The novel seemed to be written with a distinct distaste for Christianity.  I am not religious myself and it was even painfully clear to me.  THE WORST thing in this novel was Gwenhyfar, formerly my favorite character.  I could not stand to read a single thing the girl said, since the author made her so narrow-minded and simple, that it almost hurt to read what words supposedly came out of her mouth.  The love affair between Gwen and 'Lancelet' was dumbed down.  I found it particularly insulting that the beautiful but tragic affair was turned into a nearly homosexual affection for Arthur on Lancelet's part, instead of genuine love for Gwenhyfar.  Near the end of the book when it seems the author will make up for this by allowing the two to run off, Gwen suddenly decides to join a CONVENT instead. All in all, every conversation revolved entirely around no-win arguments between females/males and pagans/Christians.  Halfway through the book, the dialogue was sickening me and I wanted to pull my hair out by the roots. <br /> <br />To sum up, this book would have been much better if Marion had made up her own characters for this Feministic book instead of taking on our much beloved Arthurians.  Even so, I have to say that I still doubt I would care for this book if it had nothing to do with Arthur at all. <br /> <br />I rate it at a 2* simply because of her try for a unique point of view and her hard work.  If you really love Arthur, this book will probably be as huge a disappointment for you as it was for me.

B0001AP12G|5.0|When Kanye West dropped, he changed the game, literally as far a production. He stepped his game up big time on \\"College Dropout\\". Each track has a life of it's own and always packs soulful impact. This is one of the definitive albums of not just hip-hop in 2004, but black music in history (specially since it made the Grammys for 10 nominations!!).

0062502182|4.0|There is a quiet grace to this story which held my attention as I lived the journey with the young boy. It seems from other reviews that some people are diasppointed by it simplicity. I was not and I highly recommend this book.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Worst $6.50 i have ever spent in my entire life.  i don't know how so many people find humor in this piece of crap.  if coming up with junk like Napoleon Dynamite is all you have to do to be a quality moviemaker, maybe i should send in the tape of me and my friends rocking out on inflatable guitars and lip-synching Tenacious D's \\"Tribute\\", which was playing in the background.  i have something to say to everyone who has ever said, \\"it's so stupid it's funny\\".  i'm all for stupid humor, like O Brother Where Art Thou, and Zoolander, but this was just too stupid for me, which is saying a lot.  Napoleon is not so nerdy that he's funny.  that is just another excuse for laughing at this lame movie because everyone else says it's funny.  and for all you \\"intellectuals\\" who want to justify laughing at this show, don't give me that sh-- about all the subtle humor.  there isn't any.  don't try to argue, there just isn't.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I think a lot of people are missing some of the subtle themes on this album. <br />Everyone seems to get it for Reise Reise and Mein Teil. Great songs, fairly straightforward messages.  At this point I should say, this album was so well worth the wait. <br /> <br />Now as for Dali Lama, I suggest everyone read over the poem \\"Der Erlkönig\\" by Goethe.  Dali Lama actually turns out to be a bit of a remake of this poem and I think they pull it off masterfully.  Also the whole Dali Lama being afraid to fly thing. <br /> <br />Keine Lust sounds to me the most like the \\"old\\" rammstein sound.  It brought back memories of Sehnsucht, my favorite album of theirs.  Plus I loved the lyrics. <br /> <br />Los was a totally new direction, with accoustics rather than electric guitar.  It's a great track, but only as a standout track. An album like this wouldn't have eben good and rammstein did a nice job of using this idea when it counted. <br /> <br />Amerika isn't one of my favorites, and not because of the emssage. I think it's a very valis point but I just don't like the music as much. <br /> <br />Moskau just turns out to be really catchy.  While I agree with one fo the previous reviewers that it gives flashbacks of Tatu, (remember those average looking lesbian russians?) it just gives the feel of being at a concert and feeling the energy that comes with it.  For that, this song is great. <br /> <br />Morgenstern, I believe, is one of the best songs on the CD.  The vocals and music are hauntingly great. this song sends chills down my spine every time. <br /> <br />I see Stein um Stein as another connection ot an older work: \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" by Edgar Allen Poe.  The idea of walling someone in, while they watch, seems way too close to this older story to be coincidence.  Also a nice play on words, fitting their name in towards the end.  Very clever lyrics and I like how the song begins. <br /> <br />Now for the ballads: <br /> <br />Ohne Dich takes the pace way way downbut I love the lyrics here.  Rammstein's clever lyrics will never cease to amuse me. :-)It's for songs like this I suggest you either learn a little german or check out translations at a place like [...] <br /> <br />Amour closes the CD slowly. Am I the only one who thinks of Final Fantasy VII when he hears the first few notes? Anyway, the lyrics are fun, if pesimistic. <br /> <br />Overall this CD did what every one before it has done: captured my attention for months and left me wanting the new CD to come out ASAP. Happy listening, everyone.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|Please Please Me and Strawberry Fields Forever were both #1 on the British Melody Maker chart.  Twist and Shout was # 1 on the U.S. Cash Box and Record World charts.  Nowhere Man was # 1 on the U.S. Record World chart.  So the Beatles 1 CD is not truly representative of all The Beatles # 1 hits in the U.S.A. and England.  These are hard facts that can be easily looked up on the internet! Elvis Presley's CD of # 1 hits took all charts on both sides of the Atlantic into account, don't  Beatle fans deserve the same consideration or was this more Paul McCartney history revision as the songs mentioned above are all associated with John Lennon???
0553801546|3.0|I read the first two books of the Tawny Man and was thrilled, but then I read the third.<br /><br />It seemed to me that Hobb was leading us down a certain path with these books, but then at the end of Fool's Fate swurved and tumbled of a cliff.<br /><br />The story is not in keeping with the previous books rhythm! We learn that the majority of his emotions thus far are because he \\"dulled\\" the edges of his world and he miraculously get them back and the world is once again crystal clear as is his love for Molly, whom was already described as just a youthful love. No, now it is true love and oh! since she's available now (strange coincidence)he can go get her back!<br /><br />Angered? Yes I was, but I could have been fine with this upset that is until she dismissed the Fool. All that happens, all that they were put through and the sacrifices that they made for one another and yet in the end he is completely dismissed form Fitz's life as just another sad memory, another regret? No, that I couldn't stand. The Fool loved him, that was made clear long ago and yet now that they are closer than they have ever been he can simply leave? I understand that he was put under a trumendous ordeal, but even that pales to the sudden attitude the Fool has at the end and really the only word I can think of to describe it is exactly that \\"a dismissal\\".<br /><br />Starting at the scene before Girl-on-a-Dragon and leading up to the cabin and Fitz's diparture the book begins to fall apart. It feels as if we are being led in a direction and then swiflty turned about the other rode forgotten as well as all the possiblities it held.<br /><br />I dearly loved the Farseer Trilogy, in fact I still do, but this new trilogy has now spoiled it for me. I caution anyone who loved that trilogy as much as me and who loved the Fool, don't read these books. Simply stop at the last trilogy because you'll be dissapointed.<br /><br />Angela.
0767817664|5.0|One of the few mainstream horror films from the 80's that is still great to this day is the original Fright Night.  Helmed by Tom Holland (who would go on to direct the original Child's Play), Fright Night contains all the familiar elements and conventions of the vampire film genre, but thanks to Holland's energetic direction, great cast work, and some great (mostly) makeup effects, Fright Night succeeds where most others fail, and is a fun horror classic.  William Ragsdale stars as Charley, a horror loving teen who suspects his new neighbor (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire.  Soon enough, Charley's suspicians prove true, and with the help of an eccentric B-horror movie actor (Roddy McDowell), he sets out to stop the powerful vamp as his family, friends, and girlfriend (Married...With Children's Amanda Bearse) are threatened.  With tried but true conventions and everything else mentioned above, Fright Night may not be the best vampire movie you'll ever see, but it's certainly one of the most fun.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|Poorly directed and thoroughly uninteresting.  I am at a loss to explain why so many people have rated this film so highly:  I personally got nothing out of it.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted and has many red herrings; the pace slogs in the middle; the main character is frigid and unreadable, and the climactic moment of passion is confusing and predictable.
1594200106|4.0|THE SHADOW OF THE WIND by Carlos Ruiz Zafon (Translated by Lucia Graves)<br /><br />February 5, 2005<br /><br />This book may well be on my top 40 list for 2005.  THE SHADOW OF THE WIND plays two roles - it's the title of this book by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, as well as the title of a book by Julian Carax, a character in this book by Zafon who becomes a focal point in the life of young Daniel Sempere.<br /><br />Daniel is taken by his father to a secret place known as \\"The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\" and finds the only book still available by Julian Carax. What Daniel wants to know is why all of Julian Carax's books have disappeared, and he spends his days and nights trying to solve the mystery. The more involved he gets, the more he finds himself in danger for his life. Along with his best friend Fermin, Daniel takes it upon himself, against the advice of more than one person, to find out what happened to Julian and the books that he had written over the years. Who was destroying the books?  And who was Julian?<br /><br />The charm of this book is not just the dual stories of Daniel and Julian, but the many characters that fill the pages. Larger than life personalities, they add to the fantastic story that builds into the climax, a twist of an ending which I did not see coming. The book is rather long, but I think that anyone that can finish this book will find that they will find satisfaction with it.  It was well worth my time, and I hope to read other books by this author. THE SHADOW OF THE WIND shows what good story telling is all about.
B000268QB2|5.0|This band just might survive the new wave of Brit-rock-pop-alt that has emerged recently.  I don't think comparing them to their compatriots like Coldplay, Travis and the like does them any justice.  Their songs and sound stand alone as one of the best bands of the last year, hands down.
B000268QB2|5.0|I can't really describe Keane, the vocals sound a bit like thom yorke's from radiohead...  But the music itself is very much pop.  This is hands down some of the best music I have ever heard in my life (and I've listened to a lot of music).  There is NOT ONE SONG on this album that disappoints.  There's something about foggy dreary places that produces some of the best musicians, because England is and has always been on a roll when it comes to the quality of their music and artists.  Same with Iceland and Seattle (where grunge evolved).  So I'm really starting to believe that the worse the weather is in a certain place, the more creative the people.<br /><br />Please rush out and buy this, you won't regret it.
0765309408|5.0|After reading about ten pages of this, I had to go back and check the title page for the author, sure that it would read Robert Heinlein, not John Scalzi. Mr. Scalzi has obviously spent some time and effort analyzing Heinlein's methods and style, and the result here is an excellent novel that reads just like a brand new Heinlein.<br /><br />The opening paragraph grabs: \\"I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife's grave. Then I joined the army.\\" Simple, direct, and immediately intriguing. And from this idea of geriatric soldiers the entire story unfolds: how these advanced age people are given new, enhanced bodies, interfaced with a remarkably effective internal computer, and sent to fight the baddies of the universe. Why they must fight. What the reasons are for living. Where the human race is heading. The problems with making assumptions about other life forms - and the effect that has on diplomacy.<br /><br />Plot wise, this is a series of incidents and battles in the life of a soldier, without any strong goal or endpoint in mind. But as the scenes unfold, the person that is John Perry comes into clearer and clearer focus, a quiet, unassuming man who nevertheless can think on his feet, is not dismayed by radically new things, a natural leader with seventy-five years of experience to back up his decisions and actions, a man capable of deep love. Most of the people around him are not so well realized, but they really don't need to be.<br /><br />Comparison is obviously invited with Heinlein's Starship Troopers with its similar theme and environment. But where Starship Troopers is very much a coming-of-age story, this is an adult trip into the land of survival. And where Starship Troopers had a large amount of philosophy directly exposited, Scalzi's opinions in these areas are much more muted, more shown rather than told. Replacement of Heinlein's powered armor with Scalzi's enhanced bodies doesn't cut down on the action, but does highlight the importance of the mind inside the body, its spirit, its willingness to fight not just for himself but for all of his compatriots and the race as a whole. Where Starship Troopers might be considered a treatise on government, civic responsibility, and military organizations, this has a somewhat less lofty goal, of showing why life is worth fighting for.<br /><br />For anyone who loves Heinlein, this is a must. For those who like military science fiction, this is a must. For those who like a good story, powerfully told, this is a must. I fully expect to see this one on the Hugo nominee shortlist next year. It already has my vote.<br /><br />--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)light the importance of the mind inside the body, its spirit, its willingness to fight not just for himself but for all of his compatriots and the race as a whole.

0393317552|3.0|I prefer Diamond's sweeping new book, Collapse. It's much less \\"academic\\" yet it conveys many of the same ideas. In Collapse, Diamond sketches out the path of cataclysm. Environmental harm, climate alteration, fast population growth, and imprudent political choices were all factors in the ruin of some societies, but other societies found solutions and are surviving. Similar troubles face us today and have already brought calamity to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to muddle through in ground-breaking ways. Despite our own society's apparently limitless possessions and unequaled political power, portentous warning signs have begun to come into sight even in ecologically strong areas like Montana. This is an important book that raises many important questions. Every concerned person should read it.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I have to say this is one good flick.  A story of a couple who come to an end of their relationship decide to erase their memories of their dreadful relationship.  Joel (Jim Carrey) in the process of erasing his memory of Clementine (Kate Winslet) journey through memories of great times and in his mind trys to escape 'the procedure' of erasing Clementine.  The acting, chemistry and the direction of the movie really intrigued me.  I don't think I've ever been touched by a movie that reminds me of the troubles of love as this movie clearly reflects.  Great flick, too bad that Jim Carrey was not nominated for an Oscar for this is his best performance as of yet.  Great special effects with apparently no CGI!! Highly Recommend this artistic and fascinating journey!!
0395854393|5.0|You'll be transported to the icy north by this breath-taking multimedia version of the perennial holiday bestseller. Join a young boy on his magical Christmas Eve train ride to the North Pole, where he recieves a special gift from Santa. Based on the Caldecott Award-winning book by the same name, The Polar Express, CD-ROM Edition is a multimedia storybook that combines state-of-the-art animation, an original music score, and narration by Garrison Keillor to make story time an adventure for kids ages three to eight.
0316172324|1.0|I had high hopes when I bought this book, but it turned out to be a big letdown.  Rather than a manual about how to refine one's snap judgments, the whole book is a series of how quick decisions can sometimes be better than careful reasoning.  As I read, I kept thinking, \\"Great, snap judgments might work sometimes.  How do I improve them?\\" but he never got to it.  The examples were interesting, but to write a whole book about them and only them...it makes you wonder if the author just wants you to go through his book without thinking.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Even the original release kicked ass, this is just a \\"upgraded\\" Peace Sells.....But who's buying? Megadeth Sells....Everyone's Buying. This album is really good, beautiful solos, hard drums, and an insane Vic Rattlehead
B00009V7T2|5.0|I bought this album in July of 2003, and I've listened to it steadily for about one and a half years. And, not surprisingly, the album is still going strong. Deloused is a self-indulgent masterpiece that never ceases to deliver something new each time I listen to it. It's not a record filled with typical singles; it's more like one long composition with multiple movements. It is arguably the best mainstream album of 2003, and I urge anyone who hasn't bought it to buy it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I would have to say that Star Wars has one of those fan bases that will stay strong na matter what. It's in the top five there with Raider fans(who still DRESS UP and then walk in public to see their team CRUSHED by their RIVALS) and Star Trek fans. But you have to wonder, why all this animosity towards Lucas? Lucas is living a filmaker's dream. He's taking a movie which he had a hard time making not being able to do everything he wanted and now with his own studio can do them the he wants. And he listens to fans and tries his best to please them without letting them run over him, unlike some companies i.e. Marvel Comics who doesn't allow their characters to be used in The Sims game. I say, if he wants to tweak the movie, good for him. Let him do it and lets enjoy it. The changes he made aren't bad, they don't do anything to hurt the movies original quality. I believe if Star Wars opened today, it could still be a top box office hit and finally bump Titanic off the top. Besides, all you guys who have the original on VHS, just think how valuable those will be in a few years from now. Sounds good, huh? So all in all, Lucas is living a dream and supporting his fans and you guys and simply biting the hand that feeds you. You should be ashamed.
B00026YO36|5.0|<br />The songs, even the more upbeat ones, are so heartfelt.  I Hit the City has the incredible PJ Harvey accompanying Lanegan, and they sing together in a manner that allows both of them to be heard in a slightly off-kilter manner.  It gives the song a raw feeling that will continue throughout most of the disc. <br /> <br />Wedding Dress--has a soft beat and Lanegan's Wait's-like vocals and a sensuality that veers away from anything sappy.  This is a songwriter's song with the slight female accompaniment.  It's a slow plodder that allows you to thoroughly enjoy Lanegan's voice and lyrics.   <br /> <br />Meth Blues--strikes me as a Captain Beefheart song.  Maybe it's the constant unusual beat or the swirling, unstructured guitars.  It sounds like he didn't listen to the guitars in this song when he laid down the vocals--ALA Beefheart--or maybe it's the constant interruptions in flow.  Whatever the case is, if it's my world, and I decide what is considered a hit song.  This is in the Top 40. <br /> <br />100 days--I don't search songs for greater meanings.  I don't consider lyrics profound or breathtaking.  I merely like arrangements.  100 days is probably the most structured song in Lanegan's Bubblegum.  It has the into, the refrain, the followup, the instrumental, the refrain and the subsequent lyrics to close the song.  The beauty of this song is something to behold.  The refrain is so delicate.  It almost seems unintended.  I was ready to criticize this song, until I remembered the refrain.  It starts out slowly, then carries you to the wow! mindset when the refrain starts.   <br /> <br />Bombed--Maybe the steal of the disc.  Again a female--Wendy Rae Fowler--accompanies him, and she seems to be singing the lyric sheet after him, almost as if she doesn't know the song.  I'm not criticizing.  I'm pointing out the flavor. The effect works well on this song, as it adds the rawness to an otherwise carefully structured song.  This maybe the prettiest song Lanegan has ever written.  It's quick and some of the times brevity is the soul of profound. <br /> <br />Strange Religion--Another one of the stars of the disc. It has that simple nursery rhyme background that is common in some of the best country songs.  I wouldn't consider Lanegan country, but he will dabble in the occassional folksy interlude.  This is the type of song Lanegan for which Lanegan is known, but he even appears to be stepping this up a notch on Bubblegum.    <br /> <br />Sideways in Reverse--Is this disc's hardest rockers--almost punk Lanegan.  He makes it work in the integrity of the disc, but it's my least favorite song of the epic Bubblegum.  <br /> <br />Come to Me--My favorite song on the disc.  \\"Come to me, lie on my shoulder.\\"  PJ Harvey again. These two work so well together.  To quote a cliche, the two of them appear lost on a lonely highway together, looking out on the country's vast resources, wishing they could be more intimate with one another. <br /> <br />Like Little Willie John--Crunching background of a man telling you his theories on life.  \\"I once believed, I'd never bleed.\\"  The lyrics catch me on this song.  \\"...I dropped like a satellite.\\"  This is artistic.  Lanegan even stretches his otherwise low octave vocals to another level.  The strum of a guitar kicks in halfway through the song to let you realize that Lanegan is not all about the hopeless, depressing viewpoint that with which he has been tagged by many of my friends.  Maybe it's the \\"good looking women getting off the plane,\\" that makes Lanegan realize that life is going to be great even though he cannot \\"get back to my special one.\\"   <br /> <br />Can't Come Down--This may have been an important song for Lanegan to include, but it doesn't have much meaning for me.  It's a skippable song on this disc. <br /> <br />Morning Glory Wine--Another skippable song <br /> <br />Head--Back to focus.  I absolutely love the guitars and arrangement of this song.  Another songwriter's song.Lanegan is the master of his domain, but he appears to ready to bust out on this song.  I hear a lot of the Queens of the Stone Age work on this song.  \\"She drew a picture and stuck it in her pocket...\\"  The lyrical phrasing on this song is primal and raw and heartfelt.  The guitar fuzes in and out of Lanegan's lyrics.  Top 3 on the album. <br /> <br />Driving Death Valley Blues--another Q of SA influenced song.  Upbeat and blasting.  Lanegan is a god.  I repeat this every time I hear this song.  You want to punch a hole in something inanimate during this song, just to get it out.  This song may have the best instrumentals on it.  <br /> <br />Out of Nowhere--cleans the disc off with sentiment.  \\"Send a kiss out of nowhere...\\"  Some piano work to bridge this song.    <br /> <br />Overall, I don't think you can listen to this album one time and realize the brilliance of Mark Lanegan.  I also add that if anyone reading this believes you should be able to do this, you need to start listening to more artistic music.  There are many people singing and playing music to be stars or famous or legends.  I dare say, without ever having heard Lanegan address the issue, that Lanegan is not one of those types.  You'll probably never see him on MTV, and if you're listening to music to be the first to discover the next up and coming star, then you're listening to music for the wrong reasons.  Lanegan will never be that guy, and you'll be listening to him for all the wrong reasons.  For those of us that simply enjoy a beautiful song, a beautiful album, or a complicated mess that will become beautiful after repeated listens, then this is the best disc for you...enjoy!
0156029065|4.0|Umberto Eco is a professor of semiotics and a several-time bestselling author who appeals to me on a number of different levels. His novel Baudolino is at the same time a fantastic historical novel and a philosophical exploration into the nature and experience of historical truth. I won't pretend to be a competent reviewer of this immensely complicated piece of literature; I will stick to my own joyful experience in reading it.<br /><br />On the surface, the novel is set in medieval Europe and centers on a poor Italian man named Baudolino, who is not yet an adult when the novel begins. The story is told by an unreliable narrator who is clearly concealing what most readers want to count on as facts in a historical account. The story is told in the context of Baudolino recounting his amazing and fantastical life's story to another man, Master Niketas.<br /><br />Master Niketas, an eastern Greek, is a historian and a skeptic, priding himself on not believing most of the outlandish details of Baudolino's incredible story. We hear the story from Baudolino's mouth, but always in the background is Master Niketas' skeptical eye.<br /><br />The basic narrative of Baudolino's life is ruled by two constant themes. First, Baudolino is amazingly adept at languages: he need only hear a few sentences of another language and he can soon begin to communicate in it. Second, Baudolino is a most astounding liar, even by his own admission. In fact, the basic tension throughout the book is held up by the fact that Baudolino himself can no longer remember which events actually took place and which he fabricated but then began to believe to have actually happened. He approaches Master Niketas in hopes of having some help in figuring out what actually happened.<br /><br />Baudolino recounts his adventures that range across the whole of the medieval world. He first comes across the emperor without recognizing him. Baudolino had just been in the midst of an indiscretion with a young lady from the village when the emperor and his men step out of the mists and asks what he is doing in the wood. He promptly fabricates a story of how he was speaking with a saint who appeared to him in the wood. Taking this as a favorable sign, the emperor proceeds to question him about it, and unknowingly, Baudolino invents a false prophecy about the victory of the imperial army over a rebelling city nearby. The emperor immediately takes Baudolino into his service as an advisor, and the story takes off from there.<br /><br />Baudolino goes on to invent the Holy Grail and a dozen other holy relics along the way, eventually inventing a whole magical kingdom supposedly ruled by the original Magi from the east. The further from his village Baudolino gets, the more outlandish his tale becomes, until (400 pages later) he is captured by cynocephali (\\"dog-headed\\" soldiers from India) and escapes by stealing their rocs and flying back to Constantinople at an altitude unattainable to angels. The adventure along the way is the real joy of this novel; the characters he meets, the philosophical discussions along the way, and the adventures in the midst of which he finds himself are a series of wonderful gems. Eco is a superb master of medieval history and his attention to detail and insight into the minds of the time is vivid and sweeping.<br /><br />But the fascinating part of Baudolino is in the exploration of historical truth. On the surface, it appears that Eco is undermining any reliability of historical fact because of plausible deceptions made by those who would record it. But at a deeper level, he frequently makes known that the basic flow of history cannot have been fabricated because of its sheer inertia. Even lies told for reasons only important at the time lend their own truth to the larger picture. Objective fact and human perception form the basis of the mysteries explored in Baudolino. It is one of the few novels I have read that manages to please on every level: the writing is flawless, the detail exquisite, the plot engaging and fast-paced, the themes involved important, and the characters memorable and engaging. This is a novel that will remain on my shelf to be revisited again.ry level: the writing is flawless, the detail exquisite, the plot engaging and fast-paced, the themes involved important, and the characters memorable and engaging.

B000006OBQ|5.0|A great live album.  Put this in the CD player and close your eyes.  Have a scotch on the rocks and light a cigarette, and boom, you are at the Sands listening to Sinatra in concert.  One of the great live albums that I have in my collection.
B00000DSEK|5.0|I think this album shows Ozzy at his best level yet is not his best album it is a classic like Blizzard of Oz or DOAM although not made along with Randy Rhoads , Zakk Wylde shows a new aspect and a different sound for Metal Guitar and I believe this album comes to be the last Great Ozzy Osbourne, and the one thing to remark is the fact that Mr. Wylde dares to mix 2 very different sorts of music such as Metal and Country, by the way, on this album Robert Trujillo makes no appearance, its Mr, Mike Inez who makes tunes like No More Tears and their amazing bass lines possible.For the late Randy Castillo, thats true, the last Randy Castillo's studio album with Oz.    Considering Ozzy osbourne is now a complete muppet and nothing else but a bad joke, this album is a must have for any new fan.

This movie's got a vibe to it that just doesn't let up and if it connects with you like it does with me, you'll love it.  Dialogue and writing that will just pierce through you like a round from a thirty-ought-six.  Direction that is amazing.  And, if you're at all familiar with NYC - I'm a SF native myself, but know NYC far better than any two-bit bowery boy -  then you're in for a treat as well too.  It's just got a flow to it that you're gonna connect with.<br /><br />If you've seen this and like it, check out the \\"sequel\\" Blue in the Face.\\"  It too is right on par with this.  Also, check out any of Jim Jarmusch's films too (e.g., Down By Law, Mystery Train, Dead Man, Coffee and Cigarettes, etc.).<br /><br />Oh, the piece above? It's relevant to the movie.  Those who have seen it know what it is if they were paying attention.  Others may know it just by knowing it or knowing that it was written by one of the greatest songwriters/performers alive.  But, it is a part of this movie and I just wanted to include it for you.  Another reviewer here *hinted* at it in their excellent review when they mentioned some of the scenery.  Anyway, maybe it'll serve as some motivation for some of you to finally break down and get this absolutely stunning film finally.  I hope so.<br /><br />Enjoy.his movie and I just wanted to include it for you.  Another reviewer here *hinted* at it in their excellent review when they mentioned some of the scenery.

B00026WU82|5.0|I really do not know why this is viewed as his best, I personally think that Blonde on Blonde is his best, lyricly and musically. But this does have the classic \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and a few other classics, it just has some weaker tracks. I also enjoyed \\"Bringing It all Back Home\\" much more.  <br /> <br />On another note: <br />Rolling Stone listed this as the 2nd greatest album of all time. They listed Blonde on Blonde as number 4.
B0000C6E4D|1.0|Sarah McLachlan has always been a top notch artist in my book.  In today's music scene, her vocals & music, are like no one else.  I looked forward to 'Afterglow' with much anticipation.      The end result, left so much to be desired. Gone were the smart lyrics & mesmerizing music that made 'Surfacing' so enjoyable.  'Afterglow' was so full of repetitious melodies, it was a struggle to actual listen to it.    I tried numerous times, but it was too painful.    For an artist who recently got married & had a baby, she should be on top of the world (In my life those 2 events were some of my happiest).   Yet, this CD seemed to channel sadness more than any other emotion.  It felt like many of her songs were like the gushy greeting cards you read in the store.  I'm all for romance, but songs like \\"Push\\", just make you want to puke.  It's just TOO over the top.    The redeeming parts of the album are 'Fallen', and the standout track,'Time'.  'Time' echoed glimpses of her greatness, so fleeting on this CD.  By all means do your ears a favor and skip this boring mediocre effort.   Pick up 'Surfacing' or 'Fumbling Toward Ectasy', those 2 CD's represent what Sarah is all about.
0385510454|1.0|I have read all of Grisham's books. This one by far is his weakest. I did say it was 200 pages too long, and that is being kind. It could have been 250 pages shorter. I was really surprised Joel didn't put a bullet in his head from boredom, but maybe that was just me. Instead of writing a book every year, Mr Grisham should begin to follow Creighton example and write one every two or three. The only bright spot on the horizon is that Martini's new book will be out soon. Thank god for that. <br />
B0006B2A2E|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The first time I saw it it blew me away, I have seen it a couple of times since and it still is mind-blowing.  It is the story of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) who break up after a rocky two year relationship, Joel goes to see Clementine and she doesn't know who he is and he finds out that she has had a new procedure done that erased her memories of him so out of bitterness he decides to have it done too.  Only while it is being done he realizes that he would rather have the memories of her and know that he could love that much and be that angry than not have those experiences at all.   <br /> <br />I wouldn't say that this film is a comedy it has some funny moments, it is really a drama it makes me sad every time I watch it.  It is not a film for everyone you have to have an open mind and even if you find it confusing watch it to the end it will all be explained.   <br /> <br />I will say one thing though, don't watch it before you go to sleep it will give you the freakest dreams ever (I won't make that mistake twice.)
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is awesome.  as the title says, this is one of those rare recordings CDs where there's not only one good song or single on it.  Every single song on this CD is good.  The first song (shut up) and second one (welcome to my life) are really awesome.   <br /> <br />The DVD side is also pretty neat.  they have this little movie about how they made their CD and they show you all their guitars and equipment and a lot of neat stuff.   <br /> <br />Really awesome band, great music. <br /> <br />HIGH RECOMMENDED!!!!!
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Anyway you shake it, this movie is fun.<br /><br />Think of a 1930's serial done with modern production values and special effects. It has plenty of kitchz, camp, nostalgia, \\"futuristic\\" ( 30's style ) machines, melodramatic overacting as well as a feel for the relative innocence of the age. It was done as if it was really made in the early 30's and the writers, producers, directors and actors had no idea what was coming up just a few years later.<br /><br />It's a thrill a minute and full of fun and surprises. It's worth owning the DVD if only allow you to see it over and over to study the magnificent artwork put into the backgrounds, machines and costumes.<br /><br />The plot is unimportant ( really ) but briefly the mad sciantist Totenkopf has created a race of intelligent machines who - yes folks - want to destroy the world ( really ).<br /><br />It's up to Sky Captain assisted by intrepid reported Polly Perkins to rescue his assistant Dex from the evil clutches of Totenkopf with the help of interpid one-eyed British flying aircraft carrier commander and former girlfriend Franky.<br /><br />The movie is treat for the eyes and practically every scene is magnificently detailed with 1930's imagined advanced technology.<br /><br />If I were to make one change I would have given the robots a more photo-realistic look. They wanted to make the world look like a 1930's serial and succeeded a bit too well I think.<br /><br />The robots had a \\"carboardy\\" 2 dimensional look. Since it would have been just as easy ( maybe easier) to make them look more realistic I have to conclude that they looked exactly as the director intended. I think it owuld have been better to have maintined the \\"retro\\" design but make them look like really really real. I think that would have added a dimension to the movie that I think it lacks.<br /><br />Other than that, it's great fun and a welcome addition to my now-bulging DVD collection.
6305949980|5.0|My review might be biased because I love Tim Burton's work. It's a mixture between bizzare and beautiful. Your taken into this strange and unhappy world. The characters suck you in. I was able to watch this movie with my friends or with my little brothers and sisters. It's amazing!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|With the Sundance favoritism and the hype surrounding dead-pan comedy \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\", i could not wait to experience this piece of indie film.  To my surprise, the movie disappointed me thoroughly.  Begining slow and coming to an even slower pace, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is the pitiful and longwinded story of a highschool nerd and his struggle for girls and class presidency.  Filled with random bouts of what is supposed to be comedy and cheap-shots at high school satire, this movie breathes endless monotony and undeveloped emotions.  The characters are boring and without feelings (although the acting on the mexican student character's and the photography girl's character was done quite well) and i found myself constantly being bored with Napoleon's continuous cynisism.  The script itself wanders all over the place, giving most of the interaction no purpose or consequence, so most of the scenes are pointless.  This film may be found funny by those who see themselves as better humans than Napoleon and his friends, but for the rest of us who just want to enjoy well-made, well-written indie films, this heap of trash is at the substratum of my list of horribly bad films.
6305841861|4.0|\\"Evil Dead II\\" does not so much strike me as a sequel to \\"The Evil Dead\\" but a reworking of the first film.  Director Sam Raimi seems to be more confident in his prowess behind the camera as well as a storyteller.  The horror here is leavened with humor but in no way does it overwhelm it.  This is a horror film.  Bruce Campbell also developes as a performer here.  In the first film he seemed more like a nondescript college kid overwhelmed by the horror that engulfs him.  Here he comes off as not only a believable action hero but as an adept comedian.  His character evolves as the film progresses into a goofy parody of Rambo.  Groovy.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I personally think that this the the best album of Britney Spears, every song in this album is amazing!! Hit songs includig Overprotected, I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman, Boys, etc. This album is really hot!!! U have got to but this!! It's really hot!! Loves it!!
B0000844IT|4.0|Your enjoyment of \\"Army of Darkness\\" is not totally dependent on seeing the \\"Evil Dead\\" films first but it does help.  This film takes something of a departure from the first films in attempting to mainstream the series.  It is more humorous and it is virtually bloodless.  It is also interesting that director Sam Raimi took the series into a time-travel vein.  The action scenes and special effects are terrific.  This film is played for macabre humor as opposed to outright horror.  Star Bruce Campbell just continues to amaze as the series progresses.  He had already proven himself as a comic force in \\"Evil Dead II\\" and here he expands himself as an action star something akin to an Errol Flynn or a Harrison Ford.  If you want to wean the squeamish on the series start with this film and go backward.
B0000DZTIW|4.0|Hans Zimmer has put together a fair number of soundtracks over the past few years. From Gladiator, to King Arthur, he's managed to produce quite a resume over the past little while. <br /> <br />This score did not stop short of what we all should be expecting from Hans Zimmer. He created a fairly dark sounding score that didn't sound too Japanese for the movie, but had just enough of it to remind us where the story is taking place. <br /> <br />I are a number of songs in this soundtrack that were great. Some of my personal favourites were \\"Taken\\", \\"Red Warrior\\", \\"To Know My Enemy\\", and \\"Ronin\\". The music in this really suits the picture well and aids in transporting viewers to another world. Although I think sometimes it got a little bit repetitive, it was pulled off well, and I can't give Hans any less credit than he deserves. Thumbs up for this one. <br /> <br />If you haven't already seen the movie, do so because it was great!
0140177396|3.0|This novel was part of our lit. study in English class, and the first time I had to read it I quite liked it. I thought it was well-written and vivid, and I was especially impressed by the ending. Going back to it on my own, I really can't say that Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is anything above \\"good\\". Yes, the imagery is good, and its well written. Yes the book is \\"deep\\" and contains a lot of meaning.But somehow, I wasn't too impressed. <br /> <br />For one thing, Steinbeck's descriptions might be good, but it takes more to make a reader feel the writing than making it sound good. A picture can be pretty without compelling you to look at it for a long time. Well, this is how I would describe Of Mice and Men; the writing is sleek and polished,and, well , perfect, but I just felt that it was rather lifeless and lacking heart. The characters were wooden, and both the people and places within the novel never felt quite real enough to me.  <br /> <br />I also found myself really annoyed with all the themes in the story. Obviously, for any novel to attain the status of greatness, a good theme, or \\"themes\\" must be present. However, Steinbeck doesn't simply present his themes, he shoves them down your throat, over and over and over and over again, until you just want to scream I GET IT ALREADY. When themes are too obvious, it takes away from the sincerity of the writing, and makes you too aware that you're reading a book, and good books should transcend that. <br /> <br />All in all, I semi-enjoyed reading this book the first time. It is well-written, and demonstrates Steinbeck's creative flare. However, the story just didn't get to me, and I put down the book feeling nothing for the characters or all that had happened.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|To be honest, I thought that a lot of this soundtrack wasn't actually that good. However, a lot of it was completely killer! It was fantastic! Here is my overview. <br /> <br />Klaus Badelt was the composer of this score, and this was actually the first time I have heard of him. I would like to hear some of his other music to see if it meets the reputation for this soundtrack. I think that the majority of the music used here was suitable and it really set the mood for the story being told. It captured both a sense of the time period it was taking place in, and a sense of authenticity and it really had that pirate/british quality to it. There's no doubt that it added something to the movie <br /> <br />When you listen to a lot of it by itself, it doesn't sound that good in my opinion. There tends to be a lot of fast loud punching stuff in there mostly which would be when the film is focusing around the Black Pearl. A lot of this has a very dark feel, which isn't a bad thing depending on what you want to here. <br /> <br />However, there were also a lot of really good super awesome songs that will seriously want to make you flip out! Precisely which songs am I talking about? It's called \\"He's A Pirate\\" and its the song that plays when the credits start rolling. Other great songs from this title include \\"One Last Shot\\" and \\"The Medallion Calls\\" <br /> <br />Personally, I wouldn't spend my money on this CD. In fact I didn't, I donwloaded it. That's what I would do, but if that's not available to you, it's worth downloading. Watch the movie first though.
6304708521|5.0|This movie is not about any one thing  <br />in particular, except maybe the Beatles  <br />and their adventures on acid... who  <br />wouldn't want to watch this. For one  <br />it's the biggest band in rock and roll  <br />history.. no scrap that, the biggest  <br />band in history, and they're doing  <br />phsycedellic drugs. This is the Beatles <br />the way they should be... enjoy it.
0743243315|5.0|The main, only really, lesson Nazneen's mother teaches her is submission to fate.  Indeed, Nazneen is \\"left to her fate\\" from birth, when she is at first thought to be stillborn.  This is a recurrent theme and it's interesting to see how it plays out in her life. <br /> <br />Nazneen's sister Hasina's long letters in broken English -- I suppose it's supposed to be broken Bengali -- at first seem a bit tough to read.  But *do* read them as they add a lot to the story. <br /> <br />One reviewer poses the rhetorical question \\"Who wants to read about some Bangladeshi housewife (or, for that matter, any housewife) holed up in their (sic) boring existence?  Well, speaking as on of those boring housewives, I had a hard time believing that we'd read the same book (boring?).  I guess fine storytelling, culture clash and psychological insights won't interest everyone. <br /> <br />The one criticism I have is that Monica Ali ties up all the loose ends a bit to neatly for my taste.  Brick Lane is so rich and complicated -- until the last few chapters where ALL IS EXPLAINED. <br /> <br />All in all, though, Brick Lane is a definite must-read. <br /> <br />
B0002BK9J4|4.0|Ah! The 12th actual Ramones studio offering. Pretty decent for a band's later day effort. I've never been all THAT huge of a Ramones fan, but I do find them to be a real fun band to say the least. Some of the better cuts include \\"Cabbies On Crack\\", \\"The Job That Ate My Brain\\", \\"I Won't Let It Happen\\", \\"Poison Heart\\" and \\"Heidi Is A Headcase\\" (aren't most women?). New bassist C.J. fits into this long-running classic punk ensemble very well. Also wanted to mention their cover of the Door's \\"Take It As It Comes\\" isn't bad. So many bands out there that it's JUST occurred to me that three of these guys have now passed on, Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny. I don't believe I can recall a band that's had three original members dying within a three years time span. Still a great disc to have.
B000002JPA|4.0|'Images And Words' is the band's shining follow-up to their debut 'When Dream And Day Unite'. From the first listen of this CD, you can easily notice the guys have got a tad mellower, but at the same time, they've gotten to be stronger, songwriting wise. Does that make much sense? Tunes I was most impressed with were their MTV hit, \\"Pull Me Under\\", \\"Take The Time\\", the touching ballad \\"Wait For Sleep\\" and the eleven-minute epic \\"Learning To Live\\". Overall, just a great progressive release by a group, that I've heard SEVERAL fans comment that Dream Theater isn't just a rhetorical band - they've got something to say. I've always agreed with that point made well. Plenty of top quality musicianship, complex rhythms and nicely arranged melodies found here. Should appeal to most fans of Spock's Beard, Queensryche (duh!), Gary Moore and Marillion. Recommended listening.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Im 29 and enjoy the Potter movies a lot. Although Im not an avid reader of the books, I humbly beg the pardon of true fans of Harry. The first movie was excellent, the second kind of weakened, dont know if it was the acting or the choices of editing or not redoing of a scene. But the third, got back to excellence. Sure it was dark, but it didnt lack cheerful moods that the first two films had. I didnt notice until the second time I watched the movie, Harry keeps on waking up on the next cut scene, like there were a lot of those where he passes out and he wakes up in the next scene, perhaps it couldve been done in a different way. And Malfoy and his crew are less evil now, and are becoming just \\"jerks\\", which is good I think, but it still isnt quite believable yet. The third annoyance that I can think of right now is that when Dumbledore says \\"let them sleep and dream..etc. bla bla\\"...how does that work I ask you? I dont think Dumbledore would say that whole speech to Schnape out of all people, he shouldnt be saying any of that at all for that matter. Just a \\"let them dream for now..\\" and let the score handle the rest and the audience would get the purpose of that I believe. BUT ALL IN ALL, these minor annoyances didnt debase the movie. It is great. First was great, second iffy, third great.
B00003CX95|4.0|This movie is very dramatic, compelling and moving.  If you separate yourself out from the history, this is great theater.  Unfortunately, for many people, the only history they will ever learn about from this time period will be this movie, which is erroneous on many fronts.<br /><br />First of all, leaving the theater, you would think that Wallace was now going to be the father of England's heir to the throne.  Well, let's look at the problems here.  Wallace died in 1305.  Edward II did not marry Isabelle until either 1307 or 1308.  I'm pretty sure that Isabelle did not give birth to Wallace's son (I'm willing to bet all the rosary beads in Rome in fact).<br /><br />The portrayal of Edward I was overstated just a teensey weensey bit.  Probably one of England's better monarchs during the period, his supposed savagery in the movie exceeded what was recorded in contemporary history.<br /><br />Even with the historical flaws, the movie is an inspirational affair, promoting freedom and liberty (rather than self-rule which is what most scots wanted).  Taken for what it is worth, it can inspire you to believe that courage and determination can make a difference in your life and that of your community.<br /><br />Despite the gore and the inaccuracies, I still recommend this movie.
B0000027EP|3.0|Most bands that've experienced as many personel changes as Motorhead has would probably throw in the towel. But not Lemmy and the gang. No, sir! Not only has Motorhead stayed active all these years, but they haven't mellowed out, not one bit. Personally, I liked this CD nearly as much as I do their 'Overkill' or 'Iron Fist' offerings. Love seeing these blokes playing live. Tracks here I thought were showing the band's true colors are &#34;I'm So Bad Baby, I Don't Care&#34; (perhaps an anthem for some of us?), &#34;No Voices In The Sky&#34;, &#34;Shut You Down&#34; and their tribute to the Ramones &#34;R.A.M.O.N.E.S.&#34;. Another metal-blasting Motorhead catalog release that's fun to give a spin now and again.
1878574590|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic black and white graphic novel by Frank Miller, who helped revitalize the superhero genre with his versions of Batman and Daredevil.  Sin City might be described as \\"film noir\\", except for the fact that it isn't a film, it's a comic book.  But it soon will be a [[ASIN:B001R4KQDE film]]!  Frank Miller himself has co-directed the film with Robert Rodriguez, so there is a good chance it will be faithful to the comic book.  The film adapts more than one of the Sin City graphic novels, but I thought people might like to know who plays the characters from this particular book:<br /><br />Mickey Rourke plays Marv.<br />Jaime King plays Goldie.<br />Carla Gugino plays Lucille.<br />Jessica Alba plays Nancy.<br />Elijah Wood plays Kevin.<br />Rosario Dawson plays Gail.<br />Rutger Hauer plays Roark.
B00008BXJF|5.0|First off, let me take issue with the negative reviews here. Some people are just stuck in a time warp. Several people here give this disc a bad review because it's \\"not like the earlier stuff\\". Well, duh. I guess some people like bands that put out 20 slightly different versions of the same CD and call it creativity (if you are one of them then go buy a bunch of Dave Matthews CDs, you'll be in heaven). But not me. This disc IS quite different from the earlier material--which I also love by the way (I just bought the re-mastered version of \\"Red\\" and I enjoy it a lot). This CD has some very sophisticated instrumentals, some very enjoyable humor, and a level of composition that often sounds like contemporary classical music played on rock instruments.<br /><br />This version of the band has a different approach and a different set of strengths than previous incarnations, but it is a great band, hands down. And to blast Belew's singing is just an uninformed cheap shot: he is a singer who sounds like he is well aware of his limitations, but who gets a lot out of his singing while pushing the envelope at the same time. He also does himself a favor by not taking himself too seriously: he is not trying to be a rock vocal icon. The bottom line is that this is an excellent addition to the KC discography, and I dare say it is a very cohesive package as well; the individual songs are very good, but when you listen from beginning to end it really is a masterpiece. So if others here don't like it, fair enough. But don't take someone seriously if their entire trashing of this disc is based on the fact that the band has dared (GASP!) to refine it's sound over the last 30 years. That's just a dumb argument any way you slice it.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Everything and everyone is covered in black, white, or flat shade between. Police or guards (guarding what? from what?) are everywhere, in beetle-black armor with opaque beetle helmets. This inhuman environment is filled with people. The question is, are they fully human?<br /><br />This world's answer to war, crime, and violence is to flatten all emotion, in every one, with \\"Prozium\\". Our hero, Preston, seeks out the people who skip their doses and dare to feel. It's a capital crime, and he summarily executes the penalty more often than not. One day, his dose breaks on the floor. He is delayed in replacing it, then stops taking it altogether.<br /><br />That, of course, is where the movie really starts. It's also where tinges of color start to appear on screen, as Preston's mind opens to the figurative colors of emotion. This is a very good dystopic story, oddly similar to Brave New World even in its differences, but more like THX 1138. The action isn't as wild as comparisons to The Matrix would suggest, but this movie is a lot more thoughtful. And keep your eye on Preston's children. They are un-nerving throughout the movie, perhaps most of all in the last scene.<br /><br />I like this one a lot. It's got fair action, but it's a lot more than that. For one, it's an uncommonly effective use of the cinematographer's palette. Mostly, though, it starts from a premise that stands up to a little thought - a rarity these days.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00006J3WH|5.0|Finally discovering Buffy on TV was great. It became a ritual to set down with my neice and yell, scream, laugh and cry along with the show. We enjoyed the musical Once More With Feeling and couldn't believe the cast actually sang the parts. We loved it! The cd is great but Amber has always had our hearts. When we are together now and are bored one will start with the beginning song and we both sing together the entire cd. Right away she rememebered all of words. You can visualize the entire show while listening to it. If you like the show you will love the cd. Am I a Buffy fan? Yes...because it's fun.
0446678430|5.0|True to the Rich Dad Poor Dad series, this is another book you have to read if you want to become rich and to enjoy life. <br /> <br />Yes money can't buy happiness but it can buy you the TIME you need to do the things you really want to do. In that sense time is truly worth more than gold. <br /> <br />This is one of the books that will open up possibilities in your head, which is very important because if in you cannot imagine becoming a millionaire in the future then you will prove yourself right. <br /> <br />I see a lot of people (some of them my friends) wasting their time on useless, directionless, completely wasteful activities and then they wonder why nothing is happening to them. My advice is to follow Rich Dad's Three Paths to great wealth. <br />1. Increase your business skills <br />2. Increase your money management skills <br />3. Increase your investment skills <br /> <br />If the word investment or the other items above sounds technical and intimidating for you then this book is a big help because it is an easy and fun read.
0385474547|5.0|I've read this book once before, during highschool...i enjoyed it then.  I haven't bought the book on amazon, but where else am i supposed to enjoy good book talk?  The tale of Okonkwo is a tragic one indeed.  A tale of a proud man, who sees the demise of his people.  Shows the reader exactly what ignorance and what a forcefull will will do to the psychology and spirit of men.  Perplexing emotions and thought, this is not only an intellectual marvel, but as human a story can get.  If only the eyes of everyone were as clear as Achebes'.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Ok first of all, I don't understand why people keep saying that this CD has punk songs and high-speeded tempo and stuff. If you're into Ramones, Misfits and Black Flag, you better buy the first two albums (The clash -I prefer the uk version- and Give 'em enough rope). There you may find some good punk songs (not all of them are punk, though). The clash might have been a punk band, but I only consider them \\"punk\\" because they were fighting the authority, making fun of police and stuff, not because of their songs.  The punk community, of course, rejected this album and it was a bummer to them, but this is the best album of their entire discography. Anyways, this CD is one of my all-time rock favorite, along with Zoso (led zeppelin's 4th album). I've been listening The clash a lot, I even saw them 3 times in 3 different concerts, and I've been a the clash fan since i was like 12 more or less (long ago). <br />Excelent songs in this album are: \\"London Calling\\", \\"Hateful\\", \\"Death or Glory\\", \\"Spanish Bombs\\", \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\", \\"Train in Vein\\", \\"Revolution Rock\\", \\"Wrong 'em boyo\\", \\"Clampdown\\", \\"The Card Cheat\\". Of course I love the entire album, but I could listen this songs over and over and still won't get bored. <br />Well guys, I'm just going to sum up: if you like rock and/or reggae, get this album; if you are into hardcore and metal and all that kind of music, then just ignore this.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Finding Neverland is inspiring, captivating, bittersweet and heartwarming. Coming up with a classic like Peter Pan has got to be a process of wonder and endless imagination, which is exactly what this film's all about. Superb acting and breathtaking photography make it a big contender at both the box office and award shows. It's definitely one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />Go see it. It's a great film for the whole family. It's a much needed film in these dark, cold times we live in.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah has had many great albums throughout the years (daydream, mariah carey) but this album is definetly is Mariah at her best, and personally my favorite album of all time. Most critics say this was the end of Mariah because she was sounding more \\"hip-hop\\" but I personally think that she wasn't really going more \\"hip-hop\\" because this was just the new \\"pop\\" of 97' when Puff Daddy and his Bad Boy artists were hot at the time and Mariah took some of that and magically blended it into her sound making an awesome album, and the best in her catalogue. The one song on the album that \\"people\\" say was way too \\"hip-hop\\" was Breakdown ft. Bone-Thugs, but this song is actually my favorite song ever which had really deep lyrics and a great sound, and bone-thugs add to the song b/c they aren't on there rapping crazily, but there rapping is melodic and goes with the song. Another great song off of the album is the remake of Prince's \\"Beautiful Ones\\" that Mariah does ft. Dru Hill. This an awesome song, and unlike other remakes that Mariah did in the past ( and I do love the other covers like Without You and Open Arms) she makes the song her own and its awesome. And just for the ballad people, she has a song great ballads on here, including one of my favorites Whenever You Call, that is a great song.This album is Carey's best (closely followed by Daydream) and even though it's more of an R&B Hip-Hop album, its still \\"popular\\" music at its best, and her voice sounds flawless as ever, maybe even better. <br /> <br />1. Honey- 5/5: A great song to start off the album. its more uptempo and \\"hip-hop\\" done by Puffy and is just a great song and a \\"new\\" Mariah. 12th #1 song. <br />2. Butterfly- 4/5: Great ballad with symbolic lyrics (could be towars her ex-husband) with great vocals. <br />3. My All- 5/5: 13th #1 for Mariah with spanish guitar and powerful vocals at the end. <br />4. The Roof- 5/5: A mid-tempo hip-hop song(doesn't include a rapper)which shows Mariah can flawlessly do hip-hope. One of my fav's on the album. <br />5. Fourth of July- 4/5: Initially I wasn't really feeling this song, b/c it seemed like it was trying to be like Underneath the Stars the Daydream album, but now, 7 years later (has it been that long) I'm liking the song, and it has a mellowness to it that I'm feelin. <br />6. Breakdown- 5/5: An amazing song, with deep lyrics and a great feel to it. My favorite song, def. should have went to #1. <br />7. Babydoll- 5/5: Great R&B song with Missy Elliot co-writing and producing w/ Mariah. Great sound, and should have been single. <br />8 Close My Eyes- 4/5: Strong Lyrics about having to grow up too fast. A very emotional song. <br />9. Whenever You Call- 5/5: Awesome vocals on this song, with a great piano background. <br />10. Butterfly Reprise- 4/5: Good dance remix to Butterfly, but I dont like it as much as Daydream Interlude (Fantasy Dance Remix). <br />11. Beautiful Ones- 5/5: Great cover w/ Dru Hill (not trying to remake the Boys ll Men Moment) in which Mariah makes the song her own and its \\"beautiful\\". <br />12. Outside- 5/5: Deep Deep lyrics, kinda like Looking In. Great release at the end of the song, and great song to end the album.
B0000797IO|5.0|This movie WAS funny- if you like subtle, dark humor.  Most people don't recognize character play unless it hits them over the head.  It does not have a perfect happy closed-up-tight ending.  Does it really need to, to be good?  This movie takes a sharp, hard look at the lives of many people you know.  If you need prat falls, animals getting hurt,  and big explosions to make you laugh, this movie is not for you.  But if you find hilarity at the corner drugstore like I do- you'll enjoy this quite  a bit.
0060278250|5.0|Ok, my friend introduced Sabriel to me and i was instantly hooked, absorbed in the world of Sabriel, Lirael, and Prince Sameth. People i am writing this review not only for this book but for the trilogy.

People, do yourself a favor, every single one of my friends think it is the best series also!, BUY THEM NOW!!!!!!!!
1592400876|4.0|If you are one a stickler for grammar and good punctuation - someone who can't stand to see \\"it's\\" when it should be \\"its\\" or \\"you're\\" when it should be \\"your\\" - this books is for you.  I loved the funny stories and the examples of writing where changes in punctuation changed the meaning of a sentence or paragraph.   <br /> <br />If you're just looking for a book that will navigate you through proper punctuation and grammar, you should probably look for more of a reference book.  This book is for those who love grammar already, have a good understanding of its proper usage, and simply want to find a book where they can say, \\"Yes, this drives me crazy too!  Why can't more people use proper grammar!\\"

B00004XQP4|5.0|I think this is the best cd green day has made.  It is there most under-rated and most experimental cd.  This is the cd where they started using acoustic songs and actually sound good.  American Idiot is an average cd but its not my favorite.  I do feel that Green Day has grown up but they still know how to rock.  I was a bit skeptical when this cd first came out but as time went on it grew on me.  My other favorite GD CD is Insomniac, and then Dookie.  The only one I really don't like out of there cds is Nimrod, but thats just me I guess.  If your just a casual GD fan I'd just buy Dookie and International Superhits!  I've been a fan of Green Day since I was 8 and I am now 19 and I have seen them 3 times in concert once on there Warning tour and twice on there american idiot tour.  I normally don't listen to punk or emo but  Green Day is one of those bands that have something called talent...
B0004Z33G4|1.0|Hardly \\"ultimate\\"! Despite a couple nice features (unused footage and alternate endings plus a commentary by Stallone for FIRST BLOOD) the  \\"extras\\" in this set are mostly a farce. The so-called META features are gimmicks that turn the movies into poor video games and make the films unwatchable. The previous Rambo Trilogy Special Edition (out-of-print but available used) had tons of worthwhile extras this set doesn't include. In short, this set is an ultimate waste of money.

B00004U8H4|5.0|The more I think about Bret Easton Ellis's novel \\"American Psycho,\\" the more I consider it a member of the exclusive \\"Great American Novel\\" club. Perhaps I'm being premature in arguing that this graphic novel about a rich but soulless young man in the throes of materialistic excess ranks alongside such monumental novels as Sinclair Lewis's \\"Main Street\\" or Theodore Dreiser's \\"An American Tragedy,\\" but that's exactly what I am saying. I predict that the coming decades will see Ellis's novel elevated to the pantheon of great American literature, a novel so indicative of its time and place that future generations will read it in order to gain insight into certain segments of our culture. Like other great novels about the American experience, \\"American Psycho\\" doesn't cover all the bases--America is too diverse for a single author to capture its total essence in a single novel. But what it does touch upon strikes at a central tenet of our society, namely our greed for things and our inability to strike a balance between laissez-faire capitalism and regulated market systems. We learned in the 1980s that \\"Greed is good.\\" Ellis's novel shows us how that greed taken to its farthest extension is anything but good.<br /><br />Predictably, someone made a film based on the book--a director named Mary Harron to be exact--starring Christian Bale as the titular psycho Patrick Bateman. Pat seems to have everything the American dream promises: good looks, money, a good lineage, an ivy league education, beautiful women, nice digs, all the accoutrements that come with being a member of the American social elite. He is also, according to his own observations, a raving lunatic prone to outbursts of horrific violence. The smallest incidents cause our anti-hero to embark on epic excursions of bloody mayhem, from a colleague producing a better business card than the ones Patrick carries to a homeless man on the street who has the temerity to ask for money. He has a propensity to blurt out the most outrageous statements to his equally slick pals and numerous girlfriends, statements about heads on sticks and how he works in \\"murders and executions,\\" but no one seems to notice or care that much. Even more amazing, no one seems to notice Patrick Bateman lapsing into murderous insanity. But why would they? He's one of them, one of the cream of the crop, and is certainly not the sort of scoundrel who would murder and maim harridans, business associates, or anyone else who happens to cross his path.<br /><br />In fact, we can never be entirely sure the murders and tortures are reality or just figments of Bateman's fragmented and vacuous personality. More likely these egregious acts, acts which include chasing a woman around an apartment building with a chainsaw or burying an axe in the noggin of an associate named Paul Allen (Jared Leto), represent attempts to feel something beyond the mere superficiality provided by material goods. Then again, maybe not. A cop named Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) does turn up at Bateman's office from time to time to inquire about the whereabouts of the aforementioned Allen. It's to the film's credit that we can never quite say for sure if Bateman is responsible for all of these atrocities, but that is also the conclusion we reach with the book. What we know for certain is how useless this guy's life really is. All he does is show up for work so he can goof off, listen to music, try and obtain reservations at the latest hip restaurants, and exercise. He's really nothing and he knows it. Watching these yuppies preen and prance through expensive set pieces evokes an equally useless class of do-nothings, i.e. the European nobility of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Come to think of it, some of those barons, dukes, and earls engaged in mass murder as well.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the film version of \\"American Psycho\\" isn't really a major problem at all. In order to get a rating that would allow theatersto show the picture, Harron had to tone down the gore considerably. The book is loaded with stomach churning descriptions of Bateman's atrocities that only get worse as his insanity increases. Even an unrated version of the film couldn't begin to bring to the screen many of these nightmares, but that's o.k. What we do get is highly disturbing thanks largely to the marvelous skills of actor Christian Bale in the lead role. In a film loaded with talent--including Chloe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, Josh Lucas, and Willem Dafoe--Bale easily holds his own and then some as the savage psychotic. His voiceovers describing his inner sensations send chills down the spine yet he's equally at ease with the book's black humor. It's amazing there are times you won't know whether you should laugh or shriek in terror at Bateman's latest escapade. If you haven't read the book, which I recommend before watching the film, you might need to view the picture several times to absorb the bleak social commentary.<br /><br />Extras on the disc include production notes, cast biographies, a trailer, an interview with Bale, and a making of featurette. I'll leave you with a typical Bateman statement: \\"There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.\\" Enough said, eh?aters to show the picture, Harron had to tone down the gore considerably.

1400032717|4.0|As the other amazon.com reviewers have glowingly commented, 'The Curious Incident...' is really a unique reading experience.  Any book which is written in the first person, narrated by a teenager, a teenager with autism no less, has to be considered special.  Fortunately the author treats this young man and his long-suffering parents with dignity.  It never degrades to a tear-jerker, nor does the author resort to sterotypes. <br /> <br />As for the story, well ... the title says it all.  It is simply about a very bizarre incident in the life of this autistic young man and how he responds to it.  It's equally humorous, sad and touching. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line: the sort of book you'd loan to your friends.
B000000OUJ|5.0|this is the best Wu tang solo effort next to Raekwon's \\"Only built for cuban Linx\\", the beats are tight and the lyrics are sharp. It starts with Liquid Swords which has the usual Wu tang samples at the start which is good, anywayz the track is tight and one of da best. \\"Duel of The Iron Mic\\" is great. Living in the world today is tight. \\"Gold\\" is a hard hittin track yknow with Method man. \\"Cold world\\" is tight with Inspecta deck. Labels is dope. 4th chamber features Ghostface, Killah Priest, and RZA it is dope. \\"Shadowboxin\\" is dope and features Method Man. I dont think Hells wind staff is on the CD i have so I cant rate that. Killa Hills 10304 is tight. Investigative reports is dope. Swordsman is next and is tight. I gotcha back is probably my fav. BIBLE is great and features KillaH priest and i think it is on Priest's album.<br /><br />Overall 10/10<br /><br />and thatsall I have to say about that
B00006L7XQ|5.0|As you can see by my name, I consider myslef to be a fan of metal and death metal or any metal at that, and i am not a fan of this particular genre of music but i must say this is one of the greatest albums i've had the pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />Johnny Cash is an amazing musician and i respect him and all his works. I read that when Trent Reznor heard Johnny Cash playing Hurt, Reznor cried. What does that say, this album is a masterpiece and anyone who listens to any genre of music should pick this up, you may just find it irresistable.<br /><br />This is a good change in music for me, Im used to listening to bands such as cannibal corpse or slayer. But every now and then ill put in Cash and listen to The Man Comes Around, he does an excellent spin on the covers, well done.<br /><br />Johnny Cash, R.I.P
B00006LI4S|5.0|All I have to say about this DVD is that any true floyd fan must have it. I was on the fence about purchasing it after reading many of the \\"negative\\" reviews posted here. Being a long time Floyd fan, however, influenced my desicion and am glad it did. Yes Dave is older, heavier, his voice is a bit weaker, but that is part of the beauty of this dvd. It shows us again how this generation of musicians can still outplay and outclass any of the \\"rock\\" that has come around for the last 10-15 years. Every song has merit, feeling, and expression. The arrangements are great, the video quality is excellent, the sound is 1st rate. If you are a Floyd fan, what is not to like? I did chuckle a bit at Bob Geldof needing a lyrics sheet for Comfortably Numb- A little ironic i thought. His tributes to Syd Barret were well done, and the DVD extras were all enjoyable. Overall, the feeling of this DVD was that Dave was truly enjoying himself, as was the band, and this was a show I wish I could have seen.  Having seen Dave with Floyd, and his About Faces solo tour, this performance is unique in its delivery. It had less theatre and spectacle than any Floyd show, but more intimacy and personal touch than his solo tour.It was great to see Rick Wright team up with Dave again,and Last but not least, this DVD has perhaps some of the last live footage of the wonderful Michael Kamen, who left us all to soon, and is a loss to the heritage of Pink Floyd. If you are a Pink FLoyd fan, and are are debating the purchase of this DVD like I was; have faith, send in your money, and enjoy.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|Tries to be artsy and funny. Is neither. If you see this movie you'll waste 89 minutes of your life (it seemed like 5 hours). There are so many better movies to see. Would give it 0 stars if I could. <br /> <br />Worst. Movie. Ever.
6301969294|5.0|First let me get to the REAL reason I watched this film over and over again. PATRICIA NEAL IS SO BEAUTIFUL I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF HER. That being said, this is an unforgettable film that may even change your life. Raymond Massey gives a great performance in his usual \\"King Cutler\\" manner as Gail Wynand the publisher who rose from Hell's Kitchen to become a \\"man of the people\\". The characters are unrealistic but interesting. Especially Toohey as the villain. The musical score DOMINATES the film. In fact, you will remember the score better than the story. Gary Cooper gives a stiff performance but in consideration that the character is considered odd, his work fits the film. Now everyone knows that it is based on the Philosophy of Ayn Rand and the cult of individualism over collective control. In reflecting those values we get some real and unreal scenes. I can't for the life of me see why there would be protests and riots because \\"The Banner\\" defends Roark or over the building of \\"The Enright House\\". What is realistic are insidious and evil individuals trying to sway the public through their own propaganda to agree with them in prosecuting others (in this case Roark, the symbol of ultimate individualism). Rand was a big fan of the legal system as a vindication of truth and uses the vehicle as she did in  \\"Penthouse Legend\\" again to give this picture a dramatic climax. What was not worthwhile was how she handled the Wynand character, committing suicide because he did not stand up for his principles all the way. You end up feeling sorry for Wynand and the seeming inability to restore the friendship that he has with Roark. When this picture is shown on television, it is CUT to shreds. So much so that one night the first scene was when Dominique Francon is shown throwing the statue of the god out the window!(almost 20 minutes into the picture!) Now of couse we desire an uncut DVD. Polished and full of extras about Ayn Rand. Please, as soon as possible, give us whatwe want or you may see rioting and protests at the local DVD distributor-signed Ellsworth M. Toohey.
B0001M0A4I|1.0|Seven is a complete disappointment to me.  I am one of Tony's hugest fans, I own every conceivable studio album that Tony has been a part of.... I know that he is capable of spine-chilling chord changes and time signatures.... but I must say... Tony, where are you on this album??  I can't hear you anywhere!  Maybe I am not listening hard enough, but should it be so difficult? <br /> <br />If you want to hear some decent classical music, pseudo-composed by Mr. Banks, then might I suggest The Wicked Lady soundtrack, which is a hundred times better than Seven.  I must admit, there are moments, very brief moments, on Seven where Tony shows his true colors, but they are few and far between.  If you are looking for an album to put you to sleep at night, then Seven might be perfect for you.  But if you want to hear anything exciting by this artist, then I would certainly not put this album on the list... not even at the bottom of the list. <br /> <br />Sorry, Tony... I still have the utmost respect for you, and I know there's some good music left in you... but I just wasn't hearing it on Seven.  That is all.  Believe it or not, I consider myself an optimist, and I still very much look forward to Tony's next album.  (There is going to be a next album... isn't there, Tony?  Please?)
B000005DQR|5.0|I don't know. Buy it yourself and try to explain it to me. <br /> <br />I really cannot put how amazing this CD is in words. If you're a DJ, or just a human being with fully functioning ears, you absolutley NEED this CD. Its so good, at its current price, its an act of theft. The beats flow perfectly into one another, like a stream of water. Nature herself could not do better. The beats change completley over the course of the CD, and 3 times over the course of  one song, even (Stem/Long Stem) and each and every time, it'll be just as startlingly amazing as before.  <br /> <br />Just buy it. I command you.
B000000OF6|5.0|This compilation is one of my prized cd sets and to have \\"Who wants to live forever\\" and \\"The show must go on\\" at my disposal is priceless.

6304508611|4.0|Carrie is a film that is considered one of the great classics in the horror genre. Originally a novel written by Stephen King, this movie gives you the opportunity to second-guess letting your daughter go to the prom. <br /> <br />Carrie White (Spacek) is a homely teenage girl who has trouble making friends, partly because her mother (Laurie) is the town bible-thumper.  The extremely graphic shower scene, in which Carrie actually starts her female cycle, is nothing less than outstanding, as far as horror is concerned.  Since her mother believes that Carrie starting her period is something evil, this brings about the first chastisement we see between Mother White and Carrie.   <br /> <br />Sue Snell (Irving) portrays a teenage peer who, in the shower scene, begins teasing Carrie.  Later in the movie, she sees the error of her ways and becomes a friend to Carrie, who spares her life in the end. <br />  <br />Carrie's telekinetic powers produce many surprises throughout the course of the movie.  Mother White's crucifixion is unbelievably well deserved, in my opinion.  Many scenes in this movie are unforgettable and brilliant.  Breasts are \\"dirty pillows\\" and let us not forget the ever-popular prom scene. <br /> <br />I was afraid to go to sleep afterward and found myself watching silly children's cartoons to keep the visions of blood spattering and murder out of my dreams. <br />
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Plain and simple this movie just not worth much money, I paid 2 bucks to see it and i said ok... that was ok. But thats it! there was little (if there even was one) plot and the jokes were pretty bland except for 1 or 2 that stood out. Basically if your looking for a good consistent laugh then look else where, if you can view this for free or for really cheap go ahead and watch this. You won't be disappointed (much) but you won't be blown away.        O and by the way if you claim this is the best movie you've ever seen then you clearly have not seen many movies, or maybe you just lack taste but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This movie was a great one, personally I think that this is one of the best football movies out there. Not a real famous cast which to me can make a movie all that much better.I went into this movie with no expectations and came out with an allstar movie
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I love this show and cast recording...the talent is absolutely amazing, the songs are enjoyable, and the plot is good. However, if you don't really appreciate musicals, I doubt you're going to enjoy this. When showing this to friends who don't like Broadway, their reaction is, \\"Well, the singing's good...\\" But, of course, those who do enjoy Broadway musicals love it...I know I listen to it endlessly. There are a few boring numbers (as with most musicals), but the songs such as Defying Gravity, Popular, and For Good truly make up for it. Reccomended for those who appreciate musicals!
B000002UAO|5.0|This is the Beatles in their folk rock phase and their first complete album ie not just a collection of singles but a true work of art. The Beatles were under the influence while making this album and it shows as it has a distinct hazy aura about it perfectly captured by the slightly off kilter cover photo(my favorite Beatles cover with Abbey Road)The songs themselves are almost uniformly beautiful but the best are Johns sublime In My Life & the wonderful Norwegian Wood,these two alone are worth the price.But you also get Harrisons Byrd-esque guitar classics Think For Yourself & If I Needed Someone,Nowhere Man and the pre-psychadelic The Word.A folk rock/pop classic from beginning to end and one of the most beautiful albums ever made. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I was around when the Beatles started it all. I got the Sabbath debut when it came out & have been a Metal fan since. I'm 48 & my 5 & 6 yr old kids love this CD too. One of the few CDs of mine I can share with them beginning to end. Having listened to alot of music thru the years, I can say this is one of, if not the the best albums of all time. Nuff said!

While the grudge scene was at full swing, this record slipped through the cracks of the music scene and entered only into the minds of those who sought for music beyond what was being handed to them by MTV. Blues for the Red Sun is a testament to one of the most underappreciated bands on Earth. The power and feeling of the opening song captures perfectly the sentiment of the whole album: Loud crunching guitars, soothing arrangements, blistering bass and powerful vocals. It was like nothing ever done before, or, dare I say, since.  <br /> <br />Black Sabbath influences are evident, but to write them off as ripoffs is a gross understatement. Kyuss's second album is a great record because it pulls you in and never lets you go. Even the short instrumentals are worthy of a listen. This is also a great introductory stoner rock album, although that title is misleading. The stoner title refers to just how much this album sucks you in and leaves your senses altered, just like a drug.  <br /> <br />Seriously, Blues for the Red Sun is great because it has great songs paced evenly throughout the album. Check out the cuts, \\"Thumb\\", \\"50 Million Year Trip\\", \\"Allen's Wrench\\" and \\"Freedom Run\\". Afterwards you may question whether you go back to listening to what you were before. By far, one of the best albums of the 90's.
B000056VPD|1.0|George Benson is a superb musician, but this live production from 2000 looks like it was produced by total amateurs. The audience are fully lit, the orchestra don't understand or feel the music,  there is NO atmosphere, in fact it looks like it was shot in a large school hall! Halfway through, middle-aged women get up and start \\"dancing\\" as if they were at a 70's school reunion. I don't normally bother writing reviews but really want to spare other George Benson fans the let down that this disc caused. Buy some back catalogue Benson CDs instead (if you are missing any that is!).
0671027344|5.0|The novel itself is a mystery. It's a collection of letters from a kid who calls himself Charlie. You never know who the letters are being sent to, but they describe (in shocking detail) his life and how he lives. An amazing book! READ READ READ!
0156027321|5.0|Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, is a brutal, dramatic tale. It perplexes, confronting the reader with realism and fantasy in the same thoughts. It's the kind of story that makes you wonder if it could possibly have really happened. If so, what really happened? I'm left with a mystery, but not a frustrating one, it's magical in a sense. I savor it like the taste of a fine meal I've just finished. I linger over it and reminisce. <br /> <br />Martel leaves the reader with questions, the kind we ask about God and mortality. He incorporates many processes of thought that are slower to digest than the story itself. Survival, instinct, terror, fearlessness, and human guile all come into play in Life of Pi along with revulsion, playfulness, hopelessness, and faith. I almost put \\"faith\\" in capital letters here, because this is the story of a boy with so much faith he practices three religions-three great, complex religions-when one religion is often too much for an ordinary person.  <br /> <br />Peace-loving vegetarian Piscine Molitor Patel, named after a Parisian swimming pool, with an irrational number as a nickname, leaves his boyhood home in Pondicherry, India, at sixteen and comes up against the need to stay alive under horrific conditions. <br /> <br />His story begins slowly, making you wonder where it's headed. But you need that time to get to know Pi and rest up for what's to come. Suddenly he's shipwrecked, castaway on a lifeboat, with an unlikely group of survivors. He's forced to make decisions he would never otherwise face. He has no choice. Survival is an ugly, brutal process. Survival is messy. It smells bad. Yet even at its ugliest this tale rings with beauty and a kind of grandeur. Splashes of color and surprise elevate our vantage point. I wish I could tell you more. I'm tempted to give things away, just to be able to share my feelings about various bits and pieces of this novel, but I don't want to spoil the outcome or the journey for anyone, and Pi is the natural narrator of these events. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say this story has changed my perspective, tilted my world ever so slightly. I will never look at my pets or zoo and circus animals the same way-or another person, for that matter-another tree. Everything in the world dissolves and is reconstituted by this story into something new, with mysterious depths of shadow and light.
B000002UR7|1.0|Before The Bends- before OK Computer- before Kid A and Amnesiac, there was this. Pablo Honey. I look at reviews for this album and quite frankly, they piss me off. There is really nothing noteworthy on this album. At all. From Creep's boring rythms and Thom whinging painfully cliche'd lyrics over the top to Anyone Can Play Guitar's uhmm...well, the same thing, really- It all just adds up to one painfully cheesy album that really makes you question how on earth Radiohead managed to keep their indie cred. <br /> <br />Now, don't get me wrong- I'm actually a huge Radiohead fan. But really, before OK Computer their work was just very unconvincing and lacked the attention to detail and artistic beauty that were the power behind albums like Kid A and OK Computer. <br /> <br />If you're into emo, and gritty cliche' as hell brit-pop, then by all means get the album, but don't say I didn't warn you.
0553802534|5.0|There a a lot of opinions about this book.  However, it's a fast paced, twist and turn book.   I wont spoil it, you'll have to read the entire book, to the last paragraph to be sure.  What I can tell you for sure is, only start to read this book when you have the time, not to put it down.  Enjoy.
0596007124|5.0|I've read a few books on design patterns, and it's always been a lesson in patience and endurance.  They generally aren't fun to read and are a struggle to learn from.  Knowing the power of the Head First approach to technology books, I looked forward to reading Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Freeman (with Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates).  As usual, an outstanding job on a usually hard subject.<br /><br />Chapter list: Welcome to Design Patterns; Keeping your Objects in the Know; Decorating Objects; Baking with OO Goodness; One of a Kind Objects; Encapsulating Invocation; Being Adaptive; Encapsulating Algorithms; Well-Managed Collections; The State of Things; Controlling Object Access; Patterns of Patterns; Patterns in the Real World; Leftover Patterns; Index<br /><br />If you've never seen a Head First book (where have you been???), you're in for a treat.  Sierra and Bates have created a concept styled around active learning.  With a combination of pictures, crazy dialog and examples, text all over the place, and ducks (yes, the kind that go quack), Eric and Elisabeth Freeman approach design patterns in a way you've never seen (but that remain true to the Gang Of Four classic).  Each of the main chapters take a specific pattern, set up a fictional scenario, and explore how that pattern can be applied to the problem at hand.  Along the way, you learn the standard pattern usage, when and when not to use it, along with coding examples that show it being done.  The graphics and sketches cement the concepts in a way that straight code or endless paragraphs of text just can't accomplish.  When you get done, you understand the pattern almost without having made an effort to do so.  That's the unique value of the Head First concept...  All the senses are engaged (most with humor), and as a result the mind doesn't have a chance to wander off and think about what's for dinner...<br /><br />As I continue to work on learning this stuff, HFDP will be close at hand.  And I'll be able to refute the common adage \\"old dogs can't learn new tricks\\".  With Head First Design Patterns, not only can they learn new tricks, they can actually apply them!  Great book...e close at hand.  And I'll be able to refute the common adage \\"old dogs can't learn new tricks\\".  With Head First Design Patterns, not only can they learn new tricks, they can actually apply them!  Great book...
1400034779|5.0|Many of us in the United States know very little about Africa.  This book, the first in a multi-volume series by Smith, provides an insightful, thoughtful, and sensitive look at Botswana, its people and its lifestyle. <br /> <br />This book is fun and informative, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wishes to enjoy a few hours a pleasant leisure.  I just wish that there were similar books on Eastern Africa and Western Africa that provided the same enjoyment and insight into the wonderful continent of Africa.
6305428522|5.0|I'm very thankful to have had the opportunity to again see  <br />\\"Quiz Show\\" on 2/5/05 and re-experience the emotions I felt so many years ago when the scandal erupted. I was in my 20s, very busy raising a family and naive about the television industry. I remember having my jaw drop open like a codfish as the story unfolded in all its ugliness. What a great job Robert Redford did in capturing the drama surrounding the episode and the tragedy of ruined lives portrayed in this outstanding film; it truly deserves to be categorized as \\"great\\". While no one was punished by the judicial system, Herb and Charles' lives were ash heaps when it was over. Yes, it's a morality tale, and isn't the purpose of telling morality tales to change our evil ways?  <br /> <br />Guess what? It changed my viewing habits forever. No more quiz shows for me from that period to today's revolting \\"reality\\" garbage dished up throughout the week. Television can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on choices. That was true back in the 50s and it's true in 2005. Is this a film worth seeing? Oh, yes, and more than once. Superb performances. What a great joy to again see the great Paul Scofield in another masterful portrayal of a real-life character and a triumph for Robert Redford. I'm hoping for a DVD version with interviews with Robert Redford and any of the real-life people portrayed in the film who are still with us to tell us how their choices affected their lives when the scandal faded with time.
B000002KB8|5.0|Pure unadulterated maleviolence. This is what you get from early Black Sabbath. The inventors of not only heavy metal but also of grunge, black, and death metal specifically, Sabbath released their debut on Feburary 13, (that would be on a Friday by the way)1970. Ozzy does not really sing but croak like the evil old witch featured on the classic cover but that's part of the (black) magic! The title track says it all and has to be the scariest song in the history of popular music. What many of the religious right wacko's didn't get was the song's warning of messing with the dark path and the hero's despair and terror at the knowledge of his coming doom. Iommi and Butler would continue to horrify rock fans in the generations to come with similar satanic riffs and sinister lyrics but \\"BS\\" was pretty hard to top. Other classic songs include \\"The Wizard\\", who ironically was a white wizard protecting people from evil, \\"NIB\\" which legend has it was a band nickname for Bill Ward and not nativity in black as logic would dictate being that this metal masterpiece is about the devil falling in love. What may surprise the novice listener to this record is the heavy jazz influences along with the more typical blues that permeate throughout. \\"Wicked World\\" and \\"Behind the Wall of Sleep\\" are two of my personal favorites but you cannot go wrong with any of the aforementioned ditties. Some of the reissues, including mine include Sabbath's first single release, \\"Evil Woman\\" and while also being a cover it seems entirely out of place here and is easily the only turkey on this mesmerising debut. This is where it all began folks, why a \\"real\\" Sabbath fan wouldn't recommend this album is inexplicable to me. If you're gonna buy 'Paranoid' you need to buy this one too. Again, I'm sick and tired of these immature idiots who pan music that came out before 1995. Son, your ignorance is frightening. Sabbath deserves their status and your respect and 'Black Sabbath' was THE album that started itall.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|One of the reasons I love PMG is their seeming refusal to make the same musical statement twice. Going back four albums, \\"Speaking of Now\\" was very different musically, to \\"Imaginary Day\\", as were \\"Quartet\\" and \\"We Live Here\\" before them. Well, with \\"The Way Up\\", they've done it again and in my view this is an even more radical departure. But it's musical heaven. Though the CD is divided into four parts, the best way to enjoy this is to imagine it as Pat intended - as one seamless piece of music. Gone are the predictable (albeit intricate) melodies with the break and then the awesome solos. On this CD the entire piece comes across as one long improvisation. There are solos to be had - and each memeber of the group performs them with the usual mastery but they don't appear where you would expect them to and before you know it, they're gone. It's exquisite! Over the 68:10 mins, we are taken hither and yon, up to crescendoing highs and beautiful lows. We are treated to what seems like hundreds of mini tapestries of brilliance but every now and then, the main theme returns just to remind us that we are listening to one piece of music here.<br /><br />I'm yet to tire of any of my PMG CDs but this is one that I'll be playing repeatedly for years to come. Other jazz groups will do well to take note: PMG have indeed shown the way up!
B00005JKN9|4.0|New York is renowned for being a tough town.  Only, in the mid-19th century it was more reminiscent of hell on earth.  In the midst of it all, natives and non-natives (mostly Irish) fought for their land, culture, and their home of Five Points. <br /> <br />Scorsese, renovating the modern epic film, chooses New York as the backdrop, and the life of the gangs as his story.  This is all well intentioned, and as you might see, the film was pretty good.  However, this movie was limited by context, and in the sad story of it all. <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio (as an Irish immigrant) and Daniel Day Lewis (as an already victorious kingpin) played the two main antitheses.  Both did extremely well, and Leonardo was successful yet again in breaching out to a new and exciting character: the underdog immigrant. <br /> <br />Now, New York history has never been my interest, and although this movie sparked that in many others, and me there seemed to be an incredible lack of reason for this film's existence.  Now, I realize that this would never be an issue for an awful film, because there would be just a short brutal critique.  So maybe extra scrutiny is not justified, but Scorsese just never seemed to bring home the plot, the moral, or the point of this film. <br /> <br />If anything it is brutal is as brutal does.  For the townspeople's lives (for they were that more then gang members) were built in blood, and although their farce of a society seems peaceful, one of the two leaders, or both, will have to do die in blood.   <br /> <br />Summarily, this is a nice timepiece for New York history.  Drawn out like a History Channel film, yet vivid and piercing as an action film.  A gory immigrants tale if there every was one.
0767811070|4.0|The real south central Los Angeles is made up of mostly blacks and Latinos. The percentage is actually in favor of Latinos, something like 55 percent of Latinos in south central, yet for the people that do not know this, that watch the movie, they might think that a ghetto like south central is completely African-American when in fact it is also a barrio and the Latin community is as much a part of the south Los Angeles hood as the black community. The only Latinos that are shown in that hood are the four girls that are walkling home from school. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Singleton shows his brilliance in this movie.
0385510454|5.0|It is amazing that the best selling author John Grisham has set his new thriller in Italy. Dan Brown proved that an American author can set a book in Europe and still be successful.    Grisham's new thriller starts in Washington D.C. where power and corruption run rampant. The CIA convinces the outgoing and incompetent President Morgan to give an eleventh hour pardon to Joel Backman--a Washington power broker prior to his imprisonment. Backman had served six years of a twenty year sentence for trying to sell secrets about a sophisticated satellite surveillance system to the highest bidder. The CIA wants to put Backman in a witness protection program outside the U.S. Once he is safely established, they will then divulge his whereabouts to the secret services of Israel, Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia to see which nation executes him first.    The CIA has chosen northern Italy for Backman's new home. Even though he is a free man, they first locate him in Treviso with his assigned handler, Luigi. Since he has no money or passport, he is totally reliant. The plan is to transform him into an Italian, Marco Lazzeri. To do that they provide him a stylish Italian wardrobe and start intensive Italian lessons. Any American traveling in Italy, realizes how impossible it is to appear to be an Italian.    After four intensive days in Treviso, the CIA whisks him off to Bologna on the premise that someone is already trying to kill him. Most of the book is about Marco's amazing experiences in Bologna--his relationship with Luigi and his language instructors, the excellent food and wines, and his eventual familiarization and love for the marvelous and non-touristy city of Bologna. Even though he is under surveillance, he manages to escape it occasionally for private moments in his adopted city. The reader can't help but love this transformed Marco Lazzeria, a.k.a Joel Backman. You will find yourself cheering for his eventual survival and freedom.    BRAVO for Grisham who has obviously fallen in love with Italy, in general and Bologna, in particular. Let's hope this will lead to more of his novels set in Italy.
0670033375|5.0|Many, if not all, past civilizations have collapsed and we know many of the factors that caused these collapses. One factor, environmental destruction, is always a leading cause. We are destroying the enviroment faster than most people are aware of and than most people can even imagine. God bless, the Native American peoples who believed in living in harmony with their environment.<br /><br />This book is thought-provoking and easy to read. The author, Jared Diamond, went back in time and studied many civilizations where they collapsed based upon their inability to recognize limited resources or ecological fluctuations. The author's research for this book is detailed and his position is that we should pay more attention to history. History, if we listen, can teach us almost everything that we need to know.

From what I have experienced in my past relationships this book was dead on. Men are like rubberbands stretching and needing space, which if you give it to them they will spring back to you and women are like waves that go in a series of highs and lows. However, I felt that at times the author was repeating himself over and over to make the book thicker. What could have been said in a page he would say in a chapter. However, this is a must read for anyone interested in why the opposite sex behaves the way they do. It truly makes you understand them more and it helps you put yourself in their position.

0609610570|4.0|Everybody knows about companies with brilliant strategies that don't deliver.  They don't execute.  The fact is that the greatest strategy in the world is useless if the company or other organization can't make it work.  Strategy without execution is impotent.<br /><br />So, this is a book about execution.  Well, not exactly.  Actually, it's a book about the structural processes that lead to executing strategy effectively.  The three processes, as identified by the authors, are the people process, the strategy process, and the operations process.<br /><br />They're all important and you have to get them all to work and to work together.  The authors should know how to do this.  Larry Bossidy is one of the world's most successful and effective executives.  He was effective at General Electric, at Allied Signal, and at Honeywell.  Ram Charan is a consultant who has worked with lots of companies for a number of years and been successful there.<br /><br />Not only do they know what they're talking about,  they convey their knowledge well.  The organization of the book helps them get the message across.  The contents are divided into three parts:  Why Execution is Needed; The Building Blocks of Execution; and the Three Core Processes of Execution.  Each of those sections includes chapters which are well laid out and thoughtfully developed.<br /><br />Also, throughout the book, the two authors, Bossidy and Charan, put in short pieces in the first person.  I found these particularly helpful, because they gave me insight into the basic text, and they also gave me the flavor and style of the way these men think.<br /><br />A big plus for the book - and something that makes it easy reading - is the selection of Charles Burke as writer and editor.  Burke was an excellent editor and writer when he was at Fortune, and he brings those skills to the book.<br /><br />If this book has a weakness, it's the way examples are presented.  Since both Bossidy and Charan don't necessarily want to name names, we get a lot of descriptions of people without knowing exactly who they are.  That means that you have to put up with a lot of  \\"X's\\" and \\"Y's\\" and descriptions of people as, \\"A marketing executive for a mid-size chemical company.\\"<br /><br />Personally, I found that very irritating, but not irritating enough to get me to stop reading.

0767903862|5.0|My wife and I just got back from our honeymoon in Australia and we had this book recommended to us.  I'm reading it aloud to her and I can tell that we're going to like this book when the author, in the acknowledgments, says that he would like to thank the entire country of Australia because they're all just so wonderfully nice and helpful.  That resonated so very true to our experience that we've been hooked on the book ever since.  Now that we're in a few chapters, it's easy to make comparisons between Bryson's writing style and that of the late Douglas Adams in Last Chance to See (esp. the \\"Here Be Chickens\\" chapter) -- his persistently chipper and witty writing in the face of more venom and teeth than most of the world has seen makes this a highly entertaining read.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is the best film I'm ever seen. It is more than a movie, seeing \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is literally a spiritual experience that will not leave you the same. You will be changed one way or the other after seeing what Jesus suffered. The realism of this portrayal captures the historical context of the days Jesus was on earth. Use of the original language adds to the authenticity. Similarly the ethnicity of the actors adds another layer to foundation of capturing history on film.<br /><br />This is an instant classic indeed. Any objective viewer who sees it cannot deny this fact. It is \\"other,\\" i.e., it is in a category of its own. Yes it might be listed as a \\"religious film,\\" but it is so much more. The artists, producer, writers, creators who put this work together had the help of a Power beyond their abilities.
0440418569|2.0|The \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is written like the unsuccessful love-child of the Celestine Prophecy and the Harry Potter books. I just read that the author is an atheist, but that seems odd since the core of this story is New Age hokum. While the Catholic Church is a den of the most horrid iniquity and the Christian God turns out to be a senile Alzheimer's patient (though power-mad and wicked before senility arrived), even the \\"physicist\\" finds honesty and guidance in the I Ching. Witches, angels, herbal remedies, divination, auras... you get the idea. One of the main characters (Lyra), even has a portable wigi board-like device called the altheiometer that she consults throughout the books to find the \\"truth.\\"<br /><br />In this Age of Aquarius, the World of the Dead (literally the underworld) sections are the most painful reading. When Will and Lyra find the solution to the misery of these poor dead souls, it's so silly and uninspired I couldn't imagine what the author was thinking.<br /><br />By the third book, the characters have become cardboard cutouts that can change their essential natures as quickly as the \\"dust\\" wind can blow them. And the ending-oh, the ending! Abandon hope all ye who exit here...<br /><br />I can't say that this trilogy is a complete waste of time. The first two books were mostly fun (although sometimes preachy) and I generally liked both Will and Lyra. By the beginning of the third book, however, I had to start skimming to keep myself awake.<br /><br />Be aware that for \\"young adult\\" fiction, this book is particularly gruesome with graphic torture, murder, dismemberment, and (essentially) cannibalism.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This CD is really good, but i liked iowa and their self-titled album better. Duality is the best song.
B000002KE2|4.0|This album is one of my personal favourites and is unfortunately tends to be overlooked by mainstream radio. This is probably one their heaviest albums with songs that are well crafted and plentiful in powerful guitar riffs. The album contains Supernaut and Snowblind (which was orginally going to be the title of the album as a tribute to the copious amount of cocaine consumed during the recording of the album, but the record company vetoed the idea and the name was changed to Vol.4).  Wheels of Confusion and Under the Sun both great tracks, but there are some low points on the album.  For starters the track 'FX' is not a song.  It's a minute and a half of bizarre sounds like water dripping. So their are really only nine songs on this album.  Second, Changes and Laguna Sunrise are painfully repetitive and the instrumental Laguna Sunrise isn't as well crafted as 'Fluff' (Sabbath Bloody Sabbath) but showcases the band's willingness to experiment. All in all, (with the exception of FX) a great album and a worthwhile addition to any music collection.
B000001ESP|4.0|Before buying any Rush album, or deciding which of their so-called \\"eras\\" might suit you best, I'd say size up your own feelings on rock music and decide if you like youthful energy or mature reflection, \\"Loud\\" guitars or instrumental balance, aggression or atmosphere, esoterica or eclecticism, extension or brevity, narrative or commentary. Some listeners can find room for many styles and moods, others are more, shall we say, exacting. It is my feeling that Rush has done the natural thing of evolving over the years. As everyone who actually HAS grown up a little bit knows, it is absurd to think that Rush should have produced 2112 or Hemispheres twenty more times. If they had tried, they would have died a quick death since a vital requisite for longevity is adapting to changing environments. As for me, I'm finding it rather compelling that the oeuvre of Rush has so much to offer.  I got this one first, about 17 years ago, because I was \\"supposed to.\\" It is, after all, generally considered to be a bonafide classic. A couple of the songs have been heard on rock radio ad nauseum for over 20 years.  Back in those days, when I was just a teenager without any money, I was very hesitant to buy any album unless I was certain that I already liked at least several of the tracks. Now, for those who are sick of Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, YYZ, and Limelight, I would first suggest listening to less \\"dinosaur\\" rock stations which subsist on standardization. These songs are great and don't deserve to be labeled as \\"overdone.\\" Tom Sawyer and Limelight, particularly, are two of the best rock songs ever, both containing many staple Rush elements: fluid treatment of meter, superb musicianship, very cool riffs, lyrics that are well-written and somewhat mystifying (esp. Tom Sawyer, but I love \\"He gets high on you and the energy you trade - He gets right on to the friction of the day\\"), and guitar solos with Mr. Lifeson's signature angularity, pinch harmonics, and double stops.   When I first got the album, I pretty much just listened to these four familiar tunes. It took longer to explore the other three, but some long car rides to and from college took care of that for me, especially The Camera Eye, which is worth it if you have the time. As for the final two, Witch Hunt has its moments and Vital Signs strikes me as a sort of rock bagatelle. I rarely have gone out of my way to listen to them although they both have their fans.  I'm not sure I would recommend this album as a First Buy. The best songs are highly familiar already so why start off a Rush collection (if that's your intent) with something you already know? Try exploring some of the other stuff first, perhaps, and then come back to this when the time is right. If this is to be your only album, however, so be it. It certainly should have a place in any fan-of-rock's collection. It would, however, be a mistake to thing of it as definitive for a band that has been around so long and created such a variety of work.

B00005JMAH|5.0|although the movie does not follow the book exactly, it is incredible film work and a great story. the book goes into more detail at the end, but the movie provides enough information so that a person could understand it without reading the book. it is an awesome movie and a job well done by the director!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead are one of the very few bands who had one of the most difficult tasks in the history of rock music from a critic's perspective: how to follow up a monumental masterpiece. The album they were aiming to top, or at least equal, was \\"OK Computer.\\" That 1997 classic, in the space of three years, had been called everything from ground-breaking and revolutionary, to the Greatest Album Of All Time. I agree with the praise that was piled on top of that album, because it simply is a superb piece of artistic work. More than three years passed before the music press heard anything about a new Radiohead album. When news broke that the follow-up was due for an October 2000 release, the media went into overdrive and the die-hard Radiohead fans prepared themselves for easily the most anticipated album release of the year.<br /><br />All the hype over one album called \\"Kid A.\\" I was (at the age of 13) oblivious to all the fuss, but four years later I am older, wiser and more appreciative of quality music. Radiohead are easily my favourite rock band. Sorry to say, but they run Oasis and Coldplay into the ground for sheer musical genius. Thom Yorke and his fellow band mates frequently make comment about their music, saying they don't know what all the fuss is about, and that they don't appreciate the overwhelming praise they receive every time they release a new album. With Kid A, two things were obvious: fans were going to be disappointed that it didn't live up to OK Computer (it was an impossible task to achieve) and they were also going to hail it as a musical masterpiece in its own right. Why did they do the latter? Because Radiohead, ever the experimentalists, went out on another large limb and dabbled with electronica in rock.<br /><br />It was the new millennium, right? The music scene was changing (or at least Radiohead were changing it) so the band wanted to not only keep up to date, but to stay ahead of the game. Kid A is definitely that, and them some. This was the band's fourth studio album and went straight in at No.1 in both the UK and the US. So how can a band so abstract and removed from commercial desires be so commercially successful and appealing? Maybe it was all hype, but there's something about this album that makes it easily one of the finest rock albums of the past 10 years.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Everything In Its Right Place.\\" A stuttering of strange noises opens this track as Yorke dabbles his vocals in electronica, his tone jittering over the bass, making for quite the unusual intro. The song in itself is a very unusual yet - ultimately - masterful blend of electronica and abstract lyrics, such as \\"Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon.\\" The album's title track, \\"Kid A,\\" is the next song, and definitely one of my favourite songs that Radiohead have ever put together. A lot of people don't like this song, but I was immediately drawn to its intricate and minimal blips and clicks, along with the remarkable attention to detail. The song feels really close and comforting like its cradling you in its arms. Yorke's computerized vocals aren't even fathomable, but that doesn't matter when you have a song like this. The beat that bounces along merrily is also rather catchy which you wouldn't expect from Radiohead. The introduction of the heart-warming synths just after the third minute also make for must-hear listening.<br /><br />\\"The National Anthem\\" is the first real rock song on the album and what a song it is. The bass in this song is one of Radiohead's best ever, because it's so gritty and dark. The intro is rather long as Yorke doesn't sing until 1:36, but once he starts, you really begin to feel a part of this elaborate and freaky song. The distant voices shouting remind of the \\"Speak To Me/Breathe\\" intro from Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon.\\" Halfway through the song, a brass band starts playing! You wouldn't expect it, but then again, you should expect the unexpected with Radiohead. Some say thetrumpets spoil the song - I say it's a welcome introduction. \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" is easily my favourite song from the album. At nearly six minutes long, this epic masterpiece adopts the sweeping grandeur of soundscapes which made OK Computer so successful on songs such as \\"Airbag\\" and \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien.\\" The song is very slow to begin with, as a gentle guitar plays contently to the level of anticipation which is created by a strange sound in the background. It gently dies out around 1:37 as the beautiful soundscapes begin to sweep in. It has two notes and sweeps up then down in such a majestic quality over and over. The song gradually picks up pace as Yorke effortlessly weaves his vocals around the long, mournful aches of electronica. The tension in his voice is beautiful and Heavenly, rising and falling to the beautiful soundscape. It peaks at 5:02 before gently descending to where it started, leaving you feeling complete and entirely fulfilled. Masterpiece.<br /><br />\\"Treefingers\\" is a beautiful instrumental track which not many fans like, as they feel it slows the pace of the album down. I personally love it and think it divides the album up into two separate halves. This is a superb song to chill out to. There's not really any instruments, it's all electronic: close your eyes and imagine drifting through space to this as the soft little bleeps shine in the distant corners of space like stars. \\"Optimistic\\" is a return to true rock form as the band begin to fire up. The song is probably the most accessible on the whole album because it has some catchy hooks and a very enjoyable melody. I love the lyrics, \\"You can try the best you can, you can try the best you can, the best you can is good enough!\\" You won't even notice that the next song has started when it does because it fits in perfectly with its predecessor. It's called \\"In Limbo\\" and it's one of my favourite songs from the album. You can't really hear what Yorke is mumbling in the background, but it doesn't matter because the focus is on the resonating electronic beats and guitar which pound endlessly. A superb song which achieves that feeling of an epic landscape.<br /><br />\\"Idioteque\\" is a song that seems to divide Radiohead fans, but again, I absolutely love it. This song has an almost Trip-Hop/Funk appeal to it with the beat which reminds me of something from Bjork's \\"Homogenic,\\" along with the crunching sounds at around 0:38. The distress in Yorke's voice in this song is really powerful and I find it very moving to experience this song in its entirety. If you put it on repeat you'll become lost in the arrangement. My favourite lyrics include, \\"Ice age coming, ice age coming, throw it in the fire, throw it in the fire!\\" The next song, \\"Morning Bell,\\" is probably my least favourite song from the album although I still really like and enjoy it. The drums on this song are great and the song creates a feeling of paranoia in my opinion. I'm not sure why I feel this every time I listen to it, though. The album closes with \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack,\\" which many regard as the album's finest moment. I disagree, but it's definitely one of the best tracks on offer here. It starts off rather strange and Yorke's vocals seem a little disoriented, but that's all part of the plan for the introduction of the beautiful and bright sounds which spiral like a color wheel of harmony around 1:39. The song is so unusual, but I find it so mezmerising that I can't help but feel such love for it. The song finishes (or does it?!) around 3:16. Yorke wants to create a feeling of silence - is silence music or not? Can you feel content listening to silence? Think about this as you don't hear anything, then the song suddenly plays again for a short while, before finishing.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Just as a little side note, not many people know this, but if you gently take out the black plastic case that holds the CD you'll find a sheet of paper with evenmore artwork on it! Speaking of the album art in general, it's just absolutely beautiful. Flicking through the many pages, you get a sense of the music just by the gorgeous images. Radiohead didn't even equal the genius of OK Computer with Kid A, but I know that wasn't their aim. Sure, they want to make great music, and they do, but they don't feel the pressure to top themselves every time they try. I adored Kid A for my own personal reasons because I had heard about many comparisons to Bjork's 2001 album \\"Vespertine.\\" The lush beauty of that album by Bjork made it one of my favourite albums of all time. She dabbled with electronica boldly like no other because she fused it with classical music. The results were stunning. Radiohead, on the other hand, have blended electronica with rock on Kid A. The results aren't as amazing as Vespertine in my opinion, but the pure beauty and intelligence of this album cannot be denied.

B0006B29Z2|5.0|I really can't add anything to the terrific recap of Ed Baldhead below, so I won't be redundant.  I just want to add to the glowing reviews of this great dvd set.  I anxiously look forward to the next set which should include a remastered Live After Death, and with any luck a remastered Maiden England as well.  The one I really want, however, will be the Dance of Death tour footage.  Unfortunately we're going to have to wait until possibly a third installment. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is a great dvd set with fun concerts and gives you insight into my personal favorite band.  If you're unsure as to whether or not this is a worthy purchase, ponder it no more!  Buy it and enjoy it forever!  Up the irons!!
B00005MAM2|3.0|It's great to see this movie on DVD, it's one of my favorite Anime movies, first I had it on VHS and I found it exciting,also the score of the movies it's exciting. But this DVD special edition is not why I was expecting for: they changed dialogues and sometimes they make the story confusing. Maybe, new scenes included? The image it's clear and the animation good, the only problem are those moments inside of the bubble, when you see images of Tetsuo and his friends, and it's not clear what Akira is and he's the risponsable, of such disaster in 1988. <br /> <br />If you really like Anime this is your movie.
B0007OCG56|4.0|Paz Vega starts a new job as a maid for restaurant owner and dad Adam Sandler (Punch Drunk-Love, The Longest Yard) and his talkative wife Tea Leoni (Deep Impact, The Family Man). Leoni has 2 kids, a son and a daughter and Vega has one daughter who has to translate for her and soon after Vega starts to learn English on her own. Cloris Leachman (History Of The World Part 1, High Anxiety), in a superb supporting role, plays Leoni's crazy mother. A good natured movie such as this is a breathe of fresh air with a beautiful performane by Paz Vega and a excellent role for Adam Sandler who still has the funny guy in him but he show's us again he can do other things. Tea Leoni's charcter is hard to like though Leoni is perfect for the part. The kids are all great. Love your mother and family is the theme for this movie and James L. Brooks (As Good As It Gets, The Simpsons) does it all too well. Thomas Haden Church (Sideways, Rolling Kansas) stars as the man Leoni has the affair
6305076995|5.0|This dvd is amazing. Buy it because it is awesome. Watch one of the greatest prog rock bands play live. It's very oh so cool and awesome. Musically, they are one of the most advanced bands out their and to hear how they sound live....there is no difference. It's flawless.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|This movie dares to shock with its explicit language and demanding performances. Jude Law (Road To Perdition, Cold Mountain) plays Dan, a writer for the obits who crosses paths one day with a lovely redheaded woman named Alice, played by Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge Of The Sith, Garden State). The 2 soon fall for each other and become a couple. Later, Law falls for a photographer woman named Anna, played by Julia Roberts (Confessions Of A Dangerous Minds, Oceans 12) Law writes a book called The Aquarium which sinks. Law plays a joke on Doctor Larry, played by Clive Owen (King Arthur, Second Sight) in which Law and Owen talk to each other in dirty talk in a London Sex Chat Room. Owen meets Roberts at the Aquarium in which Law told him to go to and finds out he was a part of a sick joke. Later, Owen and Roberts get married...Law is still in love with Roberts....Law leaves Portman.....Roberts wants to divorce Owen...Owen falls in love with Portman but he still is in love with Roberts...and you get my point. Nasty...Nasty dialouge in this movie and some nudity but just plain raunchy talk. Law is always good, Roberts is magnificent, Portman plays a role she hasnt done before and she is very, very fantastic...she plays a stripper and Owen delivers in a new role for him as well..he plays a a-hole with gusto...Owen can play anything and still be as good as he is.
B00005JMFQ|3.0|I am usually a fan of the work of Mr Curtis but this film feels like an explotation of a rather tired working theme.<br /><br /> It has elements of all the other films and trys to encapsulate \\"Modern Britain\\" rather cheesily, with Hugh Grant as a Tony Blair style PM. Unfortunately he comes across as more the average bumbling, Biology Teacher and his developing romance with his Cockney Char Lady is just a touch too \\"Eliza Dolittle\\", the Char Lady is played just a little too corsely aswell; the \\"F\\" word is not a comedic tool.<br /><br />  There are some strong perfomances here though, Emma Thompson is truly cracking. The scene when she secretly uncovers her husbands betrayal of her is poignant, painful and exquisitely pitched. Andrew Lincoln, (Fans will remember him as \\"Egg\\" in the brilliant \\"This Life\\" on BBC TV) pining away for the love of his best friends wife is astonishingly engaging in his portrayal of the pain of the unrequited love, it's a shame Kira Knightely lets him down by being so utterly wet and ineffective, no real disply of anything other than cliched, embarassed, twittering, midle class women.<br /><br /> Liam Neesom is of course brilliant and Colin Firth is a classic as the tortured grieving man. There is a lot to like about this film but it just trys too hard to captilise on Curtis's past success and the strengths of it's good actors; it gives the poorer performers more to do than they can handle or convey too.<br /><br /> As a result there is too much going on and the film doesn't really seem to know if it want's to explore a little more serious drama or build up the comedy segments (incidently I think it's time British films stopped assuming that adding a few quiant British expletives is all that is needed to raise the roof in America - it's old news to our America cousins!).<br /><br /> This is a pleasent enough and hopeful film but it's a bit of a mess and ever such a tad cliched.<br /><br /> The romantic view of rainy, cosy, London is very grating in it's \\"Mary Poppins\\" approach too.ppins\\" approach too.

B000002HMH|5.0|This review goes out to all u \\"metallica fans\\", u whining, mullet sporting, black wearing, cheap beer drinking poseurs.  U need to stop this and admit that u secretly LOVE this album.  It's, personally, my favorite one of metallica's.  They learned how to have a groove and, as opposed to the ABISMAL SOUNDING \\"...And Justice for All\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\"(even though I love their first few albums [CLIFF ROCKS] for their substance and playing, they still sound like COMPLETE CRAP.  They even admit to this, THEY HAVE NO BASS!!!  The bass does not exist for the most part), how to record.  James Hetfield learns to stop writing lyrics that accuse other people and systems and starts to point the finger at himself.  Lyrically he grew BIG TIME on this album. <br />   I think the reason all u so-called \\"MEATALLICA FANS\\" hate this album is because it has balls.  \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" just kicks.  I have had that song stuck in my head for the last week, but \\"Hero of the Day\\" can almost bring a tear to my eye (though not quite because I am METAL!!! not Emo), though I like the S&M version better.  They are really a dynamic band and it shows on this album.  I just love this album.  It feels good to listen to. <br />  Just a couple points.  First: stop with the hair thing, ok.  Trust me, I have had long hair for A LONG TIME.  It gets in the way and can, at times, be cheesy.  I don't intend to have it as long as they did.  They had it for over a decade and-a-half.  U get older and get sick of holding on to some poseur version of rebelion that works in your teens and twenties.  Hopefully you'll grow up some day and realize u don't stop maturing at age 17. <br />  Next, u \\"Metallica fans\\" invest too much in other people.  What these guys are doing, or any musicians regardless of style, is art.  They will succeed and fail.  They will make good work and they will make crap.  That is the risk u take in making something.  I believe this album is an UNDER-RATED CLASSIC.  Even if u don't likethis album, I understand, it is a BIG departure from their original work.  But that's just it: they grew.  If u were a true Metallica fan you'd at least respect them for trying something new.  But u won't listen,  So go back to your time-warp. <br />   Load rocks.  Is it as complex? No.  Is it always as fast as their previous works? No. Does it kick ass? Oh God yes.  But that's just my opinion.  This album does not suck.  I can listen to it cover to cover and not wanna change a song.  I would recomend this album to people more than the black album. <br />  On one last note: I do agree with most of those \\"METALLICA FANS\\" who say they should get rid of Bob Rock.  I think St. Anger proves his departure is overdue.  Even though that album has it's good points, it's lacking...a lot.  Still, I respect it.  LOAD RULES, though.  Go buy this classic NOW!!!
B000003TA4|1.0|it sounds like a dieing cat in a cardoor.Jeez there lyrics dont even make sense not even deaf could stand they're appaling, shockingly horrific, ghastly,incompedent,unbareable,screeching sound they call muscic.if you bought any of they'er music even 1 song your a thick headed plank.i hope some day that the people who listened to that sheer crap will some day suround some great music by Rob Zombie,Guns'n'roses,dont forget stabbing west ward,Judas priest,ACDC,iron maiden,velvet relvolver, black sabbath and many more.NIRVANA lovers-dump that crap you call music that has been clouding your head for so long and get life(with good music).
B0007OCG4W|1.0|Oh dear - what has the previously wonderful Julia Roberts got herself into here? Actually, she, together with the trio of ohter main characters, holds her character role well in this sad, depressing tale of unfaithfuless, sex, [...]    It could have been so much richer fare, this movie. The underlying theme of two couples who really are more interested in their opposite numbers, is not original but nevertheless this cast could have done great things with it; attractive, and good actors all of them without a doubt. But the script is unnecessarily filthy, including a long email conversation about masturbation and oral sex, explicit references to all kinds of sexual practice hopelessly out of place in a '15' rated film (UK). Add to that the scenes in the sex club....you get the idea, be warned. What a shame.    So actually my friends and I walked out at that point, so to be fair to this review, we didn't see the climax ( pardon the pun).
B00005JNEI|5.0|How can this war be going on? How can we have re-elected this man (and I use the term loosly)?  <br /> <br />I've heard people say Moore twisted the truth and made up lies, but I saw none of that. I think this film was presented with integrity and plenty of proof to back it up. I'm not one just to take someone's word for it, and neither should you be. Watch this film and then do some checking on your own.
B000AU9UYM|1.0|Wow, can you say \\"boring\\" any louder? I would give this movie 0 stars if i could. I am a Batman fan, but this movie was just ridiculously boring. i mean seriously, it actually starts out with a little boy stealing a small rock from a little girl, and then he falls down a hole. talk about your exciting film openings. ah well, anyways, years later, he is Bruce Wayne, the only white man in an English-language Chinese prison. Bruce is pretty rich back in America, but he had himself sent to a Chinese prison so that he could train himself to beat people up, because he's peaved about his parents getting shot by a lame mugger. Okay. Then, he meets a guy with some sort of unpronounceable name, and this guy wants Bruce to join his group of evil ninjas. So, Bruce is like, \\"Evil ninjas? Where do I sign up?\\" Of course, when the evil ninja training is finished (wich totally sucked) and they want him to kill somebody, Bruce freaks out and burns down the whole place, probably killing quite a few people, very not Batman like since he vowed not to \\"kill\\" anyone(though Michael Keaton's wasn't a complete wimp like bale is here). Okay. Then, he goes home to rejoin the business world and fight crime. Luckily, he meets a guy at his father's company, and this guy makes superhero equipment for a living. Talk about your happy coincidences.  <br /> <br />David Goyer must be stopped. Seriously. I have no idea how anybody could have looked at the script for this ****ing abomination and said, \\"Hey, I want to make that!\\" How many lame-brained action movie clichs can you fit into one film? How much cringe-worthy cheesy dialog can you make your overqualified cast choke out? How much cheesy sentimental BS can you squeeze into a movie about a guy fighting crime in a modified s&m outfit? If you're David Goyer, the possibilities are endless.  <br /> <br />I cannot believe the ratings this film has received. It is a good example of what happened in \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\". Long story short, two conmen convince everyone that they've made luxury clothes for a king when in reality, they have made nothing. According to them, only those worthy enough can see the clothes. Everyone fakes that they can see them, including a very naked king, so that they can feel worthy.  <br /> <br />My God, this fable fits \\"Batman Begins\\" perfectly. It is an overblown, poorly written, stiffly acted, and badly photographed film. The action is completely \\"been there done that\\" and is photographed WAY too up close, like many bad action movies of late. Christian Bale has a monotone voice and has NO EXPRESSION! Not ever. He frankly looks bored most of the time. That really bugged me. And yes, his voice as Batman was just plain embarrassing. It felt like an SNL skit of Batman.  <br /> <br />I truly think that the marketing of this film was solely based on the idea that \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\" sucked. They weren't good, but lets remember, they each made a good amount of money for so films so critically drubbed. But they made money because people were entertained, even if they are too chicken to admit it. But Nolan gets to show us that they were stupid and frivolous movies and that he's going to blow them out of the water by being adult and intelligent. Audiences don't want to feel stupid, they LIKE feeling smart, thus with open arms people have accepted \\"Batman Begins\\" because they are told it is dark and unlike any other. But people truly are making more of \\"Batman Begins\\" than it is.  <br /> <br />It strives so hard to be realistic and profound that it strips the energy and excitement form Batman. People talk in heavy handed riddles and the dialog is leaden and pretentious. And the plot is at times damn confusing. Characters appear and disappear, only to change motivations or create new motivations altogether. Blue flowers and weird organizations come about hoping the audience can fill in an explanation, and some Asian guy...has seemingly no purpose whatsoever, but appears in the film long enough so that one thinks hes there for a reason. Also, the montage of Batman training was very scatter shot. What did they show? Really...I think they just quickly edited a few hundred frames of nothing. The Pre-batman stuff, you know, the \\"Begins\\" part of the film, wasn't very strong at all.  <br /> <br />In the end, I didn't care for anyone, because no one was developed! You can talk about fear all you want, but fear is not a character trait, nor is revenge, and Bruce had seemingly no character beyond this. Maybe its Bale's fault, as he was stiff as a corpse, but Bruce never felt real.  <br /> <br />This is so far a very harsh review, so why would I even give the film a 4/10, when thus far it seems closer to a 2/10 from my perspective? Out of respect to Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkonson. By casting respected, award-winning actors in small parts, some which are truly perfunctory, each man is only given a few moments to strut their stuff. I cherished those moments because even in a bad movie, these guys can act. But really, Gary Oldman in a small role as a humble cop who - basically does nothing?? Come on!  <br /> <br />Overall though, this is a huge letdown. People cite the darkness, and the depth of the characters, but the film is as deep as cardboard. You need not look farther than Bruce's relationship to Katie Holmes' character to see that this film is truly just a shallow hackneyed popcorn movie with a serious identity crisis, and really good marketing. If you want to see a REAL Batman movie that is not boring and actually takes risks and is original, see the aforementioned first 2 batman films BATMAN and Batman Returns. Tim Burton knew Batman (and had the most in common i think as well, lol), and while wtahcing HIS mvoies i felt he really understood Batman and Michael Keaton as well. They are more well made, more emotional, and far cry better then this new POS movie that should have been called \\"die hard 5:now hes a bat\\". Thank you for reading.  <br /> <br />

B000099T2L|4.0|I gotta say that for the longest time i would not listen to this CD because im not a big Destiny's Child fan, much less Beyonce on her own. It was the sounds of Speachless one night while i was listening to the radio that got me to listen to the song. It reminded me of one of the ol' skool funk songs that i AM a fan of, like \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\" by Bootsy Collins in wich i found that she sampled for another song of hers  \\"Be With You\\". It wasn't too bad I must admitt to that too. The slow songs on the CD is really what kept me on it honestly. At the same time tho, the fast tracks do have enuff energy to keep your head and body in motion. So i gotta say girl done did it.
B0006AZMFM|4.0|the first thing hat strikes you about this album is delta's fascinating voice and range control. the songs are very well written, great pop melodies. unfortunately, most of them are ruined by heavy handed production. oh! for a stripped down, cleanly produced cuts of these songs. i think it is tragic that typical producing excesses in an attempt to cash in on the teen segment has taken away the charm of delta's voice. <br /> <br />however, that aside most of teh songs are still beautifully performed. buy this if you like your music with a touch of mainstream pop. and one advice to delta, stay away from guy chambers. the songs he has produced are particularly overdone. <br /> <br />despite this, the beauty of the voice and songs gives this album a 4-star rating. mistaken identity, is the pick of the lot.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Enigma V-Voyageur. What can I say about this album, this album is basically a masterpiece. Each song so well intertwined in a trancey journey that could only be weaved by Enigma. Different from previous releases, thinking about it each album is different in it's own way and this is not off. This album is beautiful and filled with wonderful songs. No song too slow or too fast, everything just perfect. If ur looking for good music, Enigma Voyageur will not disappoint you for it holds many mysterious surprises, rhythms, sounds, and feelings.
6305428352|5.0|I found this movie to be heartwarming and touching. Richard Dryfus was fantasic as Mr. Holland. To see how he sacrificed his music to teach others. There was a very touching moment when Mr. Holland was signing and singing \\"Beautiful Boy\\" to his son Cole. Everytime my husband and I see this scene we both cry. We also loved the scene when his students came back to play his unfinished symphony to honor his retirement.
B00000DQSS|5.0|ORDER THIS CD IMMEDIATELY! These songs all contain terrific, well-told little stories, each one is like a little movie that plays in your head. The music is SO warm and beautiful that it's impossible not to fall in love with it. The combination of Delius > Blow Away > All We Ever Look For > Egypt is STUNNING!<br /><br />This album is like a warm, happy spring day from your youth, full of joy and hope and promise, no kidding. I read a review once that ridiculed \\"Egypt,\\" which is one of my favorite songs. I think that Ms. Bush realized everything she set out to accomplish on this record and much, much more.<br /><br />Truly a little treasure. Music like this makes life worth living. Check it out!
B0000BWVCL|5.0|Why is it that all the sequels I watch is better than the first one? Anyways, I loved this movie. The scene with Nightcrawler attacking the White House was cool as well as the scene with Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike fighting. If you're a huge X-Men fan, I reccomend this one.

B0002IVN9W|3.0|I've waited to review this album for a reason. Since its release in September, it's become the biggest hype balloon since the Strokes' Is This It. One side is going to tell you that it's a landmark achievement, the best album of 2004, of the '00s, even. Another side is going to tell you that it's an overwrought ham-fest filled with blatant rip-offs and affected flourishes. I've been listening to this album since the week it came out, and by now I think it's been long enough to draw some conclusions.     Funeral is a frustrating record because it shows so much promise at times, but lets down horribly in others. The opener \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" starts out like a muted lullaby and grows into a heaving, blazing monster of a rock song. However, not very many tracks are immediately likeable, and many are such obvious imitations of other bands that it's almost insulting. Sometimes they ape the Pixies (\\"Neighborhood #2\\"); sometimes they ape New Order (\\"Neighborhood #3\\"); they even manage to pull a shamelessly blatant Bjrk rip-off (\\"In the Back Seat\\"). I'm all for wearing your influences on your sleeve, but Funeral is more than I can tolerate, especially when they're imitating innovative bands and adding only their own tragic yelps. I know Funeral was made in the wake of numerous deaths in the families of the band members, but that doesn't give it emotional sincerity by a long shot -- it just makes it more affected and overdone. The squawks on \\"Neighborhood #2\\" are great examples -- yeah, they might be trying to emulate the off-kilter combination of Black Francis and Kim Deal, but they wind up sounding like two deaf cats caught in a dryer.    Also, I'm somewhat put off by the immediate comparisons to acts like Brian Eno, Roxy Music or Built to Spill -- those bands created a sound on their own as opposed to wringing their hands impotently. I'm pleased, however, that people are recommending \\"Surfer Rosa\\" instead of this album -- at least the Pixies did it first.     Still, Funeral manages to redeem itself at times. \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\" is a just a great pop song molded by the Arcade Fire's dense post-rock aesthetic. \\"Wake Up\\" rocks so hard that it will wake you up at night - it's everything the new Trail of Dead album should have been (up until its entirely unnecessary segue into a campy, crappy closing part that sounds like Dexy's Midight Runners). For all its borrowing, \\"Neighborhood #3\\" is a pretty good song (they mimic New Order competently enough to throw in a Peter Hook bass part), and though \\"Crown of Love\\" is melodramatic and half-cooked, it ends with a sudden explosion of stabbing strings and thumping bass that will give even the most jaded troll goose bumps. \\"In the Backseat,\\" contrived as it may be, closes the album on a soaring, searing note. It's worth hearing at least once.     It would be juvenile to throw Funeral into a love/hate get it/don't category. It's not a life-changing record, nor is it indicative of everything wrong with indie rock. It has some very bright moments that make me think the Arcade Fire will deliver in the future, but it lacks the consistency that a truly great album requires. Very few so-called \\"saviors of rock\\" are worth speaking in superlatives about, and this is certainly no exception.
B00002E224|4.0|Like its characters, Before Sunrise struggles to appear relaxed. But it develops meaningfully. What might easily have turned phoney manages to float on the delicious promise of an earnest, youthful, bittersweet romance.<br /><br />\\"After tomorrow morning we'll probably never see each other,\\" one says.<br />\\"Well, who says relationships have to last forever?\\"<br /><br />Not your hackneyed Obstacles-to-be-Overcome scenario of a garden variety romantic comedy. They are both bright, articulate, and on a train from  Budapest to Vienna. The mutual attraction is guileless as they slide into a first-date type banter about anything and everything, from music, TV, parents and expectations, to dating and sex.<br /><br />This ends up being rather chatty but it's engaging; simple everyday rhythms of two people slowly yielding to each other. As we go along, the film incrementally acquires a cache of humor and emotion to create two of the most vivid characters of the 90s.<br /><br />Hawke and Delpy are excellent: unaffected and occasionally perhaps a little too offhanded (what college kids aren't?) but the chemistry is so conspicuous you could slice it with a cheese knife.<br /><br />If you're after a movie with a distinct plot, skip it. But if you can savour a turn of heart in a very realistic, credible setting, you'll love this charming caper.
B00064MW6A|3.0|This movie is not great, but it is not awful either. I've seen films that are MUCH worse. You see, Catwoman used to be just another colorful Batman villian, a simple jewel thief with a costume, until writers at DC decided to make her a romantic interest (bye-bye Ertha Kitt, hello blonde bombshell Michelle Pfieffer)  which spawned the \\"Birds of Prey\\" comic and TV show.   <br /> <br />Now Halle Berry and director Pitof (I guess Dieter was busy) take a crack at putting Catwoman on the silver screen, delving into the whole quasi pro-feminist, Egyptian mythology based history behind this shallow comic character. I give them points for trying. The main villain is played by Sharon Stone, an evil cosmetics magnate who plans to sell bad makeup to the masses. It confirms my opinion: Sharon Stone cannot act but marries well. <br /> <br />Yes, Halle Berry is grade-A hoochie material enhanced by the leather Catwoman costume (personally, she looks hotter in her Ororo X-Man costume) but SHE can act, which helps this film. Department store dummy Benjamin Pratt shows up as the love interest - YAWN... <br /> <br />The fight scenes are OK, boarderline bad but I have seen worse (the last Batman film for example). Catwoman is worth a look, but buying it would'nt be a great idea.
1400032717|5.0|This is, quite simply, one of the best books I've ever read in my life. <br /> <br />I'm not autistic, so I have no idea how accurate this was. However, seeing that one of the spotlight reviews here on amazon was written by an autistic person, it seems as if the author was spot-on in his depiction of the difficulty of being Christopher. <br /> <br />But this book is so much more about being autistic, so much more about a mystery involving the death of a dog, so much more about the journey that Christopher makes. This book has *layers* upon layers of subplots (though they may not seem apparent unless you're an experienced reader and you're looking for them) and twists and surprises. It starts out seeming to be a simple story of an autistic child trying to solve the murder of a dog. That premise, in itself, is an extremely intriguing one, and was what caused me to purchase the book. Imagine my surprise when I quickly discovered that this book had so much more to offer. <br /> <br />This book was about real life. In real life, situations can present themselves as a mystery, and then you find that the situation isn't a mystery at all - that it's really a situation regarding emotion. Then you see that it's not a mystery, it's not a character piece, it may just be a situation of triumph over adversity. Generally in fiction you either have a mystery, a character piece, or a story about triumph over adversity. Rarely do you come across a story that encompasses all of that, and more. It takes an exceptional writer to perform such a task, and Mark Haddon has done it in this book. <br /> <br />This is the kind of book that, when I finished reading it, made me want to go back through several reviews of books that I've given five stars to and reduce them to four. Or at the very least beg amazon to allow me give this six stars. That's happened twice in the last couple of months. First with Million Dollar Baby, and now with THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME. <br /><br />To say that it is an extraordinary piece of literature doesn't begin to describe it. It is remarkable, exceptional, amazing, astonishing, astounding, marvelous, wonderful, sensational, stunning, incredible, unbelievable, miraculous, phenomenal, prodigious, and spectacular. <br /> <br />I was moved to tears, and it isn't often that literature does that to me. If you're wondering whether or not to read this book, stop wondering RIGHT NOW. Buy this book. <br />
B00006G8LB|5.0|I like this movie a lot. I especially like how Tobey Maguire portrayed Peter Parker/Spder-Man and how Willem Defoe portrayed Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. The only annoying thing about the movie is Mary Jane, she screams too much and can't fight for 5 seconds. Other than that This movie is great.
B00001OH7N|4.0|When I first listened to this album I was amused, mystifyed and thoroughly intrigued - I had never heard anything like it before.  I still haven't.  It's a very weird little album in many respects, but I find it strangely addicting.   <br /> <br />David's singing reminds me of how a cat might sound if it could sing (a cat with a nice voice, mind you).  Not quite human.  He uses lots of funky little vocal tricks that are a blast to hear.  The songs are often humourous, but sort of dark - like Edward Gorey on nitrous oxide.  Several of the songs are truly fantastic!  Not a perfect album, but definitely appealing! <br /> <br />The booklet includes complete lyrics and lots of photos and promos from the cover session and the time period, which makes for fun viewing as you listen.  The cover itself is great fun, of course (and has the delightful ability to weird people out). <br /> <br />I'm very fond of this album and I think most people, at the very least, would not regret the purchase.  So try it out!
1401902197|5.0|This is a book with the book-on-tape, read by the author, enclosed.  I CAN DO IT is all about affirmations and changing your life with affirmations.  The spoken word on this CD is incredibly powerful.  Louise supportivly walks the reader (and listener) through a discussion on the usefulness of affirmations for several areas including health, wealth/prosperity, job happiness, relationships, self-esteem and stress.  She then gives sample affirmations for each catagory.  I listen to the CD when I drive, as suggested on the CD cover, and I feel empowered to create the life I want!  I drive around saying affirations out loud, including \\"I am totally adequate for all situations\\", so empowering!
B00005NG9Z|5.0|Let's get this straight: this DVD has great sound. They took the time to mix it for multi channel, and the result is completely satisfiying.  <br /> <br />Some people here have said that the sound is awful, and (as some other users have pointed) it must be because they heard the 5.1 mix in an stereo equipment, getting the sound only partially. They should have chosen the PCM audio track instead, before writting misleading opinions. <br /> <br />So, wether you are an AIC fan, or a fan of grunge, this is a must have. This DVD visually documents the work of a great group, with the best sound you can get. Some videos could be considered \\"ordinary\\" but most of them have great quality of images and/or concepts. And they are intertwined by home footage and concert images, so basically, we have a 1 and half hour peek of the work of the band. <br />
B000000OQF|2.0|I agree.Slash is the best guitarist ever,but that's beyond the point.I,along with others,belive that this album is on a low level of lyricism and is full of hair metal ego.Sure,it was a groundbreaking metal album,but it only changed the face of the metal world,where as albums by such artists as Nirvana,Pearl Jam and Green Day helped form modern rock as we know it.Plus,the songs to some people sound the same,using riffs that are to similar to the last.Plus,all the songs are about the same thing:Women or their city.Belive me,women are awesome.But hearing some ugly dude talking about them...not so cool.And people call him the ultimate frontman,which just meant he was an egotistical jerk.So,instead of listening to a one hour and fifteen minute death sentence,go buy Nevermind or Dookie,or Ten(even though i dissed it,it's still better than this).Seriously,this should only be used in execution chambers to murders who have killed many people or anyone else who deserves it.
0553802534|5.0|\\"Alone\\", by Lisa Gardner, NY, Bantam, 2004 ISBN 0-553-80253-4 (hc), 324 p., by author of 6 prior NYT best-selling novels (plus 13 others under a.k.a. Alicia Scott).  Gardner at her finest renders a suspense novel entwining lives of police sniper Bobby Dodge and Boston socialite Catherine Gagnon with those messed-up lives of their ovn parents and  \\"lustmord\\" of pedophilist Richard Umbrio.  So yes, there's rape abduction, police homicides, and an escalating mess of murder by knife, hanging?, gun -- by chilling variant divating means.<br /><br />We are immersed into finely-tuned and researched machinations of SWAT techniques, of alleged spousal & child abuse, of aftermath of incest, pedophilia and inappropriate use of financial and judicial power, and importantly a heartening and occasionally disheartening look into survival techniques used by people suffering from imperfections and fragility of the human condition and where the bottom line rings true that blood runs thicker than thieves.<br /><br />Gardner's command of language, be it technical, romantic, carnal, or merely weaving fact with fiction is simply superb -- when novels get this good it is hard to say enough and I'd love to have a signed copy.  Deservedly, I give it 5***** without hesitation.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Setting aside the fanboy complaints about the subtitles, taking a closer look at Oshii's masterwork reveals a stunningly executed world with layers of characterization requiring multiple views to appreciate fully, and subtle master-strokes of a startling vision bathed in both romantic hope and dystopian cynicism.  <br /> <br />Innocence occurs three years after the events in the first film. The first film was essentially about Kusanagi's conflict with the sense of identity, self, and awareness, the second film is Batou's story of what it means to be human if being human means nothing at all. Dolls are a central theme to this film, and the characters themselves are doll-like and emotionless, even though their fears and motivations are seen as echoes of their actions and word choices. It's a heart wrenching continuation of the hinted-at romance in the first film, even though the Major Motoko Kusanagi doesn't make an onscreen appearance, and Batou's longing for her is only matched by his warmth for his dog, a basset hound whose symbolic importance in the key elemental discussion of the nature of souls is often repeated. The moments Batou spends feeding his Basset hound reflect his feelings for the only innocent creature in the film, and echo Oshii's sentiments about the rare beauties left in the world, untouched by human artifice, unruined by our need to recreate ourselves in the ideal of artificial life. <br /> <br />Matched in this complexly interwoven plot of what it means to have a soul is what love is worth, and the story between the Major and Batou on the ship is a real treat for fans of their interactions in the first film. Star-crossed love might be the most bittersweet, but it's also most eloquently expressed here, in just a few short lines. I was breathless when Batau draped the jacket over the woman, and even more so when she said \\"Ikku- I'm going.\\" This story is even more subtle than that of the first film, and viewers who are too awed by the visuals will miss it, as the technical efforts are outstanding. <br /> <br />Hailed as a nominated film at Cannes, this sequel shatters the genre of anime, exactingly crafted in every technical aspect and making a place for itself amongst the great films of time. With dialogue that challenges even the seasoned shakespearian viewers, animation that shames every animated film before it, (as well it should, given that IG collaborated with Studio Ghibli) and a haunting soundtrack that takes the themes from the first film and gives it an epic expanded sensibility, Innoncence continues its heritage of raising the expectations of not just great anime, but great filmmaking as well. <br /> <br />This movie shatters the idea of anime, and challenges the viewers to think about the themes of human's obession with technology, as well as what love means when even artifice can be real.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Two young adults ( Gina Philips and Justin Long) are driving their way through a sunny day on springbreak week until they witness a house that has a strange person dumping a body down a pipe. They get suspicious as they investigate that hole on what that odd person dumped down there, it appears to be a body but also a collection of stitch taxidermies made of human bodies. They head out to a local town to contact the cops, but soon the odd man from the house who has the bodies begins to stalk the two and cannot be stopped until the two are dead as he is really a monster.<br /><br />Entertaining and quite different horror thriller that harkons back to the 70's horror movies of it's era, there is some decent acting, fine gore and scares to go with it. The opening sequence is quite terrifying and it's twist ending is definitely disturbing as well, i think it's the one of the better horror offerings in recent memory.<br /><br />The Special Edition DVD is very cool! an informative audio commentary by the director, crisp picture & Sound, Deleted & extended scenes especially an alternate ending, featurettes, Photo gallery, and Trailer.<br /><br />Also recommended: House of 1000 Corpses, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 and 2003), Re-Animator, Final Destination 1 & 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, Demons, Friday The 13th series, Nightmare on Elm Street series, Stephen King's IT, The Shining, Cannibal Holocaust, City of the Living Dead ( a.k.a.

B00012BD0S|5.0|It wasn't until the New Jersey progressive metal band released their third album that they would build a substantial fan base.  After their first two albums, Symphony X and The Damnation Game went by relatively unnoticed, the band replaced their lead singer with California-born Russell Allen and wrote the best album of their career.  Fusing progressive and neoclassical movements with aggressive and fast power-metal, guitarist/songwriter Michael Romeo established the band with a sound unlike any other.  The songs do not have the predictable quality of everyday power-metal outfits, but instead have surprise turns and unexpected notes.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Of Sins and Shadows\\" would not be the masterpiece it is without the juxtaposed chorus of voices that follows the second chorus (a delightful surprise).  Neither would the 20-minute giant \\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy\\" have its tremendous appeal if the entire song were a predictable journey through mundane and overdone chord arrangements.  The twists and turns through which listeners navigate as they listen to each song are what separate both the album and the band from everyday metal fanfare.  The keyboard/guitar solo on \\"Sea of Lies\\" is delightful and indicative of things to come; the triumphant energy of \\"Out of the Ashes\\" is as close to \\"regular\\" (yet exceptional) power-metal as the band will ever get; and the real treasure of the album is \\"The Accolade\\", a 9-minute woeful power-ballad that is destined to be unforgettable.<br /><br />The album is powerful, beautiful and (after a few listens) very catchy and accessible.  Progressive power-metal is a difficult combination to execute, but thankfully for the classically-oriented Michael Romeo, this band pulls it off perfectly.  Except for a few lackluster tracks (\\"The Eyes of Medusa\\" and \\"Pharaoh\\"), the album is monumental.<br /><br />See also: Symphony X - Twilight in Olympus, Symphony X - V: The New Mythology Suite, Symphony X - The Odyssey
B000003TA4|5.0|I say this because it's true.Nirvana had it's first album,Bleach,which had a bundle of incredible songs,but lacked radioplay and a good single.So,when recording their second album,the tried hard to create a better product for the fans.Thus,we have Nevermind,Nirvana's masterpiece. <br /> <br />From the opening \\"Smell's Like Teen Spirit\\" to it's finish \\"Something in The Way\\",it is full of punk riffs and melodius vocals and incredible and sometimes haunting lyrics.You have probably heard the single track \\"Smell's Like Teen Spirit\\",since it is the song that started a revolution,but that is definetly the only great highlight.After that,brings in the track \\"In Bloom\\" which has a catchy bass line and a memorable chorus.Following that is one of many people's all time favorite's \\"Come As You Are\\",another song with an incredible bass line,but it's lyrics are some of the best written in that era.\\"Breed\\" is almost a blast of punk energy rising out of the previous track,with Kurt's vocals making want you to sing along.\\"Lithium\\" is a good song,but can be considered a little dull by some.\\"Polly\\"is performed acousitcally,but with Kurt's low pitched singing,and it's disturbing lyrics,it's one of the haunting moments on Nevermind,but it is still an excellent song.It is followed by the odd thrack \\"Territorial Pissings\\" which has Cobain screaming most of the track behind swift guitar and pounding drums.\\"Drain You\\" may sound creepy,but it really has in incredible melody with a firm chorus structre,and with the grotesque lyrics and the melody break two minutes in with Cobain echoing the word you...,it adds incredible intrest to the album.\\"Lounge Act\\" is one of my personal favorites because i'm a fan of punk,and this is a relative sound to many of the punk acts of the past.\\"Stay Away\\" is a defining moment,with Cobain's ferocious groaning and shifting guitar,makes it one of the most intresting tracks.\\"On A Plain\\" and \\"Something In The Way\\" will forever be remembered by there appearance ontheir later Unplugged performance,but both well stand the test of time by the modern rock standards they helped set.\\"Something In The Way\\" particualrly stands out as the slowest track,but probably as the most introspective,leaving it as the finishing point for a genre defining album. <br /> <br />Nevermind is one of the few albums that can satisfy almost any rock fans intrest,because of it's constantly shifting melodies and changes in atmosphere.My father,a fan of band's like Metallica and Black Sabbath and many other Metal acts of the decade,loves every track on the album.If you do not already own it,you should buy it immeaditely.You will not regret it.
B00000JPH4|5.0|I have associations with this film, dating back to when I was a small child.  I was always a great fan of the great genius, Jim Henson, his innovation, humor and intelligence as an artist, a puppeteer and a man.  Not only did Jim Henson's transition from Sesame Street to the big screen succeed marvelously in THE DARK CRYSTAL, but, for me, this is one of the greatest fantasy films of all time. I haven't had a chance to see THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, but, for me, at the tender age of two, this was the RINGS of my generation (1980s).<br /><br />It is the story of Jen, a young gelfling, raised by the Mystics, a race on the brink of extinction, living in a world on the verge of darkness, as the evil, lizard-like/monsterous skexies who wish to take over the essence from a precious crystal.  The skexies want to wipe out Jen's gelfling race, and he must run for his life, and also must make a great and courageous journey to save his planet from the plot of the evil creatures.  On the way, he encounters Keira, a girl gelfling, her pomeranian-esque pet, Fizgig (a creature with two sets of teeth and a raging temper), the musical potlins (little hippy creatures who have a lust for life and great music), and many other twists and turns.<br /><br />Not only is this fantasy story engaging, but, it is worth noting that this film was made without the use of ANY computer special effects.  Some of the life-sized puppets, worn by puppeteers, weighed a couple hundred pounds each!! What's more, it is a cautionary tale about the state of the environment, and its pending demise.  How timely!  This film is truly timeless.  There will never be a puppet quite as masterful, creative and ingenius as the late, great Jim Henson.  I believe that anyone over the age of seven will enjoy it, and, maybe, even children younger than that.  A note:  There are some scary scenes that may frighten young children.  A masterpiece.
B000009RC2|5.0|A very rewarding and wonderfully revealing document of how good music can become when limiting, commercial constraints are removed.  This is the state of the art in musicianship and for me, in taste.  ESSENTIAL.  All serious fusion fans are expected to know of this release virtually note-for-note.
B000002JKA|5.0|I heard Awake before Images and Words.  The album was amazing; it was astounding and absolutely breath-taking.  Then I decided to listen to the album as if I were anxiously anticipating it, after having loved their previous release.  Under this new light, I thought the album would gather a completely different makeup than its predecessor.  In some ways, it does - which is not an altogether bad thing.<br /><br />Many songs are much darker, namely \\"Voices\\" - one of the album's two longer songs, and \\"The Mirror\\", the heaviest song on the album, whose melodies recur in its neighboring track, \\"Lie\\" and in Moore-written \\"Space-Dye Vest\\".  All of the aforementioned songs have had dark moods - even \\"Lifting Shadows Off a Dream\\", whose very name insinuates a change of mood, is treated with an almost somber tone that never departs.  \\"Erotomania\\" is very reminiscent of \\"Ytse Jam\\" as it is an instrumental romp through spontaneous melodies, guitar/keyboard collaborations, rampant drums and changing rhythms.  It's as if the band had an extremely short attention span - they don't stick to a melody for more than tens of seconds before the song changes direction.  The 11-minute \\"Scarred\\" is not your typical Dream Theater epic - it's not that good.  It begins as a neo-jazz piece and escalates into something that sounds like \\"The Mirror\\", but without the maddening crunch that made the latter so delectable.  The song has its moments, but they're too far into the song to save it.  Thankfully, the band has saved the best song for last.<br /><br />Kevin Moore's \\"Space-Dye Vest\\" is the darkest of songs and single-handedly dictates the feel of the whole.  It begins with a lonely piano and sung by a choir of James LaBrie's over-dubbed drone(s), accompanied by synthesized static and audio clips, which give the song the tone of a future gone askew.  The lyrical interpretations are many, but the guitars roaring in the background and the continuing sadness of the keyboards never permit this song to be uplifting.  Even the two \\"happier\\" songs (\\"Innocence Faded\\" and \\"The Silent Man\\") are somewhat gloomy - they are only cheerful melodically, not lyrically.<br /><br />No matter how I try to view the album, I can't see it as anything else but another masterpiece.  Darker than the albums that came before it, Awake is worth any music lover's time - Dream Theater only gets better.<br /><br />See also: Dream Theater - Train of Thought, Dream Theater - Images and Words, Arcturus - The Sham Mirrorsting.

B000669GAI|1.0|I don't really think pearl jam sucks so badly,i just think that they deserve the title of a \\"good grunge\\" band.They had there time with TEN,and i really didn't think that was really that good either.I believe that they used Nirvana's sudden success to proppell themselves into the limelight,using slow old time rock to win over the people of America.Well,if you have half a brain(which anyone who bought this doesn't) you wouldn't even consider listening to these losers.If you want real music,listen to Nevermind by Nirvana or Dookie by Green Day,but not this.Really,you are a real idiot if you buy this,listen to this,or enjoy this in any way.
6300216268|5.0|HAROLD AND MAUDE is truly a cult classic, and, rightfully so!  This is a film about learning to embrace life, find the joy in the little things, and not take a moment for granted.  It is also a dark comedy about two misfits who find friendship and love in the company of one another.<br /><br />Harold (Bud Cort), is best described as an \\"odd young man\\" with a constant preoccupation with death.  He is constantly faking his own death to get the attention of his blase and inattentive mother (Vivian Pickles).  Her response is often one of boredom, and wearily attempts to fix him up with women through a computer dating service.  The wealthy young man spends his time attending the funerals of strangers, cruising around in his very own hearse.  It's one fateful day that he has a chance encounter with the fiesty, plucky, flamboyantly irreverant Maude (Ruth Gordon).  This woman is truly like no woman he could ever meet through the computer dating service.  Together, they embark on a lifechanging friendship.  She teaches him to embrace life, challenge authority and awakens his spirit to the world around him.<br /><br />Although, this film was quite a scandal, when it came out, due in no small part to the depiction of a romantic relationship between a young man and a woman old enough to be his grandmother, don't judge the book by its cover.  Truthfully, Maude has more life in her than women 1/3 her age, and Bud Cort's portrayal of Harold gives new meaning to the term \\"goth.\\"  Not only does the story have some priceless scenes (particularly, when Harold fakes his own death in front of the young women his mother attempts to set him up with), but it is touching and, ultimately heartwrenching.  What's more, the soundtrack by Cat Stevens is fantastic!  The real spirit of the movie is captured in his beautiful music.
0790732254|5.0|Though \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\\" as brilliantly directed by Mike Nichols, is almost 40 years old it still has real impact on anyone lucky enough to see this new DVD transfer.<br />This play and film will most likely be the zenith, the Signature Play of Edward Albee's tremendous career, though he has written much since the Broadway production of this play in the early 1960's.<br />Though, at the time it was thought of as mostly a way to cash in on their major stardom, the casting of Taylor and Burton is perfect: as each of them reaches way above and sometimes below the surface of the written page to come up with the truth and heart of Albee's words (though Nichols and Ernest Lehman adapted the screenplay).<br />Albee is concerned here with the little and big lies we tell ourselves and others in order to keep going: \\"Truth or Illusion,\\" George and Martha intone several times during this film (\\"Truth or Illusion, George, doesn't it matter to you...at all?\\"). And only when George \\"kills\\" the Illusion of an imaginary son do we feel that there is any chance for George and Martha to continue:<br />  Martha...\\"before I'm through with you you'll wish you'd died in that automobile<br />  [...]  George:...\\"and you'll wish you'd never mentioned our son!\\"<br /><br />Albee has set \\"WAOVW\\" in New Carthage, which was founded in the 9th Century B.C. The Romans razed it to the ground in 146 A.D. By the 5th Century it had again become a power, which St Augustine, in his \\"Confessions\\" called a \\"Cauldron of Unholy Loves.\\"<br /><br />Amen, Brother, Amen.
B000063CMK|5.0|Though thematically it may seem to be a subtle continuation to their previous work, The Perfect Element I, it sadly is not.  But that, however, is only a technicality, because the album is astounding.  The same themes are present - growing up, sexual discovery, and trauma - as well as Pain of Salvation's trademark musical delivery - impossible rhythms, eerie keyboards, and spoken word, an added treat to the album.<br /><br />This album is sumptuous.  Everything from the theatrical \\"Ending Theme\\" to the heart-wrenchingly painful \\"A Trace of Blood\\" (arguably among the band's top three best songs) is dripping with emotion, from elation (as shown in \\"Second Love\\") to rage (no doubt present in \\"Rope Ends\\", a tour de force reminiscent of Perfect Element's \\"Idioglossia\\").  Throughout the album, Daniel Gildenlow (vocals/guitar/songwriter) never lets a single instrument monopolize the moment, his voice included.  At any given minute, the guitars are playing over gloomy, sometimes off-tempo keyboards, while his falsetto drifts above and slowly rains down.  Standout tracks include \\"Fandango\\" (a song that can only be described as a soundtrack to a wanderer in a cemetery), \\"Undertow\\" (a repeated guitar line that forms a dark crescendo), \\"Dryad of the Woods\\" (the only instrumental song on the album, acoustic and serene), and \\"Waking Every God\\" (the archetype for eerie keyboards, complete with one of the most memorable choruses the band has concocted thus far).<br /><br />Remedy Lane is an amazing effort from a band who continues to excel in dark, emotional progressive metal.  No stones unturned, no calm thoughts.<br /><br />See also: Pain of Salvation - The Perfect Element I, Arena - Contagion
B0000DZEE3|4.0|I would not say that this is an excelent dvd, maybe because there is a lack of soul..There were really many people in Slane Castle, and I believe it is a reason for that we fell a distance of the band. Most of the concerts they're more vigorous. Most of the time, the concert was predictable. Even with the best audio equipment, this great track selection - focusing Californication hits - didn't make me feel inside of the crown.
0553269631|5.0|Not many writers are able to at his/her early twenties to have such a exquisite view of the world and complex subjects as Carson McCullers displays in her beautiful \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\". Maybe the fact that she was a sort of precocious genius she wrote the book helped her to sharp her senses to create a world apart inhabited by ordinary people, just trying to live their ordinary lives.<br /><br />Her condition of being young also influenced her in the novel. As most young people, she didn't have many life experiences yet; therefore much of her inspiration comes from her own life and the people she knew. Her father was a jeweler, like Mick's father. She also studied piano -- and this is one of Mick's dreams. Moreover, Mick's coming of age has a lot in common with Carson's. She started working on this book when she was at the university and her idea was to make a novel about five isolated people, in which the narrative's structure would be inspired by a fugue (a musical composition featuring several repeating themes).<br /><br />In the first part, she introduces the characters, the settings and the main thematic, which deals with of \\"man's revolt against his own inner isolation and his urge to express himself as fully as possible\\". Her main man in this case is the deaf-mute John Singer. The second part is the failure of each character, due to his options (and lack of them) and free will. The third part shows the faith of each character, and what they made of their lives after they met Singer.<br /><br />Unquestionably the main theme is the isolation and the alienation of the human being. Each character -- even the supporting ones -- tries to break out their condition. The isolation is the result of the combination of personal and environmental factors. In this process, Singer -- who has the most difficult to communicate -- plays a key role to help each of the four main characters to find their own voice. He represents the hope throughout the whole narrative.<br /><br />Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream. Everyone in this novel cannot fulfill his/her dreams. The girl Mick, for instance, is too smart for her family, for her town; therefore she has to suffocate her talents and become an ordinary person. But, in her mind, she can keep the flame of her dream of becoming a musician alive.<br /><br />Carson deals beautiful with language and character development. From the beginning one can notice that this is a writers who dominates her tool -- and not the other way round. Every character has his/her own motivations and these people change throughout the narrative. Because of it, \\"The heart is a lonely hunter\\" is a complex slice of life. More than a book, this novel X-rays ordinary lives and expose them, bringing us a little bit of hope to diminish our own sadness.rative. <br /> <br />Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream.

B000002UAX|5.0|This is a wonderful album. Of all the Beatles albums released in the 60's, this one is my absolute favorite.  <br /> <br />The first disc contains many classic Beatles tunes, including \\"Back in the USSR,\\" \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" and \\"Blackbird.\\" The songs surrounding these range from lovely acoustic numbers like \\"I Will\\" and \\"Julia\\" to the off-the-wall (\\"Piggies\\") and instantly catchy (\\"Martha My Dear\\"). There is a little filler on this disc, as well as on the second disc, but they don't distract too much from the substance of the other tracks. <br /> <br />The second disc contains Beatles staples like \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Helter Skelter.\\" \\"Yer Blues\\" is Lennon's tale of agonizing depression (you can't get anymore straight-forward than \\"I'm lonely, wanna die\\"), and McCartney's sweet \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" is yet another great acoustic number. \\"Revolution 1\\" is NOT the \\"Revolution\\" you commonly hear on radio. It's a more slower flowing version. It's not quite as good as the faster single version, but it fits well in its place on the album.  <br /> <br />This is, of course, a quick run through of the album touching on the highlights. Other songs like \\"Sexy Sadie,\\" \\"Long, Long, Long,\\" \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" and \\"Dear Prudence\\" are not to be missed my anyone interested in the Beatles. I do not believe that this album would be better trimmed down or made into two albums, because the sheer monstrous stretch of this album is what makes it so legendary. I do recommend listening to the album before dropping $30 on it, but I'm sure that most people would be instantly intrigued by what they hear.
B000002HPT|4.0|First things first: this was Dream Theater's first \\"official\\" album with Derek Sherinian, replacing Kevin Moore as the progressive metal quintet's keyboardist (Sherinian played keyboards for the band on \\"A Change of Seasons\\", a mini-album of sorts).  It is also the only album (except When Dream and Day Unite) to lack the band's trademark typeset (the classic \\"Dream Theater\\" logo).  It was also the first Dream Theater album I heard.  This was a fitting coincidence - it is Dream Theater's most accessible and \\"mainstream\\" album.<br /><br />The majority of the songs follow the over-used rock formula: verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus.  The album is less a progressive work than it is a rock album.  It has aggressive, riff-heavy numbers (\\"Burning My Soul\\", \\"Just Let Me Breathe\\") and wonderful, radio-ready ballads (\\"Hollow Years\\", \\"Take Away My Pain\\").  Even with two 10+ minute songs (\\"Lines in the Sand\\" and \\"Trial of Tears\\"), the album is still very smooth.  Fans of Images and Words and Awake were surely shocked.  The only song that half-resembles any of their previous material is \\"Hell's Kitchen\\", a 4-minute instrumental piece that is classic Dream Theater fanfare, but never takes off into the insanity that had characterized the band's instrumental pieces.<br /><br />In other words, the album is fun and very listenable, but never impressive.  The band is very restrained in their delivery, and in a way, the effect is counter-productive.  Although the album has its noteworthy tracks, it is essentially a rock album, and does not come close to matching the standard set by previous works.  A must-have for a patient music fan, but not for those seeking progressive metal.<br /><br />See also: Arena - Contagion, Spock's Beard - V, Transatlantic - SMPT:e
B0006957SA|5.0|If \\"Rum, Sodomy and the Lash\\" confirmed the Pogues as no mere novelty act, than \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God,\\" is the triumph that they deserved.  Shane MacGowan's writing was now at mythical proportions, with such songs as the title track, \\"Lullaby of London, Bottle of Smoke, and The Broad Majestic Shannon.\\"  Phil Chevron's song \\"Thousands Are Sailing,\\" about the Irish diaspora, proved that MacGowan wasn't the only talented songwriter in the band.  This album also contains the best Christmas song ever, the MacGowan/Finer \\"Fairytale of New York, featuring the late Kristy MacColl.  This release also showed the Pogues expanding their boundaries adding jazz (\\"Metropolis\\") Spanish flamenco (\\"Fiesta\\") and Middle Eastern tunes (\\"Turkish Song of the Damned\\") into their rollicking Irish set.  \\"Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six\\" showed MacGowan tackling political issues for the first time, and if you want to see the Pogues tear through some numbers than \\"Sit Down By the Fire, and Medley\\" find them doing just that.  Overall, \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God,\\" is a brilliant democratically written album from a band at their most creative peak. <br />The new remastered version contains the Terry Woods instrumental \\"The Battle March Medley, and the traditional \\"South Australia.\\"  The Pogues and Dubliners duets on the \\"Irish Rover and Rare Ol' Mountain Dew\\" are on here as well.  Shanne Bradley, a beautiful instrumental by Shane MacGowan, and Jem Finer's \\"Sketches of Spain,\\" round off the bonus tracks.
0425173755|5.0|This is, closely followed by \\"ABC Murders\\", the best book I have ever read. Amazingly well written, unpredictable and genious are the right words to describe it. I didn't really like the beginning so I was quite tempted to put it off but the story gets really interesting after a few chapters. Who is the murder? Every person that is involved seems to have strong alibi and it looks like it has been made a perfect crime. A murder without mistakes. That's the way it has to look like. But once again Hercule Poirot menages to find the missing pieces and recreates the spectacular and incredible plain of the murder ...

B00006L83N|5.0|Few could have expected this monstrous release.  After much touring in support of their innovative V: The New Mythology Suite, the American prog-metal band took to the studio and recorded yet another seismic monolith of sound.<br /><br />The Odyssey has its amazing songs.  \\"Wicked\\" is a great \\"typical\\" Symphony X song, blending elements of prog innovation with power-metal accessibility.  \\"The Accolade II\\" is a beautiful continuation of the legendary song off their third album with all the elements that made the original so gorgeous.  \\"King of Terrors\\" is another staple Symphony X cut, in whose notes Russell Allen stretches his voice to murderous lengths.  \\"Awakenings\\" is the second-best piece on the album, an 8-minute progressive masterpiece, winding through amazing keyboard/guitar duets, Allen's desperate cries, and a powerful chorus whose intensity is only matched by its astounding melodic edge.<br /><br />However, none of these songs hold a candle to the glory of the title-track, the 24-minute \\"The Odyssey\\".  Nothing, absolutely nothing comes close to the grandeur of this pulsing and unstoppable beast.  Inspired and based on the story of Odysseus by Homer, the song begins with a 5-minute symphonic overture, through which Romeo proves he is a master classical composer.  The song is then clearly divided into different movements, each defining a particular adventure in Odysseus' journey from and to Ithaca.  Among these we have the Sirens, the Cyclops and a fateful battle at sea.  The movements are consistently heavy and don't lose their intensity until it is time for the last part, \\"The Fate of the Suitors / Champion of Ithaca\\", the grand finale, the most memorable and epic part of the song.  It is the perfect ending to Odysseus' long and tiring epic, with Allen again stretching his voice to soaring heights.  In all its symphonic bombast, one might ignore Michael Romeo's guitars, which have been given a greater role this time around.  The Odyssey is amazing - I would recommend it to anyone, if not just for \\"The Odyssey\\", then for the accompanying tracks.  Absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />See also: Symphony X -\\"The Divine Wings of Tragedy, Symphony X - Twilight in Olympus, Symphony X - V: The New Mythology Suite- I would recommend it to anyone, if not just for \\"The Odyssey\\", then for the accompanying tracks.

B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta's album \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\" is ten tracks of pure music genius. With its brilliant lyrics, and an extremely well put together group of people, this album is most definitly the best album I have heard in years. The story behind it is that of a 5 star novel, rather then an awesome cd. The Mars Volta is unlike any other band out there, from their penetrating vocals and and theyre rhythmic guitar solos, all the way to their brilliant and ambient keyboarding, and musnt we forget the awesome beats given by Jon Theodore on drums. De-Loused in the Comatorium is an album that you must go out and buy today. Review Written by kyle, email: Bus2Nowhere@aol.com
B00005JKNF|5.0|Within the movie world it is pretty much taken as a given, and has been for years, that Robert Altman isn't for all tastes.  Yet even with that in mind, when reading over many of the one star reviews here, it is difficult to know whether I should laugh or shake my head in dismay. <br /> <br />As the movie viewing public, or more sadly should I say, the American viewing public reached such a vapid, vacuous, and unsophisticated level of taste that any movie which isn't full of car chases, explosions, or in which the immediate plot has not unfolded three minutes after the opening credits have been completed and everything has not been wrapped up in 95 minutes?  Given the box office take of tripe like \\"Are We There Yet,\\" and \\"Bogeyman\\" I strongly suspect that the answer is a sad and resounding \\"YES.\\" <br /> <br />If you can't be bothered with such inconveniences as character development, nuance in plot, and a sense that there is much more going on in the story that is unfolding on the screen than there is a good chance that \\"Gosford Park,\\" is not for you.  If these things don't scare you and you are willing to open yourself up to the notion that this isn't simply a straight forward murder mystery devoid of social commentary you might want to give it a chance.  If you relish movies in which subtlety, sharp writing and a story that works on more than one level (and simplistic one at that) than what are you waiting for. <br /> <br />And lastly, for those of you who can't write a one star review for this exceptional movie without using the words \\"boring,\\" \\"dull,\\" etc. I have good news for you.  \\"Weekend at Bernie's II\\" is available on DVD.  After all, what is more  \\"bourgeois\\" than using the word \\" bourgeois\\" as a putdown?
B000062Y98|5.0|On their seventh studio album, the German power-metal outfit have opened their magical chest and let loose everything they have.  Gone (but not too far away) are the medieval inspirations and fantasy worlds, replaced with smaller, more localized tales, and generic folklore.  The album is much more spontaneous than previous efforts, notably the critically-lauded Nightfall in Middle Earth, with tempos and melodies changing so quickly, it becomes difficult to digest individual songs upon the first listen.<br /><br />A select few offer catchy choruses upon the first impression, namely \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight\\" and \\"Mies del Dolor\\", the only tranquil piece on the album (four other versions of the song are also available on alternate releases).  The rest of the album is a melodic assault on the senses, complete with Hansi K&uuml;rsch's epic choirs, screaming guitars and a beautifully crisp production.  Every instrument is brought to the forefront of the musical delivery so that every note shines; in a way, the album never lets down from beginning to end.  Despite the heightened glory of every second, the album's crowning achievements are the last three songs.  \\"Punishment Divine\\", a ruthless double-bass powerhouse, throbs with energy in its near 6-minute duration.  The 14-minute opus, \\"And Then There Was Silence\\", although difficult to intake at first, is an instant classic, showcasing everything of which Blind Guardian is capable - majestic choirs, memorable rhythms, ominous passages and moments of symphonic grandeur.  Ending the album, \\"Mies del Dolor\\" (or \\"Frutto del Buio\\" or alternate versions) sets the listener at ease with soothing acoustic passages.<br /><br />Known for their dark-age inspiration and powerful crunch, Blind Guardian have delivered once again, but this time with the most meticulously executed production to date.  A Night at the Opera is very similar to the cover artwork: carefully-weaved chaos in a fantastic world.<br /><br />See also: Blind Guardian - Somewhere Far Beyond, Blind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle Earth: Blind Guardian - Somewhere Far Beyond, Blind Guardian - Nightfall in Middle Earth
B00008WT5E|5.0|AC/DC is one of the bands I loved 20 years ago, and still do at present.  They wrote and recorded a lot of great rock and roll music.  I definitely prefer AC/DC's music recorded with the original singer Bon Scott, over the stuff recorded with his replacement Brian Johnson.  Back in Black is a killer album, but Powerage is much better IMHO.  I like almost every song, but I think the best songs on this album are the following (in no particular order): <br /> <br />Rock N Roll Damnation   <br />Down Payment Blues <br />Gimme A Bullet <br />Sin City <br />Whats Next To The Moon <br />Gone Shootin' <br /> <br />Sometimes when I get home from a night of beer drinkin' and skirt chasin', I will put this CD in, crank up the volume, turn out the lights, lay down on the sofa, and just enjoy the sweet blues laced hard rock sounds.  Bon Scott's voice mixed with Angus Young's guitar and the underrated rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young just does it for me and always has.  AC/DC is maybe my favorite band of all time, and that's saying something.
B00005JNEI|5.0|One of the reason's why i think Mr Moore is so cool is because he exposes these neo-con fascist clowns on video, and let us \\"intelligent\\" americans see who are the power-hungry puppets that are destroying this country. The sad thing is that most americans are too stupid to do anything about it. All they do is sit on their couches, get fat and wave their flags like the ignorant twits they are. Not noticing that the country is headed down the toilet under the leadership of this \\"special\\" president of ours. Our founding fathers must be rolling over in their graves. Brilliant men like Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jeffreson, John Adams, would be ashamed of the country they founded on Liberal ideals, if they knew what was going on these days. Surely they'd laugh at us for even contemplating voting for someone as dullard as Dubya let alone actually electing the goof. <br /> <br />Michael Moore let's us see that the Republican party is unbelievably corrupt with money-hungry, power-obsessed neo-cons who only wish to make as much money possible without any regard to fellow citizens and how it might affect them. \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is brilliant in how Moore shows the audience on video how these people really work. Not way to repudiate that. It's right there on film for all to see. He even exposes the corporate media for being pawns of our corrupt government. Moore is to be applauded and praised for this piece of art and for having the guts to show it. He's a rebel in an era when investigative journalism seems to be a dying art and the ignorant majority seem to be okay with that.
B00004WGBE|4.0|I saw this on masterpiece theater and immediately bought the book.  Anne Bronte' was a woman before her time.  She was outspoken at a time when women were always to be quiet and dutiful no matter what their circumstances. <br /> <br />The video keeps to the meat of the story which is dark and mysterious.  The casting was top notch and the scene locations were wonderful as expected with a BBC production.  The video and the book are must for any media collection.
B00005UEAR|4.0|It must have been difficult for Dream Theater to create an album as masterful as Scenes From a Memory.  That is why this album is all over the place.  Easily Dream Theater's most experimental effort, this siamese release is a joy.  The first disc, comprised of five tracks (three of which break the 10-minute mark), is a musical expedition.  \\"The Glass Prison\\" is an aggressive assault that rarely backs down.  \\"Blind Faith\\" is slower and less intense, letting keyboardist Jordan Rudess churn out bursts of melody as the rest of the band accompanies.  \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"The Great Debate\\" are out-of-the-ordinary Dream Theater fanfare, providing newer sounds and political messages to an already eclectic musical style.  The last piece, \\"Disappear\\" is among the ominous and creepy variety, but lacks the power and density of, say, \\"Space-Dye Vest\\" to become a truly outstanding track.<br /><br />The second CD is the real gem of the album, the 42-minute concept title-piece, \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\".  Conveniently separated into eight separate tracks (or movements), the song is practically an album in and of itself.  \\"Overture\\" is Jordan Rudess at his best - the song will have listeners searching the booklet for the symphony credits.  The moods in this song change from a chase-scene to a carousel in a matter of seconds - brilliantly orchestrated.  \\"About to Crash\\" is a very memorable song, leading right into the album's aggressive veins, \\"War Inside My Head\\" and \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\".  Both songs are very reminiscent of Dream Theater's early chaotic pieces (\\"Erotomania\\" and \\"Ytse Jam\\" to name two).  The next tracks, \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" and \\"Solitary Shell\\", show off Dream Theater's prog influences, namely jazzy keyboards and guitars, more mellow melodies and upbeat rhythms.  The reprise and the final track, \\"Losing Time\\" bring the album to a clean close.<br /><br />Because of the album's experimental character (and possibly the intense pressure on the band to create another Scenes), it was not as widely accepted by fans.  As unfair as it sounds, precedents do count, and Scenes was quite the bar.  Despite this, Six Degrees is a great album for its creative merits and astounding production.  For any fan of progressive metal, this album is a must-have.<br /><br />See also: Dream Theater - Scenes From a Memory, Spock's Beard -V, Transatlantic  - SMPT:eScenes), it was not as widely accepted by fans.

B0002XDODU|4.0|Overall, I love this album. There is nothing really for me to add that hasn't been said. It. Effing. Rocks. <br /> <br />Now, here is my opinion on the song: Amerika <br />Much of the lyrics suggest that, insead of being copy-cats and bashing bush or the war the whole time, they are expressing discontent about the US in general. We are imposing and we are powerful. Even if we are not enemies, we are imposing our culture through business. Coka-cola and mcdonalds are taking over the world. We have less of problem with this commercialism because we don't have a prominent native culture to ruin. <br /> <br />Anyway: <br />At the worst ist's a political song, which are very popular right  now. <br />At the best it's a commentary on much more. <br />Enjoy it either way.
B00005JNEW|4.0|Friday night lights is a football movie filmed with a documentary spectrum, which sticks to the moral code of not tainting reality. The concept of the film is not to use a disney film style where the good team always wins(I hope I didn't give the ending away), but must instead kneel before the rules of reality. <br /> <br />True to this backdrop, the film is realistic, but this authenticity causes the movie to lose it's core , its central antagonists, its driving force. Shown like an ESPN documentary, thsi \\"movie\\" sometimes loses its edge. <br /> <br />However, the acting is superb, with Billy Bob Thortan and a cast of high schoool actors leading the march.  The movie was exciting, and dramatic to say the least. <br /> <br />Wathcing Friday Night Lights was enjoyable, and this truly is a good movie, but not a great movie.
B000002JPA|5.0|Having replaced Charlie Dominici with Californian James LaBrie, the American quintet released their sophomore album, their first major-label release.<br /><br />The album is light-years ahead of (and different from) their debut.  The band released singles (\\"Another Day\\" and \\"Pull Me Under\\"), made a very successful music video (\\"Pull Me Under\\") as well as distributed some creative control - \\"Wait for Sleep\\" was written entirely by keyboardist Kevin Moore, and the lyrics for the album's closing gem, \\"Learning to Live\\" were written by bassist John Myung.  Musically, the album is much cleaner and tugs at the extremes.  The heavy passages are much heavier, as exhibited in \\"Metropolis Pt 1\\", one of the album's twin apexes, a 9-minute behemoth of a song.  Without a single recurring melody and a meticulous command over melody and technical precision, the song goes beyond the realm of music and into art.  \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Surrounded\\" are shorter ballads in which the band lets LaBrie flaunt his delicate, crooning voice alongside Moore's piano (the saxophone in \\"Another Day\\" is an amazing touch).  \\"Pull Me Under\\" and \\"Under a Glass Moon\\" are both progressive drives, letting songwriter John Petrucci take his guitars into center-stage.  Moore's \\"Wait for Sleep\\" is a short piano-piece that leads right into \\"Learning to Live\\".  It is a melancholy lullaby; it has no guitars, no percussion, no distortion - just LaBrie and a piano, drifting downwards, making their way into our heads.<br /><br />And then, \\"Learning to Live\\" - my personal favorite Dream Theater song.  This song has everything: a spacey keyboard intro, odd-meter tempos, an acoustic interlude, an amazing keyboard/guitar solo - the song is a progressive crescendo.  Not a single musician is left without his moment in the sun.  This album is recognized by musicians and fans alike as a creation worth beholding.  It has been the band's most commercially successful album to date.<br /><br />Even today, no progressive metal band has matched the standard set by Dream Theater - and Images and Words ensures their stay on the throne.  No more needs to be said.<br /><br />See also: Dream Theater - Metropolis Pt 2: Scenes From a Memory, Dream Theater - Train of Thought, Liquid Tension Experiment - \\"LTE 2\\", Pain of Salvation - The Perfect Element Ie standard set by Dream Theater - and Images and Words ensures their stay on the throne.

B0002DKCMG|4.0|I missed this movie the first time around but, like American Pie, this is one of the few good movies in teen-sex-romp genre.  Like American Pie, it has a good heart and likes its characters.  Scott, the innocent boy-next-door, gets dumped by his girlfriend and goes to Europe with his friends to track down his hot German pen pal.  Of course, they get lost, travel all over Europe, get in a lot of trouble, and have a lot of fun.  The film takes potshots at almost every European stereotype but makes it all funny.  Given the raunchy subject-matter, I'd recommend getting the unrated edition of this film.
B0000584V3|5.0|With Stephen Wilson (Porcupine Tree) producing the Swedish quartet's next album, fans knew they were in for a treat - and they were absolutely right.  The album is very comparable to the band's previous effort, the stunning Still Life.  For starters, the first two tracks are the most phenomenal of the album.  \\"The Leper Affinity\\" is very like \\"The Moor\\", violent but melodic death-metal riffs, Åkerfeldt's rabid voice, rapid and incessant double-bass tempos and perfectly timed acoustic pauses of idyllic melody.  \\"Bleak\\" has choruses very reminiscent of \\"Godhead's Lament\\", with Åkerfeldt singing clean, high notes over raging guitars.  Much like Still Life's \\"Benighted\\", Blackwater Park offers \\"Harvest\\", an all-acoustic piece, perfect for winding down after the first two tracks' dual assault.  A fan-favorite however, is \\"The Drapery Falls\\", which combines the pristine sounds of \\"Harvest\\" with the rage of \\"The Leper Affinity\\" in a way that never seems awkward or forced.  Surprisingly enough, the album continues without losing any sense of originality and moves into \\"The Funeral Portrait\\", an incessantly brutal cut, whose sheer brutality makes even its acoustic passages sound violent.<br /><br />The album certainly showcases the growing variety of acoustic or \\"soft\\" passages in Opeth's repartee without succumbing to their dominance.  Like Still Life, however, when I arrive at the album's 12-minute closer, the title-track \\"Blackwater Park\\", I am exhausted.  The song offers no real substantial innovation, and therefore, I stop listening.  All in all, the album is astounding - Opeth have never sounded finer.<br /><br />See also: Opeth - Still Life, Opeth - Deliverance
B0000VAFO0|2.0|In the hands of truly imaginative people, this concept could've been a lot more fun.  Think of it Vampires versus Werewolves.  However, the biggest problem is that the filmmakers cared more about the look of the film than the story.  Specifically, the only thing this film seems to want to do is imitate The Matrix: they copy the art direction, the wardrobe, the cinematography - there are some shots that are exact duplicates.  Of all the Famous Monsters of Filmland, the werewolf is perhaps the most terrifying, but they keep getting ruined on film.  These wolves are too CGI to be really scary - and why to they need to walk on walls? <br /> <br />However, the movie is not a total train wreck.  There is enough non-stop action to pass a rainy afternoon in front of the TV.  It just could've been better. <br />
B000021XS0|5.0|The cryptic \\"Metropolis Pt 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper\\", the most complex song on Dream Theater's sophomore release, Images and Words, haunted fans for too long.  By popular demand, the American progressive juggernaut released their sixth studio album, their best to date in my opinion.  With their previous album being less progressive and more rock, fans did not know what to expect.  Fortunately, the album they were given was flawless in every respect - thematically, musically and creatively.  Centering around a man's confrontation with a past life, the album goes everywhere.<br /><br />The album's first two introductory pieces are alone worth the price of the CD.  It begins with a hypno-therapist and a soothing guitar line and continues with \\"Overture 1928\\", a 3-minute track that encompasses the album's most memorable melodies, all seamlessly integrated into one comprehensive instrumental piece.  \\"Strange Deja-Vu\\" continues where the overture left off and flaunts the band's strongest talents: James LaBrie's ability to play four different characters with vocal shifts and John Petrucci's technical command of the guitar.  As the album continues, the listener encounters some of the most aggressive Dream Theater melodies yet (\\"Fatal Tragedy\\" and the 11-minute \\"Beyond this Life\\", complete with Radiohead-esque melodies and retrospective keyboard moments), as well as the softest ballad (\\"Through Her Eyes\\", released as a single).<br /><br />The album hits yet another peak with the almost 13-minute beast, \\"Home\\", which never lets the energy down in its entire run.  \\"The Dance of Eternity\\", a 6-minute instrumental piece, makes all other Dream Theater instrumentals sound orderly and easy to follow.  It revels in its spontaneity and acts as a carousel of talent, cycling through each member, giving him several moments of grandeur.  The last three songs are a triumvirate of melody.  \\"One Last Time\\" recalls melodies from \\"Overture 1928\\" and contains the most memorable chorus of the album.  \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is a creative plateau for Dream Theater, complete with memorable acoustic guitars, a catchy chorus, and a gospel choir.<br /><br />The last song, \\"Finally Free\\" is, without a doubt, the most ominous and atmospheric song on the album.  In its first (of twelve) minutes, it undergoes several mood changes, all of which foreboding.  Thematically, it retells the entire story from a different perspective, adding new light to the storyline.  Musically, it recalls the chorus from \\"One Last Time\\" and several guitar-lines from \\"Overture 1928\\" to bring the album to a perfect, circular close.<br /><br />Few albums reach such musical and theatrical heights that they spawn a great interest in unlikely fans.  Scenes From a Memory, like Ayreon's The Human Equation is both metal and art - it has just as much appeal to the headbanger as the girl next door.  It is not a soft album by any standards, nor is it commercially accessible.  It is just a creative masterpiece, through and through.  The best metal album ever created.<br /><br />See also: Ayreon - The Human Equation, Dream Theater - Images and Words, Dream Theater - Awake, Dream Theater - Train of Thought\\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is a creative plateau for Dream Theater, complete with memorable acoustic guitars, a catchy chorus, and a gospel choir.

068987474X|4.0|I read the other reviews and it's interesting to me the way some of us critique the truth.  By no means does this book state married people are better.  I myself am going through a single period where I am constantly analyzing what I do and say to prospective people.  Given that the prospects are far and few between...I get too excited and then regret my phone calls.  I am convinced by friends someone likes me before I even realize it...sad.  I began reading and thought; wow, this is so harsh.  Then I thought, this is insane and I hate this book.  I hate this book because it's true.  I am a strong willed person, intellectual and well read in some circles.  I am everyone's rock but my own.  I hand out the advice this book is giving and it was a slap in the face to me.  How could I let myself get this caught up in one person?  Read this book for the harsh truth. If nothing else this book will make you notice how silly the \\"chirping\\" about why he hasn't called and does he really like me, you and your friends carry on about.  My mother bought me this book and it is the best thing she ever got me.
B00006SFBD|4.0|Opeth's previous release, Blackwater Park, was showing signs of a greater presence of acoustic interludes or movements in Opeth's razor-sharp death-metal.  It might have been logical to assume that their next album would be predominantly acoustic.  Wrong.  The band surprised fans with the release of their sixth studio album, Deliverance, their most numbingly intense effort to date.  With five tracks over 10 minutes, all of which define the meaning of the word \\"harsh\\", fans were treated to a devilish mix of progressive death-metal.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Wreath\\", Opeth's most intense song, clocking in at an uncompromisingly brutal 11 minutes.  Not once does it lower the intensity, not once does it permit the listener to take a breath.  The title-track comes in second on the intensity scale with only one (very brief) softer passage that occurs towards the beginning and is never felt again.  With endless twists and turns, the song is a favorite live.  \\"A Fair Judgment\\" showcases Opeth's fifth instrument, the piano/keyboard - no doubt an innovation brought by producer Stephen Wilson (of Porcupine Tree, who also produced Blackwater Park and Damnation).  The song is equal parts heavenly and guttural, providing a catchy chorus with subsequent Opeth metal.  Only the whimsical piano line of \\"For Absent Friends\\" separates the rest of the album from the relentless force of \\"Master's Apprentices\\" and \\"By the Pain I See In Others\\".  Despite the album's intensity, it is never short of melodic.  I believe strongly in the importance of melody when regarding songwriting and Deliverance is one of my favorite releases.  No doubt \\"Wreath\\" is a difficult piece to digest upon the first listen, but something always kept me listening.  Be it the winding guitars or the passion with which the songs are delivered, I kept listening.  Deliverance is a feat, and I became a fan.<br /><br />See also: Opeth - Still Life, Opeth - Blackwater Park
B000189WO6|5.0|The album wasn't something I got into immediately. In fact, the first time I heard what I now find to be the best song on the album, I hated it. It's the kind of album that you've got to listen to several times before you actually like it enough to by it (which means you should probably borrow it first). Don't feel too bad if you never grow into them, though, because it seems they aren't one of those bands that are \\"just okay\\".<br /><br />The lyrics are oddly enticing. They hint at the band's insights, perhaps beginning to divulge some sort of message, but then keep things private,  not defining anything for sure.  Between the songs there is no noticeable pause, adding to the flow of the album, which is especially amazing. The songs by themselves are incredible enough, but the album as a whole is miraculous in the way it ties into itself and just runs through, sometimes making it hard to tell when one song ends and another begins, but never sounding like a previous song.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Just when fans thought Opeth had surprised them enough with the raw power of 2002's Deliverance, Mikael Åkerfeldt and company release their seventh studio album, the all-acoustic, all-clean Damnation.  The shift was astounding - few bands had ever attempted such a radical shift in sound (Ulver, Amorphis and - dare I say it - Metallica come to mind).  Despite this polar change, fans embraced the album's sound because it worked.  Opeth's previous albums had been known to have all-acoustic instrumental passages in between restless death-metal beasts.  Damnation was like all of those songs with lyrics put into one album.  With Åkerfeldt's soft, clean voice, the songs became instant masterpieces.<br /><br />\\"Windowpane\\" is the best song on the album, with dark, emotional melodies accompanying clean vocals and jazzy solos.  \\"In My Time of Need\\" is equally morose, with disturbing guitars.  Even seemingly uplifting songs like \\"Hope Leaves\\" are saddening, desperate and emotionally crippling.  Now that we can finally understand what Åkerfeldt has been saying this whole time, the words come alive beautifully.  Even though the distortion and screaming are both gone, the album's clean guitars bring out a darker landscape, and in turn, a more intense and profound album is created, darker than anything the band has attempted before.  The subtlety of the album is tremendous - everything from the raised pitch in \\"Closure\\"'s guitar solo, to the organs in the instrumental \\"Ending Credits\\" has a harrowing intensity that is never reached in the band's trademark 10-minute epics.  Nor is the album out of character; the music blends perfectly with Opeth's heavier material (especially live).  Without a single awkward moment on the album, Opeth have delivered a true doom-laden masterpiece.  Where the band goes from here, one can never tell.<br /><br />See also: Opeth - Blackwater Park, Pain of Salvation - 12:5
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This is one of the films that you either love or loathe. I can think of a handful of my favourite films like this.  <br />Van Helsing is by far the most addictive of late for me. Dracula, as many know, is some what alluring. Richard gets 10/5 for his amazing performance. Van Helsing and Anna are nicely acted. And carla is just like a laughable lovable teddy. What more can I say? It has humour, sex appeal, Horrors, vampires and action. What makes a great vamp flick. <br /> <br />But this isn't for everyone by far. I would say that only 12 up should watch this even with parents... <br />For people up to date with horror fiction, will be delighted to see familair characters such as Dr Hyde [used in a way that he could be considered Hunch back of N.D. too], Dracula, Frankestein and the Warewolf. Along with the hunch back assistant. What more do you really want people?
B000002R48|5.0|While the 70's and 80's saw rise to bands such as Aerosmith, Metallica and Queensrÿche and the 90's gave grunge and punk the green light into stardom, progressive metal was relatively unknown and quiet.  However, the genre was slowly stirring a fantastic brew with the likes of Fates Warning, Rush and Yes.  When Dream Theater broke out in 1989 with their debut, it seemed that everything had come together.  Introspective lyrics, technically-demanding guitars, remarkable drumming, and keyboards that didn't make the band \\"sound 80's\\" gave Dream Theater a sound (and a fanbase) all their own - even though some say they sounded remarkably like Queensrÿche.  While they wouldn't hit their creative peak until much later (and many, many times), the band showed to the world that they were capable of many musical feats.<br /><br />Songs like \\"The Killing Hand\\" and \\"Only a Matter of Time\\" are a delicate balance between progressive movements and hard-rock verses.  \\"Ytse Jam\\" is one of many Dream Theater instrumental pieces, amorphous and spontaneous - impossible to understand or follow upon the first listen.  Despite it's pseudo-revolutionary character, the album is far from perfect.  The production is not as crystal clear as it would be on their second album, Images and Words.  Lead singer, Charlie Dominici's voice sounds echoed, as if in the distance, which makes the album's other instruments stand out a bit more.  Dominici would later be replaced by current frontman James LaBrie.<br /><br />Finally, the album does not have the current Dream Theater characteristic of having purely individual and instantly recognizable songs.  Some, namely \\"Light Fuse and Get Away\\", \\"Status Seeker\\", and \\"Afterlife\\" add little to the mix except more licks and riffs.  This would ultimately change with their second earth-shattering release.  For any Dream Theater fan, this album is essential - the first stone cast.<br /><br />See also: Dream Theater - Images and Words, Mayadome - Near Life Experience, Pain of Salvation - The Perfect Element I, Redemption - RedemptionExperience, Pain of Salvation - The Perfect Element I, Redemption - Redemption <br />
B00005KHJV|5.0|This film is one of the most sensational horror movies ever made. John Carpenter crafted one of the most shocking, entertaining horror films of all time when he introduced Halloween in 1978. This movie brought out a star actress in Jamie Lee Curtis as well as a terrifying, shocking story that never developed further with the many follow ups.<br /><br />By far the best in the Halloween catalog, Michael Myers is one of the great killers from an ultimate classic in the field of slasher movies.<br /><br />Recommended to anyone who loves horror films.
B00008AWOG|4.0|Having solidified the band into the quartet it is today (with Martin L&oacute;pez on drums and Martin M&eacute;ndez on bass), Opeth releases Still Life, a 7-track beast of a release, igniting the metal scene.  The album's production is as crisp as it was on their previous release, the relentless and untimely My Arms, Your Hearse, but with the song structures of Morningrise and a newfound creativity.<br /><br />The opening track, the 11-minute \\"The Moor\\" is one of the best songs on the Opeth catalog, rivaled only by a few.  It alone is worth the price of th album.  After the eerie introduction, it kicks into a folksy acoustic melody (which, of course, does not last very long before it is pummeled by the album's first progressive death-riff).  The choruses are separated by a passage of acoustic guitars and Mikael Åkerfeldt's soft voice (mainly \\"ooo\\"s).  \\"Godhead's Lament\\" is another sonic behemoth, showcasing harmonizing and melodic guitars with Åkerfeldt's dynamic voice.  \\"Benighted\\" is a brief all-acoustic piece - a much-needed rest after the 20+ minute death-metal attack.  The album, much like any heavy Opeth album, is a bit downhill afterwards.<br /><br />The sound gets a bit repetitive and difficult to digest, so with every song, less seems innovative.  \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\" is saved by memorable riffs, while \\"Face of Melinda\\" and \\"White Cluster\\" seem to lose their shine very quickly since neither offer any dramatic changes from the first two stunning tracks.  As death-metal songs they are laudable, but sadly the band decided to place their best songs at the album's beginning.  Despite the lackluster finishing track(s), Still Life is a great album for its first four tracks and musical progressions.<br /><br />See also: Opeth - Blackwater Park, Opeth - Deliverance
0515123447|1.0|I picked up this book based on the reviews here on Amazon, and I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />To be honest, I'm surprised at the good reviews that this book has received.  I'll admit, the first chapter of the book, I was prepared to be sucked in.  But, the plot and details in the book were so poorly done, that the positive first impression I had quickly evaporated.<br /><br />The main character is laughably unrealistic, and it's obvious that the author was not in the military, and made no effort at research or proofreading (note to Lee Child: it's .22 \\"caliber\\", not \\"gauge\\"; corporals are ncos, and wouldn't do an officer's laundry; MPs are not \\"elite soldiers expected to take down green berets, etc\\"; MPs are analogous to \\"patrol cops\\" in the army.  Reacher would more realistically be CID if he's investigating; etc.).  Also, there's a point in the book where Reacher puts his pistol and ammunition in an oven to dry.  I'm not going to even bother pointing out why this is a bad idea, especially considering Reacher's \\"military expertise\\".<br /><br />The plot is similarly full of holes, and the key point of suspense _still_ makes no sense (the \\"sunday deadline\\").<br /><br />In short, rather than waste more time with this book pointing out everything the author got wrong, I'll just say to prospective readers that for \\"brain candy thrillers\\", there are so many examples out there that do a better job, why waste your time?<br /><br />Pick up a De Mille, a Cornwell, etc, or better yet, a Westlake, a  n Ian Rankin, a Robert B. Parker ( for something more than brain candy)
B000085RTZ|5.0|The American power-metal quartet has onace again taken the genre by storm with their new release, Epica, a concept album based on Goethe's Faust.  Incorporating real strings and horns into a fast and melodic effort, the band forges a 16-track masterpiece with various guest musicians and choirs.  This album showcases the raw talent of the band, channeling the same musical brilliance that brought us The Fourth Legacy and Karma.<br /><br />Save only two acoustic/symphonic songs (\\"The Coldest Winter Night\\" and the beautifully orchestrated medieval piece, \\"Helena's Theme\\") the album is mostly power-metal, without a single forgettable tune.  Every song from the spectacular \\"Center of the Universe\\" to the whimsical and powerful \\"The Mourning After\\" has unique riffs and melodies that, unlike many power-metal bands, exist only in their own songs (although the Interludes, which are their own tracks, can be discarded).  The heavy ballad, \\"Wander\\" is charged with emotion, as is the album's closer, \\"III Ways to Epica\\", whose chorus is a delightful \\"duel\\" of voices between male and female vocals.<br /><br />The beauty of the album lies everywhere, but most prominently in the band's attention to detail.  A well-crafted chorus is great, but a symphonic dance-passage followed by descending guitar-line over corresponding horns is astounding (as is the case in \\"A Feast for the Vain\\").  The theatrical effect of the album is additionally terrific: spoken word, recreated scenes and characters help add another dynamic to the album.  The album is superb; one of the best power-metal releases to date.  Everything is there, from rapid, double-bass rhythms, to a full orchestra and a surprise guitar solo from the legendary Luca Turilli (Rhapsody).  As far as modern power-metal goes, Epica has few rivals and no equal.<br /><br />See also: Kamelot - The Fourth Legacy, Aina - Days of Rising Doom
0143034448|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.  <br /> <br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her.

B00009W8N2|4.0|Out of nowhere, this Swedish outfit fronted by Mikael Åkerfeldt released their first major-label album in 1994.  Even today it is a difficult album to digest - it must have rained upon the metal scene at the time of its release.  With absolutely brutal songs clocking in at 10+ minutes with short, instrumental pieces to separate the rage, Opeth had established themselves as a force to be reckoned with.  To further emphasize their originality, songs such as the 14-minute \\"In Mist She Was Standing\\" never stay with a melody for more than a minute.  The dual-guitar progressive movements that wind their way throughout the total duration of the album set Opeth apart from many bands entering (and already in) the death-metal scene.  Orchid should be appreciated for its ground-breaking style, even though the album can get very tiring.  Songs such as \\"Forest of October\\" fit well in the album musically, but has little separating it from the other songs.  This is Opeth's flaw, both in this album and in albums to come.  For fans of the genre and of the band, this album is essential.<br /><br />See also: Opeth - Morningrise, Vanitas - Das Leben ein Traum

B0000CDLA7|5.0|After intense touring and some fan backlash (those who couldn't ingest the maturity of Six Degrees most likely), Dream Theater released their eighth studio album, Train of Thought in late 2003.  Packaged in black and white with artistic photos, the album is much more straightforward than their previous release, and certainly much more intense.<br /><br />With seven tracks, only two of which clock in under 10 minutes, I decided that they weren't messing around this time.  The result is a sonic behemoth; inexplicably fast guitars, head-splitting drums, and violent keyboards.  Even James LaBrie seems to be screaming at times, no longer the angelic voice he has shown us in previous albums.<br /><br />Each song is a musical portrait of aggression, from the self-liberating anthemic \\"As I Am\\" to \\"This Dying Soul\\", the desperate continuation of \\"The Glass Prison\\".  The album has no bad songs at all.  \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" is equal parts metal and progressive, with a keyboard \\"solo\\" that can only be described as silverware falling from the top shelf of a cupboard.  \\"Honor Thy Father\\" is an ominous and rapid onslaught, perfect for the angry metalhead (or the neglected child).  By now, the album has lasted over forty minutes.<br /><br />This is where we get our rest: \\"Vacant\\", a 3-minute piano/cello piece that serves as an introduction to what is arguably the best track on the album, the 11-minute instrumental \\"Stream of Consciousness\\".  Unlike Dream Theater's staple instrumental pieces, this song is much more coherent and fluid, with defined movements and recurring melodies (neither of which defined previous album's instrumental songs).  Finally, the 14-minute closer, \\"In the Name of God\\" brings together all of the previous songs' standout characteristics to end the album on an aggressive (yet melodic) note.<br /><br />Having won over critics, the album (like its predecessor) has had mixed results with fans.  Some say it is an amazing advance in their career, while others consider the album \\"n&uuml;-metal\\", a term attached to newer, younger hard-rock bands.  Unfortunately for such criticisms, I cannot think of a single n&uuml;-metal band that reaches the technical heights or matches the boundless creativity of this progressive quintet.  Train of Thought is not nearly as genre-bending as Six Degrees, but it is, without a doubt, an apt step forward for a band that turns heads with every release.<br /><br />See also: Dream Theater - Awake, Dream Theater - Images and Words, Dream Theater - Scenes From a Memory, a term attached to newer, younger hard-rock bands.

006054094X|1.0|If you believe that little green men from outer space built Stonehenge or the Nazca lines in Peru, this is the book you want to read. Don't get me wrong.  I like books that shake and rattle the academic establishment -- but you gotta be at least moderately credible and get most of your facts right.  Menzies fails on both counts, although he's pretty good at covering up his astounding claims with a patina of scientific language.      Menzies thesis is that the Chinese sailed around the world in 1421 and on side jaunts discovered Antarctica, the North Pole, circumnavigated Greenland (!!), and left colonies all over the Americas including building stone towers near Boston.  Moreover, the Chinese sailed around the world in only a couple of years.  Oddly, the Chinese seem to have missed Europe where their visit would surely have been remembered and recorded.      As in all good cons, there's a grain of truth in Menzies.  The Chinese undertook some serious sea expeditions in the 1400s, exploring the East African coast as far south as Mozambique and probably touching on the northern coast of Australia.  It's conceivable that at some point in their long history the Chinese -- purposely or by accident -- may have reached the northwest Coast of North America -- as it is equally plausible that American Indians may have reached out toward Asia. Read \\"Kon Tiki.\\"        Despite a kernel of fact, most of Menzies' book is a mountain of nonsense.  To take just one claim, Menzies has the Chinese circumnavigating ice-bound Greenland, explaining that this was possible because of a warmer climate in those days.  Au contraire, Gavin.  As every geographer knows, the period from about 1400 to 1700 is known as the \\"Little Ice Age\\"  and temperatures were significantly colder than they are today.  Greenland was not circumnavigatable by sea in 1421; rather the Norse colonies in Greenland were dying out because of the miserable weather.  The first non-motorized circumnavigation of Greenland took place in 2001, and it was accomplished by dogsled and kayak, not a 15th century Chinese junk.               Many, many other examples of silliness are found in the book. Suffice it to say that this book should be marketed in the fantasy section of your local book store.      Smallchief
B000002C1W|3.0|I hear that David Gilmour was forced to shop these tunes all over the world for different songwriters to tighten up the songs. Maybe he did maybe not. It does, however, sorely need the touch of Roger Waters (lyrics) to send it over the top. It's Worth a listen, but not a great Floyd album. Gilmour's melodies a fine in spots (Learning....) and at other times are really very good (On the Turning....., but one-half of Pink Floyd's sound was the desperate vocals and lyrics of Waters. Without them the Pink Floyd sound is just not complete. It's interesting that the Roger Waters solo stuff sounds more like Pink Floyd than Pink Floyd sounds without him. It wouldn't surprise me that a record company would force Gilmour to make his songs sound more \\"Floyd\\" because that equals record sales and tour sellouts. It does surprise me that Gilmour wouldn't just rather take his songs and record under his own name and carve out a post Pink Floyd career on his own merits, because  what I hear in the post Waters Pink Floyd is a solo Gilmour project trying to capture the sound of vintage Pink Floyd.
B00003CWL6|5.0|As Human Beings we are not perfect ,we have our Desires and Fantasy's good and bad ,in this Movie  ,a man facing the possiblity of a lifetime of Mediocraty reaches the point of self destruction ,but Lester is such a likeable guy that it almost seems permissible what is going on in his world and the way he is conducting his affairs ..When he reaches the desired position with the young lady, that Primal urge to procreate that lies (sometimes dormant depending on who you are with)in all men, LESTER  realises to his total disappointment that he cannot bring himself to do it (apart from the fact it;s statutory RAPE), <br />the innocence of her is Beautiful and his reaction is reassuring that in the Madness there is some sanity ,the Dichotomy is he wants to relive his youth when life was not so complexed and she wants to be a Adult and see's Sex as the prerequisite ...the Scene is Awesome and thats just one of the Amazing sensuous points of this Incredible Movie .. the Plastic bag scene which is so eloquently explained by a previous reviewer, is a ONE OF A KIND...that brought out feelings in me that were overwhelming .
B00004SCX6|3.0|Let me start this review off with the honest truth:  I'm not a Britney Spears fan.  I was around the time this CD was released, but I'm not anymore.  Britney fans will probably vote that this review isn't helpful for that statement, but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that she's my idol or something.  Anyway, this is a good album.  I know I use that undescriptive word a lot, \\"good\\", but it's the only way I can describe something that isn't bad, but isn't fantastic, either.  There are some catchy, fun-to-dance-to songs on this album, but there are also the ones that can only bring an eye-roll.  Here is how I rate each song: <br /> <br />1.  Oops...I Did It Again-5/5.  Catchy, and upbeat, it's no wonder that this is the title track.  It's easy to forget about this song because I've listened to it so many times, but then when I hear it I can't help wanting to sing along.   <br /> <br />2. Stronger-4/5.  The same as the last track, though not quite as good.  When I say \\"The same\\", I mean that the lyrics are catchy, and it's easy to belt out the words along with Britney.   <br /> <br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door-4/5.  Not as fun to dance to as the last two, but still fun to sing to.  It's the never-missing tell-off song! <br /> <br />4. I Can't Get No Satisfaction-3/5.  I never heard the original version of this song, but I think Britney's version is okay.  It's not my favorite song on this album, but it's not bad.  The only problem I have with it is the double \\"Oh My God\\" at the beginning (I think it's at the end of \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\").    <br /> <br />5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know-3/5.  Just barely a 3.  It's a ballad, and not really all THAT interesting.  If you're just hangin' in your room or something it's okay, but if you're looking to dance or are in the mood to sing, it's not that great. <br /> <br />6. What U See (Is What U Get)-4/5.  Upbeat, catchy, fun to dance to, much like \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\".   <br /> <br />7. Lucky-5/5.  Very catchy, and upbeat but almost calming.  It's the truth!  Being a celebrity isn't all it's cracked up to be.  The only problem I have with it is the \\"Oh my God\\" in the middle of the song.  Some may laugh at that, but that's just how I feel. <br /> <br />8. One Kiss From You-3/5.  Fluffy pop, almost a 2.  It's just one of those songs that you feel like it's on there to fill up space. <br /> <br />9. Where Are You Now-3/5.  Better then the last one, but not my favorite song.  It reminds me of a song on her first album, but I can't quite put my finger on which one.  Another ballad. <br /> <br />10. Can't Make You Love Me-4/5.  Similar sounding to \\"Stronger\\".  It is upbeat and fun to dance to. <br /> <br />11. When Your Eyes Say It-2/5.  Boring.  Not that interesting or really even touchingly romantic. <br /> <br />12. Dear Diary-2/5.  Not fun to sing to, or dance to, considering that it's a ballad.  The lyrics are a little bit cheap, and the song is short. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, nice work, Britney.  You have to take the good songs with the bad.  I think this album is a little better then her last one, and I wish she could have continued to progress like this.  I think that over time she has lost a chunk of her fans, but it was her decision to dress in clothes that look like they've been snipped with scissors and act like she has no morals.  Even in this album you can tell that she's changed since her debut.  If you like pop music, I recommend this album to you.  But I think you should listen to clips of the songs here on Amazon before purchasing this album, just to make sure it's your type of music.  I averaged how I rated each song, and I got 3 remainder 30.  So 3 stars it is!
0375701427|5.0|Novels don't usually come with disclaimers but you could make the case for one here. I suppose it might read as follows:  <br /> <br />Note: The following novel expresses the belief that man has no shelter from suffering and living the perfect life will not deliver you from evil. There is no inevitable grace.  <br /> <br />Roth debunks images and leads you farther and farther into a world where beauty cannot shelter a person from a pervasive ugliness that drifts all over the globe. Even little New Jersey towns with quaint names like \\"Old Rimrock\\" where cattle graze and houses from the Revolutionary War sit among fertile fields are not immune. Somehow, amidst this American Pastoral, a \\"gentile Jew\\" cannot find his paradise even if it is far away from the sweaty streets of Newark where he grew up within site of factories and cluttered neighborhoods where all the non-Wasps lived. Yes, \\"Swede\\" Levov was the hope of his generation of Newark Jews because he looked (and acted) like one of the Wasps (and did so effortlessly). And this \\"gift\\" was supposed to guarantee him happiness (happiness meant being more than you were when you were born). Here we have the ultimate myth: This is America! Shed your skin and no longer be ugly, unlikeable or poor and wanting. When you really \\"make it\\" you somehow become immune to all of the indecorousness that is the life of most people. You could become one of Horatio Alger's self-made and nevermore worry about your worth or status (the insecurity of most, especially the minority). And where else but America is there such privilege and you too can be privileged, never to suffer the way the rest of the world suffers?  <br /> <br />But no, not here. Not anymore, anyway. There is plenty of suffering in the \\"American berserk\\" to derail all of the good-willed fantasies of all of the smart and hardworking and handsome Americans out there. The lesson here is that no one is safe (anymore?) from the dangers that lurk in the nethers. Are those evilswrought by the devil aiming to destroy man? Or are they simply absurdities on the loose, with no more concern for their victims than the asteroid for the planet it meets? That is for you to decide, but Roth certainly offers his opinion. <br /> <br />A fascinating book.
B000002JPA|5.0|At least, that's what my friend and I have to say about this awesome prog-metal quintet. Their sophomore effort, 1992's 'Images and Words,' is their breakthough record, and many consider it their best. From what I can tell, that's certainly the case. There are so many positive aspects to this record. For one thing, John Petrucci is one of my favorite neo-classical shredders, in the leagues of the mighty Yngwie Malmsteen. The parts on this record are all played so well, it's hard for any prog-metal band to be as talented, whether it be King's X, Fates Warning, or Andromeda, all of which are talented prog-metal crews, but bear nothing on DT.<br /><br />I also feel that this record was truly quite gutsy. Their 1989 debut, 'When Dream And Day Unite,' was much more of a straight-to-the-point, consitently-staying-at-one-time-signature type of album (from what I have read.) This, on the other hand, is the album where the band changed their ways and decided, \\"let's change the time signature every time a listener won't expect it.\\" This worked well, particularly on \\"Take The Time.\\" And then, they decided, \\"hey, let's dare to use a soprano sax on one of our ballads.\\" And they did this on \\"Another Day,\\" and succeeded. Basically, this album is all around perfect. Highly recommended for fans of Petrucci, Dream Theater, prog-metal, or prog-rock.

0441003257|4.0|Good Omens is mostly terrific for its details. Whether it is the tapes which all turn into The Greatest Hits of Queen if you leave them in the car for too long or whether it is the continuing discussion about the nature of the word \\"nice\\", the book is full of sharp moments that make you laugh. Gaiman and Pratchett clearly have a great deal of fun with this book. The fun is infectous and the reader cannot help but share in the joke.<br /><br />Good Omens is laced with a thoroughly unobjectionable moral about tolerance and balance. I would recommend it as a great gift for a teenage reader (paired with the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, perhaps?). Any readers interested in satire or fantasy should find it an engaging use of time.<br /><br />Be aware, Good Omens is significantly different from the other works of either author (particularly Gaiman). Pick up either the Sandman graphic novels or Discworld if you want something in a style more representative of the authors.
B00005Y7KX|5.0|Well... this musical is fantastic!!! it is sensual, great. When I bought this DVD, it was seen million of times...

B00003CXCT|2.0|Ok, wow, I just finished watching my brand new set of DVDs.  I was horrified to see the Anakin change in Jedi, but after a little while, I realize it's not the end of the world.  All I really wanted was to see the deleted/altered scenes.  They could have squeezed them in anywhere.  I hate the 1997 ending of Jedi and I really wish they had taken out the Jabba/Han scene because Jabba looks so fake.  All I wanted was to see the original ending because it's virtually impossible to find these days.  Though I will treasure my new dvds, they could have been so much more than they were.  If you are a true Star Wars fan, I would reccommend renting these and waiting a year till Lucasfilm gets it right and releases either the original movies to dvds or a set of dvds that allows you to watch the beloved scenes from the original movies that have been hacked to pieces with \\"better technology.\\"
020161622X|2.0|The Pragmatic Programmer is a book that describes a no non-sense approach to programming. The book covers a lot of ground, from work philosophy, to coding practices to testing to project management. The book offers good advice. The style is engaging. However I am still very disappointed by the book. Why? I found that most topics are better dealt with in other books and chapters are often too short to really do justice to the topics. For example, work philosophy is better handled in 'Please Don't Just Do What I Tell You, Do What Needs to Be Done', coding and testing are much better handled in 'Code Complete', patterns by the gang of four.  <br />The Pragmatic Programmer is a nice book for starting programmers or for a fun read. But the return on investment is very low for a professional programmer.
078681859X|5.0|When 12-year-old Nathaniel(cough, nice name) is humiliated in public by pompous Simon Lovelace, he is determined to have revenge. Nathaniel summons Bartimaeus, a 5,000 year old djinni with a pulsing hatred for magicians, to steal the Amulet of Samarkand from Lovelace. However, the Amulet turns out to worth much more than it seems, and because of it, Bartimaeus ends up in government prison, Nathaniel's (fusturatingly stubborn/narrow-minded)master and his (much nicer)wife, Mr and Mrs Underwood, die a firey and unpleasant death when Lovelace is tipped off about the Amulet's whereabouts. When Nathaniel learns what Lovelace intends to do with the Amulet, he has no choice but to travel to Heddleham Hall with Bartimaeus in hopes of revealing his scheme...<br /><br />Crafty and downright hilarious, 'The Amulet of Samarkand' is a must-read for anyone who enjoys fantasy plot-twisters.<br /><br />Reading things from Barimaeus' point of view is nice, and his comidical footnotes makes the story more bearable despite Nathaniel's show-off prig of a personality(I am not saying that Nathaniel is all bad). In my book, 'The Amulet' deserves a lot more than five stars.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I think movies have been steadily getting worse overall for the last couple of years.  It seems like Hollywood must think that the public is so dumb that they'll go see anything with a big budget and lots of special effects.  They forgot about having a decent story on this one.  It's not the actors fault; I love Kate Beckinsale, Hugh is good as Wolverine, and the Dracula guy is actually pretty cool, but the plot sucks.  I saw this at a matinee and still felt like I wasted my money.  Don't buy this, rent it if you must.
B0002KVUKW|1.0|I loved some of the humor in this movie, even though from all outward appearances (previews, etc.), it seemed to me they were trying to make a serious movie.  I thought Kate and Hugh played their parts well, as did their Friar friend.  BUT, the movie bordered on unwatchable for the most part.    The beginning was so corny and campy that I immediately wanted to give up watching it.  Every part of the film that contains Dracula is poorly acted and murderous to sit through.    Some of the special effects were spectacular, and some were so poorly executed that it made me wonder if I was watching the same film from 5 minutes before.    The movie skitters about with no real purpose.  A mishmash of characters are thrown in to try and keep things interesting, and it succeeds about half the time.  I fell asleep trying to finish the last 10 minutes of the movie, and don't plan to re-watch.  I was really hoping it would live up to the previews.  I had high hopes for this movie.
B000002HMH|1.0|192 copies of this stinkfest for sale on this site alone as I write this. Does that tell you anything? If it's such a great album why are people trying to give it away? I have read some of the other reviews, some saying \\"Who wants to hear a band stay with the same style album after album?\\" Well, their fans, that's who. Why would a fan of speed metal want to hear a Perry Como record? How many Beyonce fans would enjoy her if she began singing arias? <br />The Black Album was bad, but this is horrific. Maybe 2 listenable songs here. No wonder Metallica were so dead set against napster, they knew no one would buy their crappy albums when they can download the 2 decent ones for free. As of this writing, they have not corrected themselves. And their decline is continuing to this day. Wake up Metalliputz and deliver the goods. Leave the orchestra to Johnny Mathis. (Given 1 star because the system won't allow less)
0767821769|1.0|Predictible, sob-story melodrama with a girlfriend agenda to boot! I'm surprised that Sarandon went anywhere near this, it's such a boring Hollywood take on the mom vs. younger girlfriend scenerio. Should be understood that this screenplay was originally written by real-life stepmom Gigi Levangie. I think Gigi had an agenda to push. For once I'd like to see Hollywood come out with a film that sings the praises of original moms, not younger-model girlfriends, and makes these original moms the attractive, healthy, mentally-sound very cool and sexy women they often are in real life. Let's give them the happy ending--they make the world go round! If you like soap opera drama-rama or you're a younger stepmom/girlfriend who wants justification and wants to demean the original mom/wife (I'm not an original mom or first wife, BTW, just an annoyed viewer), you'll think this is a great film. Otherwise, this is one to skip.

0375501851|5.0|After seeing the PBS movie for \\"White Teeth\\" I absolutely had to find the author of the book and buy it. How such a story could come about with irony and humor galore was enough to spark my interests and find this book to have and read.
B000003TA4|1.0|[...] I will go ahead and say that Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" cd obviously rocks and is one of the greatest rock cd's of all time.  The only problem I have with Nirvana is the fact that they didn't age well.  Please god, all radio stations stop playing Nirvana!!!  When I first listened to Nevermind Kurt Kobain's voice sounded good but now, ten years later it sounds like  a dying animal.  I'm still a 90's rock fan (Alice in Chains, Candlebox, Stp, Tool) but Nirvana simply did not age like a fine wine like these other bands did.  I'm not saying they weren't good but please in the 21st century NO MORE NIRVANA!!!  by the way the one star rating was just to get your attention, this cd obviously doesn't deserve anyting less than 5
B00028HBKM|5.0|I find it sad that reviewers such as \\"A Kid's Review\\" (only one of quite a few) found it necessary to use personal attacks as a way of conveying their lack of spiritual understanding of or enthusiasm for the film.  (Saying over and over again that they wish Mel had made another Mad Max film only shows they did not have the ability or desire to consider what the film was about.  You probably should not have seen it since you are clearly unable to grasp the truth of His message.) <br /> <br />That said, I will not lower myself again to the same level as other reviewers who attack differing personal spiritual views as a means to criticize the film - I can only suppose it is because they are threatened by the message.  If you didn't like the film, say why you didn't like the film. Don't call people who DID find the film a profoundly moving experience idiots because you can't understand our faith.  It is only demonstrating your own ignorance to do so.  If you choose not to believe that Jesus was who he was portrayed as in \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" and in the Bible, that is your opinion and you are welcome to it.  But save the intellectual drivel about how anyone who does believe is deluded and cannot think for themselves.  Learn to read and research and you might be surprised at what you learn.  And - By the way - I am a Christian (NOT Catholic) who was brought up Unitarian.  I know how to read and think for myself!  I'm not being blindly lead.  Free will is a basic point of Faith.  I use my free will to believe.  You use yours to ridicule.  I'm sad for you. <br /> <br />In terms of visual message, this film was spectacular.  The cinematography is amazing.  It truly conveys the anguish most involved experienced - not just Jesus and his followers.  For those who claim that His message is missed in the film, I call your attention to the last moments on the Cross when the other men there had the chance to choose their path - the redemption one received while the other continued to ridicule.  That is the bottom line message - the redemption and forgiveness that is available to all. <br /> <br />I have seen many reviews that criticize Mel for making it too violent.  I find this ironic.  Have you watched the violence out there on film, in video games, even on TV?  I certainly have plenty of it in my film library.  Our culture has become immune to it.  I expect that had the violence not been portrayed so graphically the film would have lost substantial impact.  That said, it was the most difficult film I have ever watched and I cried throughout the film in the theater, but I purchased the DVD.  I will watch it again when I feel I need to be reminded of the sacrifice that was made on the behalf of all who believe - and all who do not. <br /> <br />
B000002UAO|5.0|1965 <br />Rubber Soul was the album that started it all.  It was the album that marked the Beatles going from pop stars, to true music geniuses, beginning the revolutionizing of rock music.  1965 was a busy year for the Beatles; they had tours, T.V. shows, songs to record, and also, the movie Help.  But not even all this would stop the fab four (who would soon be growing out of their \\"fab\\" image) from creating one of the greatest albums ever.   <br /> <br />Even the untrained ear can tell that Rubber Soul is different that Beatles' albums that came before it (that is, if their ear has been trained enough to listen to those).  The album is much darker and not nearly as upbeat as the 5 previous ones.  The drugs were influencing this change along with, maybe even more so, Bob Dylan.  Around this time Dylan began having a large effect on the Beatles, especially after they met him, when he introduced them to marijuana.  But Dylan was more than just about drugs to the Beatles.  His songwriting made a long-lasting and important impression on them.  The other famous thing about Rubber Soul is the sitar played by George Harrison, on \\"Norwegian Wood\\".  Although Harrison would have so many other great accomplishments after Rubber Soul, the sitar has become one of his most famous contributions to rock music.  This began the Beatles exploration of new sounds to apply to their already masterful works.   <br /> <br />However, nobody would care about any of these things if the music wasn't great, which it definitely is.  When I'm listening to this album, I tend to see John as the standout songwriter.  After listening to Rubber Soul, it's pretty easy to see why, as he pens \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"In My Life\\".  The sophisticated melodies and more introspective lyrics mark a turning point and a great development in Lennon's songwriting, to accompany the Beatles changing style.  Paul is sure to make an impact as well.  Many people consider \\"Michelle\\", a romantic ballad that he has become famous for, to be his best track on the album.  It even won one of the Beatles few Grammy awards.  McCartney also writes the opening rocker \\"Drive My Car\\", and \\"You Won't So Me\\", a song reminiscent of the Beatles earlier pop songs, but still fits in nicely on Rubber Soul.  George also comes along with his songwriting on \\"If I Needed Someone\\"; probably his best work up to this point.  He also writes, \\"Think For Yourself\\", which is very similar to his earlier songs, and it is by no means bad.  Ringo gets his first songwriting credit on the country-ish \\"What Goes On\\".  Another famous song is John's \\"Girl\\": a very simplistic song that's still very good (one of my favorites on the album).   <br /> <br />Rubber Soul deserves its place in rock history.  It is held in such high esteem for a reason and I highly recommend it, to anyone interested in or likes classic rock.  It is also one of the most important albums ever, as it marks the Beatles transition into becoming the greatest band of rock n' roll.
B000006TSC|4.0|I think \\"Breathless\\" is still a solid Camel album. Even if you don't like Sinclair's \\"Down on the Farm\\", there is plenty of excellent Camel music here. Especially \\"Echoes\\" is a superb classic Camel track. \\"The Sleeper\\" has the atmosphere of \\"Lunar Sea\\". Latimer's solo on \\"Summer Lightning\\" is excellent. The title track is a beautiful love song. A must have for every Camel fan.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|This album dates back to 1978, quite some time ago. I originally purchased it on LP and literally wore the record out.  <br /> <br />Tokyo Tapes is one terrific slab of metal made before the Scorpions went huge in the USA with a slicker, more commercial sound. Featuring the legendary Ulrich Roth, his playing is incendiary throughout. I was blown away by the live renditions of these classic Scorps tunes because Uli added so much to the lead breaks, compared to the studio versions. His playing on \\"Robot Man\\" in particular is mind blowing. The sounds that come out of his guitar are truly amazing.  <br /> <br />There is not a weak moment on this CD, although I personally would have loved hearing \\"Catch Your Train\\" performed live, because that song features perhaps Ulrich's greatest Scorps lead solo ever, (a precursor to the playing of Randy Rhodes), as opposed to the two Elvis tunes on the CD. But again, talk about a complete album with no weak spots. It's all here, \\"Pictured Life\\", \\"We'll Burn the Sky\\", \\"Speedy's Coming\\", \\"Backstage Queen\\", \\"He's A Woman, She's A Man\\", 18 songs in total on my CD, and \\"Polar Nights\\" is included on the two disc version I own. <br /> <br />While the band's style changed considerably on all the albums that came after Tokyo Tapes, one must acknowledge that over a near 35 year career, there are bound to be changes. Tokyo Tapes shows the Scorps at their peak form, playing a very European style of metal at the conclusion of the first phase of their glorious career. <br /> <br /> <br />
0060930187|5.0|I had heard of \\"The Bell Jar\\" for a long time before I picked it up to read it.  My friend and fellow writer, Greg Goodsell, liked to read Sylvia Plath's work at  the Open Mic's we attended. I would hear her name and think, \\"I am so woefully under-educated in these classics.\\" For the past few years I have set to righting that wrong.<br /><br />Sylvia Plath's tale of Esther Greenwood's stumble into insanity mirrors her own journey in many uncanny ways.  It is not unlike the words of Virginia Woolf who wrote \\"\\"If one shuts one's eyes and thinks of the novel as a whole, it would seem to be a creation owning a certain looking-glass likeness to life.\\"<br /><br />Esther's life mirrors not only Plath's life, it also mirrors many others of us who have experienced depression.  The voice is as clear and familiar as the rooms in my home - known intimately through daily experience.  Plath's writing is evocative, clear and haunting.<br /><br />We are witness to Esther's journey first as an intern at a woman's magazine - a highly coveted position - to her tumble into deep depression, hospitalization, and return to \\"the outside\\".  We witness her continued losses (one of her friends succumbs to suicide, her experience of shock treatment, her first love relationships.<br /><br />My favorite lines in the montage of tremendous lines  are these, both from the final chapter::<br /><br />\\"A fresh fall of snow blanketed the asylum grounds, not a Christmas sprinkle, but a man-high January deluge, the sort tha snuffs out schools and offices and churches, and leaves, for a day or more, a pure, blank sheet in place of memo pads, date books and calendars.\\"<br /><br />\\"I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart.  I am, I am, I am....\\"<br /><br />This book is now used in many classrooms.  This is a very good thing, to explore insanity as well as witness a writer capable of creating such beauty and at the same time, not being able to continue with her own life.<br /><br />I would also suggest readers study Plath's poetry, my favorite collection being \\"Ariel\\".  Finally, if you are especially taken with the life of Sylvia Plath, there is a DVD you may want to rent starring Gwyneth Paltrow in the lead role and is entitled \\"Sylvia.\\"  I found it to be highly telling and entertaining.r /> <br />I would also suggest readers study Plath's poetry, my favorite collection being \\"Ariel\\".

B0006IJ5PM|5.0|As Coach Billy Bob Thornton tells his players, being perfect is not about winning, it's about playing for the other players, and doing the best you can.  With that in mind, director Peter Berg's FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a perfect sports movie.  If you're not a football fanatic (which I am not), it becomes mystical as to how a sport can be such a religious experience for small towns.  Stores close down for games; everyone tries to tell the coach how to coach; what should be a carefree bunch of 17 year old boys becomes a collection of sour-faced, fatalistic young men who fear that if they don't win the state championship, their lives have no meaning.  One of the most disturbing lines in the film comes from the voice of a radio sportscaster who is chiding the coach for playing an injured player, and he adds, \\"There's too much learning in schools.\\"  How sad that students are judged not on their academic merits, but how well they catch or throw a pigskin.  While I certainly recognize the need for athletics in school, the fanaticism exhibited in movies like this can only reinforce how overemphasized it can be.  And how violent and mean.  Players intentionally try to hurt other players, and the adults become like children in their overzealous attempts to relive their lives through these spirited boys.<br /><br />As a movie, though, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS works because of the extremely talented cast Berg was fortunate enough to come up with.  Thornton is brilliant as the coach, who feels his whole coaching career rides on winning this big game; all of the boys are superb, but special notice should be given to Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund and Jay Hernandez.  Their heart and soul provides the true foundation of the movie's team.  Derek Luke as Boobie strikes a one note performance until his wonderful scene where he breaks down and says he doesn't know how to do anything but play football.  (Another sign of the academic system's failure to promote education as well as sports).  And of course, the surprisingly effective performance of country singer Tim McGraw as the brutal father whose own upbringing echoes in the sad treatment of his son who just can't seem to hold on to the ball.  It's a brave performance for this superstar:  he struts around shirtless, without the kind of physique one would expect; he doesn't mind playing a sleazeball to contradict his heroic status in the country music market.  He's very good and should try some more roles in the future.<br /><br />The movie has a lot of heart and it's ending only reinforces how unfair life can be sometimes.  If you are a football fanatic, this movie should be right up your alley, but if you're not one, you should still appreciate the immense amount of effort our young boys put into the sport, and how being perfect can make it better.ourse, the surprisingly effective performance of country singer Tim McGraw as the brutal father whose own upbringing echoes in the sad treatment of his son who just can't seem to hold on to the ball.

B00009V7T2|5.0|When I bought \\"De-loused in the Comatorium\\", I wasn't expecting much. It had been recommended to me by a friend and I had never really liked his taste in music. I figured I'd give this one a shot. I put it into my CD player, played it about 7 times, and forgot about it for a month or two.  <br /> <br />  When I recently brushed the dust off it for use in an art project, I realized the beauty this cd holds. The music is incredible. The vocals are entrancing, the guitar work is exceptional, and with Flea from \\"The Red Hot Chili Peppers\\" featured on this album too one can't complain at all.  <br /> <br />  This band takes the story behind this CD deeper than anyone could have imagined. The lyrics are indeed cryptic and at sometimes downright nonsensical. However, After reading the story behind it, and the storybook that goes along with this CD, it all made sense. If you are looking for some deeper music than The Pop-culture clones out there, this is it.
B0000640VO|5.0|I don't have a huge DVD collection because I am very picky about the movies I purchase. I only purchase films I will enjoy watching over and over again.  Amelie is one of them.  Amelie is a young woman that lived in Paris with her dad. She finds a box with old mementos and returns it to the rightful owner.  She then decides to embark on a mission of doing good things for people..  Will she find love in the process?  You'll have to see it.  Not only was the script great, but the cinematography will blow you away.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay's debut album marked them as the \\"Next Big Thing.\\"  And they are.  But their debut is a little overrated. <br />Most of the album is excellent, my personal favorite being Everything's Not Lost, a fitting (and excellent) end to a very good cd.  But this cd is NOT as good as their follow-up, A Rush of Blood to the Head.  Maybe this opinion is influenced by the fact that I bought their sophomore release before this, but I really do find that this album sags at times, dragged down by some very quiet, decent, very slow songs.  Now this is not too detrimental, because, as I said before, this cd is very good.  Songs like Don't Panic, Shiver, Yellow, Trouble, Everything's Not Lost, etc. land this cd solidly in 4-star territory.  But it's not great.  You have to wait for their next cd to get \\"great\\".
B000065VA1|5.0|Peter Gabriel's SO is really one of the best albums in my collection.  It's the best album by Peter Gabriel.  If you really loved and enjoyed SO then I suggest you NOT buy his new album \\"Up\\".  That was one of the worst (and most disappointing) purchases of my life (I purchased it the day it came out, right after classes).  When I got home and played it I was so disappointed that I gave it away at a flea market.
B000069AUI|5.0|When Politik kicks off, you know you are in for a quite different album than Parachutes, and kudos for that.  They topped their excellent debut release with A Rush of Blood to the Head, which is a fitting title to a cd that blew my mind.  I picked this up on a whim a few summers ago after hearing Clocks on the radio, and thank God I did.  This has become one of my favorite albums.  The first five songs rival any beginning of any cd I've ever heard.  While the 2nd half of the cd pales to the 1st, almost all music does along with it.  Allmusic says that this is an introspective album, which it is, but it also says that it is \\"initially inaccessible,\\" which is completely wrong.  I was drawn in from the first notes of this cd.  Completely riveting is a much more apt way to describe the album.  But you probably already know that by all the other glowing reviews here.  I must say, however, that The Scientist cannot be overrated.  Such an amazing song deserves an amazing album, and A Rush of Blood to the Head qualifies easily.  An all-time great . . .
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby is a sensational rock album that every music lover should own. U2 created this 12-track CD in Berlin in 1990-91 around the time of the collapse of the decrepit socialist state of East Germany, and this \\"zeitgeist\\" is reflected in the style of the record. Heavy emotional lyrics about love, lust and loss, driving guitar, and clattering dance and techno rhythms are brilliantly fused together in one of the most powerful records ever released.  <br /> <br />My Track Review of Achtung Baby: <br /> <br />Zoo Station - Groundbreaking lead track uses a jagged industrial rhythm and distorted vocals . The Zoo Station was an East Berlin landmark railway terminal back in the Communist era that the U2 crew visited as the album took shape.  <br /> <br />Even Better Than The Real Thing - One of the key songs of the whole decade, this fantastic recording has that \\"wow\\" factor that made it truly memorable. Brilliant video, and it heralded U2's 1992-93 Zoo TV media & information blitz. Even Better... came with a groovy dancefloor remix by Perfecto that had a chart life of its own. A big hit in July 1992. <br /> <br />One - A very special song, One is an emotional ballad that has taken on many layers of meaning over the years, and reveals raw emotions that U2 are so good at displaying. At once, a great pop hit in April 1992, an anthem for the ages, a heartbreak song, and a statement of unity and solidarity. My favourite song on the album. <br /> <br />Until The End Of The World - An awesome rock song. This has dramatic introduction, almost-apocalyptic lyrics, dense rhythms and it works superbly as a concert track. Really exciting. <br /> <br />Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses - A medium paced track with Bono's vocals bathed in a wash of hazy electronica and featuring memorable choruses. A 5th single from the album , it hit the Top 10 in December 1992.  <br /> <br />So Cruel - This song is a masterpiece and shows U2 at the very height of its songwriting powers. This slow,compelling song builds to an unforgettable crescendo in the third verse and its superior lyric reveals the power of obsessive love. <br /> <br />The Fly - An immediate attention-grabbing single released in advance of the album in November 1991 and reaching #1, this was our first glimpse of U2's radically-different new sound for the new decade. In amongst the slogans and the shades, there is a killer pop song here with that familiar spine-tingling moment in the chorus when U2 rises to a plane no other band can reach. <br /> <br />Mysterious Ways - I never grow tired of this terrific funky song. What a great bassline! I think this mid-paced track is alluring and accessible while still sounding suitably exotic (the shimmering North African scenes on its video and the concert belly dancer add to the mystique!) A Top 3 hit in December 1991. <br /> <br />Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World - I don't listen to this one as much as the first eight classics, but it's still pretty good. A medium-tempo track.  <br /> <br />Ultra Violet (Light My Way) - This has a great sound to it and is a relationship song with heavy lyrics and a memorable refrain <br /> <br />Acrobat - Many reviewers like this one, though it isn't a favourite of mine. Again a powerful lyrical song.  <br /> <br />Love Is Blindness - Brilliant slow track to close this landmark album, this lays bare the bleak emotions of a difficult and painful emotional entanglement.  <br /> <br />Overall, this album succeeds as a work of art, as an extension of the band's previous work, as a dance record and as a rock record. I enjoyed it as much as ever before when I played it through in running order a few days ago; such great music never goes out of date. It is my pick as the best rock album of the 1990's. <br /> <br />5 stars
B000002BBY|5.0|. . . If not THE best.  This album knocked me off my feet.  A swirling tour de force or thick, fuzzy guitars and pianos, (What's the Story) Morning Glory landed Oasis among the great British bands.  The only two songs I'd heard previously were Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova, which are worth the price alone, but every song rivals the two big hits, making this cd one of the greats.  I have a few bones to pick, though.  Beatles comparisons are overrated.  Oasis is solidly entrenched in their own shoes.  They are their own band with their own sound and their own image (which, unlike many, I like).  Good bands should be cocky.  They should know they're good, and Oasis certainly does.  Now while every band after the Beatles drew from the them to some extent, some more than others, Oasis is not a Beatles-copy.  And I really don't get the Mott the Hoople comparisons at all. <br />With that said, I can now say that I highly recommend this cd and this band for what it is: Oasis being and sounding like Oasis.  Nothing more and nothing less.  Brit-pop didn't get any better than this, and other rock incarnations rarely did either.
031286504X|5.0|This is such a outstanding book. It is completely original and told in a unique way. The story is also keep short and this also was the right thing to do. I mean you can only go so long with a story about the only human left on the planet. Be forewarned this is without a doubt the darkest story I have ever read. This is not bad, on the contrary it really gives the story an atheneic feel. You really feel like you are there, like your looking through his eyes. Wow, how depressing and frightning.<br /><br />If you like horror and want to read something completely original in every aspect then by all means find a copy and enjoy the ride.
B00005RIKI|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd is the epitome of Southern Rock.  And they are continually snubbed at the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame.  Right here, right now, I am giving a clarion call for all fans of Skynyrd, rock, music, etc. to protest this huge injustice. <br />On to the album . . .  <br />This is the greatest debut of all time.  Hands down, no question, black and white.  There is no grey here.  Every song is justifiably a classic, with Free Bird, Simple Man, and Tuesday's Gone still being played on TV shows, commercials, radio stations even today.  This album is a part of the national consciousness.  THERE IS NOT ONE LACKLUSTER SONG ON THE ENTIRE CD. <br />It is hard to even review this album, because everything I could say about it has already probably been said; I'm just being redundant.  People called Skynyrd the \\"American Stones,\\" but that's a slight to this great band.  Now don't get me wrong, the Rolling Stones are my favorite band of all-time, but Skynyrd is a very, very close second and stand on equal footing with the aforementioned Stones.  If only Van Zant hadn't died... <br />Anyway, this album is essential for any music collection.  Buy it. <br />Now.
0767830555|4.0|This is a great movie.  With top notch acting, a great story, and some nasty gun battles.  Just buy it you will not be dissapointed.
B000002UAU|5.0|I'm a huge Beatles fan, and Sgt. Peppers is definately my favorite album. The songs are great.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Macgyver comes from a generation of television that cared about it's viewers, Say no to drugs, care about your environment, the good guys always win. This is the type of TV that kept kids home with mom & dad, and made the 80's such a simple, fun time that most of us remember fondly.  <br /> This DVD collection will bring all those memories fresh in your mind - as you sit back and watch Macgyver outwit the bad guys with a roll of duct tape & a pack of chewing gum.  <br /> It's true that Paramount released a very basic collection. There's no bells or whistles here, but the price is very reasonable too. Thought I would have loved to have a deleted scene, or perhaps a forgotten episode.  <br />So if you know the phrase \\"Hi names Macgyver\\", please buy this DVD to support the release of more seasons. <br /> <br /> <br />
1932100385|5.0|This book is a gift to humanity. I only hope its wisdom shall be heeded by the many, not the few, so that we can begin to heal ourselves and restore the intended balance between Nature, the animals and human beings. It is particularly incumbent upon politicians to embrace the implications of this book so they can act responsibly towards their citizens by advising them what the correct diet to eat is. This book is not just stiff science  however. Inbetween the massive revelations, that we've been doing everything totally wrong for past millennia, there is humour. I particularly like the way the authors have managed to refer to George Dubya Bush exclusively in relation to his two-hour colorectal cancer check-up in 2002, perhaps the most distinguishing and telling feature of his presidency. It should only be a matter of time before medical insurance companies catch up with this book and put the final nail in the coffin of the diabolical trinity (the meat, dairy and egg industries). Bring it on I say. Prevention is always better than cure. We are herbivores after all. Viva The Vegan Revolution!
B0007VZ9DK|3.0|\\"Casino\\" briskly tells of the rise and fall of the stranglehold of organized crime over Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, it's actually two stories that sometimes fail to come together, leaving us befuddled as to each.   <br /> <br />The star of the show is Deniro, playing Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein.  Ace is to gambling what Einstein was to physics (he micromeasures each cube of dice), capable of setting the odds for any wager in America.  A man who doesn't know how to lose money, Rothstein is the lone Jew among a sea of Italians - the one man the mob can trust to run its flagship casino in Vegas.  While the leaders of organized crime watch from the distance (they can get no closer to Vegas than a general store in Kansas), Ace keeps the Casino profitable and various operatives skim the profits.  For Rothstein, Vegas is the realization of a dream - a place where his brand of gambling is legal, a moral car wash where his sins are washed away.  Trouble brews on two fronts.  The heads back home send Nicky Santoro, a mob enforcer and an old friend of Rothstein's, to keep things in order.  Played by Joe Pesci, Nicky is a one-man weapon of mass destruction, of voracious greed and infinite violence.  He's the \\"Conan the Barabarian\\" of Vegas - and in a city that seems to encourage everything, Santoro soon becomes everybody's enemy.  Vegas and Nicky seem well matched for each other, but soon the two develop a state of warfare against each other and, for his power, Santoro is eventually outmatched.  Rothstein's other thorn is the woman who will become his wife, Sharon Stone as Ginger, a hustler who will eventually steal, then break Rothstein's heart. <br /> <br />While Rothstein battles his nearby demons, the mob destroys itself in Vegas, setting itself up for a ludicrous fall.  (Concerned over the diminishing \\"skim\\", the captains dispatch their most inept underboss, the man who will ultimately and unwittingly betray their entire operation to the feds.) <br /> <br />While an interesting story, \\"Casino\\" is seldom a coherent story - it plays like \\"Goodfellas in Vegas\\" (complete with high-speed 1970's rock) even though the story often becomes more impersonal than \\"Goodfellas\\" was.  The plot never explains how a superlative manager like Ace let fortunes of the Casino dwindle, or why (when he was doing well) the Captains sent Santoro to Vegas at all - a decision which will easily haunt them.  (Santoro is easily more of a hazard than a help.)  Stone and Deniro have no chemistry at all - why Ace throws his heart to a woman who doesn't even like him is never explained, and they spend most of the movie hating each other.  Hurrying to match Ace's story to that of Vegas, the script runs out of steam and takes the easy way out - with a crescendo of violence that does nothing to inform the story we've spent about 3 hours watching.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I always seem to disagree with the great concensus when it comes to movies.  If everybody hates it, I usually love it.  And vice versa.  I thought Saw was a very good movie.  I admit, it could've been done better, and at times, it kinda ran on, but overall, I really liked it.  Definitely one to see.  Perhaps not a buyer (sorry Amazon), but you should definitely check it out if you get the chance.
B00023B1LM|5.0|This movie is intense.  I can see why it and its sequel raked it up in the box office.  I remember walking out of the theater knowing quite well this was going to be a movie I would purchase.  No regrets paying the full price at the theater either.   <br /> <br />The fight scenes are a breath of fresh air, especially after seeing so many \\"Matrix\\" copies in other movies.  I wouldn't be surprised if movie studios move more towards these straight forward fight sequences and away from the wire-fu.  The movie, \\"Kiss of the Dragon\\" with Jet Li, came out prior to this and the fight scenes are similar.  This makes the action even more tense because you see the characters more humanized.   <br /> <br />The storyline is a gripper.  You have just enough information to know Jason Bourne is and has been a part of something.  Something big enough that people are desperately hounding him.  Plus, there are no lame dialogue quickies.  It's one of the more intelligently written action/thriller/drama scripts in my opinion.   <br /> <br />The movie does move at a pretty fast pace and by the end you are wanting more.  Thankfully, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is now out.  Although, not as good, it still is topnotch for a sequel.
0553802534|3.0|Most current reviews here a very generous and three stars for this book is a kind act on my part. Easy and fast reading with good supporting characters and page turning dialog. Definately an interesting story that continues to move. The problems in the book though are numerous. EVERYBODY calls this guy \\"Bobby\\". Never an exasperated \\"Robert!\\" (...and many in the story have clearly had it with this person...) or a \\"BOB\\". BMW doesn`t make a 450, 22 caliber hand guns don`t go , \\"BOOM, boom, boom , boom\\". I`m pointing this out because Ms. Gardner lists in detail Bobby`s gear. The first time Bobby Dodge would meet someone, he`d never tell them details about his work other than the fact that he was in Law Inforcement as indicated in the story concerning his relationship with his Dad. A killer can`t be in two places at one time so whoever followed Catherine to her father`s home would not have been able to strike up a conversation with someone else, besides the fact he`d have to wait around awhile waiting for someone. Overall I don`t mean to be vague, but I abhore reviewers that go out of their way to put spoilers in their so called reviews. There are atleast three major angles in this story and it`s fun to read, but SUPER STUPENDOUS ULTRA INTHRALLING MYSTERY THRILLER it ain`t.
0790731002|1.0|What where they thinking giving the script for this movie the green light? Obviously Warner bros. Where just cashing in on the franchise and decided that casting the movie with big names will make it sell, but don't worry about finding a script for it.    Val Kilmar replaces Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/ Batman. And he obviously never bothered to watch how Keaton portrayed Batman because he went in a completely wrong direction and made the Bruce Wayne character stiff and almost lifeless at times. The main character of Gotham City is the main focus of the Batman franchise, why cast such a boring actor to drain the life out of character?    Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as the Riddler you would think would make a great combination, Tommy as a great actor and Jim bringing the humour to the film, however both of them turned out the worst performance of there acting career's if you ask me. Tommy Lee Jones may have acted like a character he had never been seen to do before, but that doesn't make it good. And Carey did not bring what he should have either, and his acting was horrible too.    Nicole Kidman playing the physiatrist to Batman also turned over a new low and created her worst performance too. Her character had no thought and no life behind it, just a familiar face to see on screen.     The only actor in this whole film apart from the guy who returned to play Alfred is Chris O'Donnell. But even O'Donnell's excellent portrayal of Robin couldn't save this movie. At least he got to reprise his role in the next Bat-movie and be in a movie much better then this garbage.    Please, forget about the cast, I know this movie has a lot of well-known actors, but please, forget that for one moment and take a look at the acting. Take a look at the plot, I was more interested to watch how bad the CGI was in backgrounds then I was in trying to find a good thing to say about this god-awful film. This film was sold on the cast alone. The Big name stars where all that was needed to sell this movie and to cash in on the franchise, and I wish that was a crime, because all it does is produces bad movies and major Hollywood rip-off's that make way for similar cheap scams and ideas by these companies to see what they have got to cash in on.     The overall movie's plot could have been interesting with a few tweaks here and there, but instead it has become one of my personal \\"worst movie of all time\\" contender choices. The movie also murders the realism the first 2 movies had, as far fetched as some things where, at least you could believe it was somewhat in the same reality as the one we live in. Where as this movie and in the 4th one Gotham City has gone from a realistic city to the worlds oldest, most historic and gigantic city in the entire world where all crime bosses and villains seem to be lured to or they are created there. (Must be something in the water?) And like I was saying, the movie also goes from a reality feel into a comic book likeness. They may as well have given Riddler a talking cartoon ninja cat as a sidekick.
B000002VJH|5.0|I can't think of any recording that seemed to give more to me than this one. Many albums are cherished by me from many a great band, but this one is what I most remember from the days of my youth in the 70's. I played guitar to this endlessly, I cycled it over and over some days (the music literally never stopped). It carried me off to the sand castles on many an evening. This GD studio album is about as good as any of their best material in my opinion (I love many other albums of theirs, of course, but this one captured my imagination the most for the journey it takes you on). I was going to their concerts in the late 70's and this is the HIGHlight material if it made it onto the show any particular evening. What more intricate material does the Dead have to work with than this? Older Dead was great, but for this period of their journey, this is a crown jewel. They really get the collaborative energy going like it may be their last adventure. Again, what more beautiful instrumental is there than Sage & Spirit in their whole repertoire? Is there a sweeter and more expressive guitar lead than the Crazy Fingers tearjerker on any studio album? The build-up of Help/Slipknot/Franklin's Tower into the Roll Away Mantra is like coming out of a dream! And that jazzy but powerful feedback lead that puntuates the trip is heavenly. They are on a tear on King Soloman's Marbles, Mahavishnu might fall behind! All of side one (or even the first six songs) was a perfect transition. Marbles scattered on a vortex coming together at the end to complete the experience. Feels like an concept album that flows over you like a wave (it might have been the wind). This album is inspired to say the least. Everybodies dancin'! I will vouch for the weirdness of BFA/Sand Castles, and I like it. It always feels like that end of a trip feeling when you start noticing all of the sounds around you - tension and release brain flexing. You've gone through the vortex to the new space on the other side (with crickets)! What a trippy little treat The Dead had up their sleeve here.

0671027344|5.0|my sister had been pestering me to rea this allegedly \\"amazing: book for about a year. i hesitated because when someone builds things up with expectations they almost always fall short. this book however did not dissapoint but surpassed my hunger for truth a million times over. <br /> <br />   i know alot of people have described the book as \\"catcher in the rye for a new generation\\". while i understand the reference i just wish that people could aprecciate the book without comparisons and for what ti is, because it is unique in it's telling and purpose and stands alone quite nicely. <br /> <br />   it's a story about a young man beginning his freshman year of highschool and struggling with the eternal conflict of being able to be in the moment without analyzing everything to pieces. it's about the price we have all paid for not stepping up, and instead letting life \\"happen\\" to us, and letting situations and experiences wash over us like waves without every trying to swim back to shore. it's about people who are broken and sad and still find a tiny place in this world where they can belong and feel somewhat at peace. it's about friendship and failure and forgiveness of those who we though infallible and coming to terms with the akwardness of life. <br /> <br />  i know the main character \\"charlie\\" is not well. in fact he's a mess in the emotional sense. he's dangerous because of what he does and more so because of what he feels he cannot do. i know he messes up and he stays quiet when he should speak, and he spends too much time viewing things from a place so far inside himself that being present really isint being anywhere at all, but in the end charlie is me and he is you, and he is everyone who has ever felt the infinite solitude that exists when despite being in the presence of friends and family, the world can still feel strangely spare and empty. <br /> <br />i reccomend this book for anyone who is comfortable with looking back at life at that peculiar age between 14 and forever and wants to know the truth of how it feels to find out who you are. <br /> crazy, yes, but veery brave, and always special.
B00062J00S|5.0|This is such a great movie I don't really know where to start.  First of all, I love Jimmy Stuart. He is so awesome in this though. Its a great story that really touches anyone except the most heartless bastard. I watch it every Christmas season more than 1 time. I remember seeing it as a kid and loved it then too. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie is a heartless bastard is all I have to say. Jimmy Stuart and Donna Reed have excellent chemistry and Mr. Potter is an ass. Great movie. Watch it with soemone you love!
0316172324|5.0|Gladwell's capacity to find the story buried in arcane science journals and to then make it accessible, eminently useful and compelling to the general reader scores again. His wonderful first book \\"The Tipping Point\\" changed the language of marketing. \\"Blink\\" will change the world.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I was raised Catholic and still am a Catholic as I go to mass now ever Sunday even though I didnt go for awhile in my early 20's. I left the theater feeling like a bad Mary Magedeline. It was a great movie though but not great that you want to watch it over and over. The androgynous Satan was really creepy. I felt like the bad Catholic that I have been after watching this. As a kid I used to like going to \\"The stations of the cross\\" events at the church during Easter but this is so graphic all it did was make me feel like a bad Catholic and that I need to go to confession really bad.
0060254920|5.0|This is the best childrens book ever.  It was my absolute favorite as a young child!
0446530573|4.0|The Italians like to eat. I know - I married one.  They always try to force food down your throat even though you may have just ate an hour ago or you are full. Anyway, this is pretty cool for a cookbook. I like all the little stories in it as well.   <br />I also am not related to the actor that plays Artie on Sopranos because it is my married name. I just hate that they call red sauce \\"gravy\\"...it makes my skin crawl. Gravy is brown or white!  But if you are a Sopranos fan you will like this. I am way to lazy to cook any of this stuff but I like to read it.
0156711427|4.0|This book is a book that is deeper than it first appears.  It deals with the tension between the British and the native Indians of India, as well as with the tension between the Hindus and the Muslims.  It also deals with the mystical in its portrayal of characters in search of the infinite and eternal.  The book is divided into three sections which correspond with the seasons of the Indian year - the Cold Weather, the Hot Weather and the Rains.  Each section of the book is dominated by each of the seasons.  Each section also focuses on one of the three ethnic groups found in India during this time (1920's).  They are Muslim, Anglo-Indian and Hindu.  This is a very deep book, that has to be read at least a couple of times in order for the reader to pick up all the nuances.
B000001EAQ|5.0|A great album that needs to be taken in context of their other triumphs:    Joshua Tree was great, the peak of the U2 1980's sound.    Rattle and Hum was a fun tribute to touring in America with a couple great new songs,    Actung Baby broke new ground for the band and for what was considered Alternative at the time.  Managed to keep the great melodies and meld them with the industrial sounds with a new direction in lyrics.  Best lyrics of any U2 album with songs that have numerous meanings.    Zooropa- the expansion of the Actung Baby sound, fun, spontaneous.  All interesting with a couple \\"hits\\"    Pop- in my mind the most underrated album.   Probably the second best song for lyrics if you ignore MOFO and Discotheque.  Sounds great.   New sounds for U2 and in the end, a unique sound period.  My biggest problem with the album is that I agree with the band- subsequent to the release they had been quoted as saying something along the lines of \\"we pressed to get this out 'on time' and feel that the songs really aren't done\\"  While the album versions are very good, the single versions and remix versions take each song up two notches...    Re-burn the CD replacing Discotheque & Gone with the remixed versions from Best Of II, Last Night on Earth, If God Will Send His Angels, and Please from the singles, tack on some of the great B-sides [North and South Of the River, Slow Dancing, Two Shots of Happy, and Edge's Acoustic Sunday Bloody Sunday (from the IGWSHA single)], turn up the volume, and enjoy!
B000053V7Q|5.0|The King still lives 0n the movies and music he sang and I seen this movie on tv to me it is a great movie.<br /><br />If you are an Elvis fan like me you should buy this movie.
B0006399FS|4.0|As a longtime fan of U2 who was thrilled with everything from Joshua Tree through Pop (once you get over the initial reaction to the new sound of Pop, it's a great album with the released remixes stronger than the album cuts) I was OK with ATYCLB- a little more bland and not nearly as imaginitive as the 5 preceeding albums.   <br /> <br />While understanding Bono's consistent self promotion (every album is \\"the best ever\\") I was excited to see where they were going to take things.   <br /> <br />It's a good album, better than the regular top 40 junk currently out, but it basically it sounds alot like ATYCLB (which is decent but not as imaginitive as I was hoping).  The other downside is that while the prior 6+ albums had amazingly few duds, this album lacks the stand-out song and (despite giving the album months to grow on me) I skip at least half of the songs.   <br /> <br />The lyrics are generally not as strong as in the past with a couple exceptions.  The other distrubing trend I've found is that the really up-tempo rockers have BAD (or I'm just not getting them) lyrics.  Think Elevation, Vertigo, MOFO, etc- they initially get your pulse quickened, but the past meaning and depth of lyrics is just gone. <br /> <br />While I'd give this 2 stars when compared to other U2 albums, compared to everything else on the market, it still deserves a 4.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|The Crossroads Guitar Festival is the must have for the seeking guitar player. Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, BB King, Eric Johnson, Jimmie Vaughan, Robert Cray, Santana, Joe Walsh, ZZ Top, Johnny Lang, John McLaughlin, Steve Vai, Robert Lockwood Jr, Hubert Sumlin, Robert Randolph, John Mayer, and many more.....Their are also some great acoustic players including James Taylor, Jerry Douglas, Dan Tyminski, and Ron Block. Robert Randolph is one of the greatest steel slide players I have ever seen in my life, he highlights a new era for all slide guitarist across the world. And how can I ever forget John McLaughlin's performence of Tones For Elvin Jones. Their's great renditions of Killing Floor, Sweet Home Chicago, and Six Strings Down with Robert Cray, Eric Clapton, Jimmie Vaughan, Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, and Robert Randolph. Their are also great guitarist including Doyle Bramhall the second's Green Light Girl. And to close the night who better than ZZ Top with La Grange, and Tush. This is truely filled with everything any guitarist in the world will truely love. Rock, Blues, Country, Metal this one is for you!
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's second album contains no less than 4 big radio hits ( \\"White Flag\\", \\"Life For Rent\\", \\"Don't Leave Home\\" and \\"Sand in My Shoes\\" ) and at least one or two more are potential hit singles. Dido has a voice than can easily be distinguised from the majority of the female pop-singers of today. ( a little Dusty Springfield and a little Suzanne Vega ).  Most of her songs have catchy hooks and moving lyrics.<br /><br />There are simply so many great songs on this album that it even surpasses her much-acclaimed first album \\"No Angel\\"; well that was was I used to think. Now I realize that this isn't really possible. \\"No Angel\\" is a masterpiece; \\"Life For Rent\\" is \\"just\\" an extraordinary great album!<br /><br />Can't wait for her new album!<br /><br />My favourites here are, \\"White Flag\\", \\"Life For Rent\\", \\"Mary's in India\\", \\"Don't Leave Home\\",  \\"This Land is Mine\\" and \\"See the Sun\\" - Don't miss the hidden track \\"Closer\\"!
B00023B1LC|5.0|<br />     THE BOURNE DOUBLE FEATURE <br /> <br /> <br />The Bourne Identity is a non-stop, action, suspense, thrill ride.  <br /> In my opinion it is an excellent movie. (****) The director, Doug Liman , did an excellent job on this movie. <br /> The fighting and chase scenes were done so perfect. The fighting style that Matt Damon used reminded me of THE MATRIX, perfectly smooth and fast. <br /> My favorite fighting scene was when Bourne goes to his home in Paris and the other Black OP assassin swings and smashes through the glass window attacking him. Awesome hand-to-hand combat. When the assassin finds out he can't win by hand-to-hand he whips out a small arrow head blade, trying to get the upper hand. When Bourne sees this, he evens the odds, with a mere ball point pen and stabs the assassin quite a few times with his fighting technique. The assassin ends up losing and commits suicide. <br /> My favorite chase scene was the Paris Pursuit. (In the scene index) He tells Marie (Franka Potenta) that this is her last chance to go on her own, but she decides to stay and buckles up for the ride of her life.  <br /> So, on this rainy day in Paris Bourne is driving a Mini Cooper, which in fact made this car famous, and out runs the Paris Police by dodging and doing 360s around other vehicle. <br /> The only way this scene worked was the fact that the streets were totally wet. They were so perfectly wet that it made this scene one of the best scenes in the movie. <br /> Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates action movies like me. <br /> The BOURNE SUPREMACY was also a great film. (***.5)  <br /> In my opinion it was not as good as the first one because it had a different director (Paul Greengrass) and only one great scene. <br /> I think the director did a bad job on filming the chase and fighting scenes. It was like watching SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, where the camera was bouncing rapidly. And didn't capture the action very well. <br /> It was still a great film because, Bourne actually remembers and learns everything he had lost when he first got amnesia. Also, finishes the story. <br /> The best scene was the Death Chase, when he`s running from the Russian Police in a taxi cab he had stolen. Smashing into every vehicle, out running the Police and at the same time the assassin, who killed the love of his life, is chasing him too. <br /> When Bourne saw him he leads him down an underground tunnel with a lot of traffic. While smashing each other into the cement walls, Bourne then does a 360, grinding into the assassin's SUV. Bourne takes out his hand gun and blows out the front driver-side tire, causing the SUV to pull right in front of Bourne sideways. Bourne then puts the petal-to-the-metal and rams the SUV into a cement pillar. <br /> Now both vehicles are completely totaled. Bourne gets out of the cab limping towards the SUV, pointing his gun at the assassin and sees his pursuer lying on the steering wheel covered in his own blood. It looks to me like he was still alive and breathing. All Bourne does is just walk away. <br /> If I was Bourne I would have put a bullet in his head and called it a day. But it could have been a perfect story for another movie, making these films into THE BOURNE TRILOGY. <br /> Overall, I recommend seeing both of these films back-to-back to understand the entire story. <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for Destruction is clearly one of the best albums ever! <br /> <br />It has stood the test of time, and is pure rock and roll.
B000002KDO|5.0|Not only is \\"Into the Void\\" the best song on this album, but it is a statement of what Ozzy and the gang were doing at the time-Going into the void.  Example1: Not only is Master of Reality heavier than Paranoid, it is one of the heaviest albums of all time,and it was recorded in 1971, a time when heavy problably wasn't even a term used to describe music (I wouldn't know).  Example2: Master of reality also shows sabbath risking their metal career with songs like orchid, embryo, and solitude.  Sabbath, however, made those songs work, who cares if they are not heavy, they are essential to the album.  In conclusion, not only is sabbath's going \\"into the void\\" on this album making it problably thier best ever, it is also their most influential. The only downfall of this album is that the production quality is not as good as it is on Paranoid, and the coughing part at the beginning of \\"sweet leaf\\" is sort of annoying.
B000065AI3|4.0|Classic meat and potatoes 70's rock / power pop. Would have been great to see these guys when they still played clubs. Compare \\"Strangered in the Night\\" with \\"Im on Fire\\" by Shelter labelmates Dwight Twilley of the same year. <br />(hint hint if you are looking for other solid 70's power pop!)
B000002KHH|5.0|Faries wear boots- I love that song, it's great. <br /> <br />All the other songs on this cd are good, too. Black sabbath is a good band and you should by this cd if you like heavy metal or classic rock 'n roll.  The best songs are Faries wear boots, War Pigs, and Hand of Doom.  Dont get the greatest hits of black sabbath, get this!  The greatest hits dosnt have hand of doom, rat salad, or planet caravan, essential songs to black sabbath's canon.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris is a brave man.    It's not that he's taking on big oil, government corruption or even \\"the church.\\" No, he's taking on religious faith across the board and the problems it brings to our ever-shrinking global world, problems of the sort we witnessed as we watched the World Trade Center towers burn and fall. And since most people belong to one religion or another and believe in God - though they fail to agree on what the word means - Sam Harris is in the unique position of annoying most of the human race. You have to admire his bravery - and his book.    I think it's safe to say that, \\"The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason,\\" is bound to be as great an abomination to believers as it will be an inspiration to freethinkers. I hope it will provoke wide debate on the topic of faith and belief. Indeed, someone should place a copy of Harris' book in a time capsule in the foundation of the building under construction at Ground Zero, which is to say that the book should be the basis for something that keeps the Freedom Tower upright, a tall order for he world's tallest building.    Since it's the reviewer's duty to point out problems, allow me to share a flaw, a minor weakness eclipsed by the strengths of Harris' daring book.     Harris uses the word \\"evidence\\" a lot. He seems to think that much of the problem of faith will be solved when people learn to follow the evidence, with science having a lot and religion having none. However, we must remember that Newton's physics was overshadowed by Einstein's ideas and that Einstein's theories were overshadowed by quantum physics. And when we deride the faithful over their strange, unproved beliefs, we must remember some scientists propose spooky things like \\"action at a distance,\\" a phrase that should always be accompanied by the other-wordly tones of a Theremin. In short, scientific evidence is fallible and tentative, and too much faith in the scientific method causes problems.     Philosopher David Hume pointed out in the 18th Century that even something as glaringly \\"obvious\\" as cause and effect - the bread and butter of the scientific method - is not necessarily demonstrable or logical; he concluded, of all things, that it was primarily psychological! And \\"Hume's Problem\\" - the assertion that we can't help but psychologize the empirical method - is still unsolved and puts limits on all our claims of objectivity. I agree on the importance of evidence, but the battle over belief won't be won that way.    It will be won when we understand how, as fallible human beings, we invest certain beliefs with monumental power, when we understand the mental and emotional mechanisms that turn human ideas into sacred \\"truths.\\" Or to put it more simply: The battle over belief will be won when we understand - on a deeper level than hitherto imagined - the difference between fact and opinion. And not before.     The answer to the problem of faith is not in the evidence but in ourselves. And in spite of his faith in evidence, Sam Harris helps us understand that. Read this book.

B0001UL7RY|3.0|I was suggested to give this album a listen, despite my extreme dislike for Lavigne's personality, fakeness/wannabe-attitude, and overall simple-minded lyrics.  I have quite an eclectic taste for music, and anything other than Celtic music (Lnasa, Altan, Clannad, Solas, Loreena McKennitt, Capercaillie, etc...), or genuinely talented/pioneering musicians (Blue Man Group, Rush, Linkin Park, October Project), usually only consists of a single song or two I happen to like by any one pop artist (Alanis Morissette, Godhead, Love Spit Love's remake of \\"How Soon Is Now?\\", Tears for Fears, Def Leppard, Poe, Sarah McLachlan, Sheryl Crow, ...).    Anyway, now that you have some understanding of what I like, I can state from my own point of view that I think \\"Under My Skin\\" is generally mediocre, though better and slightly more matured than Avril's debut \\"Let Go\\".  But I WAS absolutely SHOCKED and DUMBFOUNDED that I DID like one of HER songs: \\"Nobody's Home\\".  I found the only reason I enjoy this song is because it DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AVRIL LAVIGNE.  I first heard the song in 24h Fitness one day and she sounds more like a cross between ELIZA CARTHY (from whom I DO like her music and voice) and the already-obvious ALANIS MORISSETTE (I like her voice too sometimes, but only a few of her songs).  And, as others have already mentioned, she doesn't really do a whole lot of work anyway: Chantal Kreviazuk wrote the lyrics, she doesn't actually play the guitar (though that's an old rumour; maybe she's learned in the last two years), and her voice is largely synthetically corrected in the studio.    To summarize, it's more like Alanis Morissette wrote and performed the song, and Eliza Carthy sang and helped with orchestration.  That's all...  :o)
B00000JHAU|5.0|There was a ton of great music written in the 90's. This record is certainly falls into that category. PErsonally, the three best records of the 90's were Hollywood Town Hall by the Jayhawks, The Soft Bulletin by the Flaming Lips, and If You're Feeling Sinister by Belle and Sebastian. <br /> <br />This is a perfect record. Im also amused by folks who claim it's a \\"rainy day record\\". I find that to be rather untrue. In fact, I find the record to be more of a suunny road trip record. Why? Well there is alot of stuff going on in the background that when combined with the singers voice create grand moments that are musical versions of rolling landscapes - passing an old oak tree   bathed in sunlight, catching the bend of a river underneath a bridge as you pass by, blue skies and fields as far as you can see.....   This is all in the world of the stunning instrumentation of these songs. <br /> <br />This record  has amazing songs about interesting characters, but it transfers to the larger stage of the world, not just the corner of some room.  Grab yourself some coffee or hot chocolate and hit the road with this cd on a beautiful sunny day. You will surely enjoy it.
B0002X314C|4.0|When I first heard that Kanye West was behind John Legend's album, I expected a R&B album with Rap appearances, however I was wrong.  John Legends album is refreshing in the way that it comes across as a true R&B album without sacrificing and artistic creativity.  Someone compared him to Brian McKnight which is someone I would not compare him to, but I will say this much, he is off to a great start.
B000001FI7|5.0|This is a GREAT album that I found out by listening to a band  I love called Waterlog. Waterlog s \\"Brained Off Drugs\\" album credits said Portishead was one of the albums inspiration, so I had to pick it up and Waterlog was right! Dummy is unbelievable and Brained Off Drugs is the same excellent music vibe of unique, well-done genuine music. Not that Waterlog and Portishead sound the same, Waterlog creativity and perfection and sincerity remind me of Portishead albums. I LOVE THEM BOTH! THANK YOU WATERLOG! THANK YOU PORTISHEAD!
B00065LY1I|5.0|I've loved Kylie since she came to us with 'Can't get you out of my head' back in what 2000?  Ever since I've bought her major American releases and only recently delved into the smaller ones.<br /><br />'Ultimate Kylie' is good but a bit unessacery.  CD 1 is basically half of 'Greatest hits 87-97'.  And for that matter not nessacerily the 'better' hits.  I dont know which ones did the best (I havent researched it that far) but I can say which ones have held up the best over time and well not all the choosen ones have.<br /><br />CD 1 as said is mainly what as American's we missed after 'The Loco-motion'.  'Better the devil you know', 'I should be so lucky', 'Hand on your heart', 'Je ne sais pas pourquoi' all hold up VERY well.  Simple Classic and brilliant at that!  Other songs such as 'Especially for you' and 'Step back in time' show what was wrong with the late 80's and early 90's.<br /><br />CD 2 is a bit better.  It features a few 'pre Cant get you out of my head' era songs but a lot of its familiar to us USer's.  CD 2 kicks off with 'I believe in you' a song you'd swear at first belonged to CD 1 but no its her newest single, the single to launch this CD!  It's a good song though the chorus 'I belllliiieeeeeve in ooooo' is a bit well grating.  Ah here's some familiar tunes 'Cant get you out of my head' and 'Love at first sight' 2 of Kylie's biggest (and best) US hits.  Other highlights include 'Red blooded woman' and 'Did it again' while low lights offer a duet with the AWFUL Robbie Williams on 'Kids' and the just plain odd duet on 'Where the wild roses grow'.  The only other oddity is the 'radio edits' i.e. butchering of 2 of her best slower songs: 'Chocolate' and 'Come into my world'.<br /><br />Overall a nice Kylie collection, well worth any new or older fans $.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is a classic album that has become a victim of people's tendencies to hate anything that is popular. True - most popular albums are worth hating, but this is a rare case of well-deserved popularity. A lot of people look at Radiohead and assume they're pretentious because they're mopey and British, and they use weird sound effects. That's an understandable first impression, and who knows, maybe they are pretentious. But I could care less about their personalities. Music is music, and this is a classic album - not good - classic.  <br />Now, please excuse me, but I have to go write a bad review of the Franz Ferdinand album.
0316172324|3.0|This is a readable and even engaging book on decision making, but although I sympathize with the author's main thesis about rapid judgments (people are often right about these, but then, they're often wrong, too), he's a little too facile in discussing some of the more technical psychology and neurobiology and whether that evidence truly supports his thesis. For example, as another poster here mentioned, the fusiform gyrus isn't a piece of software but is an anatomical area of the cerebral cortex. But Gladwell not being a trained neuroscientist I can forgive him for confusing anatomy with functionality.<br /><br />However, Gladwell's theory that accomplished experts in various fields can often intuit, or on the basis of very small \\"slices\\" of information, often make quick and very complex decisions is nothing really knew, and it might or might not have anything to do with the ability to make snap judgments in general. It could be that such experts are quite competent in a particular area that taps into their cognitive and analytical strengths but they are incapable of making such decisions in other areas. It's more likely that people who have the ability to make quick judgments in many areas function differently from those who don't. For example, I can make quick analyses and decisions in two or three areas that I know well, but in other areas of my life I have to sit down and think and deliberate more. All this means is that some decisions are information intensive and some aren't, and if you're skilled in a particular area you can function faster than someone who has to work more slowly through the relevant information or decision-making steps.<br /><br />Another important point to remember is that power doesn't always equate to speed, either. For example, it's said that Einstein wasn't a very quick thinker, but leave him alone with paper and pencil and his mind could go further than any physicist of his generation, because of his powerful analytical and visual/spatial skills. Hence, rapid decision making, although perhaps useful on the battlefield or at the yearly stockholder's meeting, doesn't necessarily equate to quality and depth which is probably more important in the long run. It's also sobering to consider that more and more we seem to be electing politicians on the basis of their ability to come up with facile and great-sounding 20-second sound bytes that are hardly a realistic test of a candidate's ability to actually lead, govern, or come up with new and viable policies and solutions to our social problems. By that criterion Einstein couldn't have gotten elected to his local city council. But he's definitely someone you'd want on your team because of his ability to think creatively and deeply about many problems.<br /><br />That having been said, much of the organization of the human brain relates to generalized, quick decision making, although mostly on a sensory processing level. The human brain is extremely adept at combining inputs from all the sensory modalities in real time and being able to select and make decisions on the most vital information. This is aided by multi-sensory and multi-associational neurons in the anterior parietal cortex just above and to the side of the visual cortical receiving areas. The technical jargon aside, this makes perfect commmon sense if you think about it. If something is stalking you and may eat you, and you hear a twig snap, well, it could be your buddy, or it could be a big tiger or other predator. All animals (including humans) know when to haul a_s and get the hell out of there when they see or hear or smell something suspicious. These sorts of sensory abilities make such quick, selective responses possible. This is actually the most convincing evidence for the sort of abilities Gladwell is writing about, but it's not discussed in the book.<br /><br />One other minor technical point, I also agree with the previous writer that I don't understand what the author means by rapid heartbeats shutting down the motor systems. Obviously, certain abnormal cardiac conditions can impair motor functioning (it only takes about a four-second interruption in blood flow to the brain to result in unconciousness, which would certainly tend to interfere with motor control :-)) But other than a heart attack or a loss of blood circulation to the brain or serious arhythmias, such as fibrillation, which, depending on whether they occur in the ventricles or the auricles, can be potentially fatal vs. merely annoying and slightly debilitating, I'm not aware of anything like that. However, I'm not a doctor (I'm a neurobiologist by academic training) so I don't claim to be an authority on that area.<br /><br />However, I give the book 3 stars for effort, and some of the stories and info was interesting.he motor systems.

B0001ZMWQO|3.0|Most overrated album of 2004 hands down. Sure, it's good for what it is I guess. And what is it? Repetitive dance rock. But don't worry, fans of real music. Soon this whole genre will be gone and Franz Ferdinand and The Killers will be featured on crappy compilation CDs like the HITS OF THE 80s mixes you see advertised 2:00 AM. <br />Fans Ferdinands - before you rate my review \\"unhelpful\\" go check out Bloc Party. They will be your new obsession this year, I guarantee, and you will be glad you read this review.
1592400876|4.0|After majoring in biology and humanities and having been at least halfway literate at one point, I then spent the next 20 years of my career working with engineers and scientists who were far better at math but significantly worse at writing, grammar, and spelling, than I. Unfortunately, the influences seemed to flow only one way, and instead of my getter smarter mathematically and their becoming more literate, they stayed the same and I got dumber on the fine points of grammar and punctuation.<br /><br />So when I saw this book, I had to check it out, especially considering how unlikely a book on English punctuation is to end up a best-seller.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book, and it was more than adequate for giving some of my flagging grammar and punctuation skills a bit of a tune-up. Although not a more systematic book on punctuation or style like the well-known Chicago manual or some of the more forbidding references on English that I've seen, I still learned a lot and would recommend the book for anyone wanting something more readable on punctuation than the usual dry tome on the subject.<br /><br />However, if you're looking for something more in-depth or technical or a systematic exposition, this isn't it. The book's main strength is that it addresses many of the most common and glaring mistakes in people's writing today and the media and is useful for that. I didn't find the author's attempts at humor or wit very funny but as I don't exactly consider myself Robin Williams or Jay Leno, I didn't hold that against her. :-) Overall, it's a pretty good book for what it is and if our increasingly illiterate citizenry and mass media just knew what was in this book things would be, although perhaps not great, at least tolerable and better than they are now.

You throw this song on and you'll be benching 350 just to warm-up. Now that Metallica and Megadeth suck, Dimebag is gone and Sepultura broke up, I don't know if there will ever be another good metal album ever again.
B00003CXA2|4.0|I have given a lot of thought as to what \\"it\\" is that I like about this picture and I just can't seem to be able to put my finger on it as to \\"why\\" though.  Ironically although almost everyone that came into contact with Forest had a terrible tragedy in the end  - Ironically, I would have to say that overall the best way to describe this DVD would be as a \\"feel good movie.\\"  In the end you are left with an unexplainable feeling of hope.  If you are a Tom Hanks fan you have already seen it, and if you are a Hanks fan and haven't - then shame on you!   I enjoyed it and if I were you I would buy it and add it to your DVD collection or in Forest's own words \\"Stupid is as stupid does\\" - Don't be stupid by passing on this one.
