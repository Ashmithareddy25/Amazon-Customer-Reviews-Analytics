B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I didn't like the presentation of this movie.  Wished I had ordered an earlier versoin, of which there were several.
B0095P33IW|5.0|I loved this movie.  It gives a new insight into the Avengers.  It is a very good super hero movie.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|All of this novel could be true. I lived in S Korea for a time where their soldiers were treated like the descriptions in this book. We can only guess at the atrocities this book spells out but I tend to believe many of them. So sad.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|It is too much like a Martin Socorsky movie. I don't think I spelled that correctly. The ending was too blunt. It left me hanging.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Over 10 times, I have read this book.  I love it.<br />Speaker for the Dead May be better.  Card is the Master!
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I gave this to me nephew for Christmas and he loved it!  Great for any Lord of the Rings fan!
B009NY43NY|5.0|Overall, I loved the book. It seemed a little shorter than previous books. Maybe I read it too fast?! I can't believe is the last book, but I liked the ending. I couldn't see it ending any other way. Charlaine Harris did a wonderful job with Sookie. I loved the character and all the others. Can't wait to see where the story will go in the True Blood series since its now so much different from the  books.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The book is so on the mark with the HBO series. Good work...i got the bundle which was a great deal also....
B0063IH60K|5.0|ok once again its solitaire. what else can you say...plays well great skins decent opitions did i write enough (just call me lazy)
0345529057|5.0|What can be said about George R.R. Martin's epic that hasn't been said before? It is simply perfect. If you're a fan of the show please pick up the books to get even more time in Westeros.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great for anyone trying to improve their spatial skills! Can drive you crazy but is fun to play. Enjoy Flow Free!
B00C0W08XK|3.0|It feels backwards to me, to select the square and then a # for every move.  I would like the option to chose a number and then place it in multiple squares...otherwise it's just okay.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|*I was gifted this book by the author for an honest review*<br /><br />Luck of the Weissensteiners - Book 1 in The Three Nations Trilogy by Christoph Fischer is an amazing story of love, friendship, family values, faith, death, prejudice, fear, loyalty, sacrifice, struggle, and survival.  The story unfolds in Bratslavia in 1933 before the official start of WWII (although the first inklings of unrest can be clearly felt).  In a bookstore is where we meet the main character, a sweet & very naive Greta Weissensteiner, and her charming suitor Wilhelm Winkelmeier.  It is here that fate steps in and intertwines their families forever.  Her family is Jewish and his family is German - not a very good combination when war finally reaches them.  Like everyone around this time, they are forced to make difficult decisions that will affect their families forever.<br /><br />I loved that the author chose to focus on the dynamics of the Weissensteiner & Winkelmeier families and the impact that the impending war had on them and not so much on the war itself.  There is a bit of background history and mention of historical persons but beyond that it is very generalized and mostly fictional.  The story is brilliantly & vividly told through the eyes of colorful characters as they weave their way throughout the horrors & triumphs of war.  A haunting tale of innocence lost and a powerful testament to the resilience of the human spirit.<br /><br />I look forward to reading the other books in The Three Nations Trilogy.  As you read this book keep in mind the title - \\"The Luck of the Weissensteiners\\" - I ask is it really \\"Luck\\"?  Read this fascinating story and form your own opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very fun to play!  I have even been able to make my daughter jealous because I won the jackpot in coins!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't know what I will do when the show is over. Hopefully there is many more seasons to come.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I wouldn't have watched it except I thought it was a comedy/spoof.  NOT!  I don't like the average vampire movie anyway.  Except for Van Helsing and Red Ridng Hood, which were good.  Although Johnny Depp is always an excellent actor, he could not redeem this movie full of pointless killings and blurred good-guy/ bad-guy roles.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Despite the hard reviews I always love this series and am sad it's ending. I love that's the stories are slow then heat up the second half and continue non stop. I was enthralled in this book with so many questions I couldn't wait to be answered.
B004AQR29C|4.0|I say this because after we had watched over half-an-hour, I realized I'd seen it before.  But that makes it almost like new, I guess.  A great action flik, with great actors.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I like the constants. New Orleans has the best slots. Need more power ups awarded. Chat is annoying. Needs more animation or action in games. Use famous people for narration.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This was a great action/adventure movie.  It's about an alien invasion, but doesn't have the weird sci-fi feel.  So even if you hate sci-fi and fantasy, try it anyway.  And the acting was superb.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I use this for a lot this photos. It has great options and the pics look fantastic no matter which setting you put on
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is awesome nothing better than a action game with a twist of temple run in it especially the point that you can com get all the suits Tony stark has ever made.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The products arrive fine, very good bag , im starting in photography, the bag works fine, i made some photos to friends and are really beautis.
B009AMANBA|3.0|We got this as a gift for a friend. I also rented it and wanted to see it. It is so hard to watch. They are trying to talk in the language of the Era but it is difficult to understand. I was worn out. Besides that it is a long movie. Did recive this from the seller fast and it is no reflection on them. Just a bad movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|this book is perfection and i advise anyone to read it<br />it shares a beautiful story about a socially awkward boy
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|Another movie that I bought for a friend. Hope she likes it. Ben Afleck still can't act. He is too stiff.  Why he was in it except for directing. Again the seller did great on getting it here fast. I would buy from them again.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|heard it many many times. All songs are lots of fun and diverse. Personal favorites include Radioactive, Daemons, Bleeding Out and It's time.... great artists!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I really loved this series and wished there was more than the one season. I had watched several of the individual shows on TV but because I have the opportunity to stream the entire series in order...SO much better! Now all I have to do is watch the Serenity movie that ties everything up in a nice tidy bow.
1609611543|4.0|Gives some very good reasons for altering my diet. Parts of the book are a bit more scientific and a bit more boring to read. The Wheat Belly cookbook is easier to read,
B0064QNS62|1.0|Very hard to play on the Kindle.  Would be better on a regular computer.  Glad I got this app for free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|One word amazing! Draws you in like no other! I couldn't even .oh the book down! Time to move on to the next book!
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|I very much enjoyed learning about a stretch of US history that is not often examined closely in popular histories. There are issues of collective responsibility and guilt over our national failure to timely recognize and confront evil and injustice; and conversely, the greatness of some of us to have fought that evil with much courage. Roosevelt emerges in this history as a somewhat lesser personage than in other biographies I have read, and provides a different viewpoint from which to examine the events of that time. Unfortunately, the writing was somewhat stilted and at times got in the way of a good telling.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is very reliable in finding tough words you don't understand. This is useful for homework and other special activities such as an academic game
B003G4W49C|1.0|The book makes the characters interesting. The science fiction involved appears to be plausible. I would have like to see<br />more information on the other &#34;toon&#34; leaders.<br /><br />Unfortunately, controversy surrounding the author are difficult to stomach. The author supports  the Mormon church and National<br />Organization for Marriage both dedicated to bigotry and homophobia. I just gave money to a person who wishes to deny my civil<br />rights. I will not buy again.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I had the Jorte calendar on my previous phone and quickly downloaded it to my current phone.  It's extremely easy to work with and provides all the information needed to track your schedule... Great product... Thanks
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I Love it and can't wait for Season 4!!!!  I'm so happy for Lady Mary and Cousin Matthew's impending wedding.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This a great show and they keep up coming with new twist. It will be sad when they finally put the Winchesters to rest!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show was produced by Bryan Fuller, the same guy who made Pushing Daisies and Wonderfalls. With Daisies and Wonderfalls, Bryan Fuller showed how well he could do bright, happy TV (winning lots of awards in the process). Hannibal is like the Yang to the Yin of his previous work. Still the same award-winning polish and deeply smart writing, but with all of the light and cheer sucked out of it. It's like he's channeled his powers for evil instead of good, and I'm loving every episode.
B00555X8OA|5.0|If you're the type of person who likes knowing things, I would recommend this book.<br /><br />Not in that reading the book actually helps you learn anything new; it more helps you unlearn things you though you knew, which you did know, but which were wrong.<br /><br />The chapters are long and formulaic, and reading this book is much like watching a season of House; you can read like 5 chapters in a row rapid fire without wanting to put it down, then you will hit a point of &#34;Well I just honestly don't care right now.&#34;<br /><br />Turns out, the book discusses this effect somewhere, I think.<br /><br />I can't remember, I just skimmed that part, honestly.
B00005T7I1|5.0|Nothing to say just a must have for any collector or film buff. Action, Song and Theater all in one!
B006IDG2T6|5.0|You may want to believe you have free will, but you were predestined to believe that.<br /><br />While it's certainly the case that we might not live in a fully determined universe (one of the tenants for the book [SPOILER ALERT!]), in this day-and-age the Argument for Chaos from Quantum Mechanics is the only &#34;legitimate&#34; stance against determinism, and it's legitimate in that Quantum Mechanics is poorly understood by both the proponents and opponents of this stance.<br /><br />Honestly, the book is more interesting as a case study in Determinism vs. Everything Else as a universal world view. There are very interesting and social points, but I care so very little about those things.<br /><br />It's not my fault though, as you'll find if you read the book.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This film was amazing from begging to end. From the unrecognizable Mariah Carey as a social worker and Lenny Kravitz as a nurse, to the debut of Gabourey Sidibe in the lead role this a true potrayal of life and it's socio-ecomomic affect on the people of late 1970's New York City. Not to be missed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of those books that you don't want to put down.  It is written very cleverly from his viewpoint, her viewpoint, chapter by chapter.  It is a mystery, so you're really not sure who is telling the truth and what the outcome will be.  I enjoyed this thoroughly and am going to purchase the author's previous 2 books which I understand are equally as good.
B001S86J0I|5.0|This is the single greatest spoof movie ever made and it should be a part of everyones movie buff's collection.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|This wine holder is so nice and better than I expected.  I had so many compliments on the wine holder.  Best of all I could even figure to mount it on the wall even though the instructions were in German.  LOL
B007IV1E2W|5.0|Doctor who is the awesome sci-fi show ever. I like the story, characters,  and the doctor. It gets better and better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a really fun, but also mind- involving game. It has a lot of different packs... I recommend it.
0765317389|5.0|Read the book when I was younger and when I heard that the movie is coming out I made sure I got my hands on it again. One of my favorite books of all time, definitely worth the read. I would buy the rest of the series if it came in hardcover.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It's very addicting!!! I would like to have more ways to earn diamonds but it's awesome!! I am liking this game more and more the longer I play!!!
B0080MPUUK|5.0|If you are a fan of the early woody Allen movies, then you have to love this one....lots of familiar faces....classic bumbling woody....all the awkward love scenes....plus a Bogey look a like....one of my faves!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game!! I play every day and can't get enough of it. Great game to play to pass time.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Really good game when it does not freeze.  Wish there were more credits and less time get them like every few minutes or so.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Made my brain hurt trying to solve s o me of the puzzles.  Too short, left me wishing it went on further!
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|This is a difficult film to review.<br /><br />Die Hard 5 is not going to please you if you are hoping for a film like the first Die Hard: underdog good cop in a situation over his head struggling to make things turn out right while the government/cops etc. try to to handle the situation.<br /><br />The GOOD:<br /><br />This film is an excellent action movie with a couple of ridiculous scenes--like the transition from bridge to road below, or from chopper to roof, etc. You'll understand. The action is incredible and beautifully shot. The car chase alone is a new experience, the way the bystanders and cars get tossed about. It's unlike any chase scene I can remember. The only disturbing part is how many innocents John must have killed! lol. His son has a few cool CIA gadgets. There are a few nice plot twists. On it's own, the film is a fun ride, fun to watch, thrills unfolding in a novel way.<br /><br />But . . . it is not Die Hard. It is a weak reflection of the series we adore. Here's why:<br /><br />1) The beginning is slow, with John literally standing around while his son does his thing. I don't EVER want to see my beloved John McClane loafing around like a lost puppy! What a lame moment. He keeps calling his son's name and truly resembles a lost old man.<br /><br />2) John actually whines throughout the movie. What is that about?<br /><br />During the chase he is talking to himself and most of the lines are lame.<br /><br />Throughout the movie he complains that he is \\"on vacation.\\" When did this turn into an intended vacation? It was NEVER a vacation! He went there to help his son!<br /><br />He says \\"Jesus Christ!\\" more than a crazed Baptist minister on Sunday. I was actually guessing when he would say it again and laughing.<br /><br />3) John's son sucks. Why am I watching his son? Why is my hero following his son around? It would have been a million times better if John had seen his son get killed and went out for revenge. But, no. Instead, I have to hear his son whine and see his son fight bad guys with cool CIA gadgets. While the American legend and super cop John McClane . . . helps out.<br /><br />4) No cops in Russia!?! No special forces Spetsnaz or something? The terrorists and John crash through the cities and no one shows up to stop them. No one. That is a big no no. How silly.<br /><br />5) The villain's plot goal is one we've seen too many times before. I won't spoil it, but come on. They could not have cooked up an original threat? The last Die Hard did that well, putting John out of his element. This is simply old hat. When you discover what it is, you'll groan.<br /><br />6) The ending scene is literally a mushy musical Wonder Years, Hallmark, Lifetime moment!!!! I know what they are trying to say about John's family, but come on! Come to the point in a more creative way. Or don't at all. Let us assume it has happened. I would rather John had just yelled, \\"Yippy KiYay!\\" into the camera until the credits rolled.<br /><br />I hate giving negative remarks about this film. There are quite a few fun John McClane moments as well as a few touching moments done well. But the film either tries too hard or tries too little when developing the relationship between father and son.<br /><br />I cannot shake the feeling that his son Jack is intended to do a spin-off movie. They set it up that way, with Jack overshadowing his father a little. I hate that idea.<br /><br />Rent it. Watch it for the action, not the Die Hard.is son whine and see his son fight bad guys with cool CIA gadgets.

B006LSZECO|5.0|OMG!! I have suggested this book to so many friends.  I am dying to see if there will be a sequel, because the end totally leaves you wanting more.  I saw myself and people I know all through this book.  I can't say enough good things.  Read it!!
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love JLo  and Cameron Diaz movies but this one had too much going on. Not in the complicated way.. the storyline just didn't keep me entertained. Cutr, but a bit annoying.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Different than the average movie.  Depth to it.  I like that it kept me thinking about situations days after the movie.  Bradley Cooper did a great job.  I'd recommend it.  :)
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I hope to use the camera just like I use my phone. Pictures come out great! I take my kindle everywhere.
B009X01GJ2|3.0|I love the concept of this case and my only problem is that it doesn't stay clipped into the slot tightly and I find that it slips out often.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|This is my favorite Jane Austen book and the movie was very true to the story.  Captain Wentworth is a hunk and much more romantic than Darcy.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story is gripping and disturbing.  Also, extremely relevant.  I had no problem slipping into the groove on this one - I was into it immediately.  My only problem with the father is that he keeps saying &#34;just like any other teenager&#34; ......... well, no, not really.
B000007XUQ|5.0|Great album to own for the Christmas season.  Great sound and songs from a great star.  A must album to own for Christmas.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We've only watched 4 episodes so far-but still the intense, teeth-clenching suspense and emotional roller coaster we've come to love/hate. :)
B0015AARJI|3.0|The product works fine. It just took a long time getting here.<br />From China? Really? I don't get why there weren't any in the USA.
B008RRLCFK|5.0|I must've bought this CD three or four times in my lifetime. I was 12 years old when this album came out, and I immediately fell in love with it. It's an album you can listen to the entire way through without skipping a song. Solid album from a phenomenal group of musicians. Ear-romatherapy at it's finest!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love the variety and my fiance found sounds he likes too which is not easy! Makes falling asleep a breeze
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was happy to see how easy this is to do....mainly because it is written for the average person, not a computer geek. Book one , here we go
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game requires the use of logic and reasoning to win. Also, strategizing. One of my more favorite games when I'm stuck with no internet.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Love Baldacci!  Takes you on a ride and doesn't let you off until the end! Twists and turns abound here!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you liked Resident Evil, you will like this show. It's better than Resident Evil, actually.  it's great that you can start with season 1 and 2 on Netflix and then pay with Amazon to receive the current season.
B00471TLZS|5.0|I saw this in the theater oh so many years ago, back when you could afford to go.<br />Then I got a LaserDisc copy in widescreen and it was very good.<br />So I have revisited this film many times over the years.<br />This Blu-Ray copy is the best of all and the bargain price made it a no brainer to buy.<br />This might be a 1982 film but some of the so called supernatural movies of today could take a few lessons on how to make a scary movier that isn't &#34;R&#34; rated.<br />Highly recommended.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun way to spend time without taxing your brain too much. I get a little frustrated because it moves a little slowly but it is still worth playing.
0312117337|5.0|Great tarot deck. Images are very easy to connect too and pictures a very subtle.  Book gives good insight. Cards are good size, easy to shuffle.
B009AMANBA|5.0|It met my expectations.  It is a very compeling movie.  The acting was excellent.  Just a wonderful experience. two more words
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I'm a big Iron Man fan so I maybe bias about this game....<br />It's a pretty challenging game overall You control I.M. with the motive of the tablet/phone and have to tap or swipe the screen to use his hand beams Basically he just flies around and you shoot different characters down But you can collect coins for buying up grades on different suit O and there are PLENTY of suits However to get then it takes a ton of ISO-8 (jewels) or a ton of XP You build XP by just playing the game and the further you fly the more you earn The jewels are given per level up OR of course you can buy for REAL MONEY Same with the coins you can pick them up free in the game or but them too O and when you crash/run out of life it's like a 30sec &quot;repair&quot; time until you can play with that particular suit again kinda funny<br />Overall fun addicting game You almost feel like you wanna keep playing to go further and of course own all the suits Last tip...you only get like 4 slots for suits so to build a 5th you will have to dismantle one YOU DON'T GET BACK YOUR XP EITHER but it keeps the upgrades it's just 2k coins to rebuild...ugh
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is amazing to have.<br />I like playing it. It helps me learn more about horses. That's why I love it very much!
B009CF3P7E|5.0|I love this movie and have been a fan of Star Trek. Not the cos-play or convention kind just alway enjoyed the films and tv shows. This new reboot has rekindled my interest and have to say I was surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie. A must have for any Star Trek fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed the book.  Kept you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next.  I would recommend it to the teenage set and older.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this program. I can't wait until a new season comes out. I watched every thing in about two weeks.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love iron man and this game is amazing. Fly through town as iron man, buy new suits,and save the world this game has it all.
B005EZJ3MW|4.0|was blown away hearing her do &#34;Skyscraper&#34; &#34;Lightweight&#34; and &#34;For the Love of a Daughter&#34; I love a couple other songs off of this as well, but don't care for the other poppy stuff. but I can tell Demi has grown a lot in her music career. still love her :)
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Very well done. It loads fine and video player is really good. Best thing is the sound quality on Kindle is best when compared to iPad.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|heard their single &#34;Now&#34; and at first was skeptical of their new sound. but then it started to grow on me and was looking forward to this release. now I finally listened to it and love almost every single song off here. this is really nice and look forward to more new stuff from them in the future :)
B00452J5IW|5.0|This album deserves to be ranked in the top few releases in all popular music. Jerry Garcia was at his peak as a guitarist. the concept, although a bit overblown, is a very nice science fiction story. The production values are top notch. The players who are on the album reads like a who's who of the San Francisco era. How can it get better than Kantner, Slick, Garcia, Crosby, Nash, Hart, and Cassidy. this is a brilliant gem that needs to be in the collection of anyone who appreciates the music of this era.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|wow wow wow. this is just too good. I love almost every song off here and so much emotion in her songs. better than her last album and she just keeps getting better and better
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|It's a funky slice of disco revival.  Sounds great, very catchy.  The best thing Pharrell has been involved with in a long time.<br /><br />By the way, if you don't like this song, you'd better skip the album.  It's very similar.  I loved this song, and the album did not disappoint.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Nothing new here and the acting was just so so.  I read the book and as usual the book was better.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|When Iron Man 3 was first announced, I was indifferent...until I heard the news that Shane Black was writing and directing.  I liked Iron Man, so I went to the midnight release of Iron Man 2 with a few friends, and boy was I disappointed.  I even dozed off in the theater.  However, the news that Shane Black was now involved made my day.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know, Shane Black wrote the first few Lethal Weapon movies and a slew of 90's action vehicles (The Last Boy Scout being one of my favorites when I was a kid).  He finally got a chance to direct with 2005's, \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\", a criminally underrated movie, and then he didn't do anything after that...until now.<br /><br />A lot of people are hating on Iron Man 3 online because of how much time he spends apart from the suit.  \\"Call it the Tony Stark movie\\", blah blah blah.  I thought this was a great touch, and it allowed Stark to go back to his roots a bit.  Others are upset because of the way a certain villian was treated, but I thought it added a great touch to the film.<br /><br />The comedy is on point, the action scenes are tremendous...including one where people are falling through the sky, and RDJ is, as always, charismatic as hell.<br /><br />It wasn't perfect. but I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Final Rating - 4.5/5.0.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I didn't know what to expect, but the movie was wonderful! It was interesting to hear about a family that made it through it and now I understand why the movie was called the Impossible.
B005TVYVI2|1.0|My daughter's swim team requires this device for practices.  First one failed after a few weeks.  This was not a battery issue.  The 2nd one lasted several months.  Now I have to purchase a 3rd one!  Wish there was a competitor's product I could purchase instead.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like the colors, different levels and moderate challenge. I would definitely recommend this game to people of all ages.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I'm still watching season 1, but the first 9 episodes have been engrossing.  I never watched the show on tv the first two seasons because I found the ads for it implying the \\"good wife\\" was long suffering, helpless, blah blah blah offensive.  Knowing now where Alicia is in season 4, I really enjoy watching her competence and successes in Season 1.
B0043JDUNS|3.0|1st one was better, this was more of a drag.<br />I am a big fan of Downey, so no issues
B000002KHF|5.0|Every song is a masterpiece.  I bought this for &#34;Brand New Day&#34; after losing my husband.  The best version of &#34;Crazy Love&#34; I've ever heard !
1566196337|4.0|I would recommend this book to others, the best work by Oscar Wilde I've read. Its a story of a man who gains everything he's ever wanted (youth, immortality) and finds it isn't all it's cracked up to be, and then begins to  struggle with the consequences of losing his own soul. Dorian Gray is the main character, but I was more fascinated by Lord Henry, and with all of his witty quotes, I was not able to put this book down.
B0082FPIY8|4.0|An ordinary person attempts a difficult lonely and long adventure and succeeds against the odds. One of those long walks with many trials and tribulations.
B009R659L8|3.0|This was an OK book but in my opinion it's not one of Clark's better works.  A little too predictable.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The creative mind was not just alive with the author but with those who made the movie too. Astoundingly enjoyable fantasy with delightful characters.
B0088W8QSU|5.0|This is a great show, I'm kinda glad that I didn't watch it while it was on though because it has killer season enders, the kind that have you gritting your teeth ticked off that you have to now wait months to find out what happens.  Still, I love it and when it's over I'm sure I will be sad and wish I had more seasons to watch.  :)
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|Lots of action as expected from Bruce Willis.  It left some open questions at the end.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone by stating them here.  However, the acting and action were good.  There was enough mind-bending to satisfy my needs.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Fun, easy Iron Man game for those into the marvel-based character. Graphics are good, no major glitches or bugs. Its easy to advance in this game as most things don't take long to accumulate.
B00BDZV9M4|4.0|The majority of the songs I really like are the ones I hear being played alot. I really could have just burned the ones I liked as opposed to buying, but my husband took it so we both can use it.
0670022705|4.0|I purchased this because I was listening to the fascinating articles being read on National Public Radio. I would gladly have paid more than twice as much for this book if the photos had been in color.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I've been reading James Rollins since I picked up The Devil Colony at Target. I have been looking forward to reading each of his Sigma novels with anticipation before buying it. I have been reading each in the order they were written after reading The doomsday Key, The Devil Colony and Bloodline last summer his latest, The Judas Strain, is a slam dunk. I loved everything about it from start to finish.<br /><br />I enjoyed the premise from the first page, which is ALWAYS a good sign in my book. The voyage of Marco Polo from Asia back to Italy was beset by some kind of major tragedy which nearly wiped out all those who participated on the journey...a voyage which Marco never spoke about to seemingly anyone, even at his deathbed...or DID he? Yet another fantastic What If scenario begins as we jump to the modern day world where what seems to be a particularly nasty plague is infecting, and then altering the very DNA of those inflicted. It seems to be originating from the ocean, and after a very short time, scientists from Sigma Force kidnapped by the infamous Guild are working side-by-side attempting to stop what could very well be a planet-wide catastrophe. As always, those in the Guild may or may NOT be what they seem, and all the while we factor in the Vatican and surprisingly the possibility of an actual language of the Angels being translated which somehow seems to be all connected. But to what end? Never fear...Mr. Rollins has control, and he takes us on another thrilling roller-coaster ride that never fails to entertain as well as inform -- which always seem to be the best kind of books to read (IMHO).<br /><br />Probably my favorite aspect of Rollins' thrillers is their integration of science into the story. After all, his team of protagonists, the Sigma Force, is part of a government agency that recruits former special forces operatives and educates them to the Ph.D. level in scientific disciplines. They've got both the military training and the scientific knowledge to investigate technological and scientific phenomenon around the world on behalf of the US government. Not a bad starting premise.<br /><br />The plots of Rollins' novels tend to be complex, multi-stranded affairs that are difficult to summarize. In Judas Strain, as has been noted by other readers, there is an urgency brought on by a possible pandemic outbreak of bacterial infections. That, in and of itself, is not the most original plot. But in a Rollins novel, it's never that simple. Did you know that only 10 percent of the cells that make up your body are human, and the other 90 percent are alien--bacteria, parasites, etc? It's true, absolutely true. Did you know that the difference between a commonplace, harmless bacteria and a potential killer disease is just the tiniest alteration to its genetic code? What would happen if something altered all the zillions of harmless bacteria we have contact with daily and suddenly they turned on us in the most horrific way imaginable? And I do mean the most horrific way imaginable, because James Rollins is a bit of a sicko, and nothing seems to be off limits for him. What he puts his poor \\"patient zero\\" through is--yuck--awful!<br /><br />But I dont want to spoil anymore details about the plot to you so you should go buy this book you will not be disapointed For those familiar with the novels by Rollins, this is one of those No Brainer decisions: you simply MUST get this book, it really IS awesome...however, for those who may be new to these books, by all means, buy, read and then run to go purchase the complete works by Mr. Rollins. IF you have the chance, while you do not have to, buy and read his books in the order they were released. ( I highly recomind it ) Entertainment written by a real master... Now, my reading of the NEXT Sigma Force novel begins...See you soonledge to investigate technological and scientific phenomenon around the world on behalf of the US government.

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Convoluted, crazy, inappropriate - he's my favorite serial killer. Terrific subtle and nuanced acting on Hall's part. He and Jennifer Carpenter are just great together.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I received this in two days with Amazon Prime and this is definitely a 'good' movie and worth watching if you like the genre. However, I think all the hype had me expecting something absolutely fantastic. For me, I'm glad I saw it but It's not a movie I'd watch again.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Good performances by the 3 main characters. Interesting but little known tale based on true events. A bit over the top, but not a bad period piece.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Classic Buble.  Each song he does, in my opinion, is better thatn the original.  The disc was delivered quickly and was priced very, very competetively.  Thanks.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Weird book but a must read. It is definitely different and that's a good thing. You walk away feeling a more experienced well rounded reader.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Great read, good characters, up to date plot.  This is perhaps the way things &#34;should&#34; be rather than the way they are, but what the heck, we could use a few more like Director Kennedy or agents like Mitch.  Vince Flynn is right up there with the best of the story tellers.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Have not watched much 'cartoon' films other than Disney, this is a great story and whilst its mainly for kids, a little bit of the kid in me still loved its story, and it was FUN... hope for some sort of sequal.
0679809015|5.0|The children at work loved this book.......i actually wish I had bought a few of this.......the boys point to the animals and make the sounds!
B00CL0J99K|5.0|When Iron Man 3 was first announced, I was indifferent...until I heard the news that Shane Black was writing and directing. I liked Iron Man, so I went to the midnight release of Iron Man 2 with a few friends, and boy was I disappointed. I even dozed off in the theater. However, the news that Shane Black was now involved made my day.<br /><br />For those of you who don't know, Shane Black wrote the first few Lethal Weapon movies and a slew of 90's action vehicles (The Last Boy Scout being one of my favorites when I was a kid). He finally got a chance to direct with 2005's, \\"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\\", a criminally underrated movie, and then he didn't do anything after that...until now.<br /><br />A lot of people are hating on Iron Man 3 online because of how much time he spends apart from the suit. \\"Call it the Tony Stark movie\\", blah blah blah. I thought this was a great touch, and it allowed Stark to go back to his roots a bit. Others are upset because of the way a certain villian was treated, but I thought it added a great touch to the film.<br /><br />The comedy is on point, the action scenes are tremendous...including one where people are falling through the sky, and RDJ is, as always, charismatic as hell.<br /><br />It wasn't perfect. but I really enjoyed it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is the best thing in the world i love everything and only 2 more sharks till great white
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Like it<br />Everything worked liked it should. I had no problems with the app. IT was easy to move around the site with easy.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book...it was as great as all of his other books and the message that he gave at the end was absolutely incredible.  I highly recommend this book to everyone, especially anyone that has strong feels about time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved it!!! Best book I have read this year. Must read. The best twist I have ever read. The most Beautiful story.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|While this story was a bit light on action, I loved getting a look into mind of Soong. I hope Data will return in up coming books.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|Entertaining for my kid and it was cool enough for me to watch it with him and get some laughs myself.
B006T3RM08|1.0|So I buy this thing for almost 30 bucks. Having to fairly force the trackpad and keyboard in, like many others it made the trackpad unusable. So I thought 'maybe I'm doing something wrong' so I wrote to them and asked what to do. They sent back a pdf with instructions on how to shave some of the plastic down in some areas so it would work.<br /><br />What??!?<br /><br />Two reasons why you should just move on and not do this:<br />1) modification will render it un-returnable.<br />2) WHY THE *^#^%*^*#}{!! SHOULD I??? I paid almost thirty bucks for this cheap piece of plastic, and now I have to break out the toolbox??<br /><br />Forget you Clique. You're not the only game in town, keep your shoddy product. Returned.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have tried many of the recipes and have loved them all so far. I have got many ideas for home projects and crafts, gardening ideas and some beautful pictures. I can spend hours just looking and searching and of PINNNG.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Doctor Who does it again! Rory gets more bad ass, Amy gets a little crazy, the doctor gets a wake up call about  how he's acting and we get to figure out who River  song is :O A very good season.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Wow! I'm a huge J.J. Abrams buff. I love almost everything he's made: Fringe, Star Trek, etc.. This is no exception! It's a bit corny, a bit tongue-in-cheek, but it sure is a fun ride! Has a bit of something for everyone. I'm surprised by the array of hate for the movie on these reviews, but to each his own. I admit the whole story is rather cliche, but I don't care. It's a good movie. It's exciting. It's fun. Why ruin that? It's tense and thrilling without being horrifying, it's funny and edge-of-your-seat action-packed. If you like alien movies you might be a bit disappointed--you barely see the alien, and the whole thing is rather more about family, childhood adventure, innocence and creativity, love, hate, and human interaction. I admit the ending was a bit less than it could be, but the ride up to it was well worth it! J.J. Abrams is notorious, it seems to me, for being fantastic at supplying enough creepy, mysterious events and curious things to keep a whole army of sci-fi/fantasy/thriller/horror/etc. buffs aroused for months on end, but he frequently has trouble, in my opinion, at supplying satisfying endings/answers to all of his mysteries. This movie is, as I already said, no exception. If you're like me, however, and find the ride to be why you came, you are in for a good one! Loved it. Plan on buying it eventually. Didn't know at all what to expect and it blew me away!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|it was a very good movie , could have been a little longer, but it was very good , I loved it.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I always thought her music was too \\"young\\" for me. On her last album I only liked \\"Skyscraper\\" and \\"Give your heart a break\\". I have to say I'm really digging this new album. It ranges from ballads to dance; all really nice. You can tell she's growing in her music. Great job Demi!
0618526412|4.0|I thought this was a very good book.  The characters were good.  John Singer was probably the best.  His relationship with his mute friend was very poignant.  I liked Mick Kelly as the young girl who was trying to broaden her horizons, both in terms of outlook and interests.  Biff Brannon was an interesting character, although his crush on Mick was creepy.  Otherwise he was an understanding person.  The other two characters, Doctor Copeland and Jake Blount did not work so well.  For some reason they just did not quite manage to achieve the same depth as the other three main characters.  Perhaps it was because they were much more political than the others, which led to less of a personal portrait.  The ending was good because just as the Second World War was breaking out, the characters' futures (with the exception of John Singer)were left hanging in the balance.  So, the uncertainties of the looming conflict overlapped with that of the characters' futures.
B000J103PC|5.0|I loved the story,,acting, and the clothes ,the dvd was in great condition,really loved it,to me  Ifeel that im part of the story.
B00007GZR5|5.0|My Junior Honors English class watched this after reading 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven' by Mitch Albom.  They walked away thinking about life and how they fit and what they can do to make a difference.
B008P9M614|5.0|I love watching House.  The best part of the show is seeing how confident, intelligent and rational House is.  It is inspiring to watch him from episode to episode.  As far as I know there are no other characters like him.  He is a truly a titan.  Everything that he does has a reason and he always does what is RIGHT.  House does not let his emotions cloud his judgement and that is likely why he is so brilliant in the show.  All of this comes together to not only provide entertainment while I am watching the show but it inspires me to work harder and to make the right decisions in my life.
B009NY43NY|5.0|It was a great story line, plus the inclusion of favorite characters from earlier in the series. Loved the ending.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Ssoo good. I just wanted to keep reading and reading!<br />Great book about family ties.<br />Just loved it. Want to read more of this author
B00BB22GQM|5.0|I'm really impressed with Vampire Weekend's new album - it's an excellent addition to what they've created so far.  It's a breath of fresh air - Fun music with smart lyrics!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Despite the press buildup and Academy Awards hoopla (which usually makes my expectations too high), this was funny, real, and not always predictable.  The supporting characters were great, and I feel that we're seeing two up and coming (already arrived?) great leads that were really well cast.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|I liked it but I do think that an older person  50s + is more likely to enjoy this  as they can identify more with the Mother.  It was a nice light comedy..
B000P0J06U|5.0|Have all the cards..loved the movie years ago..got around to buying it. Good movie. Really 20 words required?<br />It is a good movie.
1607050072|5.0|This book is a favorite of mine. The projects are fairly simple and have a great look. How fun to draw, paint and express yourself with fabric and stitching. What a great idea to use artwork with her daughter as her design. (13 Birds Mini Art Quilt) Inspires me to use some drawings from my children's younger years to make wall hangings to hang by their photo the age they were when they drew it. My grandmother was Swedish so some of the images remind me of her and many items she had in her home. I hope Kajsa Wikman puts out another book to enjoy.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I am the pinball junkie and would love to tournament if I had the time....I use this game when I am waiting for something, or someone...I have to turn the sound off which ruins the experience, but my friends don't appreciate the distraction...
B007ZD17XO|5.0|THIS IS A FUN TIME CONSUMING GAME. ONCE YOU START PLAYING YOU LOSE TRACK OF TIME. KIDS EVEN LOVE TO PLAY IT TOO. WORTH THE MONEY
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I can't figure out the concept, too old?  Or too not into figuring out the play of it...Now someone who plays games a lot could probably have a lot of fun with it...so I will keep for them to play.
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|Slow in just a few places but its all the buildup to a fine, original plot. Good action and acting. I really enjoyed this movie and don't want to give away any more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun that I play it every day even my brother has this game on his phone!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|This movie reminded me of the &#34;Last Starfighter,&#34; a well-acted, entertaining family-oriented movie. I enjoyed it and was happy to see a good story, inspiring characters and no content that makes you shut it off. Thanks for making a solid, entertaining movies that is appropriate for teens.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really wish I had spent coins on something else. It doesn't have all kinds of stuff. It's a great app. Juat not a perfect app.
B008Y7IINM|5.0|Great story, great twists and surpises. Really good performances by the actors. I really like this movie. Great job by the film makers.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Absolutely right on such a defining film about how life can throw you curves and what the choices you make are so important. I felt that all the actors were wonderful but the main characters were superb.
B00A9X7X6C|4.0|Time travel. Twists, turns. Great special efffects and the human element. I really like this movie and have watched it several times. It's well crafted, the acting is good, It's fun and thoughtful.
B00AAZOKS8|5.0|Everything she writes is awesome. My son loves her stories. They are dynamic! This is his favorite story ever. We read it every day.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|I hesitated when the kids wanted to see this movie. But, it's a good, clean, humorous movie with some good moral messages about prejudice and treating people right.
B00B00RJJO|5.0|This is such a great album. I always enjoy Billy's work, but this is really exceptional. Beautiful songs, performed in a gentle restrained way. His singing is really wonderful on this too, which isn't something I would have expected to say of him.
B001QFZADA|4.0|I had read one of his books years ago which helped while I was married but I wanted one for singles since I am now widowed. It<br />was very good showing how to work with your peers, or if dating.
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. An amazing story of science and a family of people who unwittingly got drawn into a remarkable scientific story.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wow. If you can get over the sex fest, there is a story that will draw you in and want you to keep reading
B00BESNKB8|1.0|Shocked that Tarantino allowed himself to be associated with this piece of crap in any way. Just awful in every possible way...and I love cheesy martial arts movies...this one was just bad.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A twisted story that makes you think about life and what the mind will do to survive. The story holds out with a smack in the face surprise ending that leaves you feeling all sorts of emotions.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|Spacey and Guy Pearce are fantastic as the major protagonists.  Loved the book and never thought it could be turned into a movie let alone a series.  This is a great movie that maintains the pace, the complexity, the period feel without loosing the audience.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you put up with all of the sex details in the first 2 books, you will be rewarded witht this last book. Worth it!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|After missing the library copy so many times, I finally broke down and bought my own - great movie, I still remember when I went to see it in the orginal theatrical release.  Good extras, but still a time tested classic.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Slow starter, but stick with it. The story weaves in and out with the different characters and ties them together in a way that keeps you on your toes.
B0013ND36G|4.0|Arnold is always fun to watch and while not as outstanding as Terminator 1, it is a satisfying end to the trilogy and makes for a fun afternoon watching all three during a cold winter afternoon with some hot chocolate and a large bowl of popcorn.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book fleshes out the story beyond the endless sex and keeps you engaged wondering where the author will take you. The end leaves you itching to read book 3
B005O30Y5Y|4.0|I read the books and found the end dragged a little - too long for one movie, and I found that watching the two together makes for a nice long holiday/weekend afternoon with hot butter popcorn.  The three heros grow up well and Deathly Hallows is a good extended end to this series.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is good because it has a lot of hidden object levels. The mini games are interesting. Good fun, relaxing.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Absolutely love &#34;the future mother in law&#34; and thoroughly enjoy this Hitchcock classic with such smart writing and two outstanding actors.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is a phenomenal film. It leaves nothing out of the imagination and is such a joy think about. Very suspenseful film and very emotional. The story is not dry at all and you will completely fall in love with the main actors. This movie accomplishes something rare, which is that it makes you feel as if you are in the movie. Must watch.
B001P9KR94|5.0|Was delighted to discover Dev Patel in The Best Exocitc Marigold Hotel and went back to watch Slumdog Millionaire again.  Having a roommate from India certain helped me understand the realities of modern India which made this a much more meaningful movie - fun to watch but the dark corners illuminate the reality of India today.
B00CHILW64|4.0|This movie portrays a tsunami quite well. Aside from that it is a very good suspense film and has you constantly thinking how an &#34;impossible&#34; situation could get any better.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Whenever I wonder what to do with myself of an evening, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of the three classics that I pull off the shelf and watch again.  I enjoy singing along and remembering what fun it is to occasionally go to the midnight shows - at 67 I can't stay up that late, but can still enjoy this great classic.
B009I0QTF8|4.0|I've been a fan for a long time, but I am not without complaints. Very good vibes in this music, but there are some recycled beats that, though improved upon, could have stayed out of this album.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|I read the books and found the end dragged a little - too long for one movie, and I found that watching the two together makes for a nice long holiday/weekend afternoon with hot butter popcorn.  The three heros grow up well and Deathly Hallows is a good extended end to this series.
B000WOXQDM|5.0|I loved this album in 1997 and I whenever my daughters complain that something isn't fair I sing, &#34;Just a Girl&#34; at them so I was excited when the Kindle offered the whole album streaming for $5.99.  Great for the summer.
6305428050|5.0|Elizabeth Shue is great and carries it off with elan.  Such a great modern popcorn movie for rooting for the babysitter and the kids - my pre-teen babysitter looked like the wicked witch of the west, I would have been over the moon to have had someone like ES, but this delightful fantesy is a good 90 minute escape.
0345803507|5.0|Love the story, keeps you reading more pages than you plan on therefore you read it faster to get to the next one.
B000CCBCAS|5.0|After Delaware approved same sex marriage, I watched this movie again and the the gay characters moved me a great deal - times are changing and this is a wonderful view of the dynamics of modern sex and marriage English-style.  Wonderful stylish fun with a many profound thoughts underneath all the fun.
0345803493|5.0|Having read the first I can say it's just as good and interesting. Keeps with the story line and can't put this one down either.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love. this. game. I'm addicted. to it love. it so fun u need to get it or are u to chicken.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Just re-visiting The Shield.  Have not seen since it went off air.  The episodes get gritty as the strike force team, Detectives of Farmington, Politicians and Criminal organizations take you on a thrill ride.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoy playing mahjong solitaire. This game is challenging but fun. Lots of levels, good graphics and pleasant background sound.  If you like these  kinds of games this is worth trying.
B001EBV0NU|1.0|The DVD we received did not have any sound track, so we could not hear them talking.  We are very unhappy with this DVD
1417082658|4.0|I actually liked this movie and I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen movies. This movie was interesting and makes you create a love/hate relationship with the characters.
B0011Z78R6|5.0|I do not have the discs yet but had these in earlier years and really want the ones on its way.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Many years had passed since my last viewing of the Jurassic Park movies, and my mind had buried their badness in favor of their goodness. So when the chance came to buy this blu-ray set inexpensively--the cover was worn, but the disks were perfect--I did.<br /><br />The original JURASSIC PARK has its merits, especially near the beginning of the movie, but it also has its demerits. Specifically, unconvincing moments that are disrespectful of the serious viewer. Reviewing it alone, I might give it three stars, maybe four.<br /><br />The second movie, THE LOST WORLD, is terrible: a long succession of unrealistic, implausible, and unconvincing sequences. Still, the beasties are nice to look at. Reviewed by itself = two stars.<br /><br />I watched JURASSIC PARK III on the day after I watched THE LOST WORLD (JP-II). Therefore I was expecting more of the same: disgusting unrealism. But the leading sequence--man and boy flying a parasail--is not bad. And then the camera switches to sequences in America, and--believe it or not--an actual story develops (as opposed to the wretched scripting and the exploitation of dinosaurs that characterize JP-II). Even as JP-III's events move to an airplane over the second dinosaur island, there continues to be development of story and characters. Indeed, contrary to what I never feel in JP-II, in JP-III I feel approval. JURASSIC PARK III is not perfect. Especially during the action sequences, you can nitpick against unrealistic moments. But there is so very much unrealism in JP-II, that the moments of unrealism in JP-III become minor and tolerable.<br /><br />The third movie redeems the set. Because of it and because of the impressive dinosaurs in all three, I give this set five stars.<br /><br />I am not capable of praying with honesty, but I can fervently HOPE that the fourth Jurassic Park movie looks to JP-III as its mentor, not JP-I and ESPECIALLY not JP-II.

B0082RHRHC|4.0|I like this classic love story, but love the fact that now I am able to enjoy it as an audiobook!
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|I love this movie. Great performances and great sets and costumes.  I've seen it several times now. I really should buy a copy.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|..but this book was slow, dragged on and I felt like I struggled to get through each chapter. In the previous books I had to force myself to stop reading. This one is a fight just to make it through it so i can get to Book 5.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was really happy to see a &quot;myst&quot; style game for a change instead of all of those hidden object games. The puzzles in this were interesting to solve, and the hint system was well integrated. No having to earn coins or purchase extra hints. The graphics were also really well done - can't wait for the sequel!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Justin Timberlake does not disappoint with this album, Gave this to myself for Mothers day,  Loved it from beginning to end..
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|It would be good if you could stack the commands better like in the other games in this series, but that doesn't hurt the game very much and this is an excellent example of why dash games are so great!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Fun game for the whole family. Easy enough for the young ones to play and for the older kids too.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Amazon's FAOTD is so RARELY anything useful like this app, it's so refreshing to see something other than a silly game game geared to the tweeners rather than than their real market, the baby boomers.  This product is great.  Very basic calculator with an extremely useful tape record of your calculations, essential for office productivity.  The app allows you to edit the wording on the tape, so as the screenshots indicate you can itemize various items by editing the text on the tape.  The app also allows you to copy and paste the totals, making its useful universal and transferable.  The only minisicule downsides I see are that there are only three color schemes for the layout and most are \\"cute\\" pastels.  I'd prefer an ICS layout.  Also, the buttons are very basic, no sculpting etc.  But these are cosmetics items and do not affect a great program.  Thank you.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and now I bought it to share with my own kids.  They also enjoyed it.
B005R32L66|2.0|It does not work well at all.  The picture cuts out every few seconds and its very frustrating.  You may want to wait until they improve it before you download the free app.
0810993139|5.0|My 7 year old son loves this book and carries it with him wherever he goes. He has made his own doodles in it and it has really sparked his creativity. I'm glad he has found a book that he treasures. Even if it says poop and moron. Hey, maybe that's why he likes it to begin with - lol :)
B009GEFXLC|3.0|Authors surely need a break. Characters are by this time more and more inconsistent, except Espo. But if authors go that way they will break him too. I'd hate to see the show to end, but all ends in life...<br />Much better than sports anyway.
B008L1F91A|5.0|Good stuff and great stuff.. I am collecting again and this was and awesome grab, I'm tryin to gather all the new 52 justice leauge statues and detail are amazing
0307200477|5.0|A timeless classic that has enchanted babies for generations. I read it to my kids, and got this one as a gift for my grand daughter.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I would have to admit that i enjoy youtube and this makes a very convenient tool to view videos but it doesn't seem to give me the same searches that i get with my laptop or desktop.  if it had a better search function then i would give it 5stars.
B0082EC7UM|4.0|It you like this song you will like this mix.  It is fun, catchy, and great to groove to! My nephew asks me to play it over and over again.
B00BCV3HGU|5.0|Great workout music!  I enjoy listening to this style of music which keeps me pumped up.  I think Will should have gotten more credit for this album.  No different than what T Pain does and still get more credit.  Just my opinion.
0307474259|3.0|I was disappointed that this book does not live up to its title; it only deals with proximate causes of obesity and the debate about carbohydrate in diet.<br />It does not address the matter of millions of people who eat what they like and never get fat.<br />There is some mention of genetics but no mention of epigenetics and no mention of the effects of the Dutch Famine of 1944.<br />Although there is some mention of obesity in Polynesian peoples, Taubes ignores the theory that Polynesians have a genetic disposition to weight gain as a result of the long sea voyages undertaken by the forefathers.<br />Taubes seems to work from the America premise that everybody can become obese with the wrong diet, and can loose weight with the right diet. He starts from a false assumption.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This program is excellent for anyone who wants to learn basic strategy.  It is entertaining and relaxing.  Matching is a very important skill in geometry and in carpentry.
0061537969|5.0|I am not a &#34;reader&#34; -- BUT, this book was fabulous.  I could not put it down.<br /><br />If I could find more books like this, I would read ALL the time.
B004HMQ7BI|5.0|It was really sweet and good--nice for a late night surrounded by covers, cats and ice cream --I would recommend watching--but 2.99 is too high a price--however try to find it anywhere else
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it, can't wait for season 4, I could not wait to see all the seasons and have enjoyed them very much
B00C33M2EE|5.0|This CD has everything that was left off the first CD, plus everything that has come out since. I also have everything that Jon and Steve did before The Piano Guys, so this is an essential addition to my collection.<br /><br />Make sure to get the Deluxe Edition. It comes with both a CD and DVD, and it doesn't cost much more. It's so nice to be able to watch the videos without the YouTube interface!
B00ATP24NW|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing! I bought it on a little bit of a whim, as I had only listened through the songs once, and I didn't really know all of the songs. But I am so glad that I bought this album. All of the songs are great, and they show a diversity in their sound, which I appreciate, as all the songs don't sound similar. I also have to mention that I bought the Target edition of the album, which contains seven extra tracks (two in addition to the five extra that are on the deluxe), and it was worth the extra money! I have to say I love some of the bonus tracks more than some of the tracks on the album, and they are absolutely amazing!<br />Favorite songs/ special songs (besides the two big singles from the album):<br />Tiptoe<br />Bleeding Out<br />River (bonus)<br />America (bonus)<br />Overall, this album is great and is very worthwhile the investment!
1582701709|5.0|this book is for everyone. it can change everyone's life. i love it. i recommond to everybody who like to have better life.
B0060MYK7G|4.0|I can say, there was a lot violence thru the story line. I can say, this actors and actress made their characters so real.  The whole cast perform outstanding work.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Its ok - a bit like hunger games. Its interesting and well written but think there could be a bit of a folllowing of hunger games type of story.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Multi-purpose case that lives up to its promises. Well made, strong, and very functional for a great price!  The various positions of the case make it perfect for reading, watching movies, and playing games.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I liked this new mystery puzzle game but some of the things in it were kinda creepy. It was fun and scary at the same time but it didn't last long at all. Although it was something new and fun to play.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book. Thought it was a nice read about a kid who is different and teaches a valuable lesson about friend shop and treat people the way you would want others to treat you. I liked the book and would recommend it for ages 9 and up.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|There are not enough stars for this book! I have been reading the WOT series for many years and I consider Robert Jordan one of the best writers! Brandon Sanderson did a fabulous job finishing the series and I am a bit sad for it to come to an end. What an amazing ending though!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love his voice ,the way he sings he is the new Frank Sinatra I have some of his other albums and I hear them frequently
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I found this game entertaining. But I would like options to change the background and the pictures on the tiles for variety.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|he has a great voice, very musical and strong I have other albums from him and I like to here them they are very romantic
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hello i ask to mine craft pocket edition to put this app free in 3 days more becouse i realy want it but i donot get any money please make my dream come true from p.r  att nick name johnney cage
B0098466CK|5.0|This album is as good as there others and there all great. If you can find the special edition it has 2 extra songs on it.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Very interesting particularly when it based on a true story.  I don't want to give away the story, but I would recommend.
B00684J49U|5.0|I love this series for the shock and awe factor.  You never know what will be around the corner.  I love it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This this book was a slow start, but it didn't take long for me to start getting into the story. For a moment, while Katie was flashing back on her time with Kevin and her experience escaping from him, the story reminded me of the movie Sleeping With the Enemy. But the similarities stopped there. There was another vibe there that is uniquely Nicholas Sparks. If you're read him, you'll know what I mean. Katie, though is a strong woman, it's like she's needy. She has to learn to live all over again while liking this guy she meets in the small town decided to hid out in. Of course Alex, is pretty much the perfect guy, with the perfect kids. Polar opposite from Katie's crazy husband.<br /><br />The story is somewhat predictable up until the last few pages. What an eerie and somewhat creepy ending! I didn't expect that exactly. I always thought there was something a bit off with Jo, but I didn't know what! How clever! But it all clicked into place for me a half step before Katie revealed it for us. Well played Mr.Sparks! That is an ending that you'll remember.<br /><br />Once I got adjusted to the fake Southern accents, the narration was fine. It did throw me a bit off when the narrator started speaking because even though I'm not from the South, it sounded fake. I talk to many Southerners and they sound nothing like this narrator.<br /><br />After listening to Safe Haven, I really want to see the movie now. It's not in the theaters anymore, but it's not on Netflix yet either. It just came out last week for rent on On-Demand and on Google TV. I guess I'll have to pay $5 bucks to watch it on Google TV. I have a feeling just from watching the movie trailer, some changes to the story have been made. I hope it doesn't ruin the book.
0439813786|4.0|This book is very unique. It is loaded down with pencil drawings that tell the story but again there are over 500 pages so there are several pages of the written word to go along with the cool pictures. My dad made it sound like I could read this book in about twenty minutes but it took several hours to get through the whole story. It was overall a sad story of Hugo's life, Living within the walls of a 1931 Paris train station with a knack for fixing clocks and stealing for food. I thought this book was a cool picture book that I could tear through but it ended up being a very intriguing deeper than I realized short story with a lot of heart. The movie Hugo is based on this book, I am curious to see how it turns out.
193700788X|1.0|will never buy your books again, not fair to readers and fans. i understand you are the writer, but you cheated us as fans and made lots and lots of money doing it...
B009CV7IIA|5.0|This is an awesome book for Geeks...Almost the entire story takes place online in a virtual world. The creator of the virtual world has begun a contest to take over the reigns of the world. He was a teenager in the 80's and his contest is covered with 80's pop culture references. Music, Movies, and especially video games. Those that grew up in the 80's will dig this book for all of its shout outs. You 20 somethings will dig it for its online world. Probably the most enjoyable book I have read this year. It is a bit popcorn fun predictable near the end but all the more fun when the bad guys lose!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very fun and addictave game, good game to play to waste time. There is not alot of skill to this game so you can easily play with out paying much attention to it. You don't have to buy coins for a good experence.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Kvothe's adventures continue at the University....and than the courts of the Maer....and is introduce to the Adem mercenaries....Kills some folks...spends some time in the fae....becomes a fighter, a lover, an arcanist...its good...900 plus pages now we know what Kvothe has been up to from age 11-17. I guess he is middle aged man in the Waystone telling his life story to chronicler....So Book three only has to cover from age 17-55? should be roughly 45,000 pages. We will see how this all wraps up.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Tryed playing for 1/2 hour and lost interest on the differnt options and settings.  The game play just seems to far off from the original brand and I can't get used to it. The app ran fine and looked nice.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is told entirely in flashback...There are interlude chapters of the main character telling his story to Chronicler. It is an interesting literary device. This is book one in a trilogy so it will be interesting to see how the story of the flash back meets an end with things happening in the present.<br /><br />This trilogy has some cool potential...so far are main character is only 15 years old, but he is a genius child and has already called the name of the wind.
B008KE3960|5.0|I played this for a few evenings and enjoyed it. The application runs well but can slow down when you have a lot of planes flying. Good app for kids also, my son and I both played it together.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This is a great quick read. Spooky, creepy....a bit on the predictable side...but its got old houses and time travel. I would recomend it. The use of photos through out the book really adds to the atmosphere of the book really cool
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really never buy games but I only buy them if their like super awesome. And this one is. I enjoy playing this game and it was worth the money
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is my favorite show. I love the actors, plot, setting. Everrything is set so well by hbo. The story completely entraps you into the show and you get lost and always wanting more by the end of the episode.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best series I've seen in a long time.  Love the british background.  It's interesting to see how the &#34;other half&#34; live.
B00B1TJO10|4.0|With considerable pain, I give Andy Field's marvelous, somewhat spectacular book, a 4 star rating.  I bought it in Kindle, then in paper.  Kindle absolutely lacks the technology to offer the book.  I would rate the overall Kindle experience for this book around 2 stars.  I will explain in a bit.  On the other hand, for content, style, and all that makes for a great book, the paper version has it all hands down.  I am a Ph.D. and an author.  Never have I seen such an intelligent, witty book on statistics or for that matter on any technical subject. Field has helped me to understand statistics and their use in research in a way I never thought was possible. The paper version is 5+ stars.  But books are more than just words in print.  They are also a format in and of themselves, which brings me back to Kindle.  I have around 200 purchases on Kindle, this is my first technical one.  It is not possible to expand the graphs and charts, which are essentially unreadable (nearly microscopic) on the Kindle and are essential in understanding the subject matter. The paper version uses multiple columns and color coding to add to its readability.  These are lost on Kindle Touch.  Additionally, it is not at all easy to get back to your original location when you opt to tap a reference or go to a figure.  You actually have to write down your original location number and \\"go to\\" the \\"got to\\" menu and type in the number \\"to get back.\\"  For me the Kindle works fine for a linear read, start at the beginning and go straight to the end...and I love it...but not a book that by its nature requires mobility. Now Andy, author to author, sit down with the Kindle and try to read your own book. Make sure you have a box of tissues nearby. :)
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|Of this is the genius of all times. His lyrics was before time during time, and will be after time. He has timely music that will go on and on.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Best game I've played in a long time. Well worth the price. Highly recommended. Playing it on the Galaxy S4.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|To start this review, I'd like to explain a little about myself.  I'm not a computer programmer and have never taken classes or gone to school for it, but I do use my free time to play with and learn how to use my computer.  Basically, I'm not a novice when it comes to the different kinds of programs.<br /><br />My personal reasons for getting this product are simple; I have a bunch of old cassette tapes cluttering my home, and I wanted to put them on my computer so I can box up my cassettes and have some breathing room.  In that respect, this program has done exactly what I wanted - the cassette tapes are now accessible from my computer.<br /><br />However, from the start there were issues with the product.  When I opened it, the software install CD had a large crack in it.  Not a scratch on the surface, mind you, but an actual crack.  Luckily, this was more of a disappointment than a setback, because the software installed successfully.<br /><br />My disappointment was increased, however, when I began to read the manual.  It was clearly designed for more experienced users, which wouldn't have been too much of a problem, except that it was clearly written in another language and then poorly translated into English.  I puzzled through it and got the program installed, but at that point, I would have considered it a 4-star product.<br /><br />Then, the moment of truth came, and I inserted a cassette and tried to record.  Once more, however, I was disappointed, as it wouldn't pick up any audio at all.  Nothing I tried could help, and in desperation, I came back to Amazon to read the product reviews.  One very helpful reviewer had the same problem as I did, and he explained that what he needed to do was to turn the volume up the whole way on the actual device.<br /><br />I tried this with mine, and it worked, but the experience took it down one more star to where it currently is, at 3-stars.  There was an awful lot of hassle, and the audio program that is included is pretty useless.  It's difficult and tedious to separate the tracks, and I still haven't managed to figure out how to save them as separate files, nor have I tried to export them.  Basically, what it boils down to is that I have the entire cassette in one audio file that I can only use with the Audacity program.  This is a very cost-effective way to preserve your cassette tapes for future enjoyment, but it's difficult for a first-time user.<br /><br />Hopefully this has been helpful!
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|I am not sure why Will Smith turned down this roll. I have at say that this movie is Quentin Tarantino style. Action and funny. he always knows have to bring it.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Loved the movie, and the 3D was Awesome. This is one I will watch & enjoy again and again, worth every penny.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love Michael's singing style. . .he has a great band to back him up.  The duet with Reece Witherspoon is especially good!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I got into this series by chance and I could not put it down once I started. Cannot wait for the last series to come out. Easy and nice read with very real characters just trying to get through life's trials.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I was surprised by how enthralling this political drama is. Usually not my type of show, but I'm obsessed! I can't watch enough of it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Once I read this one I had to get the next book. Easy read and loved the characters and how the developed.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was surprised by how enthralling this political drama is. Usually not my type of show, but I'm obsessed! I can't watch enough of it!
B00932A4XE|5.0|Very fun to watch! Loved all the characters, and how the different stories all weave in and out of each other.
0823013626|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to learn various methods for creating surface finishes in polymer clay.  Can't beat the price or shipping, and you would never know it was a used book.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|The movie had funny parts but some scenes were slow and uncomfortable. Overall worth watching.<br />I love Seth Rogen. This was a very believable mother son combo.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I am disappointed that it was for only one season.  I would recommend the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; as a follow up.  Why is this off the air and crappy reality shows are still on.
086140324X|5.0|I actually heard the name Pratchett, then saw the movie. I decided to read the book. A short fantasy novel, that is set up all on its own. This is a hilarious and refreshing fantasy that is comic, full of action, character depth and adventure. You have the ever first year wizard (who's been a first year for forty years) Rincewind, the worlds first ever tourist, Twoflower and a magical luggage of sapient pear wood that follows his owner faithfully (Twoflower) where ever he goes. Through the mountains, catching the city on fire, and the Unseen University. These two have the most hilarious and fun filled adventure in the fantasy world. Death is also ever present, always trying to get Rincewind, the wizards can't seem to track him down no matter how many demons they summon,or mirrors they look into and yes, or course, the God are still mad at the giants for not return the lawnmower and they love smashing atheist's windows at night. Rincewind and Twoflower must escape being sacrificed by being put over the edge of the world (the world is a flat disc on the back of four elephants standing on a giant space turtle), and make their way through and inverted mountain with dragons that come from your imagination. A must read for every fantasy goer!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I started reading this with my son to bond with him but I quickly read ahead and finished it. Exciting to read the rest of the series. So much better than the movie was!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it's better then temple run its really cool I play this game 24 7 it is a very cool game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#!
B00992CF6W|5.0|as I said in the title best game ever I can't wait to I can get on servers and also people who hate on this game they don't no what they're missing so try it
B001609SQA|5.0|OUTSTANDING MOVIE A MUST BUY KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.<br />ALL THE ALIEN MOVIES ARE JUST GREAT ,LOVE THEM.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have to admit i was skeptical at first about the new author taking over, but he has done a wonderful job of bringing the story to its climax. The battles are exciting and you feel the pain of the characters losses.
B00000ILDF|5.0|ONE OF THE VERY BEST , TAKE THE TIME TO WATCH THE ALIEN MOVIE. YOU WILL BE A FAN BUY THEM ALL.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My girls love this update to what's becoming a smart phone/ tablet classic franchise. This is such a hoot with the Pigs. Our youngest memorably sobbed one night stuck on a level, 'the pigs are mocking me'.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Was a much quicker read than the first book in the trilogy. Looking forward to the 3rd!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Same as above when he opens the market band taps on eggs it  always says international error and says we have been notified but it doesn't work still
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|Fun to play.<br />This game was fun for both my grandson and me. We enjoy trying to outdo each other.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|This movie is offers nothing new and follows the line of hundreds of other movies: it is predictable and cheesy. The story line may be a little less appealing than most movies; however, Josh Duhamel's terrible haircut does at times make for interesting viewing. Hough offers a visual delight but an otherwise uninspiring performance.<br /><br />I recommend this movie if you are looking for a way to kill a couple of hours or if you just need a cute movie to watch with your love. Otherwise, keep browsing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a amazing game great for all ages super fun great graphics and amazing sounds over all its a great game.
B008TTPQXA|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book on so many levels. I loved the way it was written and the author's amazing ability to capture a concept or idea in a way that I could relate to, understand and visualize.  The author takes you through his journey, his thought processes and not only opens his heart but also reveals a glimpse of his true self in this very delicate, mysterious, wondrous discovery. I suspect  this NDE will continue to inspire and touch many, and more importantly finally give hope to a jaded and lost generation.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is so much fun. The game shows that kids could also plant while playing with neon the adorable little fish in the sea
0060245867|5.0|Love this series. This is a classic book that you must have form your home collection. Working on buying the whole series.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Thought it would be the same cheesy story but it was great. Good characters, good evil cousins who just got the part. I liked it a lot. Get it. Read it. Enjoy!
B005K8QIS0|5.0|A wonderful suspense series that keeps you guessing until the end. Jason Isaacs is a Good choice for the lead, his interactions with the other characters keeps you in stitches.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome and everyone should try it. You get to create awesome creations and fight off monsters with swords to defend your self with. Those people who say it sucks don't realize how hard it is to implement every thing from the pc version.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|wish I hadn't bought it for my kindle fire.  When you get to the child room one o f the crayon is hidden behind the clue tab and it is impossible to tab on it.  this needs to be fix. I want my coins coins back.
B00080ZG10|5.0|One of my fave movies, great story, great performances, and cinematography. Leo does an interesting howard hughes and gives him life in a realistic way. Love it
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I think Misremembered Man is a book of true literary art and not just a book manufactured for commercial success.
B004TI1WME|5.0|This is a great calculator for doing simple arithmetic, and the Virtual Tape is so useful.  I love how you can add text to entries in the tape, and the ability to go back and change an entry and have the totals adjust is a wonderful feature.<br /><br />But I wish there was a way to export the virtual tape to CSV format so I could drop it into Excel.  The copy/paste feature is okay, but you lose all the formatting.
B00902MCVY|5.0|These Guys are Epic as hell. Such Amazing music. If You love power metal, Then Wintersun is Definately a go!
0385535147|3.0|It seems like every recent Grisham book suffers from the same thing:  really strong start but very weak endings.  I loved this story through the witness relocation process followed by the main character's location/identity being seemingly blown.  But then everything becomes completely implausible, from Vanessa's undercover/espionage skills that come out of nowhere, to the overly complex travel schedule of the main character.  The resolution in the end is unexpected and therefore interesting, but I wish the road to get there was more believable and written as well as the first parts.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Awesome book, the suspense is unbearable, great description s of the arena and details about blood and wounds are excellent!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I couldn't put it down! The author wove a wonderful tale that kept me hooked through the entire story (or should I say stories).
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Good book, kept the suspense going. Happy with the ending.  A heart warming twist of romance.  Sparks does it again
B007I2BZIE|5.0|You're either gonna love Rush or hate them, and this review won't change that. But I will say this: If you once loved Rush, but lost your faith some time in the late 80's and 90's, do yourself a favor and give this one a listen. It rocks. It's beautiful. There's nothing the least bit cringe-worthy on it, and no one raps. It's a masterful achievement that stands alongside their best previous work. The production is a modern, which may be a distraction for some people who are tired of hearing music saturated in plugins, but unlike most radio rock it doesn't sound like it came out of the same batch of presets that Taylor Swift uses. At times along their evolution, Rush have adopted elements from the popular music of the time with mixed results. While some of the songs demonstrate a harder recent-era metal edge, they never seem out of place or forced. The bands sounds like they're entirely comfortable in the style they've created here. The whole album has been growing on me since the first listen and I hum the songs all day. Haters are gonna hate, but that's never stopped these guys. I don't know how many more albums they've got in them, but if this is the last one it's a heck of a way to go out. The last few songs are especially beautiful.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It was super we enjoyed it and my sister came with her husband and son and they enjoyed it too
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Well paced, interesting theories, love the historic set and &#34;real feel&#34; of Viking life!  Action packed, and suspenseful all the way.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I really enjoyed this read.  It is humbling to know the sacrifice our warriors endure while fighting for our freedoms.  This is an important story, a must read for all. Some expected colorful language in parts, but not over the top.  I found myself fighting tears as I read the heroic details and tragic end to these SEALs.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|While the horrors of the orphanage very disturbing, the character depictions and dialogue were excellent and charming.  The story was woven with finesse and concluded with an element of riveting suspense.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|a cut above the genre.  i really enjoyed this movie.  appreciated the lack of gore with some genuine spooky moments.  perhaps a bit contrived (I thought we saw a little too much of the ghost) but decent neverhteless.
143353083X|3.0|Maybe I should have gotten the one with large print, other then that I appreciate my bible. I like the break down of each verse which helps me to better understand what I have read and it gives other references to better elaborate on a particluar subject.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I was interested in reading this book as we think our grandpa may have been one of these orphans.  Hence, I found the sections about Vivian's past the most interesting and disturbing.  The idea of these people taking it upon themselves to split up families and ship children off to unknown fates is abhorrent.  It put me in mind of the film, Oranges and Sunshine, which depicts an equally disturbing time in Great Britain when children were taken from their families because someone decided they weren't fit to raise them and they were shipped off to Australia.  Discovering this shocking behavior by supposedly Christian civilized nations makes the book well worth the read.  The movie, Oranges and Sunshine, is very well done, too.
B007N8RULO|5.0|luv playing the game on my kindle while relaxing on my chair  great concentration play for many hours till go to sleep
B00992CF6W|5.0|Create your own world, do what you want, kill zombies, build a skyscraper, dig the largest tunnel known to man - It's all up to you...
1400067820|5.0|This is a truly fascinating book though not by any means an easy read.  The author shows in marvellous detail how things which can survive and adapt to changes or damage are those which will survive the longest.  Adapt and survive.  But it isn't as simple as that as might be expected from a book of over five hundred pages including the index, bibliography and copies notes and appendices.<br /><br />The subjects touched upon range from medicine, ancient Greece and Rome, modern New York, the banking crisis, food and governments with many diversions on what is a totally engrossing journey.  The author writes in an engaging and down to earth style which helps to make the subject matter comprehensible even when he is dealing with complex issues.  It is the sort of book which will repay more than one reading in my opinion.<br /><br />There are many brilliant descriptions but one which sticks in my mind is this `A Stoic is a Buddhist with attitude . . .' This is a thought-provoking book which may cause you to question many of the assumptions you make about your daily life and the people you meet.  It is a marvellous read in my opinion and will be of interest to anyone who likes reading psychology or science.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use this app. all of the time and by using it I am able to better determine plans for the day.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love this app. keeps my mind working and forces patience!  if you take your time you won't have to spend any money
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The characters literally come off the pages as I find I can see the people so well described.  The fast pace of the novel makes for good reading.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great game. love playing it. pretty easy to play. very addicting. good game to play to pass the time away.
B006ID01OS|5.0|Having just gone thru a corporate reorganization followed by a completely new strategic focus that didn't seem very well designed or communicated, this book is incredibly clear on the requirements for &#34;good&#34; strategy including clarity on the purpose (aka difference) a company exists to serve in relationship to its customers.
B0031KE9C6|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows of all time and I'm glad to own the 1st season with the movie coming out. I can't recommend this enough.
B00B4804KS|3.0|It might wok or it might not. At the very least all. Had to return the first one and Amazon was gret big no trouble. 2nd one was a long time loading but did get it to load. I have a very nice system $8,000.00-$10,000.00. It is a very nice system and hooked up to internet for updates. Sony blue-ray player. I own over 3,500 movies and 50-75 3d and this one just is not a great movie. After the 15 minutes to get it to load the piture was wonderful have only seen one other with this great of piture. Last if I did not love this movie as much as  Ido I would send it back Dan
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've recently received these, and these are very nice to have.<br /><br />I'm a PC gamer, but I have a different headset for that purpose. I got these, because sometimes I'd like to sit in front of my TV, grab my wireless mouse, and enjoy some stuff from distance. I bought these primarily for that purpose, but now that I have them, I think I'll use them for more than that. For example, now I can enjoy some music with this headset, while cooking :)<br /><br />Firstly, this headset does not have cables; so the cable problems are out of the question. You still need to plug the charging cable to charge it naturally, and I'd suggest that you should take extra caution while doing so, to avoid any possible problems. Batteries are very durable, and would allow you to enjoy using these without much of a hassle.<br /><br />Sound quality wise, I'm not used to this headset yet. I enjoy the deep bass, but the higher end of the spectrum sounds a bit like listening to something in a steel bucket; you might need to adjust the equalizer to get rid of this \\"effect\\" (I set my EQ settings to -6 -3 0 4 2 -2 2 -6 -3 0, and this sounds exactly what I'm used to). The surround feels great when you boot something that this headset \\"supports\\". This headset is closed; but the noise cancelling is not that great, however I appreciate it as it cancels most of the outside noise, especially when you are listening to something, you wouldn't hear a thing (take it as a warning if you want).<br /><br />There are 3 programmable buttons, I adjusted them to mute Teamspeak, open my favourite music, and shuffle between them. I think it is more than enough for headphones. The microphone quality is allright, and it mutes itself when it is raised, which is handy. Also, you can control the volume directly from it, which is also very nice.<br /><br />Build wise, I cannot comment on it yet, but it looks very sturdy, and strong. If you have a big head however, these might cut the blood circulation to your brain, so try one set before you buying one if you can!<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for wireless headphones, these are what you seek. If you want virtual 7.1 solution, I cannot compare this to any other, but I am very impressed with it too. Thanks for reading, have a nice day!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is one those games were no matter how much u play it, its still fun. so I highly reccomend geting this app.

B004BLTNM0|3.0|The castration seans were a bit skitchy, I guess I was expecting more explicit details of the guys being castrated.  The rape seans were quite vived and believable.
B009UVWBMA|5.0|I have heard some of her albums, and wow. She definitely has a talent. I am a fan now for sure.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Great game, no frills but good for chillaxing<br />Some say needs a sound track but I prefer without<br />Good app of the day choice
0743201140|1.0|I bought the book specifically so that I could take the StrengthsFinder assessment.  The code in the book is invalid.  The description of the book made it sound like they were selling new copies with valid codes but that is not the case.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Comong from someone in the medical profession, it really adds credibility to the story.  His research prior to writing this credits to him.
B0060AY85C|4.0|Current students and recent grads met to discuss this book for an AA Lit class at CSU in Baltimore, MD. This novel is short, but still ripe with distilled themes of Morrison's previous writings.  If you're new to Morrison, this may be a good place to start because it's not too long and not as dense as her other works.  If you're expecting more of the same from Morrison, then you may not find what you are looking for here.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is the third book I've read by Gillian Flynn.I absolutely love her work, she is a literary genius. I would absolutely read one of the three I've read over again on a reading day. Fantastic.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love playing this game, I look forward to playing it daily.  The only thing that would make it better would being able to get additional free credit.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|This, like books about death camps in WWII, is a haunting accouot of how cruel humans can be.  The story is told a bit more objectively than I would have liked.  It fails to delve into the psychological toll that the camp had on Shin
B000FC10HA|5.0|As an engineer and perpetual tinkerer, this book is invaluable for learning to focus and market ideas efficiently.  Really a pleasure to read and hard to put down
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I enjoy the aurthor's style of writing.  It is interestingly about people who are missing something in their lives and may unexpectedly find it in the story.
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|No real storyline it jumps about so much I  dare you to try and watch the whole movie without losing interest
B00BZXM3VA|5.0|kurt vile has a way with lyrics. he alludes to his fears, his shortcomings, and the problems of the world - without complaining and in a way that allows him and the listener to transcend those issues. he's also a romantic in a completely authentic and cool manner. wakin on a pretty daze is his best so far. lyrically wise and musically interesting and comfortable. highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />favorites include &#34;girl named alex&#34; and &#34;run away&#34;
B003H6KRIE|5.0|After repeated watching of the series, it never loses it's shine or enteraining value. Watching all the three series together is pure enjoyment. Matt Damon is perfect to play this Jason Bourne in the series. This package has the complete series with a nice price to own.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was a great book. Picked it up because of the price and was rewarded with fun, thoughtful read. Didn't know there was a movie coming out until half way through the book. If done right it could be pretty good.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|Unsure how this product has gotten fairly good reviews. If you care at all about the quality of your images then please do not purchase this product. Very low quality images despite being 10mp.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Wonderful main character, I wondered if she was autistic. I particularly loved learning about the flowers.  Well written but some supporting characters were not fully realized making their actions seem odd or doubtful.
B000JIHP88|5.0|The product was in excelent conditions, really nice, y bought and all the terms were right. my child will love it
B0016OOS16|5.0|I bought this for my nephews birthday.  He designs video games, the animation parts.  He states, &#34;This makes designing so much easier as you can immediately see your character in 3D!&#34;.
B000P0J09C|5.0|This book is right on as far as the boot camp and the war scenes. It's a shame to see what these GI's went through and how they were treated when they came home. More people should be sensitive to those times!
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|Wish i could buy it from the UK site! such brilliant episodes and a wonderful adaption! but wish i could contribute to the show's ratings from where i live! please dont cancel it NBC!!
0756666937|5.0|My elementary school friends love LEGOS books, magazines, and all things LEGO. Although I already had several copies of other giant LEGO books, I decided to splurge and buy the updated copy. Even after they have poured over this book so many times, some of them still beg parents to buy a copy of their own. So, Mom and Dad, go ahead and buy this new LEGO book as a special award for hard work done, or buy it to stimulate summer reading.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|The fish swim around, and you randomly click on things and try to make something happen. And nothing happens. There's no challenge and it's extremely boring. For a child that can't read, it's even worse.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow! What a read! I could not put it down, and I usually take 2  weeks to read a book. Hunger Games only took me 2 days!
B005KITK6C|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 8 year old son.  It was lower priced than at the lego store and was exactly what I thought I was buying.
B000Z27HLS|3.0|I'm at least halfway into this movie and am thinking of removing the disc and putting it away. It's just not interesting, the heroine isn't very appealing at all. It's dull, not much story at all. I know I read the book but don't remember it being this silly and boring.
B005PK56TA|4.0|It was condensed and didn't do justice to ALL of the stories participants. There was more than horror lying within the house, there was an evil that was not completely brought out.
B00947N6D8|3.0|The Rise of the Guardians was a fun little movie for the kids who had been asking me about who was Jack Frost!
B00C7JAAH0|5.0|I love it! As usual, Lady A has delivered an excellent album!  I really love Golden and It Ain't Pretty.
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|If you went to college sometime between 1985 and 1995, you probably listened to a lot of R.E.M. whether you wanted to or not (unless you spent Friday & Saturday nights in the library and didn't own a radio).  In my case, I wanted to.  R.E.M. is in that rare space occupied by Pearl Jam, Van Halen, The Doors, and maybe the Beach Boys - that space being called \\"Contenders for the greatest American rock band of the last 50 years\\".<br /><br />_Green_ is their debut effort for Warner Bros. records.  R.E.M. had gained a massive college following under their previous 5 albums, culminating in _Document_, the fulcrum for their entire output.  After the success of _Document_, the band made a conscious effort to do things differently and, while the result is not completely, 100% new, the more pop-ish, 80's-influenced semi-dance numbers like \\"Pop Song 89\\" and \\"Stand\\" were not in the slightly mordant, melancholic vibe that the fan base was used to up to that point.  Nonetheless, \\"World Leader Pretend\\" and \\"Orange Crush\\" showed same thoughtful, serious-style song writing that also was an evolution of style and more sophisticated than much of what had come before.<br /><br />Included with this release is a concern given in Greensboro, NC on the tour supporting this album.  Mixed for this release from the original master tapes, this show included most of the _Green_ album along with many R.E.M. favorites up to that time.  Also included in the box are 4 postcards of the band members (not much into these myself, but others may enjoy) and a poster (which I may donate to my kids should they like this album and ask for it).<br /><br />A word about the sound in light of another review here.  I found nothing to complain about.  Yes, this does not sound like the 1989 CD - this CD is louder, fuller, and mixed with the idea that people may use it to rip MP3's for their mobile players.  That's how all CD's are made in 2013 because that's the format most people use to listen to music in 2013.If you do choose to play it on your stereo, like I did in my car, you will not find anything to complain about in my view.  Solid bass, but clear, and lots of detail.  If you want your music to sound like it did in 1989, buy vinyl - it's still made that way and you'll be happy.<br /><br />Overall, a great purchase and I am looking forward to an anniversary edition of _Out of Time_.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I can follow all tasks that need to complete. And this software have a simple interface to manage all that I need
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I bought this for my 2 yr old son. He likes to dance to the music with me and says kitty kitty when he sees ther characters.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really am enjoying this puzzle. The graphics are stupendous and the mechanisms are ingenious. I look forward to seeing more from this developer.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Best series on television.  The acting is outstanding.  My wife and I want the new episodes and its fun to go back and see the earlier episodes
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I purchased every season, although I had watched it on TV. It was great to see the whole show without missing an episode and really understanding all of the little details of the show.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Smart, funny, moving, makes you feel good at the end and i'm just trying to type more words for the word limit.....
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is great but need less ads. It is great distraction when u need a break. But it needs different levels
B00992CF6W|5.0|THat<br />High-tech s a nd cool go buy the Hamas now because it is cool so awesome to explore and stuff
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved this movie. Eddie Murphy really makes the movie. The shipping took longer than usual. I don't normally like cartoons so I was really surprised when I liked this one.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Great Action Great Story Line! The Actors did a Great job of continuing the Saga.Hope they continue to produce the story.
B004RL9T50|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites.  It touches the romantic and the geek in me.  I think you'll enjoy it too..
B005G5PPGS|4.0|The most interesting thing about this book for me was the applicability of its concepts to business generally. Beginning in the mid-1970s the ready availability of powerful and inexpensive computer power opened the door to sophisticated statistical analysis for all businesses. The appalling thing is how slowly it is being implemented.
B004N6369Y|1.0|Not a very exciting story line. Seemed more like a sorty of a spoiled rich girl growing up. Not a lot of drama nor comflict....just an ongoing story. I kept waiting for the main story lime to appear but never did.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I decided to read this book after reading Mika Brzezimski's Obsessed. This is a seminal work outlining a comprehensive history of the processed food industry over the past 100 years outlining how we got to where we are today. It makes me more determined than ever to avoid processed food.
B004021GKW|5.0|The dark color is nice so that the dirt won't stain as much...I avoided the pink on another review and I can see now it was the right choice.  Very washable...just toss in the washer and go!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher Books and was happy to see a movie.  It was well done though it is difficult to put all the greatness in a book in a short movie.  Would recommend it to people who like Jack Reacher Books.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|I've had some okay gear for a little while and honestly didn't know what I was doing with it. This book helped fuel my desire to understand more about digital photography in a way that allowed me to instantly improve my photographs while getting excited about learning much more. Thanks Scott.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|I was a little skeptical when I saw the price but, based on the Amazon brand, I thought it woudl be a decent backpack.  It is adequate to hold a camera body, lenses and flash and has sufficient pockets for other items as well.  However, after only two weeks of light use, I noticed a hole was torn at the stitching in the bottom.  Fortunately I found it before my camera and lenses fell out.  Very, very disappointed that something like this is happening so soon.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Product was new and as described and expected.  Movie was destined to be 3D. With 5 in family price beats theater at $10 /seat plus it may be viewed at any time on 70&#34; 3D smart t.v.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I could not watch it! it is full of crude, violent scenes. I unerstand that this movie is showing the other side of the war, and that is why I rent it, but it was too much for me...
B006LSZECO|3.0|I just found these characters to be over the top with their behavior.  Well written but I really didn't like the characters.  They are a sad commentary on our society...
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Not interested in on-line gaming...just enjoy the &#34;regular&#34; games better. Social media types will probably enjoy this aspect of Angry Birds.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app, is very good for local weather and united states weather. It shows the radar also and forecast. Excellent
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|Although I consider myself a loyal and longstanding Bowie fan, I am also a very critical listener. This album is fairly well produced, but the material sounds like re-worked outtakes from Bowie's vault. I found no cohesiveness in this album and the songwriting was fairly lackluster. I say this because I know what David Bowie is capable of, and this just feels like a lukewarm effort on his part. There were some enjoyable tunes, Stars are Out Tonight is a toe tapper... just not enough to keep me coming back for another spin.<br /><br />I do see a lot of 5 star ratings here, and for the life of me I cannot fathom what those folks are hearing. Five star Bowie would be Ziggy or Scary Monsters- Not The Next Day.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Not that I hate this game, I  could not get it to down load. I tried several times and gave up...................
B00004R99F|5.0|Great movie for adults and kids alike with a great moral story.  The music is catchy and my kids cannot get enough of Powerline.  Highly recommended.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics are terrific and the puzzles are challenging.  Sometimes a little slow loading.  Looking forward to more by Fireproof Games.
B000002KY8|5.0|Every Prince fan or someone interested in getting into Prince must hear this album. There are a few songs on it that had to grow on me just because they are a little different, but after listening to them a few times and understanding them I love them. The best songs are 1999, Little Red Corvette, Let's Pretend We're Married. If you want to hear some funky sounds from the best musician of all time listen to the track Delirious. If you want to hear some fantastic vocals listen to International Lover. It is one of Prince's greatest love ballads to date.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Great songwriter with a natural sound that not overly produced. Her words are meaningful and her voice is clear and I can actually understand her words. She is one of the best sondwriters and communicates her message well. Outstanding!!!!
B000002L68|5.0|This is the second copy I have bought of this album because I wore the first one out. Every song on the album is perfectly fitting and fluid and of course the content is just spectacular. This very well may be the best work he has ever done. I am a big Prince fan and I usually find one or maybe two songs at the most on his albums that I don't really care for, but could still listen to and on this album I love every track from beginning to end.
193700788X|5.0|Again purchased as a gift.  Brand new book - Excellent cover and know the person will like it the book.  She is definitely into vampires.
B000002L9B|4.0|Parade is a great album. It contains several popular songs and a greatest hit song. My favorites would have to be the hit &#34;Kiss&#34;, as well as &#34;Mountains&#34;, &#34;Girls and Boys&#34;, &#34;Sometimes it Snows in April&#34; just to name a few, but overall I like the whole CD. The only gripe I have about it is the length of the tracks. Most of the songs are around two and a half minutes long with the exception of the over seven minute long final song &#34;Sometimes it Snows in April&#34;.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Not the most unpredictable of Sookie books, but it answered lots of questions and tied up loose ends nicely.  I enjoyed it.
B000002N1E|5.0|GE is probably the best album of Prince's name change to a symbol era and it seems to be very under appreciated and I have no clue as to why. The other great album from the symbol era would be the three disc album Emancipation. GE has the one greatest hit &#34;P. Control&#34;, but we all know that greatest hits are just the popular songs and not the greatest songs. My other recommendations would be &#34;Endorphine Machine&#34;, &#34;Shhh&#34;, &#34;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&#34;, &#34;Billy Jack Bitch&#34;, and my album favorite and one of Prince's best love ballads and the album song that he turned into a maxi single &#34;Eye Hate U&#34;.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I truly enjoyed the book Gone Girl.  I understand why the ending could be upsetting to some people but it really didn't shock me.  I had a hard time putting the book down and managed to read it in a few days, which is quite an accomplishment when you have a 2 year old to chase after!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|i wanted to order this movie for my class to watch during the week we celebrate dr.seuss' birthday and it worked perfectly
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Tended to be a bit long winded in parts.  Otherwise a good story.  I would recommend it to other readers
B0000X61VE|5.0|i ordered this after remembering i had it on VHS in the 90s.  The music is still amazingly horrible and she goes a bit fast but it is a good quick workout
B009UX2YAC|5.0|well this game is pretty cool i like to play it when i have nothing to do  dont get bored off of it. even my little sisters and brothers love this game.. everybody should download this game .. the only thing i dont loke is when the game pauses . but it havent did that for a while soo yeah.. WELL DOWNLOAD THIS GAME !!! :)
B00BVYJG18|5.0|JESSE IS BACK! STRONGEST VOICE I HAVE EVER HEARD. JUST MY OPINION. IF YOU DISAGREE? THAT'S OK. YOU ARE WRONG. THESE MUSICIANS ARE A CUT ABOVE. NO WEAK LINKS IN THIS CHAIN HOLDING DOWN AN 800 POUND GORILLA. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ALBUM SINCE ALIVE OR JUST BREATHING. REFRESHING TO HEAR LYRICS THAT ANYONE CAN RELATE TO. JESSE HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO HAVE AN UNDERLYING MESSAGE TO HIS LYRICS...THAT HUMANS SHOULDN'T BE PIECES OF S***! LIKE I SAID...REFRESHING. SONG COMPOSITION REMINDS ME OF THE OLD DAYS OF METALLICA (RIDE THE LIGHTNING, MASTER OF PUPPETS). SONGS ARE PERFECT. I CAN'T THINK OF ANY WAY THEY'D BE BETTER THAN THEY ARE. ALBUM A MUST HAVE!
B004T2QZL8|1.0|It keeps crashing every time I open it. I down loses it on my kindle fire hd. It worked fine when i used the free version. I don't know why It keeps doing this
B0091REZMW|3.0|Very repetitive.  Unless you pay money you have to keep looking for the same stuff in each room.  It gets boring after awhile.
B0029358GM|4.0|I bought this album because I heard &#34;I don't care any more&#34;, and I thought it was a cover tune. I was wrong, it just sounds familiar. Original, but derivative. Good album.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|Video froze briefly a few times and sound was affected in those same areas. So far the overall video and sound quality is not as good as Netflix version of Season 1.
B00AEFZ8OY|5.0|This movie is not for the &#34;politically correct&#34;. But it is hilarious, and worth the time to watch. There is a message to be heard under all the crude and vulger language.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard app. I had to replace my LG's Keyboard. I plan on continuing to use it when I upgrade to the GS4. Its really the only keyboard that can work with me. Everyone should have this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Chose this for my husband, but found I was quickly addicted to the series. Actors do an excellent job, and the setting is great. I enjoy historical themes
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had purchased this book because it was on sale, and I had heard good things about it. I had went into reading it with my current top contemporary romance novel being \\"Walking Disaster\\" by Jamie McGuire. Within about 40 pages, I had turned to my husband and said \\"This book is shaping up to be better than 'Walking Disaster' to me.\\" He was completely surprised. I had never said that anything was better than Jamie McGuire's books. By halfway through, I was completely sold. The book was well written and by halfway through I was completely mind-blown by the turn in events. I've read books where I've said to myself \\"Holy cow! That just happened.\\" But nothing like what \\"Hopeless\\" did to me. I just sat there, staring at the pages wondering how I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover writes in such a way that you being to really get immersed in the characters and their lives. It takes a special type of author to really build that kind of connection between the reader and the characters. This book was tied up nicely, and ended perfectly. I never thought I would say it considering I knew basically nothing about the book going into reading it, but \\"Hopeless\\" has become my favorite contemporary romance novel. I can't wait for \\"Losing Hope\\" to read River's perspective on this whole story. And now, because of this book, I feel compelled to purchase the entire \\"Slammed\\" in a weekend.

B00913P6G0|5.0|Check out the full review at: dozensofdonuts.blogspot.com<br /><br />Still, these critiques are hardly anything to scoff at. This debut is a masterpiece. The album will be considered Hip-Hop Album of 2012 by years-end, and will likely be considered a classic years down the road. \\"good kid, m.A.A.d city\\" is a triumph in the Hip-Hop community and one thing's for sure: Kendrick Lamar is the new leader.

B008XKSW7M|3.0|It's nothing mind-blowing but it's an entertaining movie to watch on a lazy afternoon.  It has its humorous moments and a good cast.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|VERY addictive also short to complete. Leaves you wanting more for sure.<br /><br /> Cannot wait for the next one to come out.
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|Great first book from this author.  Had me gripped from the beginning to the end, couldn't put it down.  Can't wait for her next book.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect coming in to this movie.  It wound up being supremely sincere and very well done.
B000062TU1|4.0|The book was indeed more indepth than the movie but as with all movie adaptations of books, they only have so much time to cover what's happening in the book. Still, the movie covered the important parts really well, like how Harry learns he is a wizard and what happened in his past. The characters grew over the course of the story. Sure, Hermione was a smart nosed and all around brat that mnay people disliked initially, but after certain events she becomes more personable, humbled and a valued friend to Harry. Similar to the book, it makes you feel like you're in a fantasy world with all the visual cinematics and at the same time like you are going back to school. Giving a few scenes in the classrooms with all their professors like the \\"classroom battles\\" with Professor Snape and the stern, motherly but proud teachings of Professor McGonagall. The overall tone is pretty light and kid friendly with limited dark context that isn't really exposed until the later books and movies. To enunciate this the music is pretty light and upbeat throughout the movie, with some sad scene exceptions (Mirror of Erised), to give it a more warm-hearted feel.<br /><br />Comedy is also present to give laughs to the audience. Like in the scene after the trio (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) get lost on the third floor and encounter Fluffy. Hermione berates the two boys for their choice to hide there from Filch and states \\"Now if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed or worse, expelled.\\" to which Ron retorts at Harry \\"She needs to sort out her priorities.\\" And then there's the exciting scenes from the Quidditch training and matches. Nothing like a good game of Quidditch!<br /><br />Sure, some the actors, like the kids, did seem a little dry or emotionless at times but for a lot of them, it was probably their first shot on camera. You have to give them credit for the bravery it takes to showcase yourself to the entire world ata young age. Not my favorite, but definitely a great start to one of the best movie series ever created. 4 out of 5 stars.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As with all of Nicholas Sparks' books, this one was easy to read and held my attention throughout.  I am one of his biggest fans.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I don't watch TV at all. Need an alternative to clear my mind at bed-time. This book kept my mind pleasantly occupied till the eyes start shutting down the day's stress. Well written, full of surprises, no nonsense situations, great analytical capabilities, fantastic applications of everything Reachter learned and experienced during his millitary career.......Great Read.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I couldn't get interested in this book.  It was a waste of time and money.....didn't get past the first 25 pages.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Although I cringe at the thought of a crazy violent, bloody movie, Django is just amazing.  Needless to say, the reality of the subject matter and the thought that any part of it happened in this country is just heartbreaking.  Mr. Tarentino is just such a talent!  BRAVO!
B007712XAU|5.0|Bought it as a gift and it came very quickly. The only negative was one episode wouldn't play. Would purchase again.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|I really wanted to love it , because i love his music . But i truly only like a couple of songs not worth the buy. I only like to buy a whole album if i love the artist music , and i usually wait for the reviews from other buyers. I bought this album the first day, and i wish i would have waited .
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I always have my phone with me and it's just such a huge help that i can also always have my bible, devotional and notes all with me in one item! Love all the  features...so easy to find specific Scriptures and find strength and refreshment in His living Word anytime I have a free minute!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game has been my favorite book since I picked it up in the 7th grade.  It's now the #1 book stolen in my classroom... and I don't even mind.<br /><br />Ender has NEVER disappointed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. The world Howey built is fascinating and intimate. I look forward to more in this universe.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut for only a couple of bucks?  Yes, please.<br /><br />Wonderfully weird and moving book, which should remind us all why war is never the answer.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great app.  Very helpful. Saves me a great amount of time. Word suggestions are usually spot on. Would purchase again.
B000PVAFT0|5.0|It was awesome to show this video to my students on a rainy afternoon! The students and I enjoyed the super close up shots of all the wildlife undersea! So insightful!
B000002LFU|3.0|I was a huge R.E.M. fan in the 80s and into the 90s, and still bought all the albums they put out in the past decade. But this album would rank as my least favorite of the bunch. I think I'm generous even giving it 3 stars. For the most part, this just didn't click for me. Not a single song I loved, and hardly any on here that I care to hear again. Taken as a whole, the album is far from awful, but it's also far from magical or truly memorable, and those were hallmarks of the early R.E.M. sound, when the band really had a creative spark. On \\"Green\\" it sounds like they are already running out of ideas. I noticed that there is now a deluxe version of this album that has been released. I bought the deluxe versions of \\"Murmur,\\" \\"Reckoning\\" and \\"Fables\\" and liked them all ... that's really as far as I want to go. I have no interest in hearing \\"Green\\" again in any format.
B009NY43NY|5.0|loved this series.<br /><br />Enjoyed each book, love the show.<br /><br />interested to see new season in a few weeks.  Will miss this like an old friend.
B0067Q04AM|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this CD earlier this year. I'd read the rave reviews and was intrigued, but I'd never heard anything by Glasper previously, and I'm not much of a hip-hop fan. But I love the old Blue Note jazz albums and am a huge fan of 60s and 70s soul, totally worship genre-bending artists like Gil Scott-Heron, as well listen to tons of pop and rock music. So, I have pretty broad tastes in music and thought: why not take a chance on this one? Well, I don't love it all, but I like the mix of musical styles and the daring way that Glasper presents everything on this album. To my ears there's not much jazz on here, but then again that depends on how you define the genre. Instead, this is like an urban music buffet: a bit of hip-hop, some jazz touches, a lot of soul grooves, and a bit of rock (he does some interesting covers of songs by David Bowie and Nirvana, as well as jazzier tunes by Sade and Mongo Santamaria). At times, Glasper's piano is unneccessarly buried under a wall of beats and vocals, but other times, his subtle riffs are easier to hear, and appreciate. Favorites on this CD include the lovely \\"Cherish the Day,\\" the soaring \\"Why Do We Try\\" with vocals by Stokley, and the  clever cover of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit.\\" Listen to this album with an open mind and you'll find these songs becoming part of your soul. Quite impressive
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Good family high action movie. Somewhat predictable plot, but overall fun time. Would recommend this to others who like action packed films.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I cant write anything to create so I cant even play the game! it doesn't work! I have a kindle fire and idk what happened!!! Could someone please help me? godddd
B003O86FMW|5.0|Usually don't read much due to my busy schedule but couldn't stop reading it..finished in two days. Can't wait to read the third one and see the movie this year.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|there's an error when ever I try to download this. my brother has this game on his ipad but I cant play it because he always hogs it. when he lets me play I just cant stop! I rate this a 5 star app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I highly recommend this game for horse lover's I enjoy this every time I play its great for people who want a horse but a horse is to much money
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|So much fun, wish each time wasn't a week long  Having fun playing family and friends. I won the first one
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|Shot in dark lighting... hard to see on an HD set. That's just the production issues. The cast over-acts in nearly every respect. Sean Penn is like a cartoon character. Loaded with cliches. Nothing original here. If it were meant as satire or send-up of noir classics, it might work. But this movie takes itself seriously. Don't waste your time.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Nice compact unit, as it needs to be for carrying in a &#34;pocket&#34;.<br />Has everything necessary to maintain edges, although smaller size<br />may necessitate a bit more effort on larger blades.
B0065AVS0K|5.0|Well written and choreographed with an obvious deep respect for the original author. Battle of moral and ethical dilemnas and violence, plays like a gritty comic book; fabulous.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is really fun. I like the graphic and how easy it is to use on my Kindle Fire. Although it does require to have you download the game before you can play. Overall I would recommend this game to people who love the spider man movies.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Wrapped up the series in a great fashion, as the last battle truly was that and not a quick little fight, a great read which lots of the long running threads finally concluded.
B001B1CBSQ|5.0|Who doesn't love the Fugees?  I often wonder what happened to them.  Lauren Hill's grammy winning album was dynamite.  Wish they'd come back.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I am an avid Jodi fan and this book was no disappointment. Kept my interest the entire time and i finished it in 3 days. A good twist at the end and I was wanting to read it again!
B0034G4P80|5.0|I would def recommend this movie to anyone, it was a great family movie as well.  You must see this before seeing all the other avenger movies!
B003HO0RFY|5.0|The first time I heard this album was about 12 years ago and it has never stopped being amazing. Hearing it now on Vinyl is just incredible.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This was a great copy, exciting movie and the whole family is enjoying it together...can't beat that.  Good family time is always worth it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great story to read. I couldn't put the book down. Very interesting book to read any day
193700788X|4.0|I haven't written book reviews before, but after reading so many horrible reviews on this book and reading the book itself, I felt I wanted to put my two cents in.  I thought the book was a good read and I enjoyed the plot.  It was nice that Ms. Harris brought back a few old friends for cameo appearances (like Quinn) although they were't integral to the story. The only thing I found a bit jarring was the sudden introduction of another child of Eric who had never been mentioned before.  I didn't see anything truly out of character in the depictions of Eric or Bill (DON'T confuse the book characters with True Blood; the story lines are vastly different).  Bill is still in love with Sookie (unrequited by Sookie) but they settled into a comfortable friendship in the last two books and Bill maintained his friendship in this book.  Eric was at odds with his King in Shreveport and in serious jeopardy; the marriage to a Queen gave him a safe and comfortable solution. Eric was also angry with Sookie because she did not take the vampire marriage seriously, cut their bond without telling him, rejected his offer to turn her, and because she used the cluviel dor on Sam instead of him.  It is not so surprising for his character to leave Sookie and take some revenge by forcing Sam to keep his distance from her.  I didn't see Eric's actions as character assassination but a natural outcome of the way his relationship with Sookie was going.<br /><br />My only disappointment in this book is that it had been marketed as the LAST Sookie Stackhouse book, but now we find out that it is not.  If you want to find out the fate of the characters you have to buy ANOTHER book (After Dead) coming out this fall.  It would have been nice if Ms. Harris had combined the two books instead of trying to wring a few last dollars out of loyal fans with separate publications.
B008393Q2O|2.0|thought i would use it more, but i really dont, maybe i will some day than have to change the comment
B008XFJEE2|2.0|I thought the plot was pathetic.  I cannot imagine any woman putting up with this man's antics for even 1 1/2 weeks!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|these games are on my kindle and when i have to go to the laundry mat to do our quilts (king size) i enjoy having my kindle and games to pass the time
B00871C09S|5.0|This movie will also be a gift to someone in my family.  All of my four kids love Jimmy Steward movies so one of them will receive this as a birthday or a Christmas gift.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|My family and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. I had seen it many years before - but my wife and daughter had never seen it. It brought them a new perspective on the new TV series.
B00AEBB97S|5.0|I ordered this movie because my Grandson who is 23 and just graduated from the College of Charleston told me that this was the best movie he had ever seen but did not have a copy of.  So I gave this to him as part of his gift upon graduation.
B00683JLXA|2.0|If you like Angry Birds, by all means!  This is a good app.  If you were looking for something else, keep looking.  Graphics are great, tho.
B003XKNE7U|2.0|This is a very disorganized story, and hard to follow the story line.  Too many people and difficult how they are related to each other.  I'm reading this for a book club, but do not care for it.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Spoiler alert.<br />I'm a huge Bond fan. This was the worst one ever. Daniel Craig looked like he was about 60 years old The plot was very thin. They replaced John Cleese with some unknown young punk and killed off Judi Dench. They replaced Moneypenny with a really bad actress and then had her and Bond in a physical relationship. The whole point of their relationship was flirting and nothing else. They really messed this one up.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|can't stop playing it and booklet includes all the lyrics another nice feature was purchase of cd included mp3 download
B009R659L8|5.0|I LOVE Mary Higgins Clark books.  This one, yet again, did not disappoint!  I got my mom hooked on her books years ago.  Every year we can't wait for April to roll around for the release of her newest book!
B0086700CM|5.0|It's a good game to keep the kids occupied while traveling.  I also like play it when I'm trying not to fall asleep.
B007NZDES0|4.0|I enjoyed watching this dvd the sound quality was great. i am looking forward to see similar shows in dvd.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Works awesome. Great at predicting my words. Also possible to type a few words without even looking at the screen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After the reading I immediately jumped online to see when the movie would be released.  Just when you think things couldn't get worse .. oh just wait they can.  It'll be interesting to see how much makes it into the movie and what's left out!
1401201911|5.0|what if Superman was born in Russia, and was their champion--this books explores that in a n interesting and fun read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Of course that is always to case as the movie would have to be over 3 hours long.  Listened to this book after watching the movie and picked up on so many more head tilting awws.  I wish movies could portray the books exactly.  The ending when on the Cornucopia was one of my favorite parts when looking into the beasts eyes and the potential realization of who they are.
B009CGCWHM|5.0|Set during a time of innocence and hardship (the Great Depression), this is a wonderful story.  I read the book and the movie is a close parallel.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|From the first book to the third, Suzanne Collins has a way of painting every scene in ones mind so vividly.  Couldn't stop listening.  Living in LA and constantly on the road, traffic becomes easier to handle listening to great reads like these!  Saddened it was the last, hopefully a new series will come that continues with a similar style of writing.<br /><br />Now the antagonizing wait for the movies to follow!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you love bingo you'll love bingo blitz.There is so very much to do,earn,and seek,it will honestly keep you coming back.The hate part is the fact you will always need neighbor's too help finish rooms,etc. And that last elusive trophy to finish really depends upon the kindness of strangers or it could take months to complete,BUT you can still move forward so you don't get stuck.All in all,I always come back and have actually made some phenomenal friends there.they keep it fresh and fun.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Went to the app store like it suggested, followed all the guidelines and the game still isn't there anywhere, major bummer!
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|That and the fact that there are no new special features and no commentary whatsoever--I want commentary, damn it!  Sigh.
B000002IWM|5.0|This review is for the ATLANTIC[[ASIN:B000002IWM Fragile]] GOLD CD only. All Around great. Period. This Edition in my humble opinion is THE version to have. Clean, crisp but also full of body and very lush sounding. HOWEVER, I Have Never heard the DVD Audio or the MoFi edition. I have read reviews of the MoFi edition and they are very positive, But I can't personally comment on it's sound quality. But so far this is the best I'VE heard.
B009MYARIK|4.0|Good mix mystery, comedy action, these are fast reading which is a good thing, otherwise you would get no sleep.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Tangled is one of my all time favorite movies and it is a great movie for children, by the time the movie is over they will want to be a princess and go on an adventure with Flin Rider! Again I love love love love this movie and you will too after you watch it! So go ahead and click that BUY button twice :) please like if this was helpful, thanks ^-^<br /><br />  -Critically Chic <3
1452101248|4.0|I selected this book because it had a lot of vegetarian style cooking a little more interesting than the bland vegetarian cookbooks I have seen in the past.<br /><br />It is relevant to today's consumer who wants to avoid the unpleasant ways in which animals are not given a good life in natural surroundings and killed, often not humanely. This is a better option so that we can live simply.<br /><br />The book arrived safe and sound I thank you for that too.  jenni zeller
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love hidden object games especially those that are incorporated into the storyline.  This is a good combination of puzzles with plenty of guidance throughout the game.
B009PMB3CI|4.0|I got this game for my 6yr old granddaughter and she absolutely loves it. it seems to a fun app for kids.
B000093BDX|5.0|An excellent collection of the group's tunes.....  Brings back a lot of memories.  It'll leave you wishing for the beaches of the 60's.....
B0042L78MG|5.0|I chose this album because I'd heard \\"That Man\\" and \\"A Night Like This\\" on the radio. This has to be the most happy-fun I could have with a simple CD. Good road music, the retro mix of 40s swing, jazz, Andrews Sisters vocals - and simply the fact that Caro has an amazing voice has me going back to this disc all the time. Every song has a distinctive beat - and they're all great. Jazz, Scat, Tango, Salsa, Caribbean.....I'm looking forward to her next release which comes out this week I believe. Already have it on my wish list!
193700788X|1.0|I loved the first few volumes in this series, but became very disappointed as the last few deteriorated into senseless, contradictory plots and poor writing.  I was more pleased with the volume before this since it seemed that the author was getting back on track.  However, this, the final volume, has got to be the worst of the lot.  It is a jumbled mess with an unappealing plot and a hurried, unsatisfying end.  Shame on you Charlaine Harris for thinking so little of the fans that you foist this poor excuse of a concluding book in the series on them.
B001Q9J4PG|3.0|I really think Clancy's just started running out of steam here. The Cold War offered him so much rich material but now he's reduced to the absurdity of a plot wherein the CEO of a major pharmaceutical company and some members of the Sierra Club want to destroy the world. There are really no surprises. I could see from the very beginning that the former KGB guy was going to be the key to stopping them. The actual conclusive shootout is... boring...???<br /><br />Clancy is a fantastic writer. I'd advise anyone working their way through his oeuvre to stop at Executive Orders. No need to go any further. After reading Rainbow Six I think I'm done.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I thought this was a game my 3 year old could play, but it's not really.  Kind of like Farmville, you build a reef but there isn't much strategy to it.  It is addictive however, at least to a certain level.
B000JO9JHW|1.0|can't believe this lasted as long as it has; very uninteresting.I like the premise, however, and perhaps I should have given it more time, but just couldn't manage to sit through another episode.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book for it's light-hearted tone and easy-to-follow story.  The characters were quirky and fun.  Was a quick read,though the story was a bit far-fetched.
B009B1UZ7C|2.0|It sounds as if someone locked this young man in a room when he was a child and forced him to listen to Bob Dylan and Beatles records exclusively.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|It's always fun to read about how a game starts and this book makes you root for Spartan 117 John even more. I've read these all in the past but they are always good to read again and again.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|This is a traditional plot in French movie tradition: how to make an impossible relationship possible? The movie explores this angle with two radically opposed characters who finally get along together and bring unexpected situations, humor, warmth, and most important, reconcile yourself with humanity. It also addresses a problem that is present in France nowadays, the integration of first generation immigrants in society. Good movie, actual and optimistic.
B0044DEAUA|2.0|This product is alright but I would not buy again. It was easy to set up and appeared to run well but the reception on the other end is not good. It still is crackly sounding on the other end.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Been a big fan of all her books but I could tell that the author is weary of the story line. Don't feel any Closure with sookie or others, except maybe with Jason who doesn't have a lot going for him anyway.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Not the greatest book ever written, but it's a classic for a reason. I enjoyed it much more than I expected to. (highlighted and commented on it much more than I expected to as well).
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Very easy to learn....attention grabber.....and alot of fun!!! Everytime my wife hears me playing this game; my wife takes the game from me
0316066524|1.0|When I read I want to be entertained and learn something. For my taste, there were too many words to say very little
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|She said it was one of her favorite movies and wanted it. Was shipped quickly. She was happy with it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is the best show on TV.  I don't have TV so I buy each show and watch them when it works into my schedule!
081095415X|5.0|I actually bought this book to use some of the pictures to frame. Another person that had reviwed it gave me that idea.  Found a few of the pictures seperately but were too expensive. After receiving it, I did not cut out a picture because I did not want to ruin the book.
0345803485|5.0|Grabbed my attention as soon as I started reading it.... One of the Best Books I've ever read! It's a Must Read! ! !
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|The only thing I was dissappointed with was that they have held the last episode back from being rented on Amazon. Its been a month since it aired.So I watched as many as I could on TV and the ones I mised I rented from Amazon except, I will never see the last one unless I buy the whole series!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game has kept my kindle in hand for hours, and many more to come! Do yourself a favor and download this game and give it a try!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love the game you all needed to try it . I love to play it on my Kindle Fire HD l love Mahjong  and Amazon too . Thanks again.<br /><br />Patty Thilman
B000KJU1HI|4.0|good dvd quality very interesting content of the film as I am a huge Bob Dylan fan.overall a very good puchase
B0036S4C6G|3.0|It kept me coming back, but it was difficult to track with the different story tellers.  I don't do well when stories seem to jump around from the perspectives of different author's telling the story.  I'd say, be prepared to do mental gymnastics to keep the stories straight.  It was a good read, though.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I use my 19&#34; computer moniter for most what I use Google and it is far more suitable and easier to view,
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this app is addictive. i think these kind of apps are one of the best kind. im not a big fan of kid games but this one is a good one buy it
B004TI5N38|5.0|A tightly-written thriller with great characters and a plot that will keep you reading.  It kept me up past my bedtime.
B00007J5VN|4.0|I had just seen an updated version of the MacLaine play - and couldn't remember seeing Shirley when it came out.  It was a good record of her big hits: Big Spender; If My Friends Could See Me Now.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Read it! Just do it! You might not have thought about it, or maybe you did. maybe you have another book n the burner to read...but this one...this one is fast, if you're like me, and can hardly<br />Ut it down...No matter what the &#34;harmonies&#34; become for my push...just do it!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Victor Hugo's Les Miserables - the movie - with Hugh Jackman was shipped immediately, and in brand new condition.  I've watched it over and over - and especially love the many &#34;bonus&#34; sections included!  Thank you.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|First of all the acting is impeccable.  If you know anything about The Odyssey you will appreciate the fantastic writing and finely done satire. It is one of those movies you could even watch blindfolded because the music, singing, and the script is so wonderful.  But don't just listen enjoy the beautiful filming and amazing facial expressions captured!<br /><br />You haven't yet seen it?  Where have you been?  See it now!
B004TI1WME|2.0|A few weeks back, NeoCal was offered as FAOTD.<br />In comparison, this is lame.<br />It does what it says it does but feels like something from the dollar store.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Could not stop watching....cannot wait for season 4! Must know about Mr and Mrs Bates, as well as the other characters.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is more sophisticated than the original frontline commando.<br />You are still confined to one or two cover spots per scene, but the animations are better, the tasks more versatile, and you can take control of &quot;liberated&quot; weapons like a heavy machine gun temporarily.<br />You can even hear the enemy threatening to kill you in perfect German.<br />I'm not far enough advanced to judge how far you get without paying, but you'll definitely see serious action.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent! Loved the details that were forgotten in the screenplay. I'm so excited to continue reading this trilogy and to see how the story further unfolds.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|A good story about challenging traditional beliefs of MLB by asking \\"Why are we doing it this way?\\"<br /><br />Michael Lewis really did a great job researching his topic and told the story in a compelling way.
B00AK22QOQ|5.0|The work here is incredible; very original and mind-blowing. I enjoyed the tour around the world in so many different versions and styles of art. It really makes your mind race as an artist to find new and interesting ways to draw the world around you in constant motion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best graphics. not to be picky, but the riders potion is horrible. thumbs up, back strait, sorry obsessed with horses. lol<br /> love this game!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I have had the 2 disc cd for years...after seeing the concert on PBS, I bought the concert dvd...Cohen is the best, the musicians are at the top of their game...if you love his poetic wording, you can't go wrong with both the cd and the dvd...my highest recommendation...
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|This album has a couple tracks tailored for each trance music preference. More electro-minded and prog house individuals will love the first track along with waiting for the night and this is what it feels like. These tracks are cheery and hot. Fans that would prefer more solid vocals with a sad edge will love \\"Love never came\\", almost made me tear up and Wont let you go by Aruna. Moderate and average listeners will absolutely enjoy forever is ours and pulsar, both solid tracks probably the most balanced as well. The last two fan bases are closely related, die hard trance fans from back in the early 90s and everywhere in between will enjoy hearing \\"last stop before heaven\\" as it clearly takes the form of a retro track with modern synths. Theres something about that track that gets me every time I listen to it, especially when I play it right before \\"in ten years time\\" a weird classical / electronic hybrid that makes me look up at the stars at night and wonder where I'll be and where the trance scene will be in ten years from this album's release. And lastly, the uplifting and 140 bpm enthusiasts will fall in love with who's afraid of 138. Its as if this track was made to reach out and pull all the new uplifting melodic and euporic trance tracks up and into the spotlight. It mixes well with all of those faster trance hits and was an unexpected surprise on the album. Goes to show you that you can always trust in Armin to deliver quality trance music!

B0034DGPEU|2.0|&#34;Gone With the Wind&#34; meets &#34;Jayne Eyre.&#34;  From a somewhat plausible beginning, the story engages in histrionics .  Ridiculous decisions result in impossible situations.  And what a closed mouthed bunch!  You would think someone would speak up or notice something was awry.  I forgot to mention rape, insanity, murder and bodice ripping.  RIP
B001RIY49C|5.0|Beautiful and very good endoskull, I like soo much, beautiful sounds, in the dark looks like a real terminator in your home, because of red light in the eyes. Great product.
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|THE MINIONS ARE THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS STUPID MOVIE  I TURNED IT OFF AFTER 20 MINS.  DUMB.  NOT FUNNY. MAIN CHARACTER IS THE WORST.  BLEH BLEH BLEH BLEH BLEH
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I don't know how this bag will hold up over time but it seems to me like a great deal for 30 bucks! I was able to fit by camera in it with a 200mm L lens attached as well as 2 other lenses and all my other gear. If the bag does fail after time as some have reported than I'll just buy another one which beats paying like a hundred bucks for others. I can replace this bag twice and still be under a hundred bucks which is a no brainer for me.
B006VJMZXY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as I love any historically based book ,( either fiction or non fiction), especially if it is based on a genuine person or period.This was a great read and so well written that I could visualise everyday life during this turbulent period of history, through the eyes of the central character.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|This item works perfectly with my nexus 4. Just plug it to your HDMI and your phone will be mirrored onto the TV. Love it.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|My memories of reading &#34;Pride and Prejudice &#34; were better than my reading it again. I found it okay but not as eventful as when I read it years ago.
B000IDEQTK|3.0|I loved everything about this movie except for a poor casting choice. I'm a huge Helen Hunt fan, so it was disappointing to see that apparently she can only play Helen Hunt. This role was all wrong for her, and the distraction of her obvious struggle with the role took away the authenticity of the film.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I downloaded this game for myself because I loved finding nemo. It is teaching me things about the ocean I never knew. The graphics are beautiful, and the soft music is very relaxing. Only thing is the amount they want for certain items
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|the producers and/or writers presented the movie to be more concerned with attempts at humor and over the top special effects as opposed to telling the story  --- the digs at African culture were blatant, e.g. to be a wizard is lofty -- to conjure is just superstitious (however they are one in the same -- one has a european label (wizard) and the other an African label (conjure) Oh well such blatant delusion of white supremacy in this century. the movie is OK nothing more.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this app so much. ive been waiting forever for it to come out on android and I'm so happy! ive always been playing it on my cousins ipads and phones and now I don't have to deal with them asking why I cant just play it on my kindle anymore. I highly recommend this app, it was well worth the money.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|the refurbishing of this movie was nicely done.  My daughter and I enjoy watching it.  It is a nice addition to our goth collection
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Like I say all the time, his books never disappoint. I read of his books, that I can get my hands on. Very good!
B00BUL171O|4.0|Overall this is a good album from lil wayne. i heard i am not a human being and tha crater 4. This has more hits one it then the other two. The four singles are the best songs on the album. Theirs maybe  2 songs that i really couldnt get into but everything else makes up for those two, Looking forward to his need Album. Hopefully it wont be his last for quite some time.
B0043URV8M|3.0|I have been a soundtrak fan since I was a kid and since I loved the Harry Potter movies and have them on DVD, I needed the soundtrack.  Out of the composers that have done the Harry Potter films I like Alexadre Desplat the least.

193700788X|3.0|I don't like writing bad reviews but this book was not what I was expecting.  Actually, it took my expectations of what would happen and just crashed and burned. At the end of book 12, I got the feeling that Sam would be playing a bigger role and that Sookie and Sam may become an item.  With that being said, I like Sam as a character, I really do.  He's been givin' a hard time of it in the female department. And yes, Sookie has had her fair share of blows... So I can see them together.  BUT... and that's a big but, at least give us some more to their \\"story\\" so to speak.  I mean one minute they are barely speaking and the next they're in bed together?  I would have prefered to have more of them or something.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of Eric, so it was a little hurtful to see how he was just cast off.  At least, give more insight to that... besides the few times he was put into the book (and not because Sookie was thinking about him). His fate was just awful, 200 year marriage contract... I wish this could have been done different or something. At least let him and Sookie leave things in better form or at least as friends... I don't know but something!!  Not the way that it was though.<br /><br />Bill's character didn't really bother me one way or another because I never really liked him.  Sure he was nice and has always helped Sookie but I just never liked him for some reason. So him \\"enjoying\\" telling Sookie about Eric's terms when Sam went to him to help them bail Sookie out of jail.. just tipped the scale for me even more so.<br /><br />This book was edited well (and for that it gets 3 stars) but the plot just didn't do it for me. It was seriously missing it's usual charm. I was also very disappointed that this is the last book and it was just blah! It was like Mrs. Harris was just tired of this series or something and it showed because the normal depth that is in her work was seriously missing. This could have been so much more and I hate that such a good series ended on this note.  Worth reading if you have read all the other books but just note that it will not be the finale everyone hoped for.od series ended on this note.

B000025XKM|5.0|The Volkswagen commercial. And immediately fell in love.<br /><br />It's been a few years, but a buddy of mine had this on his iPod and it reminded me that I'd never gotten the album. So glad I finally got around to it. Nick Drake was unfortunately not appreciated so much in his own time, but I'm grateful for the music he did manage to leave us. It's lovely.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Purchased for my grandson; he loves it!<br />Came on time and was well packaged. Keep on keeping up the good work.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love it very ceative.<br />ITS VERY INTERESTING GAME.ANY AGE CANPLAY IT!<br />fun.Interesting. adventure.  creative.  sometime differcult.<br />I would recommended
B0094K1PW4|5.0|I'm biased. Those kids were me. I made Super 8 movies, built models, had crushes and loved fireworks. And I'm a huge fan of huge monsters. Super 8 is a blast and, for me, stands up to multiple viewings. Good Saturday kick-back stuff!
B000W8HC8I|4.0|good page turner, describes the craziness of wall st. in the 90's.  Good detail on how his addictions ended up ruining everything
193700788X|1.0|Disappointing read, felt rushed, weak plot lines, a lot of OOC stuff going on. The HFN ending was 'meh' at best.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing Hinton blitz for spittle over a year and I love it.  Its fantastic!  You meet so many wonderful people who really like helping you.....teaching you the game....and then you hand down the help to the new people you meet.  Its additive and I wouldn't have any other way.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Found the show to be interesting and suspense filled.  Great acting and I'm looking forward to next season. I hope Emma gets what is coming!!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Liked it interesting fast moving. Good wins in the end<br /><br />Some outcomes a little to much to believe by good tie ins to earlier series
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|A good balance of action, humor, and plot. I just wish the other movies had been as good as this one.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, and this one started off a little slow for me. However, after about 30% into the book I began enjoying it and could not put it down. There is a thriller element to the book once it gets going. I also saw the movie, and it was even better! (WHICH I NEVER THINK HAPPENS! BOOKS ARE ALWAYS BETTER)
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|Either that, or I'm just nostalgic.  The more I see of current filming techniques, the more I appreciate movies where they don't shake the camera until I get motion sickness.  But I did notice a J.J. Abrams-esque lens flare at the very end when V'ger &#34;evolves&#34; and the Enterprise emerges from a big flash of light.  I'll forgive it this one time.  :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Probably one of the best books i have ever read. A MUST READ. I have recommended this book to many different people and all of them, even men, love the book!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|very fun game with responsive controls. but the developers set the requirements to unlock all the armors so high that they almost require you to buy in game currency. im all for them makin money but id rather just pay for the game. but hey its free to try out so judge it for yourself
B007R21JJK|2.0|So far, this has been a decent motherboard, but the VIA USB ports do not work. They worked for about a day or two, and then nothing. I tried re-installing drivers, but now it simply says I do not even have the hardware for the selected drivers. I am not sure what I can do to fix this.<br /><br />DO NOT buy this mobo. Might get the UD5H for the next PC I am already planning on building.<br /><br />Buy a mobo with lots of USB ports and then buy a separate USB hub because the ones on the PC don't work...how sad is that?!<br /><br />Very disappointed!
B002NNA9N0|2.0|I recalled being unimpressed years ago watching the theatrical release. I started watching it recently because the cast is so very impressive and figured with the passing of time and my own aging the film's accolades would make more sense to me. It didn't. Within just a few minutes I was reaching for the stop button. Incredibly boring. Reminded me of Kafka's \\"The Castle\\" and/or \\"Waiting for Godot\\". Lots of hype but really lame boring stories.
B0096HL33G|1.0|Worst movie I have seen in along time. Wonderful actress, I cant imagine what she was thinking when she took this part. I was hoping it would get better but it never did, dont bother.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game and very addictive I recommend it to anyone wishingtobuildthier own city. Just watch out for the in app purchase. You can have your parental controls turn them off.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|It  was  Gene  Roddenberry  at  his  superb  best.  I  had  seen  the  episode  many  years  earlier,  and  so  instantly  caught  the  plot  from  the  title  &#34;The  Man  Trap&#34;. An  excellent  storyline.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Our Review, by LITERAL ADDICTION's Guest Reviewer, Cheryl W:<br /><br />I was lucky enough to win one of the advanced reader copy versions of Deborah Harkness' A Discovery of Witches, to be released in 02/2011. When I completed the first chapter and woke up the next morning I decided that I had to write my thoughts for the review as they occurred. One of the things that crossed my mind when I first heard about this book was wow. This book is written by a scholar. I researched the author via her university home page because I was curious about her background. When I finished the first chapter I was still in the wow stage and my thoughts were; this is a bridge between scholars and great urban fantasy writers. I love when I get to have both! I wish as a techie scholar I could combine my two loves of computers and urban fantasy. This book was everything I hoped it would be!<br /><br />I read this slowly despite how I typically devour most books. With some books I slow down intentionally because I realize that I do not want it to end quickly. A Discovery of Witches is that type of book. It is the type of book you develop a relationship with as you read it. I think that there will be people that will fall in love with it as they read it just as I did. I hope that even those that feel that it may not be for them still find something that they can take from the book. It is very intricate. The story is well developed, extremely well written and the characters are very well developed. But, it was not a quick read for me because, I did not want it go fast. For me it is a book that you spend time with and do not forget the places it takes you as the characters are being drawn. The history it discusses is thought-provoking. One of the things I liked was how Diana developed with regard to her powers and her family. Politics were a strong part of the story. With regard to the politics one of the most intriguing things I found was who is involved in the politics. I am trying to keep this review spoiler free. But, as the blurb on the back states we have multiple beings involved in this book and they have a very long history with each other. One of the things that make this book so amazing is the historical backdrop for all of the creatures. I found myself looking forward to learning more about all of the beings. I really look forward to more written by Deb Harkness.  I had a hard time deciding how to end my review but it does not spoil anything to shout; “I can’t wait to see what happens next”!p this review spoiler free.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|Let's be honest, it's just a plastic pen light.  HOWEVER, it is pretty fun for my 13-year old Dr. Who mega-fan.  It works, it is tough, and my 7-year old now wants one.  We get a lot of giggles over the invisible writing on our refrigerator.  The &#34;Doctor&#34; Halloween costume is now complete.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game, it is something I can do for a short time then return to the next day.  The things that others complain about, like finding the same objects, is what I like.  The one thing I do not like is that it will sometimes hang up and time out.  This can be frustrating but I have other apps to go to when this happens.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The settlers of catan is by far the best board game I have ever owned.  I am excited to get the expansion pack.
193700788X|1.0|Very disappointing.  I am not disappointed because of who she ends up with in the end, but there really should have been more of a storyline dedicated to this relationship within the book.  It would have been more interesting if the characters that were after Sookie had been important characters in the past books.  To give such a storyline to minor characters was boring and almost painful to read through.  It would have been much more in keeping with the rest of the series if it was the vamps who were after her to try and keep her away from Eric.  Where was the big battle scene that I was expecting between Sookie's love interests fighting for her affections.  It is unbelievable and not true to the rest of the series that Eric and the rest of the bad vamps would just skulk away to Oklahoma without any fight.  I think the fans deserved a better ending to this series.  Don't waste your money on this one.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|This movie was so great, the cast had a lot of chemistry and the whole was put together well, it's an instant classic
B007N8RULO|1.0|Needs to down load and brainium app to play I wont down load until I can find out more information as to why this is required.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|The game itself is awesome!<br />I didn't like that the pieces (roads, settlements, cities) are different than in the game sold in Europe. For instance, a road is a small stick, whereas in the European version you get an actual road-shape plastic piece.<br />This shouldn't affect your enjoyment of the game, though!
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|Starts out a lil cheesy but the story is far beyond that and now I can easily say I'm a true whovian!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I found this book hilarious!!!  I read it while on vacation and it was a perfect beach read...I'd recommend it for anyone in need of a laugh.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this trilogy. I started reading this because my nephew enjoyed it and introduced it to me. Great!
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|After listening to House of Gold & Bones Part 1, I was blown away.<br />It was a near perfect rock album, with an absolutely perfect ending.<br />I heard that it was only half of a 2-part concept album, I wondered how the band could possibly follow it.<br /><br />Stone Sour did not match their performance in the first album.  They surpassed it.  By far.  The songs flow together perfectly, as themes from the first album are snuck into the music here.<br />Definitely a runner for album of the year.
B007VTUYWW|5.0|A little predictable but great action scenes and special effects make the heroin unbeatable.<br />Great scenery and place never seen before.
B008P9M614|5.0|It arrived in great shape. I had never seen the full series and now I've watched one-and-a-half seasons. Just what I wanted. Great series! No complaints. sf
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I love how Sagan creates his alien world.  The story questions what faith is very well.  It's a love story, an action story, a mystery, and a drama all together with a little humor thrown in.  And Jodie Foster rocks as always.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Although serving completely different audiences, this adaption of Les Mis is an amazing accomplishment.  The live singing by big time stars, coupled with the detailed cinematography, provides an excellent complement to the live play.  When you are in need of a &#34;Les Mis fix&#34; and wanting to hear all the great songs/music and see the story unfold, it makes it easy to pop in the DVD.  It will never replace the live version, but it is a fantastic movie that stays true to the original story.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I enjoy this game because it allows me to build something rather than to worry about being overtaken.  The only drawback is that it is highly addictive.
B006XOBFB0|5.0|Fanfare magazine recently put this set in its Hall of Fame. The reviewer wrote:<br /><br />\\"Perahia is unhindered by academic issues, and he turns in elegant and exuberant readings that possess abundant energy in the outer movements and gracious lyricism in the slow movements. The orchestra plays with enviable precision and enthusiasm, providing Perahia with excellent support through the dozen discs. If a \\"How to...\\" manual for this repertoire were possible, these performers could write it. This is fresh and invigorating music-making and it wears the mantle of the era with an enviable freshness.\\"<br /><br />This is the only traditional Mozart set that they included. The other one is an original instruments/fortepiano interpertation with Malcolm Bilson (fp)and John Eliot Gardiner.
B009MO5G90|3.0|This film is the worst of the franchise. The last one, (#4 from 2010), Afterlife was for me, one of the best... especially in 3D! Bought this with hopes... cause I like collections. Very disappointing. I will watch Retribution again cause I love 3D, (I know that many do not, but on my 73&#34; Diamond Mitsubishi in the dark with surround sound.... awesome). But the story was weak. Acting mediocre. Did nothing to move the franchise forward.
B009NY43NY|4.0|As a devoted fan, I've read all of the SS books. I've enjoyed them all, some more than others, and as with most series that go this long, the later books haven't been my most favorite. But in my opinion, this last book was pretty much a perfect ending to the series. Sookie has made it clear from the beginning that she would never want to become a vampire. So a long term relationship with a vampire just wouldn't work. She'd get old and wrinkled, he wouldn't, blah, blah. And I've always been a HUGE Eric fan. But I've always recognized him for what he is. He's 1000 years old, addicted to power, and he's lost much of his humanity. He's always had an agenda, and his feelings for Sookie have never been strong enough to call real love. Even when he's saving Sookie, he's getting something out of it and that's always been the case. He feels deep affection for her, he feels she belongs to him, he \\"loves her as much as he is capable of\\".<br /> Also, I've always know that there was something more than friendship between Sam and Sookie, even though they wouldn't admit it. So I was not surprised or unhappy with the way the series wrapped up. Sookie actually has the possibility of marriage, children of her own, a real future. I'm happy with that.<br />As for the plot of the book, it was true to all the others. All the troubles and trials, the people out to kill Sookie, the supernaturals pulling together to help out. It's all good.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|I have watched this movie twice in 3D on a 73&#34; Mitsubishi Diamond (we also have superb surround sound)... I love the surreal imagery. Acting is good. Story is slightly above average for the horror genre. Product came exactly as ordered.<br />Would order again. I have been building my 3D collection slowly... I love 3D. Watch over and over and over...
B00APKIN1I|5.0|5 stars for the music and performance on the album. Kick butt in your face rock and roll. Really good.<br /><br />But the CD is over compressed loudness blown to the nth degree. Holy ear bleeding loudness war batman! If you want the best quality go for the vinyl if you can or find a rip some where. Night and day difference. Dynamic range of 6 on the CD but 11 on the vinyl. Huge difference side by side on a good system.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Favorite movie of all time, still think there should be more in the ending and always wondered if what i saw in the distance as they swam was triton's kingdom. Sigh* such a cliff hanger. Anybody else feel like there should have been more of a back story on madision. Like is she a mermaid princess, what her kingdom looks like you know the whole &#34;Little Mermaid&#34; experience. Anyway love this move, made me obsessed i want to buy my own splash tail from Mike Van Daahl
1575666286|5.0|A very good book to read, for the cancer in all of us, read and be the judge of your own health.
145210655X|5.0|This is the most adorable story i have seen literally. The idea of Dark Vader connecting with his son is absolutely genius and nothing short of sweet. I love how Brown incorporates actual lines from the movie in the book to make it look that more authentic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish there was a way to get mods... well good mods like the portal gun mod, twilight forest, or equivalent exchange.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Its 5.40 in the morning i woke early and immediately but also reluctantly turned to finish reading Harold and Maureens story, i will look at my day differently today because of this book. It is full of life and humanity and although you need to know the end, the journey is delightful. Thankyou rachel joyce.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I only watched about half of the first season. I heard this season was fantastic so I bought all the episodes as they came out. They are great! Extremely riveting and the character dynamics are riveting. I loved that this season was a completely different story from the first but the dark, paranormal mood was the tie for both.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you're looking for a good game, here is one you should get. There is infinite things to do. You can build a castle or just a regular house. Also if you're new to Minecraft than here is a tip build your house near spawn so if you die then you can find your house fast. Like I said earlier BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I love Mark Wahlberg and I pretty much enjoy anything he's in. I did enjoy this and I made it through the end with a smile on my face. I wasn't glued to the screen, though. It was cute, definitely not child friendly but probably something you can awkwardly watch with an older teenager.
B009AMANBA|3.0|While the cast is good as well as the acting, it was difficult for me to get interested because the script was in the speaking style of years ago and not, at least for me, easily interpreted and understandable...it was too heavy.  I was disappointed because I was looking forward to learning more about the incredible  Mr. Lincoln.
B0085OELXK|5.0|Love Matt Damon, the move plot was great never a dull moment.  It really helped that all the leading men were hot.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|What in the world was i thinking when i got this one. Its not what its crack up to what i thought it would be.Definitely was a waste of time,because you can't do nothing, Not even practice your skills.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Heat Wave is a great start to the Nikki Heat series. The characters are great and it's a good murder mystery.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Someone recommended Tom Selleck as &#34;Ike&#34; and while looking on IMDB for movies with Selleck I came across all these Jesse Stone films.  I'd not read the mysteries on which they are based, and I'd never even heard of the books or the films.  I first watched &#34;Jesse Stone - Stone Cold&#34;, which while it is the first one made, it is actually preceded by this prequel.  I was captivated from the start.  Complex characters, interesting and unusual dialog, haunting musical score that is so evocative and appropriate and the mysteries are excellent.  WOW! The best result of not having seen any of them before is that I've been able to watch one right after the other.  I've been immersed in the character of Jesse Stone, the small town of Paradise, MA, the quirky other regular characters played with equal ability (to Selleck's) by Viola Davis, Kohl Sudduth, Kathy Baker, William Devane, Stephen McHattie and more.  You've seen these actors in other films and TV shows, but they are better than ever here as an ensemble.<br /><br />The sad thing is that I'm concerned with Selleck in the TV series Blue Blood (which I also like), that there may be no more Jesse Stone movies.  There is one more for me to watch.  Lucky me.<br /><br />Stone is such an unusual, complex and complicated character.  I am captivated! And besides that, he has a wonderful golden retriever through most of the series.<br /><br />Why it is so hard to ascertain what the order of the series is?  It took me a bit of work, but here it is for you.  Some are available here on Amazon Instant Video (and on Netflix-streaming and DVD).  Do not miss this series, and do watch them in order.  There are back stories that you want to follow along as well.<br /><br />Jesse Stone: Night Passage (January 15, 2006) a prequel to Stone Cold<br />Jesse Stone: Stone Cold (February 20, 2005)<br />Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise (April 30, 2006)<br />Jesse Stone: Sea Change (May 22, 2007)<br />Jesse Stone: Thin Ice (March 1, 2009)<br />Jesse Stone: No Remorse (May 9, 2010)<br />Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost (May 22, 2011)<br />Jesse Stone: Benefit of the Doubt (May 20, 2012)

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has achieved maturity in fantasy writing, and this series will be his masterwork. The only comparable works that I can think of are the Robert Jordan Wheel of Time books (which Mr. Sanderson completed), the L. E. Modesitt Recluse series, and the George R. R. Martin books. The Way of Kings series stands (at least with the quality of the first volume) with the best of these. There is a complex back-story, many characters, and a lot of time spent fleshing these characters out. An incredibly engaging story. Unfortunately, we now have to wait 10+ years for the series to complete. Perhaps Mr. Sanderson will be so good as to crank out 2 or 3 volumes per year? Kudos, Brandon!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game is brilliant, awesome graphics. My friend automatically gets a free gem everyday, how can i?? Otherwise excellent, should make it for more devices
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is nice<br />It is a good thing for example the best way to get a farm in my mind is not<br />A new games
B005NACYQU|4.0|I was 10 years late to the party but glad I made it! The concept of the old gods versus the new is awesome.
B00BBW16HW|3.0|I liked it, it was slow at times but had a great storyline so that made up for it.  Would recommend.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|I have not seen the film yet, which I am grateful for. I have seen the trailer and I think that did slightly spoil the experience of the book. I found myself trying to match the images I had seen in the trailer. Also, I was looking for a story I had made up around the images.<br />The completely different styles that each of the stories were written in made for a very interesting read. The post apocalyptic story called for quite a bit of concentration.<br />All this being said, I had a good time reading it and am sure that I will read it again sometime.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I was not happy with the format of game, eyes too old for the dark rooms.  It was free so I really can't complain too much!
B00915G6YE|4.0|Dexter gets no respect. Showtime has continued to offer little to nothing in the way of \\"special features\\" for the series. While that might not be a big deal for some, it is, for others, one of the reasons that they buy a DVD or Blu-ray. In this instance, the DVD has better \\"special features\\" because you get access to the episode from other Showtime series (\\"The Borgias: Season Two-episodes 1 & 2 and the pilot for the series \\"Ray Donovan\\", biographies--something that was out of date a decade ago). Blu-ray buyers get only the pilot for \\"Ray Donovan\\". Oh, and to add insult to injury the pilot episode is only available as a Ultra Violet Download.<br /><br />Four stars for the season, no stars for the special features.<br /><br />I digress.<br /><br />The seventh season proved that there was still some life in \\"Dexter\\". The previous season showed promise but it fully flowers here on the seventh.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Dexter is caught just after a kill by his sister Debra. She becomes complicit in Dexter's activities because she chooses not to turn him in. She also believes that she can help Dexter control his impulses. Dexter himself becomes involved with a woman who went on a killing spree as a teenager and now quietly runs her own gardening business--except she hasn't exactly given up killing.<br /><br />She suggests that Dexter doesn't have a Dark Passenger at all--that it's all part of HIM which forces Dexter to re-evaluate who he is.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The Blu-ray for Dexter looks exceptionally good. The early Blu-rays released by CBS for Showtime were a mixed bag with nice detail but had issues with noise. \\"Dexter: The Seventh Season\\" looks darn near perfect with skin tones spot on, solid blacks and exceptional detail.<br /><br />The lossless 5.1 mix sounds marvelous as well with excellent use of the format to immerse you in the action. It's an amazingly detailed soundtrack with sounds everywhere. There's also the option for 2.0 surround as well as 5.1 French and Spanish audio tracks.<br /><br />Unfortunately, subtitles are ONLY provided in English which, given that this also has French & Spanish 5.1 mixes available is an odd choice, indeed.<br /><br />We spoke about special features earlier. This continues to be a failing for \\"Dexter\\". Curiously, Jennifer Carpenter tweeted earlier this year that she had completed a commentary track for the seventh season which begs the question--where is it? My guess is that once the show wraps up, CBS will release a boxed set complete with commentary tracks and other special features forcing the hardcore \\"Dexter\\" fans to pony up yet again for something they may have already purchase. If that IS the case, shame on CBS/Paramount/Showtime.<br /><br />We get the pilot for \\"Ray Donovan\\" but that's all folks. It's somewhat embarrassing that what used to be Showtime's flagship series (winner of multiple awards)is treated so shoddily on Blu-ray and DVD.<br /><br /> For those fans who watched the original run on Showtime and want to own this on Blu-ray, the only advantage is that this looks better here than the compressed high def version that ran on Showtime. Aside from that't there's not much else to entice fans.und as well as 5.1 French and Spanish audio tracks.<br /><br />Unfortunately, subtitles are ONLY provided in English which, given that this also has French & Spanish 5.1 mixes available is an odd choice, indeed.<br /><br />We spoke about special features earlier.

B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I loved this app!! Played it everyday and spent real money on it every week. I had almost 70 dragons had spent at least $100 when I went to go play today it had lost my park and started me over at level 1. Do not get this app if you plan on spending money or getting super involved. I have done everything the app said to do to retrieve my park and nothing has worked. Very disappointed
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Good
B008602KQI|4.0|This is a very good film. Unfortunately I have not read the book, however most have told me that the film compliments the book very well. Highly anticipate the sequel which will be released soon.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|at first, i wanted to do stuff on my kindle i couldnt do (i didnt want to root my kindle) i spent days looking for something that could allow me to do what i wish. then my friends told me about this. after a few days, i was furious cuz i didnt know how to use it. after that, i was browsing through all my files. this is an easy to learn app and you really need nothing more than this if you wanna rename, move, copy, edit, or delete files. you probably need no skills with the file editors on the computers to learn how to use this app. i highly recommend this app if you need help accessing your files and stuff.
0307744434|5.0|This is one of those that you read and you are spellbound the entire time. The story weaves does a superb job of weaving together reality and fantasy, past and present. It is romantic, but not overtly so. One of my favorite reads this year!!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis gives such a believable portrait of Lincoln, I forgot I was watching a movie. It was such a turning point in our history that Spielberg and Day-Lewis brought the humanity that has often been forgotten. I think this should be shown in every high school history class.<br /><br />Spielberg does it again and Day-Lewis rightfully receives the Oscar.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing!I had a hard time putting it down once I picked it up,I read chapters at a time.it's definitely Syfi,but there is as lot of drama.the ending almost made me cry,ALMOST! I highly recommend reading it if you liked the first books.<br /><br /> It was very different in the beginning. When I finished the death cure I had no idea what the 4th book could possibly be about.I mean , that was the big,happy ending right?wrong. This book had a surprisingly different twist to it, and if you like surprisingly different twists you should read it. =)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was awesome, I just want more of it so I could keep playing. Can't wait till it's expanded!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Saw it for the first time on m 55&#34; screen... have nothing to compare it to, i.e. how it looked in the theater, but the quality of the image on this blu ray is fantastic.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I have watched ths movie with my children about 21 times.  It has some nice life lessons and is funny and sweet.  My five year of son particularly loves watching it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Despite all the disgruntled letters to the writer, director, author, editor, and their mothers written here in review of Star Wars: The Complete Saga on Blu Ray, I will join the 5 star reviewers in saying WoW.<br /><br />A very worthy purchase.  Yes I have it on DVD but the transfer to Blu Ray is phenomenal.<br /><br />Bravo!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Well done! Keep me interested. Was a little hard at first to understand what to do next but there was help when I needed it.  Looking forward to the next one.
B000A2RRF4|1.0|I would love to know who it is that traveled to Bucharest with their mini camcorder, sat in the last row, stuck the tiny recorder in the pocket of their t-shirt, then sat down and recorded the concert.  Because that's what it look and sounds like.  I didn't bother returning it because it was cheap and it came from a third party seller.  bad bad bad bad bad!
B008Y79HE6|4.0|This must be the 6th time I saw this movie, and enjoyed every minute.....even though I knew what was coming next.  It may be a little hard to believe, but unlike other monster movies...this one is funny.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|This review is for the \\"Complete Matrix Trilogy\\" not the ultimate version.  I find it irritating when reviewers take it upon themselves, as reviewer #1000 to describe each scene of a movie/movies....Everybody wants to be a Siskel & Ebert.  Siiiiigh.  In any event, the Blu Ray quality of these movies is good, not the best I have seen.<br /><br />I bought it because yes, I have a 55\\" HDTV and a surround system, but mainly because I never bought the entire trilogy on DVD, and this set was under $20 at the time.  If you have a Blu Ray machine that up-converts DVD's to HD  and you have the full set on DVD, and you're just an all around hard core scifi fan, maybe put your money toward something like the Blu Ray / 4K [yes 4K] set of the new Total Recall currently available for pre-order.  Or something else.<br /><br />If you are a total Matrix-Freak, and you could just never get enough of The Matrix, then you should def, def, definitely buy the \\"Ultimate\\" set not the Complete Set.......
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I can't select different armors and the armory is glitched. It's a good game, but I think it needs an update before I can fully experience it.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|Natalie Portman delivers a stunning performance as a very troubled and haunted young dancer who can't quite separate reality from fantasy as she pushed herself over the edge to prepare for the coveted role of Black Swan.  Mila Kunis is suprisingly effective as her supposed nemesis, and Ksenia Solo also deserves mention for her portrayal of fellow aspiring soloist Veronica.
0679805273|5.0|My daughter just finished k-4 but I got this book now so each year her teacher can write a message for her in it.  I will give it to her on her graduation day probably with lots of tear marks.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I don't know why on all the reviews of this book they didn't like it as much as Ender's Game. First of all if you read the preface this book was designed to stand alone anyway. Personally, I love that Ender is brought back and that you get to see the brilliant military child grow up into an adult. The consequences of his actions as a child really reflect on his personality as an adult and I love every minute of it.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I purchased this series with very high hopes based on the reviews I read. I purchased is as &#34;used&#34; but, reportedly, in excellent condition.  It appeared to be in &#34;like new condition&#34; when I received the series. However, I found they would not play on either of my Samsung Blu Ray players even though they were properly rated for my geographical location. I followed Amazon's troubleshooting guidelines without any success. I then contacted Samsung for the &#34;Blu-Ray Update Discs&#34; they provide (free of charge).  When the discs arrived, I inserted them to update my players. I was informed that NO UPDATE NECESSARY on either of my Blu-Ray players. All of these troubleshooting actions took time to complete.  By the time I had accomplished all that I was supposed to do, according to Amazon's recommendations, the return time window had expired!<br /><br />I called and spoke with Amazon about all of this but really got no satisfaction. I ended up returning the OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE DVD SERIES with a letter fully explaining everything enclosed. I asked Amazon to check the DVDs themselves to confirm what I was saying. I also asked them to replace the series or send me something comparable by this same presenter.  That was several, several weeks ago. They have my purchase price, AND they have their product back.  I have nothing as I have yet to get a response from Amazon regarding this issue.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Amazon has refused to respond to my concerns regarding this matter. I am a long standing customer with Amazon, and I have acted in good faith with them. I'm very disappointed that they have not responded to this issue.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of those books that you can read every year and it never gets old and it never gets boring. This is the first time though I was so engaged that I bought the sequels Ender's Shadow and Speaker for the Dead.
B008Q00BOQ|3.0|Not much to say.  MI II was merely okay.  Truthfully didn't care all that much about it.  There are far worse films out there and MI II was marginally entertaining, but ultimately highly forgettable.  MI II was so improbable that it reminded me of some of the earlier James Bond films with all of their absurdities.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This was my introduction to the Homeland series and what an introduction!  Great acting, great plot! I'm hooked and I'm eager to watch more.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I'm a huge Tarantino fan so am willing to overlook many of his excesses simply because I enjoy so many of his excesses.  Jamie Foxx is great as always and Christoph Waltz turns in another fine performance for Tarantino (though not nearly as compelling as his performance in Inglourious Basterds).  DiCaprio does a wonderful job as your stereo-typical plantation/slave owner and Sam Jackson turns in fine performance as the totally owned house boy.  This is not Tarantino's best work.  It's much too derivative of his other films in way too many ways.  Nevertheless, it is still pure Tarantino and if you don't mind his excesses, I would definitely say go for it.  It is a film I will own.
B000FC0V3E|1.0|I saw nothing, read nothing in this book. Aimless drifting of a bunch of dropped-out veterans that I could not relate to. Poor boys, all that traveling, all that drinking and a story line that was dull and of no interest.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Extremely HANDY.... fits on just about anything, and since its structure is made of hard wire, it bends and molds to whatever you have.  Really nice option to add to any stroller that doesn't come with a cup holder.  As a matter of fact, I use it on my Uppa Baby stroller, because the cup holders they offered was REEEAAALLLy expensive, and I felt I had already payed enough on the stroller itself.  I also use this product on a Mia Mode stroller.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is such a great series! Lots of drama w/o the trashiness that today's shows seem to think they need to generate interest.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game had me hooked from the start, I couldn't put it down.  It made me think and want so easy that the answers were right there for you, you really had to look. And the hints helped but still didn't give the game away.  Also, the graphics were awesome.  Can't wait for another game to come out.
B004TI1WME|3.0|I downloaded this as a free app of the day to use on my Kindle Fire.  The app is handy for on-demand calculations, but not useful for providing a professional historical audit trail.  Overall, this calculator is basic and functional.  For my purposes, though, the lack of ability to make a professionally formatted printed record is downright frustrating, and (since I don't want to have to re-accomplish my work) it forces me to use a different tool.<br /><br />What I Like<br /><br />1. You can look at the list and immediately know what your last entry was.  This is extremely handy if you are attempting to add up a list of numbers in an environment in which you must cope with frequent interruptions.  This feature alone saves an incredible amount of time because when accuracy is extremely important, you won't need to re-start every time you are interrupted.<br />2. The numbers are large enough that you I can use my fingers instead of a stylus to perform data entry.<br />3. You can see the information you enter immediately.<br />4. The interface is extremely responsive to touch.<br />5. The app's functionality mirrors that of an old-fashioned (and basic) desk-top calculator.  For example, you can run a virtual tape, or clear the current entry prior to hitting the mathematical operation key.<br />6. The information you are currently entering is very visible.  The current entry is displayed immediately above your number entry pad, in a much large font size than the numbers on the data pad. The size of the data display is large enough to allow you to complete your work without straining your eyes.<br />7. The virtual tape displays numbers in a nice size of font.  These numbers are larger than the data entry pad, but smaller than the current data entry information.<br />8. You can touch the screen to expand the screen so that you see only the virtual tapes, without the data entry pad.  This if handy when making a side-to-side comparison.<br />9. The user gets to set the number of decimals.  Providing a floating decimal makes the app extremely responsive to the immediate data entry needs of the end user.<br />10. The data display switches between black (positive) and red (negative).  This is very nice.<br />11.  The end user has a good variety of options that can be customized to the needs of the moment.<br /><br />UPDATE ADDED  I figured out how to edit the tape, and have moved that item from the don't like to the like side of the equation, and have clarified issues related to the historical audit trail.<br /><br />12. The product description indicates that you can make go back to a previous entry and make a correction.  It wasn't easy to find the instructions, and they weren't very clear, but there is a tape menu that is accessible by going to the tape view, pressing down on the screen, and holding the press down for a couple of seconds.  This will make a tape menu pop up, and you can select to edit the tape, delete lines, add text annotations, etc.  You can also copy the information over and export it to a clipboard from there, but the transport to the clipboard doesn't retain the format or provide the printed version of the tape I'm looking for in financial management work.<br /><br />What I Don't Like<br /><br />1.  The app allows you to select up to five decimal points.  If I'm doing any type of analysis beyond the most basic sort of two-digit, five digits doesn't provide enough precision for my purposes (financial analyses).<br />2.  There isn't any way to print your virtual tape.  This eliminates your nicely presented audit trail as soon as you move on. (You can export the tape to another program, but there are issues with that - read next item and other reviews.)<br />3. You can copy the information entered onto the tape and export it to a clipboard from there, but the transport to the clipboard doesn't retain the format or provide the printed version of the tape I'm looking for.  You have no permanent printed record of your work directly available in the format presented within this app, and other people cannot review your work (immediately or six years from now).  My rating remains at three stars because this challenge alone makes the app worth less for historical purposes.  I just can't create an audit trail that can be used for professional purposes, and I don't believe in unnecessary rework for the purposes of creating audit trails.rk directly available in the format presented within this app, and other people cannot review your work (immediately or six years from now).

0670000337|2.0|Truly a great book with an incredible level of using the English language to make you feel the dust and degradation of the spirit.. Steinbeck is a wordsmith with incredible insight into the soul.
B005K01VZS|4.0|As the author of [[ASIN:0974637475 Saving Your Faith, Your Home, and Your House:: A Guide to Faith in Turbulent Times]] I couldn't agree more with the author that as Americans struggle in these hard times they turn to faith.  Will faith let us down too as institutions have?  Are we prepared for the doubt that comes when we believe.  These issues are ones that I dealt with in my book and they are brought to light in this book too.  Faith is real and powerful; and learning a deeper understanding of faith is vital in this 21st century.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Saw this while on retreat last year and decided to purchase it.  Despite the subject, I found the scenes of the preparation of the bodies absolutely fascinating and beautifully executed.  Loved how all the storyline strands wove themselves together.  Not a film for everybody as the central subject could be seen as macabre and upsetting and the whole film too slow but I found it very satisfying and enjoyable.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Had never heard of this before seeing a still of it on Facebook, which was enough to peek my interests.  This is a wonderful movie.  I would highly recommend watching it!
B00BO2VKBG|5.0|Generally, the songs have less of a swing to 'em than the last album did and they've got a more desolate feel, but they are still hooky as hell, the solos are killer, the riffs are devastating, and the playing is a lot tighter. The band plays both slower and faster than they had done before, depending on the song, and they allow songs to meander into strange territory more-so than before; the opening track feels almost like a medley of a few different songs. Conceptually, lyrics seem to be sung mostly from the point of view of a cult leader or an abusive, controlling lover. So, creepy as ever. I absolutely did not expect to like this album as much as Blood Lust, but it turns out I love it. It's a good progression made by a great band.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun game!  I play it so often that my wife has started giving me looks when I play.  It can be a little clipy at times but still a good game.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This version has it all.. This version also has the 3D and digital copies as well as a gorgeous holographic sleeve. Disney has been improving these holographic images for the last few years and starting with Brave they really feel like the image jumps out about 2jn off the box.<br /><br /> The movie is fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate the value of a good character. If you are a gamer or love arcade culture you will find additional value in some familiar motifs. Bowser, Ryu, Sonic, and even Pong make brief appearances. At heart it's about a character who is stuck with what he is but has to find a way for that to be ok while not overwhelming the character he wants to be when he's not in the limelight. It's sort of from the point of view of celebrities and the line that divides a performance of a specific character  from the person outside of the performance when they are no longer on strange. However, in this case, the actor  has only one part to play forever.
B0055IU4GM|5.0|Once again John Hiatt delivers a CD packed with great music! Love every song on it. Why do we need to have a min number of words??????
B005K17RU0|4.0|I find the app easy to use, and the information is laid out well. Hard to complain about a free app unless it messes up other apps or freezes frequently,  which this does not. only wish accuracy of forecasts was better but that's a science/art issue not the app! by-and-large AccuWeather is as good or better than any weather forecast.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This rendition of Sherlock is the absolute best one. Period. Fantastic acting all around, cinematography is great (especially for a TV show) and the plotlines hold mostly true to the original books. Seriously, Sherlock's character is just dead on imo.<br /><br />Very well done. One of the few TV series I've watched through more than twice.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Wasnt a huge Bob Marley fan but ordered the documentary out of curiosity. I love they way they portrayed his life story and philosophies. would recommend.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Love this series... Have already read 3 - captivating and mysterious, full of adventure and fun fantasy!  A must read for fantasy fans indeed :)
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I don't want to play Angry Birds on Facebook, didn't know this when I downloaded it.  I later deleted it.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Once I started reading I couldn't stop. I did have to put it down for a few minutes from time to time so I could pull myself together though. I was completely overcome with one strong emotion after another. I called my mom after I finished reading it to tell her that she had to read it too. Jaycee did a wonderful job telling her story. She certainly touched my heart.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I have to say its not what Lord of the Rings was, but considering how greatly its being tied in to the overall story, you have to see it, own it and keep watching it.  The movie was enjoyable even for my kids and as a family pic, great.  Being a fan of the original LOTR I found myself being overly critical of the movie because I think it lacked the grandeur of those 3 we saw several years ago.  After watching it a few times, I started to enjoy it more and more to the point I started re watching it few times a week.  The movie does grow on you so do give it a shot.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was such a good book I really loved it! Such a good story and unlike anything else I have read. TRULY an emotional journey th a that I could not stop reading!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig really bounced back from Quantum of Solace.  This movie really went back to what we loved of Casino Royale.  The story is fantastic, the action was incredible and the payoff simply a delight!  Can't wait for the next Bond!  Highly encourage anyone that loved Casino Royale to get this as this movie in just plain and simply awesome!
B000F8O35U|5.0|I bought this dvd for my little grand daughter and she loves it.  She likes to dance to the music, good soundtrack.  It came well within the alloted time frame and was well packaged.  Another very good buy from Amazon.  Ellen P.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I liked this book because of the scary moments the happy moments and the making out between Percy Jackson and Annabeth
B00BESIKWM|1.0|The storyline couldn't hold my attention. The acting was less than what I would expect, even for a &#34;scary movie&#34;. I would stop at the first film.
1401917186|5.0|This is a very enlightening book! Worth the reading. Doreen Virtue is a fabulous author and I love her books. Enjoy!
B003ITIQ88|5.0|The love and bond between an dog and his owner is amazing.  Destiny played a roll in this love able pair, and knew they needed each other. I love this movie..I cried and felt the loss of pain as Hachi did.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|The storyline that runs through this series is well written and well developed. And the plots of each episode are seamlessly woven into this storyline, and are equally well constructed. It makes for viewing experience you don't want to stop. I've watched as many as 4 or 5 episodes in one sitting.<br /><br />The characters too are well developed. They have color and depth that, along with the plot, make this a very engrossing and engaging show.<br /><br />In other words, yeah, I think I'd recommend it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|this game is a lot of fun especially if you're into puzzles! I just wish I didn't have to pay for puzzles I really wanted.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Would not open the executable file so we could play.  So, maybe I can download again on another tablet when I get it.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This is a good scanner for the price.  It was easy to use.  Doesn't have the bells and whistles or the clarity of the higher priced scanners but it also does not have a high price.  It did the job that I needed fairly quickly and efficiently.
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|really love the story and the history lesson in the early years of the CIA. The movie has a great cast which alone should be enough to watch it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Great book for any age. Might need to read it twice!  Required reading for some schools but don't wait for the teacher to assign it.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Didn't expect less from the director of cast. film is long but keeps you engaged the whole time with action and funny commentary. Would recommend seeing if you are looking for a modern take on spaghetti westerns.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This is another great movie that Stallone does a great job of keeping you entertained, I enjoy action films, and if you do then I am sure that you will enjoy this one.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis makes a convincing Abe Lincoln, and the story couldn't be more perfect for the times. would recommend watching.
B00943SQCI|4.0|Its not real funny, but it was ok. I liked it, and would recommend this movie for adults, I don't think its for kids.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|the characters might be real but the story is no where near accurate. some of the movie has cheesy acting which I is hard to tell if it was intended to make it appear like a mid century picture or if the acting and writing was just that bad. It provides some action but overall was just okay, probably nothing I would watch again.
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|Nothing new just more of the same. This movie is just like the others, there is a story, but its on the same wave length as the others.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is a fun upgrade if you can actually call it that of the original Temple Run.  It is what it is. It will keep you entertained but it was disappointing considering the first one.
B0094M0P4G|5.0|Great writing!  Great singing! Amazing dancing!  Great story line.  An overall awesome movie to watch over and over again!  Buy it!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is simple, fun and straight to the point. Keeping in mind this is for a tablet not for a console, so yes this is probably one of the best considering how original it was. great job on it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is amazing.  I am thoroughly enjoying the third season of Downton Abbey.  I cannot wait to see what happens next!
B00138GZAC|5.0|I'm a softie at heart, I love the way she sings, so gentle and her feelings come out so vividly.
B009MYARIK|3.0|It was a little predictable. It entertained me enough to finish it though. Not sure I will try her again.
B004SDEP38|3.0|What can I say it is what it is, a free version of office.  not bad but not great but it will do for a cheap person like me.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I completed the free version.  And, then went back and redid to get all scores under 4 min 40 seconds.  Decided to purchase the complete version.  Can't wait to get started with new challenges!  I like this one the best because you can reshuffle and eventually complete the puzzle.  Some don't let you clear the board.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight, the second of the three part series is a great tour de force movie that really hits home for the fans and the curious partakers alike.  The blu-ray version translates the action sequences into a stunning quality fit for anyone who wants to experience the movie as much as possible.  This version, a rather fun variant from the others, features a Joker cover with a fun Joker oriented display on the back detailing the movie.<br /><br />The two villains in the film are, of course, The Joker and Two Face with a few occurrences of Scarecrow.  Batman is effectively pushed aside by Heath Ledger's performance of The Joker, and it's truly a tragedy that Ledger will be unable to play the part again in the future, or any part for that matter.  For this to be his last performance is sadly ironic since it was done so very well. To have pushed Batman aside, however, is forgivable since The Joker is the arch nemesis after all.  It's just unfortunate that Heath's character stops at the end of the film.  One other peeve is how they took care of Harvey Dent's Two Face.  But, for those who have not seen the film, I will not ruin it for you.<br /><br />The movie itself is well done, and sets up the final movie well enough.  It's two hours and twenty minutes of action, humor, drama, and enjoyment.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie does an excellent job of portraying Bipolar Disorder.  I'm a therapist so I know.  It's encouraging and shows that you can live a full life even with mental illness.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Cannot stop watching this! It is such an intelligent and well-written series. The actors are incredible. You will be hooked!
0470913029|3.0|This book went into too much detail for me.  I wanted to know the basics with dietary instructions and could have gotten that without reading this book.  I did pick up a few new things but not much.  It's common sense if you know anything about health and nutrition. Save your money.
B00AEFYS8G|5.0|While it is evidently slower than what modern people are now used to, at the same time without snazzy special effects, I can honestly say I immersed myself in 1968 while watching this movie (1968 was when the movie came out).
B005J2UM9S|5.0|Oh. My. God. I can't believe it took me this long to finally watch this movie. Wow. Do it. Seriously.
B009178OQA|4.0|It was a good story because it showed the dedication to the form of making sushi and the details involved with being a perfectionist in the art which today is lost in today's world.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Do more levels would be great! Enjoyed it very much!  I am not a facebook person so if you could let us go to more levels with out having to on face book would great too! Thanks for this game it is a good one! J. P.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I honestly luv this app butt IT IS ONLY A DEMO NEED MORE TIME ,MOM WOULD NOT LET ME GET FULL VERSION but still good app
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is the best book I've ever read. I love it more then any other book in th world
B0083Z614S|5.0|I choose to rate this book 5 star it . Was mystery romance and those are some of the things that I love in books
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Well Done Thriller and Grace Kelly looks gorgeous !  Highly recommend and think you will enjoy it if you have never seen the movie.
B005K17RU0|1.0|AccuWeather used to be my favorite app on my Kindle Fire. It was absolutely perfect. It displayed the information I wanted in a way that was both beautiful and super easy to read. There was a reason the app had a 4.5 star rating. The new app is completely useless to me because I cannot easily see the hourly and daily forecast. I will be deleting the app from my Kindle.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Really good show.  Lots of action and he has a smoking hot body.  Stories are good as well.  Hope there are many more seasons.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My daughter is just getting into these kinds of games (infrequently) and she likes the poking; i can help her by suggesting shapes and colors to help her select the correct item.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a great book!! This book has everything you need to get started and to continue to workout. It goes over everything from weight loss (cutting), gaining size, and \\"maintaining\\" (avoiding fat gain, while still increasing in strength and build, supplements, diet, different exercises, everything needed to reach what ever goal you are trying to get to. I have not been lifting for a while due to an injury and schooling (college), but have lifted in the past and have tried many different ways to lift and while I gained some size and strength I found that my shoulders would hurt as well as elbows, etc. due to improperly lifting. This book breaks everything down so you know exactly what you are doing and when. With that said you do have to do a little work to match your schedule. You also will need to put together your diet plan with the formula given as no book can give you a plan that exactly tailors to each and every individual individually (hope that makes since). I also have a medical background in Sports Medicine and nursing and everything laid out makes perfect and absolute sense as well as researched by peer reviewed articles. If advise in the book is followed results are certain!!!!!! Mike Matthews even gives you his contact info for any follow up questions, concerns, etc. (I have never seen this before). In case your wondering, Yes, I have written an e-mail and it was responded to by the next day and I found the response very helpful. I am truly amazed and glad I found this book. I was led to this book by a review for another book I was looking at (It said to get this book instead and I am glad I did). The Bigger Leaner Stronger book is different from the Thinner Leaner Stronger book by how many reps to perform as well as a couple of different exercises to add and there is no bulking in the thinner leaner stronger book. If you are a woman get the Thinner Leaner Stronger book and don't copy the diet and workout info in Bigger Leaner Stronger (Everything elseis pretty much the same). I purchased the book and not the kindle version as I like to have a hard copy in front of me.
1401324649|5.0|Funny and brainy.  What a fine story that replays much of the history of the 20th century from the vantage point of a 100 year old man.  I sent a copy to my mom, and we have been enjoying reading along together.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Am a huge fan of the Zombie Apocalypse, for lack of a better term.<br /><br />This was a detailed, thought-out venture into the possible future of those who are destined to survive such an encounter.  If you ever needed a good read and provocative material to pique your interest, this is it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Trust me, it is good. If for some reason you are even reading this then don't read this book. I didn't even look at reviews before I bought this one.
B0017QDH3S|4.0|I really liked this movie, lots of action good story and pretty good acting. always have enjoyed a good sci fi.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I feel like a heroin addict who has just gone cold turkey.  This book was soooo much beter than the 4th if you are asking that silly question, and yes I am shaking from withdrawal.<br /><br />Buy this book, give GRRM all of your money!
B0086DBE62|5.0|This was just a delightful movie.  Pure escapism. Lets you forget the worries of the world for awhile.  Loved it.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This was my least favorite of the series, of which I have read all, but you still have no choice and must read it.  Deal with it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first sentence made me want to put the book down. A man climbing to his own death? How depressing. From there it just got more and more exciting, tumbling down and down, around and around the spiral of lives hurtling to a climax that encompasses the population of the planet, such as it is. A great read, and I can't wait for the next one!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Maybe the greatest book I have ever gazed upon. It was like crack for my imagination and left shaking for more when I was finished.<br /><br />Buy this book. You have no choice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it is just that awesome like turtles I like turtles o I like green greens cool minecraft wat was I talking about
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If I hadn't already read this book, I would do it in sync with the series... but I have, so you do it instead.<br /><br />As with the rest of this series:<br />Buy, read, repeat.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I chose to read this book because I wanted to learn what a Navy Seal goes through while training for such an important mission. It was very interesting to learn how the mission was carried out to capture one of the most notorious terrorist in the world. Very good book.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|Awesome. Super Interesting. It won a Pulitzer... Obviously it is good.<br /><br />But seriously, this book was expertly written and researched.  The level of detail Yergin provides while remaining interesting throughout is astounding. I recommend this to all of my friends, and they thank me for it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down. It only took me a few hours to finish. It was so suspenseful and ended on a cliff hanger. I absolutely recommend this book.
B00CCZ4BFQ|5.0|Like the title say's great CD. It kind of has a Heart Break Station sound to it. This is the kind of CD that you will listen to every song, not just skip to the favorites. This is my new favorite album. Trust me if you are checking this one out, BUY IT...  you will be happy you did.<br /><br />  Dano
B005PK56TA|4.0|the only thing bad I can say about it is that the story was stretched too much.  If everything was condensed down by 3 episodes it would have been excellent.
B0028IDXDS|3.0|I don't know what all the hype was about this. Our boy didn't take it at all. The pacifier wasn't orthopedic. So hard to keep clean as there's no cap for it. Once it's dirty you have to wash the entire thing, including plush toy. Wish it had an option to insert a new pacifier.
B00ABO609A|2.0|very arty, but a boring story.  great acting from actors you'll never see again.  slow moving but true to life.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Really like Star Gate Atlantis.. the characters are done very well and in my opinion, easy to follow. HIghly recommend it to anyone that is into Star Trek.. throughout the first series, every now and then there will be some reference made of Star Trek, which is meant to lighten a scene up and I think it is hilarious when the characters do this.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Like historical novels and fiction/fantasy. This has both. It's a fun read though at times can be a bit too detailed about things that don't help further the plot along at all, but it's fun none the less.
B003JH8LPW|2.0|You can see the devices that will serve Dan Brown later in better novels, but we all have to crawl before we run.<br /><br />In this novel the characters happily eschew the obvious for the obscure in a book that proves you can turn a short story into a novel if all of your characters miss all the clues all the time..<br /><br />The fun of the novel is that the reader feels very smart, like the kid at the Saturday matinee who tries to warn the screen hero that the outlaw was not out cold from one punch and is sneaking up on our hero..<br /><br />This is fun on that level, and cool to see that, in fact, he did get better
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm wondering if Charlaine Harris left things a little open ended so that if she decided to in the future, she could pick it up again. It was a good read, but for the most part largely predictable. It felt, flat. Like she really didn't want to write the book at all but needed to have some closure for the readers. I am happy she wrote the book, I enjoyed reading it and by no means am I saying I didn't. But I didn't feel that same spark as I had reading other Sookie Novels. Still, I can't help but wonder what else Charlaine has up her sleeve.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Such a great story from a warrior who was taken before his time. I can't wait to read his next book on american gun history.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Ted is not sensationalism, it is thought provoking, innovative messages from critical thinkers.  I truly enjoy how the submect matter is categorized and look forward to the new topics.  The length of the videos is great for a quick watch over lunch or while waiting for an appointment.  The world's innovators give me so much to think about.  One of my favorite apps.
1840220554|5.0|Loved the novels by Jane Austen, spent my summer reading all of them...should not have waited so long to enjoy them again, haven't read her books since high school....
1451695195|1.0|I first picked up this book in Target and could not put it down. Upon reading the rest of it at a later time--about halfway through--I felt something very strong within myself urging me to put it aside--that it was not in keeping with the Bible. I realize that others who don't believe in the Bible will ridicule me here, but whatever Eban Alexander experienced was not what the Bible says about heaven. It says that we are created in God's image. If we look in the mirror, we are not an orb, we are not a light. The Bible says that when we see the Trinity/Father/Son/Holy Ghost, that we will see His nail-pierced HANDS. This is a physical attribute. I asked myself if the reason I had a problem with this book was because Eban's description of God was different from MY picture of God. What I came away with was that my \\"problem\\" was, simply, that Eban's descriptions of heaven were not biblically sound. Then I saw another review for this book that captured my feelings exactly. I will borrow that verse--used in that review--to assist me in illustrating my point here:<br /><br />\\"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago--whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows--such a one was caught up to the third heaven. And I know such a man--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows --how he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which it is NOT LAWFUL FOR A MAN TO UTTER.\\" 2 Corinthians 12:2-4<br /><br />This tells us that even IF we went to heaven temporarily--such a place is too SACRED to even speak about. Does this reasoning apply to the book written by that little boy a few years ago? Well...I personally think that that little boy heard a lot growing up in his household. \\"Normal\\" (forgive the word) children his age don't talk like that....a lot of things he said sounded like things that could've been overheard being said at his home and church, and expounded on.<br /><br />I don't want to assume that I know whom God chooses to use to \\"inform or encourage\\" us---however, the Bible explicitly says that the space between heaven and hell is a \\"fixed chasm\\". What Dr. Alexander describes as traveling between the Earthworm Eye's view and the Gateway/Core, is not in keeping with the two dimensions that the Bible describes. The words Fixed Chasm are used to emphasize how FINAL each destination is. My advise to anyone really interested in the subject of Heaven, is to also read the book, \\"Heaven\\" by Randy Alcorn, just to get another perspective.<br /><br />As for Dr. Alexander's work, I give it a score of 1--not because I disagree with the content--but because I found the book tiring to read. I have a degree in an applied science, and do love science, but it started to read a little like a text book, and my mind started wandering in and out. In short, it's not a book to take to the beach.that I know whom God chooses to use to \\"inform or encourage\\" us---however, the Bible explicitly says that the space between heaven and hell is a \\"fixed chasm\\".

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really love this game. It is a great way to wine down after work. I was very happy went they put it on the kindle fire.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|So far this is a pretty good game. Will have to get through at least half of it before I can give a more definite positive review.<br />---A HALF HOUR LATER---<br />I only got a few scenes more after what I just posted. Had to pay 4.99 if I wanted to play more. Not my understanding of free. Oh, granted, they tell you you can buy more apps within the game to \\"enhance?\\" it, but I don't remember reading that you had to pay to continue past the beginning.<br />Although to be honest, if you want to pay, it seems like a very interesting game. There are others that are just as good and cheaper.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Too short! You could finish it in one sitting! I hope the next one is longer!<br />The game is somewhat challenging but you can figure out very quickly plus the hints give the game away too easily! For the price is not worth it!
B005PK1G76|5.0|I own a Phil and Ted classic stroller with double attachment, and while I love my stroller, it offers few bells and whistles. The customizable options for high end strollers can be rather expensive, so I was looking for an alternative to use as a cup holder for my stroller. This little caddy is an excellent value, very sturdy, and holds two drinks plus keys, wallet, and other odds and ends. I think it would fit any stroller very easily.  (Other reviewers are spot on about the strong chemical smell... You may want to let it air out before using... Preferably outdoors.)
B00008S7KC|5.0|this is a must have gives you one on one time with the members of the band its amazing and worth it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This year is the best I have seen in years.  It is totally engaging, funny at times and heart-wrenching at other times.  It is an absolute must-see!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|How to handle life, and make choices. And to be confronted with the choices you made.<br />It's close to the heart!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is phenomenal!  The acting is tremendous, the costumes are beautiful and the storyline is totally engaging.  A must see for all ages!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Always fascinating how life and love works!<br />All the books of Jodi Picoult are worthwhile, and she's not afraid to write about difficult subjects.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works great everytime, I love to use it when I am out of town, really keeps me updated on all my selling and buying.  I have never had it fail.
B002S45V32|5.0|Awsome movie, going down memory lane and just smiling! Get soundtrack and MAN THE CLOTHES WE WORE THEN! 80'S RULED!
1432794426|5.0|This book should be in every library, City, County and Schools. Everyone especially if you are a member of the Media should have to read this book! Wheather you're an MJ fan or not I guanantee you will see this gentle soul through different eyes after reading this very informative book! I could never thank the author enough for going to all the trouble and time!!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I am a fan of The Notebook and A Walk to Remember which are sappy and straight forward romantic movies. There plot twists and suspense ( in a Nick Sparks story?!), which is a nice change. The setting is beautiful and makes me want to move back down south - or at least back to the coast!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, definately lived up to the hype.  The ending seemed to me to be a bit rushed but otherwise no complaints. Great characters and plot!!
B000002TYX|4.0|This anthology has a lot of early Beatles greats and some very early songs from before they were well known.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great story line. The interactions between the characters continues to build. Love the idea of this &#34;fringe science&#34; that brings so many elements together.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I thought it was a very touching story. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper nailed the part and were very likeable.
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|I've watched this movie twice. There is a lot to take in. It seems to be about reincarnation and how you can make your life better or maybe worse.
B00992CF6W|3.0|compared to the xbox version if the Pc version, this game doesn't stand a chance. needs more redstone and has to have more fun stuff, not just blocks. otherwise it is a fairly decent app
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Great and enlightening movie!  Parents with young teenagers in the house should watch it together to understand and discuss how innocent situations can turn tragic.
B001993Y2C|3.0|Well i got mine very fast for free shiping and the outside caseing looks awsome but mine didnt come with the pic of the actors at the bottom but that doesnt bug me much but my cyclon that came with it was missing a shoulder plate and doesnt come with and exchangeable hands or switchable pices so u cant put it in a shooting position and like everyone else says it is cheaply  made when it comes to holding the discs me personaly i am gonna get slim jewl cases and then put them in the season set box but it does look cool on the shelf if u have room for it but if u just want the series and u r a big fan of battlestar and ur on a budget this set is the way to go for bluray
B0029LCJJS|4.0|This was entertaining historic drama about a very volitile period of European history.  With many powerful secular leaders and the politics (internal and external) of the Catholic Church, the period was ripe with conflict.  The interpersonal struggles were the best aspect of the season.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I'd past this movie up a couple times just cause it didn't seem like it would be my thing. This afternoon I decided to give it a try, based mostly of the leading ladies. But to my surprise, the supporting cast was actually pretty good as well. I laughed a bit, and some of of the more touching moments really got to me. Overall, I'd recommend just giving it a chance, even if its not your thing.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is an excellent TV Series.  I really enjoyed it.  Exciting, tense, very well<br />worth watching.  I have 2nd Season on order.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I was looking for a good Christian stories, im not a big reader but Im trying to get into more reading. I was looking for a book with stories of Biblical characters, well this is perfect. This author really keeps your attention, and the stories keep you thinking about them and their characters throughout the day, will pass it on.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I am an avid hidden object gamer first on the computer now i also play on my kindle fire. always was a fan of big fish games this was my first G5 game and i loved it. Great combination of hidden object and puzzles great graphics and story even a good length. Its definitely worth the $5.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I think this movie is great. When it was playing at theaters it didn't appeal to me cos it looked boring in the commercial maybe it was bad marketing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well it is certainly  shocking -  I knew it was slightly shocking when I ordered it,  but  this was more than I expected.  I'm a 73 year old widow, and  some of it  was quite startling. . LOL  I do like that the girl did speak back to him and made him change from totally  a owner,  to where  he was made to think  someone else may have some thoughts of their own.  And  I just felt that he kind of liked the adventure.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|After watching this movie I can see why Jeniffer Lawrence won the oscar. I am suprised that Bradley Cooper did not also win.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|It's a dark and twisted prelude to one of the most macabre icons. Building upon the relationship between Will and Hannibal while delving into their psyche presenting a troubled man and a monster that is still quite human despite his habits.
0465011047|5.0|Very good book! i read this book withing 16 hours and was interested the entire time. very compelling story. i am going to read it again so the story sinks in deeper . highly recommended
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|something new and exciting each week with just the right amount of humor, not the run of the mill series
1476712042|5.0|Loved the detail and dramatic effect of conflicting emotions the priciple character stuggled with.  Looking forward to more work from J. McGuire.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Really, just get this. It's King Crimson meets classic Genesis through the lens of Wilson's unique styles. Get it, you won't regret it.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The story did not really go anywhere.  It was hard to keep reading this book.  Since I finish what I start, I finished it but it was very easy to put down.
B00BNYCFNM|4.0|I may change this upwards over time, but for the moment, it's a 4 from where I sit. I do love this band.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Story line, actors, and cinematography excellent!  Each actor does well portraying their strength, character flaws, and even those who are primarily 'scheming' have a few scenes where their hearts can be seen.<br />Great ensemble cast with beautiful scenery!
B00915G6WQ|2.0|The overall theme of the disappointing season seven of \\"Dexter\\" can be summed up in a quote from one of the producers; \\"People have to remember that Dexter is not a superhero. He's a bad guy; a serial killer\\".<br />\\"Dexter\\" was one of the few programs left on TV that I would actually set time aside to watch. The writing was intelligent, it had a strange and engaging sense of humor and had a mostly superb cast. What season seven managed to do was lose the fine line of good taste that made the show such a joy to watch.<br />For some reason it was felt that Deborah need to develop an incestuous desire for Dexter. There were six seasons ahead of this establishing Deb's sense of family loyalty, they did not need to fly off in this uncharacteristic line to establish her motives for the final episode. Her conflict over this felt contrived and forced.<br />There have been complaints over the killing of Maria but considering the inconsistency of the character I personally felt she should have gone long ago. She's a selfish, amoral, bask stabbing political animal; no, wait, she has a deeply motivating love of community - oops, um, no - it's her sense of duty that drives her. It really seemed that during several seasons they had no idea of what to do with her so they pulled some story line out of the air to accommodate keeping the character on the air. This, however, is not the reason why the killed of Maria; they needed a lynch pin to drive season eight and that was it.<br />Even more problematic for season seven was their inability to maintain the sense of humor. The attempt was there but the execution left much to be desired. Whether it was in the editing or the script is hard to tell, but Dexter's funny little internal observations come off as morbid and angry. All through this season he keeps telling Deborah that this is his territory, he's used to problem solving in this atmosphere. The funny little observations he would make over his irritations are now ruthless and devoid of wit.<br />I will purchase this season but I will wait until it is drastically reduced in price. That purchase is more about my \\"OCD\\" sense of continuity in that I have all the prior seasons. If you're a casual fan and don't have the other DVD sets then rent \\"Dexter\\" season seven or borrow a friend's. The only true reason for seeing it is the lay out for season eight.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Best think JT has done to date!!!  He has out done him self this time.  I love every song.  So very good!!!!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Speeches on many interesting subjects. Topics to interest anyone from scientific subjects to cuisine of eating insects. Highly recommend for everyone.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Written with a thought provoking different perspective. It made me feel that basic humanity can manifest itself under the perverse conditions that exist under a cruel authoritarian society.
B0063M22QO|3.0|only just got the game. good Color, easy to play. I love the game mahjong, so we will see how it goes.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I purchased this book on my Kindle and added Whispersync so my 10 year old son and I could listen to it in the car. He absolutely loved it!! And I enjoyed rediscovering one of my childhood favorites. He was most impressed with Long John Silver as every boy should be. Jim Hawkins is running a close second in neighborhood role playing with good old Long John in first. Several other boys in the neighborhood have started reading Treasure Island on my son's recommendation!
B007LB5MF4|1.0|After a rather lengthy download, the print was so small, it was impossible to read (see). I tried the 3 zoom magnifications I was given and they were too big to fit on the screen.  Somehow, somewhere I must have missed that this was the comic book version, but when I forwarded to the pages the print was just impossible to see at all. Wasted $14.
B00CHILW64|3.0|This movie was ok, not great, not terrible. It did do a great job of showing the horror of th  tsunami.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Its a good and old game, Its a challenge to win so it keeps me going to win a game.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|I watched this simply for the costumes, which were amazing. The story was very interesting  but th  production was bizarre.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I love this movie and was glad it was affordable with the digital copy included.  Can't find the same for Wreck it Ralph.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I already had a Solitaire game, but it seemed I was playing the same deals over and over again.  This game is better even though it has ads.  You can skip the ads and get right back to a game.  The graphics are nice and you can change the background and other things to suit your taste.  It has the tap to move feature, too, but little sound.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie is a good. The characters were given proper justice. But not as good as the book. Good to watch.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|We enjoy watching several programs in the series. We watch of the Roku we bought from amazon.com and use our Prime membership. It is a great combination.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|The movie was alright. The picture quality and sound were horrible in standard definition. I thought I need glasses and a hearing aid. Amazon would get more customers if they drop the price for HD movies.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun to watch the angry birds in this game.  Grand son loves it and is trying to clear all of the levels
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Even though the first book was great I have to say that the second book outshines it. This book was wonderful. Thank you Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl for creating such a well published book!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Grand kids love it.  They like to feed and groom the pets and see their messages.  Shopping for new pets is always fun!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game!! this is the best game I have ever played on my kindle. and the fact that it was only $1.98 is well simply amazing! I do have some suggestions. I think that monsters could natrully spawn at night and not just around their spawn block. they would still spawn around their blocks, but they would spawn natrullay at night too. I also think it would be great if you added a gorgon as a monster and Medusa as the boss. They are monstrers from Greek Mythology that have the lower body of a snake and the upper body of a beautiful women. they also have snakes for hair. for more info, read the myth of Perseus And Medusa. If you would incorporate these monsters,  I would tell all my friends about this game and play it even more than I usually do! great game guys! keep updating and making it better!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I found the characters not true to a world of high school teens.  It took the whole book to have some understanding of the main character, but throughout the book I was just not interested in his life.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We all enjoyed the movie.  Watching it at home was wonderful.  Being able to pause it and get up and move around really helps elderly people.  It was well packed and was delivered on time.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Cant put the book down!  Truly a CLASSIC!  I've seen the mini-series.  the book is always better than what TV can produce!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This was a good movie.  It was a little hard to follow if you weren't familiar with the men who were involved with Lincoln during this time period.  An introduction might have been helpful.
044024613X|4.0|Our book club selected this book and we all agreed that it is a very good read.  It keeps you on the edge until the very end.  I recommend this book to anyone that likes mysteries and suspense.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book. She did a great job telling her story and it was very inspiring. It made me want to hike more and it made me want to get out and do something different. I would recommend this book to anyone.
193700788X|2.0|Warning review contains spoilers<br /><br />Took me 13 hours and staying up way after bed time, with work the next day even, but I finished Dead Ever After. I must admit I was expecting much worse, I am still disappointed, but the story itself was much better than the last few installments of the series. I am going to give it two stars.<br /><br />If I was rating the story simply on who she ended up with and how Harris handled the ending of Sookie and Eric it would have been one star and a trip to the burn pile. But really most of the book had little to do with Sam, Sookie and Eric. Most of the story revolved around Sookie being framed for murder and a bunch of people trying to kill her. That part was actually pretty good, and reminded me of earlier books in the series. Sure some of the characters felt a little off at times, almost a mix of the book series and the tv series, but the plot moved along pretty swiftly and kept me reading into the wee hours of the morning. IF I was rating the book purely on that story line and disregarded the destruction of Eric and Sookie's relationship I would have rated the book three stars. I can not forget what Harris did to my beloved Eric so that one star brings down the three star to settle on two stars for the last book in a once loved series. I really do feel that Harris tried her best, but I still wish Sookie could have rode off into her H.E.A with Eric. If I was to rate the series on a whole I again am torn between one and two stars. So much of the series revolved around Eric and Sookie that for her to NOT end up with him just plain sucks after reading 13 books and falling so hard for Eric...the ending is almost cruel to Eric fans.<br /><br />Now to address Sookie ending up with Sam! What the Hell! I remember that Harris said a while ago that Sookie hadn't yet met who her H.E.A was... So what is this crap of putting him with Sam, someone who has been there from chapter one of book one. I think this was really a cop-out, and Ican not believe she paired them together. I'm sorry but I just don't see the chemistry between them and the one sex scene was kind of ew at the end. To me Sam and Sookie had more of a brother/sister or cousins relationship, NOT a romantic one. I really don't think that if we followed them further into the future that they will still be together. I just don't see the fire between these two. It was awkward and didn't feel right. I am so mad at what she did to Eric, he really got the short end of the stick in this story line. I believe he really loved Sookie and wanted to be with her, screw her not wanting to be a Vamp, I wish he would have gone ahead and just changed her. Eric was right Sookie never really gave their marriage a chance. My heart breaks a little of what Eric has lost and the life he is going to go on to live. He lost pretty much everything in the end. I can not forgive Harris for this and I will not be reading anymore of her books and I'm done with True Blood as well. I wish I could have stopped reading several books back and just have that memory of when things were good between Eric and Sookie, that is the Eric I wish to remember. Harris broke Eric and I think she did it on purpose to punish over zealous fans.<br /><br />Like I said much of the story had nothing to do with Eric, Sookie and Sam and was actually pretty good. I did enjoy how the community seemed to finally rally around Sookie and supported her instead of condemning her. The last couple of books had been a struggle to read and at time quite boring this book had the feeling of earlier installments in the series. I think that most of the major story treads were wrapped up and everyone, except Eric, is going to live happily ever after. I was happy to see that Harris did not destroy the relationship between Sookie and all the vamps. Pam was made sherif and will continue to be in Sookie's life along with Bill.<br /><br />In the end I am disappointed, not as much as I thought I would be, but still sad. I don't agree with the pairing of Sam and Sookie and am angry over the fate of Eric. It once was a great series, but I don't think I will be re-reading it again or picking up another Harris book, I've been burned and feel a little cheated for having stuck with the series to the bitter end. I'm just sorry that we had to part on such poor terms Ms. Harris, but I'm not going to trust you with my heart again. I loved your series and your characters and you broke my heart.
1416955070|5.0|I really loved this book, so much that I right after I finished it I went ahead and bought the second book, and I am now anxiously awaiting for the 3rd one,
193700788X|1.0|I really had high hopes for the ending! I mean obviously if I waited for a year to be blown away by what I had thought would be an amazing ending.... WRONG! I wish I could unread this and leave the series with my previous image of the characters from book 12.. I'm just so disappointed..
193700788X|1.0|First let me get it out of the way and say that I liked Sookie and Eric together. I have always thought Sam was an underdeveloped background character for the most part in the series and that he was more like Sookie's brother and friend than anything else.  The ending storyline between Sookie and Sam actually gave me the creeps!<br /><br />However, this wasn't the real reason that I rated the book so low.<br /><br />I felt that the final book was not well written and was really forced as something that had to be done.  I don't feel like the author was really into the characters anymore and tried to stuff too many into one book with no real purpose.  The plot line of the book was rather dry and lacked both the humor and supernatural flavor and fun of the earlier books.  It all just seemed very...... tired.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the treatment of Eric and Bill. Eric never truly got to say a goodbye to Sookie and was sent off without any real closure to the readers who had come to love him.  Eric's behavior was  just out of character for him in my opinion.  Bill was another background character for this story and did very little. He didn't even try to convince Sookie to give him another chance which was out of character for him.<br /><br />The introduction of a third child of Eric's really did very little for the storyline beyond showing Sookie that Eric had a \\"type.\\"  It would have been better to have had Bubba guarding Sookie.  At least the readers  would have been guaranteed a few laughs.  The pages taken up about Quinn and even Alcide in the storyline were useless.  Pam was barely mentioned as was Fangtasia.<br /><br />In the end, the book just didn't feel like a true ending and it felt to me like Sookie was \\"settling\\" instead of living up to her true potential.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My grandson is 5 and loves this app or anything to do with building. My problem is that I broke down and bought him the full version and then a month later it drops in price from $6.99 to $3.99.  What's up with that?
B009VMN3RA|3.0|Very much a real story about the complex relationship of 2 very different people sad at times and Sachs has more of a forgiving nature then I could in similar circumstances
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I am a fan of the Iron man series and of the superhero genre in general and I will say I was entertained by the 3rd installation of the Iron Man series, however, I don't think that this was nearly as good as the previous 2.  What it does have...Robert Downey solid in his role as usual, great special effects and some really funny humor.  The Iron man/kid scenes to me stole the show.  But the baddies are a little weak, doesn't follow the comic's version of the Mandarin at all.  The movie in fact weakens the Mandarin's abilities as compared to what he was portrayed in the comics.  I really wanted Ironman to be more Ironman in the suit and less of a bunch of empty suits flying around in the main climatic scene.<br /><br />Having said all that, I do like the movie and think it is a worthwhile watch and purchase but in comparison to the others, you will think this is the lesser of the 3.
B0000065MS|4.0|Theories about the airship disaster abound, but this one is fun to watch, and interesting throughout. Just read that a board found (about time) that the cause was now known to have been static discharge, which was one of the original theories anyway.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I absolutely love Rothfuss!  He creates an incredible story that I could not put down.  I finished the book in a week.
B000002KOJ|5.0|Great follow up to her first album song to a seagull.  Songwriting is phenomenal. Guitar arrangements are little orchestras.  She's totally overlooked.  Better musician than Dylan, Lightfoot, Paul Simon, Neil Young or any of her male peers at the time.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A long but good overview of Steve Jobs.  If you knew a lot about Jobs then whats in the book shouldn't be surprising.  He was a jerk.  A liar.  Disloyal to people who helped him.  Full of himself.  But he was also brilliant.  Its tough not to see this book as his last way of explaining to the world, &#34;this is why I was such a jerk.&#34;  Destined to become one of America's greatest businessmen and thought leaders; a true innovator.  I couldn't put this down reading about how it all unfolded.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I am writing this review mainly to warn about Amazon's band width description.<br /><br />It is actually 22mm, not 26mm.  BE CAREFUL when purchasing aftermarket bands.<br /><br />Otherwise, great watch!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Andy Weir has a detailed understanding of biology and it shows in this book. Totally believable. If you were stranded on Mars, this really is what you would have to do to survive.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|(reading this book). The untold sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform and their families are humbling. This book tells about just a fraction of those. I am speechless.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|totally awesome movie.<br />when it was in cinemas i first didn't want to see it - i was afraid it would be too kitschy. but it's anything but. REALLY great movie. highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, love the way the author has you follow the characters. I wanted to jump and scream at certain parts it pulled me in so deep... this is a book i will be recommending for a while.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Been a fan since early 80's, seen them 5 times in concert and will be seeing them again this fall.  I think Dave Gahans voice gets better with age!  Love them!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Reviewing the book's content is very hard, as I'm very enthusiast on the whole Ice&Fire series. It's complex, it's very detailed, its story is hard to keep-up-to, but just as real life... (on a medevial society sprinkled with magic & dragons!).<br /><br />The eBook is just fine. What I've paid for. No enhanced maps or aditional material. Just the text and some basic maps that are included in all I&F books.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Great love story.  Just a way to escape from the ordinary to the extraordinary.  would suggest this to friends. Great movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I play all the time, the only thing I didn't like was even though it was on my kindle account on fb, it made me start over...
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is a great game the black suit costs a lot 20000 to be exact but still a good game
1451695195|5.0|I actually listened to this book on youtube, where you can find it for free. It was wonderful to hear this man give his account of the NDE and I felt that he was genuine and truthful. It makes me feel more safe on earth and helped me to not beat myself up so much for the things that I had regretted doing which I felt were out of alignment with my life purpose. The part where he recalls that he was told that no wrong can be done on earth was very reassuring and it's helping me to get a bigger picture of the all loving creator who welcomes those who transition through the doorway of death into an nonjudgmental welcoming embrace.
B00CC569E2|5.0|Will.I.am steppin up his game. Not a fan of beiber but I enjoy their song as one of the top on this album.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My 2.5 year old really likes this movie and its enjoyable for me to watch too. He gets scared when the large combine tractor (the one that makes the bull noise) comes on.<br />Also, he now thinks tractors say &#34;moo&#34;...<br /><br />I would recommend this as a family friendly movie.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I was just browsing through prime and saw the Tudors, it looked interesting so I started watching but from season three. I watched all episodes and really liked it so I had to watch it from the beginning. I love it so much I started watching it a second time. I highly recommend this series.
B001HN6922|4.0|This Cars was a little more complicated than the first one and my 2.5 year old definitely prefers the first one. This one was more enjoyable for me to watch though.
B008MM9630|3.0|I like it so far but I don't want to have to buy just to play, like I say though it sure is cute and fun!!
0930289234|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. Not comic books. Not graphic novels. BOOKS. This piece of literature has merit in the literary field and set a precedent for greatness in the graphic novel genre. No other graphic novels come close to Watchmen. The subtle interplay of art and prose... the awesome foreshadowing... Will definitely be re-reading this after I make my way through the stack of graphic novels this book inspired me to buy.. maybe before then!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|If I don't want to share my progress on social media then I should be able to skip that goal. I don't like that it remains there until you complete it. I don't need my FB friends knowing each game I play and when I make improvements!!
B004XGN8W4|5.0|came in on time quick shipping my husband loves this item he works on the road all the time so on his down time he gets to play his xbox or use the screen to watch movies works great
B001OGRI90|5.0|One of the best thrash albums ever. A classic! If your a fan of the genre or a new fan to the band this is a must have! Killer drumming. Crushing, fast yet technical guitar work. And D.D. bringing that one of a kind monsterous bass. And Blitz's unique vocals bringin that 1-2 punch to drive it home! Easily one of Overkills finest efforts in a long line of great albums!
B00821OX98|4.0|I like this show quite a bit.  I'm a big fan of apocalyptic type shows.  Perhaps the further I go into the series, the more I will understand the direction early on, but at times in season one, it seems like the writers were not sure where they wanted to take the show.  There are some discoveries the second Mass makes that they seem to forget about in future episodes and never fully look into.<br /><br />Overall, I find the overall plot and idea of the show to be great.  It's highly entertaining.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|The whole series of course. It will become a classic if it is not already. I envy those who can read the whole thing without waiting a year for the next one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|She loves it and I love to very interesting . Can't wait to see what's next on the games. Recommended
B00881PTRC|5.0|This hangman game is so easy to get hooked on, the animation is as much fun as the game.  Even if I know the word I sometime go to the last letter just so I can watch him escape.
B0017XD3OY|3.0|The film appears to be a combined remake of &#34;The Stand&#34; (great book, horrible movie) and &#34;28 Days Later&#34;.  Animations looked like they came from &#34;The Mummy&#34;.  Interesting, but mainly a rip-off of prior plot lines and special effects.
B009G3T01M|2.0|There were multiple versions of the album when I made my purchase.  The more expensive ones had more filler tacked on to the end; I decided to not buy a version with all the filler.  After buying and listening, I found out it is the clean version. Not happy about that.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played in my life!!!!!! If you like army,battles,and fighting,get this app.if you think their kidding about this app,don't get it
076780421X|5.0|This was the very first movie I ever saw Salma Hayek in and I fell madly in love with her in this movie. Now THAT is a great actress!!! She is the epitome of the Latin beauty, full of fire and passion along with intellect and a heart that beats to love. I had only seen Matthew Perry in Friends prior to this and I must admit that he did a good job of carrying the humor and pathos in equal quality in his role in this film. He holds his own against the firey passion created by Salma who easily could have carried the film on her own but they were perfect foils for one another and their ability to create humor and pain together is a great tribute to their abilities as actors. Every now and then I revisit this movie when I want an evening of great movie watching.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The plot premise is gripping and the author's knowledge of the court system makes this novel an interesting one. Definitely worth reading!
0425264351|3.0|\\"Killing Fields\\" is certainly a page-turner. Once the book gets wound up, the action proceeds at break-neck speeds. Entertaining, it is, but a reader must swallow a huge amount of suspension of disbelief to make it all work.<br /><br />Principally, one must ask how an itinerant ex-military officer has the apparent license to kill anyone in his way, sometimes without even due provocation, with absolutely no legal ramifications.<br /><br />Its like Jack Reacher was granted 007's License to Kill, except that he hasn't. Anyone, especially not intimately connected to active law enforcement, would find themselves the subject of lengthy investigations and jail time given Reacher's final body count.<br /><br />Aside from the protagonist's ability to use deadly force to sweep all opposing entities away, the storyline is interesting and the pace doesn't lag.<br /><br />The book is recommended, but with the caveat of having a reader understand that they'll have to believe a lot of things that would never occur in real life.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Every once in awhile a film comes along that has to be seen more than once and Perfume is one of them!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Solid listen after you get past the filler on the front end.<br /><br />eight more words required for this review. there.

B000GFLE1S|5.0|Just love this movie.  Great story and great music.  The actors were wonderful and the fact it was based on a true story and had the actual shoe factory as a backdrop made it even more enjoyable.
B007N85POS|5.0|gotta love the birds. I have this on my Kindle fire so I am never without the birds. sorta addicted...
1476734941|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book as well as watching Michael Mosley's one hour PBS special about the various fasting options and benefits.  I bought an extra copy for my family physician and later discussed the book with him.  He gave his &#34;o.k.&#34; for me to go on the 5/2 diet.  I am starting the diet this week and looking forward to this new adventure that makes sense to me so far.
B00BPXKWGS|3.0|Yet another terrible sounding remastered disk! Very thin, tiny, crispy sounding remaster of an original disc. There are people who actually listen to music on high quality stereos with high quality speakers and like the music to have depth and dimension. These horrible made for MP3 player remasters are ruining the audio quality of great music rather than enhancing it.<br />The live disc in this set is worth the purchase and is the only reason I'm even giving a 3 star rating rather than 2 stars for the hideous sound quality of the remastered original disc.

145210655X|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this book.  I gave it to her as a birthday present and she asks almost every day to sit and read it.  We both like it more than &#34;Vader's Little Princess,&#34; which I also gave to her as a birthday present.  I'm so proud that my daughter likes Star Wars!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book several times as a young person and I got it more for the memories but it is an ageless story and well suited to any age reader.

B001FB4VXU|4.0|got hooked on this show it has to be one of the funniest programs on tv good cast they comp each other
B0064MPXFA|5.0|If you missed Season 1 of THE GOOD WIFE, you must see how it all began.  Characters are introduced, and as a current viewer, you see how they have evolved and how relationships have grown.  Kudos also to the writers for bringing cases that grab you, while letting you see what goes on behind the scene at a major law firm.  This is one of the most intelligent shows on TV.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I like Timothy Olyphant so I had to see the movie.  We liked it.  It's entertaining.  Reminds me of an X-Men type of movie with obvious good and evil characters, a lot of action, so the movie moves pretty quickly.  Not too much drama.  Typical SF movie in the teen category.

B00B0FQ8NC|5.0|Another in a list of high quality DVD's from the best heavy metal band of all time.  Others come and go, but Maiden has been true to their music, their fans and all of this has played into their longevity.  In their hey-day, they never broke the top 10 selling albums in the USA.  They have done so more than once since 2000.  That speaks to their ability to reign in new fans and keep their loyal fans happy.  Staying true to their music and fans for over 30 years.  Who else has done that?  No one!  Well, Megadeth has--&#62;thanks Dave.  Nevertheless, 30+ years.  That's impressive by any musical standard.  Up the Irons!
193700788X|2.0|I am a huge fan of this series and I enjoy Charlaine's writing style but this book is a letdown.  Eric continues to be portrayed as cold hearted and selfish and if your waiting for him to come in and sweep Sookie off her feet don't hold your breath.  You will on the other hand get your fill of Barry the bell boy and Mr. Catalide's, like anyone cares.  Please Charlaine I know you said you are done but can you write one more with an alternate ending for your fans that gives us the excitement and closure we long for, how about \\"Dead Done Right\\"!  Many people say this was the practical ending but I think it is safe to say that when your reading this series you are hardly looking for practical, you are afterall reading about vampires, shifters, and fairies.

B005BZQVJ8|3.0|We wanted to watch a comedy, saw the trailer for Paul thinking we might be entertained.  The concept is cute but we felt it was missing something.  Most of the funny parts are in the trailer.  This is one of those movies where you feel the same at the end of the movie as you did when it started, except for the relief that you didn't pay the theater price to see it.  If you're curious rent it before you buy it.  Who knows, you might like it!

B0094M4R3Q|4.0|My 4 year old daughter loved the movie, though was a little scared during some parts of the film.  Overall, worthwhile for family viewing.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Alright this movie is just one of the best spy movies out there and it's a spy movie with cars.<br />I see the main problem that most parents have with this movie is the large amounts of 'deaths' that happen in the movie. I will point you attention to the fact that these are 'CARS' not people. I saw it as it came and understood that it was just the death of a car not a person. We see cars get destroyed all the time in everyday life so it wasn't something that came as a shock to me or my little six year old cousin when we saw this movie together. Also it's not all guts and gore or even blood so I could see how the movie got a G rating.<br />The amazing part of this movie was the growth of Mater and the resonating friendship that he and McQueen have with one another. That's the part that makes you know that it's a Pixar movie is that kind of deep emotion that makes your heart go out to the characters.<br />The action was what had you at the edge of your seat in anticipation and the jokes just flowed right in and like some of the more recent Disney films you had NO idea who the villain was until the end.<br />To sum it up Cars 2 is an amazing movie to be enjoyed by kids everywhere but some parents need to see that these are cars and that your kids have see worse off cars on the side of the road during a drive then what happens here.<br />Francesco will make you laugh, Mater will be Mater, McQueen will learn that a true friend doesn't care about what others say, and McMissile is the new Bond.<br />The heart is there with a lot of action making this movie a really good all around family film.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Relaxing, a bit busy but fun.  Why is there a word limit on a review?  Like I don't have other things to do?
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|My expectations were too high for this movie. It was a little too slow for me. The acting was great.  Sally Fields did a very good portrayal of Mrs. Lincoln.  Daniel Day-Lewis made a surprisingly good Lincoln and it was very obvious he put his heart and soul into his character.  It was good information and for that it was worth watching but it moved slowly.

B002H5HJ9G|5.0|I watched this movie after getting into the Hannibal TV series, so I could get familiar with the Hannibal Lecter character.  Excellent movie!
0544139453|4.0|I started reading this book more out of curiosity but it evolved into an avalanche: I kept reading faster and faster until I was done...in one seating. It is haunting mixture of feelings of gratefulness and confusion of someone who \\"should\\" love America for all good she stands for, but his sense of loyalty (and rightfully so) to his homeland and certain inner outrage changes the course of his life.
1449410243|5.0|I found this book hilarious the first time through. As with many humorous books it isn't necessarily as funny the second and third time but some still make me laugh each time. Most of the bits were clever but there were a few sections that fell flat for me. A quick read.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|If you love fantasy, the medieval world, or are looking for a well-developed, action-packed series, then you will want to watch Game of Thrones, a series based on the George R.R. Martin books.  I have been looking for something to replace The Lord of The Rings movies and Game of Thrones comes very, very close!  Prepare to be transported to a world of chivalry, betrayal and warfare. I would have loved the series even more if the creators would have slightly backed off on the nudity and explicit sex scenes.  I am definitely hooked on both the series and the books, and cannot wait to watch Seasons 2 and 3 and 4 and.......?<br />Winter is coming and for once I can't wait!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|An excellent author - the ending was not what I expected at all.  At times it had a tendency to drag during the trial testimony, but that was explained at the end.

I hope this comes available soon on Amazon Appstore.
193700788X|1.0|The final book of the series is such a departure from the previous twelve. I loved the first ten books, loved them! I recommended this series to many friends. As a reader who has invested significant time and money, I feel hoodwinked, cheated, manipulated, and extremely disappointed. The deus ex machina, or cluviel dor, is an insult to readers. This indicates a lack of interest, as do many other choices made by the writer. This book is terrible. Clearly, this series should have ended sooner, maybe when the writer was still engaged in her work. Instead, television producers began influencing the writer, story, and characters. Not surprisingly, the television show has become terrible too! It's truly a shame that all of this was a sham. This writer or any product having to do with this series will never see another dime from our household.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Loved this book. It gave an insightful look at the mood and political climate in our country prior to the building of Pearl Harbor. Highly recommended for fans of FDR,  Lindbergh, and WWII. If you love politics, you'll love this book.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I thought this was like bejeweled. could have been larger and it was ok I an glad I did not pay for this

B00AJER3SE|4.0|What's not to love about the Terminator? Great 80's action flick that has held up pretty well. Most people would say T2 is a better overall movie, but this one really ramps up the tension during the chase scenes
B0094K1WZE|2.0|Attempts to intersperse bits of levity throughout the film mostly fall flat and make for a pretty lame movie.  Easily the worst (so far) in the Mission: Impossible franchise.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love pintrest and love pinning!...app has worked great for me on my kindle fire..sometimes slow however that has been my only problem.

B0068THAGY|3.0|If you like to be emotionally manipulated with special effects, then you will love this film. It's E.T. on steroids.
0765356147|5.0|It is hard to put down. I really enjoined the series. Lots of action and yet very clean.  I wonder where they get the ideas for the book.
B00011KHTM|5.0|This is just what's needed to connect a macbook to VGA. It works fine and I've had no problems with it so far.
B00007E7K0|4.0|I actually ordered the item that is pictured which is the same as my original lens cap.  Instead (and this is the first time for me with Amazon) they shipped me a Canon cap with center levers.  This is actually a better design than the original cap which had the catches on the circumference of the cap so I was not disappointed, just surprised.  It is a good versatile cap and has Canon printed on the cover, so it is manufactured by Canon.  I guess they don't make the cap that I received only a year ago with my camera.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|While this book wasn't quite as amazing as the first two in the trilogy, it was excellent.  There were a couple parts that were a bit slow, but it definitely satisfied as a completion (sort of) for the story started in Old Man's War.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My wife and I have started to compete with each other for achievements in the game. It has become entirely too addicting.

B00CL0J99K|3.0|Ironman 3 is the concluding chapter in the Ironman trilogy. While the movie has a lot of good features to boast about, it's ultimately an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Ironman 3 finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) an emotional wreck, reeling from the events that transpired in the Avengers movie. But Stark's past is about to catch up with him in the form of Alldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who has a idea for DNA regeneration that Stark had rebuffed years earlier. The threat to Stark is doubled when the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) appears inducing terrorist attacks across the U.S. To complicate it all is Stark/Ironman's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).<br /><br />Some of the problems begin with the introduction of Aldrich Killian, it seems his plan to take over the United States is remarkably similar to the one Jim Carrey's The Riddler has in Batman Forever. As a matter, of fact Pearce's first appearance and portrayal of Killian is similar to Carrey's portrayal of Edward Nygma, and later Pearce seems to be aping Val Kilmer! Then there's the dependence on the Avengers movie, as a stand-alone movie Ironman 3 is much too dependent on the Avengers movie and the assumption that an Ironman 3 audience would have seen the Avengers. I didn`t, and it left a considerable hole in the story. Then, there's the Ironman suit featured in most of the movie. It seems to have no other practical purpose except the function it will have in the conclusion, that is telegraphed almost from the first. Finally, there's the unfortunate inclusion of the Iron Patriot, Don Cheadle in the role of Colonel James Rhodes who is now the U.S. government's enforcer. But at critical moments in the action, Rhodes doesn't seem to know how to operate the armor.<br /><br />That isn't to say the acting isn't good. Everyone in movie turns in a strong performance. Robert Downey is reliably good as Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow has finally been given something to do in an Ironman movie besides scream and react to Downey's Stark. Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin takes the character from a truly menacing character to parody (it's purposeful) and is believable in the almost dual role. Even for the drawbacks I've mentioned before, Guy Pearce's performance is strong and he's believable in the part.<br /><br />If you're an Ironman fan you're going to see the movie. If you're on the fence, maybe wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray (and the extras it's sure to carry!), or temper your expectations. Perhaps Hollywood is all ready for an Ironman reboot.to Downey's Stark.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Outstanding and compelling. The last 20 minutes is the most exciting. All the actors<br />played there parts very well. This should be required viewing
B005LAIGP0|4.0|I loved this supernatural ghost thriller. The storyline was fantastic and the ending a super shocker that totally got me by surprise. Daniel Radcliffe does an excellent job!  Harry who?  You completely forget who he is famous for playing and become engrossed in his character and the storyline. I highly recommend this film!
0385349947|4.0|I liked this book much more than I thought I would, based on early scuttlebutt I had heard.  It occurred to me that some of the criticism leveled at Ms. Sandberg at least partially demonstrates her point - that it is often our own self-prescribed limitations that hold us back.  It is true that she has a lot of resources that others do not - but she didn't always have them.  And pointing to the difference in resources, and using that difference as even a subconscious excuse, supports a key element of her argument.<br /><br />There are myriad ways we women can hold ourselves back without even realizing it.  We are our often own harshest critics. We are frequently exceptional at enumerating the stumbling blocks and feeling defeated about their perceived immovability.  And we hold ourselves to far too lofty a standard - how effectively we should be able to \\"balance\\" or personal and professional lives; how \\"qualified\\" we need to be before we can envision raising our hand for the next challenging role.<br /><br />It is absolutely true that there are external factors still very much present which make women's professional journeys more difficult - but all the more reason not to add to the hindrances by our own thoughts, actions, or inaction.<br /><br />In my opinion, Ms. Sandberg made it abundantly clear that certain elements of her story/situation were unique - most particularly the financial resources she ultimately accumulated which could smooth out the challenges.  But she didn't always have them.  And I think if people don't focus too sharply on those aspects of her story, it is easier to see the potential lessons - albeit lessons that might need to be tweaked for our individual situations.<br /><br />I guess what truly struck me, however, was the fact that Ms. Sandberg could have reached a position of power by almost anyone's definition, and still feel plagued with doubts about her talents, abilities and right to be there.<br /><br />This book is true food for thought.  It may not be revolutionary, but it shines a light on the stories we women tell ourselves about ourselves and our potential.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love the series and cant wait to see the next season on blue-ray. Though it seems a little shorter then the prior seasons.
B008Q0D32S|2.0|We thought this film would be great with big name stars and good reviews. It started well with wonderful photography and an interesting sound track but after about 15 or 20 minutes the really slow pace with lots of close ups of evil looking cowboys was just  too much.  The whole effect, while very arty just was a bit too  s l o w  for us. We quit at that point. Maybe it would have gotten better had we waited. The art of what we saw was very good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun app that will keep you very busy. Lots of different things to do. Highly recommended.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I likes the movie.  It explained part of a verity of scenes that were in the stage play.<br />The actors were perect for there roles
B0051T46XM|4.0|I was channel surfing one day and stumbled on Troll Hunter. I couldn't believe what a gem of a movie I had found! I loved it so much I bought it for my mom and sister. Needless to say this wonderful film put the kabosh on my channel surfing that night!
B000FC1AGG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The story line was clever.  My only complaint would be that the story dragged just a little bit toward the end.
B009R659L8|2.0|Mary Higgins Clarke's books have become more immature in the last couple of years. The writing has become repetitive within the books themselves, the same words for descriptions are used over and over and are full of cliche. It's too bad, she used to be fun! Perhaps some third rate ghost writer is taking over a bit.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|So...this is how my reading experience went with this book.<br /><br />First part of the novel I felt like:  Ugh! Why is America so annoying in this novel? She is so indecisive I want to throw my Kindle across the room. At this point I just wish Maxon would eliminate her useless bum!<br /><br />Middle of book:  America you need to freaking get real or else....ELIMINATE!!!  (if I was a Dalek)<br /><br />Last part of the novel:  Hmmm...okay. America ends up redeeming herself. Sort of. I just hope she gets it together by the next book.<br /><br />That about sums it up.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book, it's refreshing to see something actually well written when today's authors seem to have forgotten how important that is. Thank you John Green!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|A great historical movie of the rescue and the killing of Ben Lauden. Allthough their were a few inaccurcies it was still a great movie
B0000047CX|5.0|Featuring the first Jazz/Bossa Nova single to ever be awarded the grammy for Record of the Year &#34;The Girl From Ipanema&#34; (album cut) leads off this classic impressive package that includes a documentation of how the record came to be, how the selections were made, how it was decided that Astrud would sing on the LP (making her an unintentional international star). And it also includes the original liner notes as well as original art work and photos...In addition you get 2 bonus tracks. The 45 edit/mix of &#34;The Girl From Ipanema&#34; and &#34;Corcovado&#34;. This is a Smooth Contemporary/Jazz/Bossa Nova masterpiece and a definite must for your collection done by a collection of historic &#34;masters of their craft&#34; in the early days of their careers.  It well deserved the Grammy's and accolades it has continued to receive over the years.
0718178130|5.0|The Rosie Project is, in the very first place, a hugely entertaining romantic comedy, and thus obeys the rom-com convention of \\"love conquers all\\". Accordingly it is optimistic, and could be seen as sentimentally unrealistic.<br />But the book is more than that. Gently, with great affection and encouragement, Simsion charts a significant episode of social and emotional development (we might say \\"human development\\") in the life of his hero, Don Tillman. Don Tillman is \\"different\\" -- we are tempted to believe he might have Asperger's Syndrome.<br />While at first blush the book might therefore seem to be about autism spectrum disorder I think on the contrary that it is about \\"human being spectrum disorder\\". Don Tillman is not the only person in the book who is \\"different\\"; most of the book's characters are \\"different\\" in one way or another, JUST AS PEOPLE ARE IN REAL LIFE. Sure, the book emphasises and exploits these \\"differences\\" for our entertainment (and edification), but that is no more than due literary licence.<br />Perhaps Don Tillman has Asperger's -- he certainly has some of the symptoms. But HE doesn't think so (another symptom, as we're told); and at no time in the book does anyone else say so. Simsion makes it clear early in the book where he (and Don) stand, in their attitude to the \\"aspies\\" on the one hand and their \\"normal\\" parents and teacher on the other. \\"Asperger's isn't a fault. It's a variant,\\" Don stresses, and Julie the teacher admits this gives her a new perspective. We also discover after a while that several of Don's Asperger's symptoms are in fact learned behaviours or defence mechanisms. So maybe Don doesn't have Asperger's -- we just don't know. And therein lies the book's deeper point -- it doesn't and shouldn't matter.<br />I think that Simsion, in this book, is making an argument against our tendency to pigeon-hole people who are a bit (or even a lot) \\"different\\", with labels and syndromes. He is making a plea for us not to limit what ahuman being might do, or how they might develop, by the labels or syndromes we attach to them because of their \\"difference\\". And it's not just OUR expectations of people that we so limit; all too often the victim of our labelling actively sets the same limitations on themselves (as Don has clearly done when we first meet him). \\"They're not going to have real relationships -- they'll never have partners\\" might be a factual statement of a \\"disorder's\\" inevitable outcome; or it might be a crippling, self-fulfilling prophecy that we burden people with by our diagnosis.<br />Simsion is showing us that circumstances, other people, determination, and yes, love, can lead to anyone's developing as a human being. Not just Don, but also Rosie, Gene, Phil and most of the minor characters grow as human beings during the course of the novel.<br />And that's why it's a good book.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We loved this movie and could not wait for it to come out on DVD so it was so nice to get it in the mail
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Visually appealing, musically sound and just plain fun!  A great story line and well adapted from the stage.  Few will find fault with ABBA's tunes.
B000CNFC76|5.0|With a great golf match as the background, &#34;The Greatest Game Ever Played&#34; blended the character developed by the time setting and the nature of a game that can show true personl character. It was nastalgic and uplifting in both energy and skilled performance.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works well on Kindle Fire with a good number of options and the adds are not that big of a deal for a free version.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I loved the story line plus the actors. It was a good movie that left out all of the violence and bad words
B009AY04A8|4.0|this was a really fun game.  graphics are good, objects not too small or to easy to find, the story was a little wordy but it does let you skip the dialog.

B001LMAK88|5.0|Like westerns and love the part Kevin K plays along with the other actors.  Fast moving at the end and cool acting
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Horribly sad, but amazingly written. Jaycee Dugard is an amazing person. Her story story is tragic..but her attitude towards life is refreshing. Gives hope in a dark world..
B007SGM084|3.0|Amusing reading as long as you take it for the fantasy smut that it is.  I see way too many people that think this is really how the BDSM lifestyle is and they are wrong wrong wrong.  If someone acted like the main character in the local community here he would be run off as the abusive type that he is.
B0090SI460|4.0|This is a charming movie that the kids will love. Adults will enjoy the humor too. John Goodman and Billy Crystal interact with each other hysterically and the rest of the cast is top-notch. The blue ray presentation is excellant with all the trimmings which include the 3-D version of the movie. A definite add to your collection.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My brother has a 3-D tv and he loved his Christmas gift. These DVD's in the store are priced outrageous, so I would say I really got a good buy and loved the movie!

B000YMM3CC|5.0|... and a great movie to revisit, always. Early Ryan Gosling and Rachael McAdams nail this amazing love history. Highly recommended.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Great show that keeps your interest at a peak high throughout most episodes. Adds just enough drama situations to be interesting but enough action to keep your attention. Very well made show with graphics and acting!

B0060AY6FO|1.0|When you buy a book like this, you should be entitled to reclaim your money back, just like when you buy a totally useless product. I'll never read anything from PD James Again, and I'm sure that the late Ms. Jane Austen would sue her for the use she made of the characters of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;.<br /><br />Fernando Del Corso<br />Amparo, Brazil

B004UID2LC|1.0|seems to download videos with weird volume settings so when you try to play them the sound is distorted like when you turn something up really loud and your speakers cant handle it. not worth downloading at all.

B0054SMIH6|4.0|Watched this with my 16 year old grandson. Aside for the obligatory sex scene (seems like every movie today must have one), thought the movie had a good story line and message.

1619692368|5.0|I \\"read\\" this in audiobook format and all I can say is I...LOVED it.  Seriously...I'm not kidding.<br /><br />I'll admit, I'm an Ellen fan, so I may be slightly biased, but this book was just what I needed.  I typically read non-fiction (business) books and occasionally fiction, but I was bored.  I needed something different, something light, something that didn't make me feel like I was reading.  After all, reading is work.<br /><br />The audiobook is narrated by Ellen, who is just a joy to listen to.  Over the course of three hours, Ellen talks about everything from gardening to gambling to how to become a billionaire.  She tells fun, lighthearted stories and she just makes you laugh.<br /><br />I don't know many men in my life who would enjoy this book, but I would highly recommend it for women, especially those who are already a fan of Ellen.
1476734941|5.0|Very interesting diet theory which I plan to try out myself starting next week. Need to be sure to get the right book by the right author since there are other books with similar titles, but not the same quality of background research, etc.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|First, I'd like to say that this is a great graphic novel, the best I've ever read. Granted, I stopped reading comics in 1995 so there may have been some very good graphic novels since then. But of the ones I've read, nothing tops, \\"Watchmen\\". It does have quite a bit of content though. There's some language, some violence and some sexual situations, but nothing feels gratuitous. The story is very real. At least as real as a story about superheroes could be.<br /><br />The reason for the title of this review deals with the reading experience I've had with my Paperwhite and my 8.9\\" Fire. The panels are laid out in such a way that the Paperwhite blows them up full screen and it's actually a better read on that device. The fire adds color, but the panels are much smaller. Just my opinion but it's been a joy to read on the Paperwhite. It does take a lot of memory though.<br /><br />Update: 5-18-13 The prose sections of the book are unreadable on the Paperwhite and barely legible on the Fire. I wish that the publishers had formatted the book so that you could enlarge the text on the back story sections. Bummer.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Super fun and challenging. Definitely makes you think. And it takes many hours to beat especially if you don't use hints.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|When even the most basic of events are relayed, there is an air of grandiosity.  It reduces the credibility of the entire story.  Three stars only because it does lead one to ponder some interesting concepts.
0762434279|1.0|Could not believe the size of this book, it was all of 2 x2 I think, thought I was getting a reg. book.
B00902S0IS|5.0|This film asks not whether we are smart enough to wield power, but whether we are good enough to wield power.  It assumes that all men, no matter how good and noble, are flawed.<br /><br />One of my top 15 movies.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book has been a great whirlwind. I would fall asleep with it in my hands. I wanted to skip work to finish it. Every moment I wondered what would happen next to poor Ender. I never even saw the end coming.<br /><br /> Each character is just as rounded as it needs to be. Every moment was well placed. Just read it already.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|Let's just say I have the entire thing on repeat.  Every song is moving in its own way - It's nice to finally hear someone produce an album that has actual lyrics that mean something.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was looking for a backpack so when we travel or hike it would make caring all the gear easier without it being in the way like a shoulder bag. This has met my needs. I have used it for going to my kids sporting, going to the beach, festivals, and hikes. Its nice having the extra pockets if you want to put a map besides having lots of room for your camera accessory's.
B00846REIS|4.0|SOOO many similarities with 50Shades of Grey, I feel like I'm reading a \\"wanna be\\"  however it is Very good
B004TI1WME|5.0|I've been using the free version for years, and have almost purchased the Pro version several time, and would have if I used it for more than balancing my ledger every month. So happy that I waited and get it for free! Thanks Amazon!
B009KEN87O|4.0|It is more than a &#34;space invaders clone&#34;. After a while you have a series of &#34;breakout&#34; style levels. Plenty of different enemies. Not something to spend hours with, but a great way to kill 10 minutes every now and then.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I may be jaded but although I enjoyed the movie I found it a little slow and sadly predictable.<br />I have a tendency to look for situations or activities that catch me off guard. I do recommend it for viewing but don't expect to walk away with it as a lasting conversation piece.
B00BSN0K1C|3.0|When I first saw the pictures of this figure, I was pretty amazed at how much Mattel had stepped up their game.  The facial sculpt and a lot of the detail reminded me a lot of how detailed the Diamond Select Avengers Movie Hawkeye is.  It actually looked like Henry Cavill!  I was more than a little disappointed at how different the actual product is.  If you are ordering this figure, disregard the close up pics, and pay attention to the one of the figure in the actual packaging, because that is the figure you are getting.  I'm really not sure what happened between the time that the figure in the close up pics was developed (which is also the figure displayed on the back of the packaging, btw) and when the figure was actually mass produced, because it is a big step backwards.  In the close ups, you can also see some really good detail in his hands, almost to the point of seeing the underlying veins.  The actual figure has plastic hands.  Not bad, but again, not as detailed as the close ups.  The last thing that is different, is in the close ups, his suit is not textured, but in the actual figure, you can totally see the almost chain mail like texture.  I realize that figures go through different iterations before they actually go to market, but shouldn't the final product look better than the prior versions?<br /><br />After all that, the figure isn't really that bad.  The facial sculpt looks good (if nothing like Henry Cavill) for A Superman, and the articulation is decent, although I would have liked an ab crunch of some sort.  It was just a disappointment purchasing a figure that looked like it was movie accurate (hence the \\"Movie Masters\\" designation) and getting something that...isn't.<br /><br />Three and a half stars.  Two stars off for looking NOTHING like the pics from Mattel and how disappointed I was at how different the actual produce is (I'm sure I'm not the only one who expected more with how high Mattel set the bar with their own pics of the figure), but half a star added back because it's not a horrible figure when all is said and done.  I'm pretty sure that if I had purchased the figure without the expectation of it looking like the movie character, I probably would have given it a solid 4 (but then again, I'm not sure if I would have purchased it in the first place).  It's pretty much the fact that Mattel set some high expectations and just did not deliver, and I really can't give it that extra star because of that.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosh takes us once again into the reality of daily life of a working detective. Los Angeles is a familiar locale to anyone who adventures with Harry Bosh. Once again we travel the city and explore the beauty and imperfections that provide the perfect backdrop for an urban crime novel.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Great book. Being a Pittsburgh native, I enjoyed parts of it more than the average reader. I read this before seeing the recent movie. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who has gone through the awkward teenage years.
B003719GGS|5.0|I was impressed at how simplistic the author made this reading. It was as if he has discovered the key to marriage. Yes, you have people that are very selfish and immature that probably were never ready for marriage. Nevertheless, if you are married and having issues I strongly suggest this book as an anecdote.
B000T46O52|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies!  The story is compelling because it is true.  Those of us who were around in the 80's and early 90's to see how devastating the disease of AIDS is and how phobic people are, will be especially touched by this story.  I think it is one of Tom Hank's best performances.  Denzel Washington is stellar, too!
B000GCFX36|5.0|An excellent book written with great insight into the feelings of recovering addicts in a humorous and utterly unstoppable read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. The last of Season 3, although the viewer did see the catastrophe toward the end, it nevertheless left me feeling irritated that I have to wait until Jan 2014 to see what the reactions to this catastrophe might be. Grrrrr

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I purchased this case as an accessory for the Kindle Fire I bought for my granddaughter last Christmas.  She loves the Kindle Fire and the case helps protect it.  (She's only 10 and not the most careful with her things.)  The case protects her Kindle as she totes it around with her, and when she uses it to &#34;snap chat&#34; with her friends, she props the case so she can be &#34;hands free&#34;.  The case is of good quality and provides the protection I wanted, but looks nice and satisfies my granddaughters requirement for &#34;pretty&#34;.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I am hooked from the beginning and am in love with Reacher!!!  Having been raised in a Marine family and on bases in the Southeast, I can relate to his childhood.

I need more,<br /> please!

Love being able to do what I love and it being free. Good graphics, characters are fun to play, gear is Simi easy to get. You can do things on your own such as trade skills or you can purchase things you like through actual cash. Which ever way you prefer to play this game you will be very entertained.

B00CL68QVQ|2.0|I love jennifer lawrence. I like Bradley cooper<br />But this movie received so much hype  we expected more<br />Lawrence's Oscar win was a mystery<br /><br />Everyone just did a lot of yelling including de Niro.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|My title line pretty much says it all.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book about complicated relationships, criminal investigation, and overcoming love.  It's a book I might read again as this father journals a parent's nightmare and the overshadowing influence of having a murderous and unapologetic father.  Murder gene?  I read it at night when I'm sleepy.  When I take my Kindle on vacation, I may read it again while alert as I probably missed something!!

B008AUGEFC|5.0|In Cloud Atlas, David Mitchell tells the six interrelated stories, each with a distinct voice and style, using a symmetric structure: 1-2-3-4-5-6-5-4-3-2-1.<br /><br />The Pacific Journal Adam Ewing, as the title implies, is a journal of the protagonist's adventure in the Pacific. Reading the story is like reading one of Joseph Conrad's stories, with the European colonists dominating over the natives. Dr. Goose, Rev. Horrox and the first mate Boerhaave, epitomes of greed and callousness and the sense of entitlement, could be villains from The Heart of Darkness or Lord Jim.<br /><br />Letters from Zedelghem is an epistolary about Robert Frobisher's coming of age, and he could be one of Stendhal or Flaubert's protagonists, charming his way through life until he meets his match.<br /><br />Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery is a mystery written in multiple third-person POV and it is a John Grisham style thriller about a reporter stumbling into documents that reveal a nuclear plant's safety issues. The company's executives would do anything to conceal the problems. The hunger for energy drives the greed and ruthlessness of these executives. The Pelican Brief comes to mind.<br /><br />The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish written in a first-person POV is a humorous account of the title character's adventure in a retirement home, a twist on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Only through such an ordeal could this callous and cynical publisher learn to appreciate life.<br /><br />The Orison of Somni-451 is a sci-fi about a fabricant server's rise to self-awareness. The interview between the Archivist and Somni-451 reveals the sickness of the consumer-oriented society and the encroachment of technocracy. Reminiscent of A Brave New World and Oryx and Crake.<br /><br />Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After is a first-person POV dystopian tale of survival in Hawaii. Humanity comes full circle from savagery to civilization back to savagery, as if, after Nea So Copros, society could only descend into barbarism. Again Oryx and Crake comes to mind.<br /><br />The six tales would just be interesting stories, if written by six writers, but David Mitchell manages to cross genres--from mystery to sci-fi and from historical fiction to literary fiction--and integrate the stories through common human predicaments into a teleological vision.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas, in addition to being great storytelling, is a postmodern study of text. In Sloosha's Crossin', an aged Zachry tells a yarn, where truth mixes with fiction, to a group of children. His son finds an orison which when warmed would create a hologram of Sonmi-451 telling her story, which is The Orison of Sonmi-451. And in Orison, Sonmi-451 watches a movie about a twenty-first century publisher called Timothy Cavendish. That movie is The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish. In Ghastly Ordeal, Timothy Cavendish receives from an author, the manuscript of Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery. In Half-Lives, Luisa Rey comes across Sixsmith's letters: Letters from Zedelghem. And finally, in Letters, Robert Frobisher finds Adam Ewing's journals in the famous composer's house. And so, we go from yarn to stored data, to cinema, to novel, to letters, to journal--a journey through various communication media. In the spirit of Italo Calvino and other postmodern writers, Mitchell creates several levels of texts, and thus various levels of fiction. Since the aged Zachry is an unreliable narrator, we would question his yarn's truth, as his son was doing so. The orison as stored data recounts an earlier historical period and might be true. Or is it, given the story of Orison is a setup to manipulate Sonmi-451? The movie The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish is fiction within fiction but since it is based on the life of the title character, the story may be true within Somni-451's world. Half-Lives, Letters, and Pacific Journal are various levels of fiction within the novel Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is a modern masterpiece where the aesthetic form matches the intriguing stories. And the reader will continue to reflect on the human condition long after she has finished the book.<br /><br />I saw the movie starring Tom Hanks and Halle Berry around the same time I read the novel and I prefer latter over the former. The movie, which changed various stories' endings, destroyed the beauty of the novel. I recommend reading the book rather then seeing the movie.Cloud Atlas is a modern masterpiece where the aesthetic form matches the intriguing stories.

193700788X|1.0|I am sad all around at the end of the series.  I was looking forward to a book that knocked it out of the park and had me on the edge of my seat.  What I got was a book I forced myself to finish.  Sookie just didn't seem like our Sookie.  She seemed mean and judgemental of other characters.  And flat.  I was willing to cut her some slack because the girl has been through a lot.  But she never really came back to the Sookie I have loved for years.  The sex scene I could have totally done without.  Seriously just yuck.  If this is the end give us a heart pounding scene where we are cheering for Sookie and saying YES!!!! This is perfect!!  go girl !!  Instead I want a do over where I can imagine it off page.<br /><br />What happened to her essential spark?  Why were things we were told to be cannon disregarded so blatantly? Was it to force a round peg in a square hole?  Continuity is big for me and there was none.  And honestly since it is the last book why spend time on characters that I could have cared less about like Arlene, Cope etc..<br /><br />I wanted to love this book.  I wanted Sookie to have gotten what she wanted on HER terms.  I feel like what I got was a lot of loose ends tied up because they were supposed to be without any feeling.  Talking to people at the book store Saturday this was a common complaint.  Such a missed opportunity to end the series with a bang.  It could have been talked about for years as one of the most fun series in a long time.  Sadly that won't happen now.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Everyone should see this movie to see how we are being manipulated by the big business of the food industry. It is so very sad to see how animals, that are raised for the sole purpose of food, are treated. Watch the movie to learn what you can do to make change.

076421120X|4.0|I love having  a devotional book by my bedside so that each night I can end the day with reading something from and about the Word of God.<br /><br />Revealing Jesus is just that sort of devotional. Each day starts off with a bible verse, and ends with prayer. In the middle is a few words from the heart of the author Darlene Zchech.<br /><br />Although I prefer devotionals that offer a digging deeper section that has you digging into the actual bible each day as well, I do love the uplifting and poetic voice of the author. I also find myself singing along when she adds words of hymns and praise music to her devotion of the day.

0062014536|5.0|Since Delirium, I have been in love with this series, and the world, and Lena an Alex. There's just something about their story that has captured my attention and broken my heart over and over again. Lena goes through so much and changes so completely over the course of the books, that I'm surprised Hana even recognizes her in Requiem. She's so radically different from the way she was in Delirium - she's daring, brave, strong in her beliefs, and very much in love - and it's been incredible to experience her transformation.<br /><br />I honestly thought Pandemonium was going to be as bad as it was going to get for Lena. I mean, she had to deal with losing Alex (and then finding him!), falling in love with Julian, and almost dying. Oh and realizing her mother is still alive, and then losing her again. I mean, it can't get any worse for her, right? Wrong. Requiem managed to leave me more heartbroken at times than I even thought possible. I don't know how Oliver does it, but she manages to pack such an emotional punch into even the simplest things.<br /><br />And then, we also got to see how Hana was managing back in Portland. Although I'm not Hana's biggest fan, I thought it was really interesting to see how someone who has been cured is handling the Resistance attacks and planning a wedding to the most important man in the city. And, of course, everyone has their secrets. Even the mayor. I think his might be the worst of all, because he has so much power and has so much potential to abuse that power.<br /><br />Like the rest of the series, the writing in this book is absolutely wonderful. It's one of those books that I hated to put down, and then I was so sad that it was over. Especially this time, because that's it. Now we have to say goodbye to Lena and Alex and Julian and Raven everyone else. And speaking of the ending, I thought it was perfect. I don't think a really conclusive ending would have done this series any justice, and it left off in a place that I was ok with. Especially because it feels so real, and not thrown together for the sake of a happily ever after.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has read any of the other books. And, if you haven't and you enjoyed series like Matched, Divergent, or any of those other amazing dystopian series, I would totally recommend this book to you. Seriously, you'll be blown away. A strong 5/5 on this one, and over the entire series.k with.

0062059963|5.0|When I finished The Selection last year, I was left with so many questions and wanting so much more! I mean, America made it to the Elite, but did she even really want to be there (but come on, who WOULDN'T want to be with Maxon?)? Would she and Aspen be found out? What is Marlee's secret? Well, The Elite did not disappoint at all. More questions are raised, some questions are answered, and others are left for the final book in the series.<br /><br />There is still quite a bit of \\"The Bachelor\\" feel to this book - six girls vying for the heart of one man, but with the added bonus of becoming a princess. And although I can't stand the TV show, I'm actually a huge fan of this book. There's still those elements that I could do with out, but Cass does such a good job classing it up that I really can't complain. I really like that there's a country at war outside the castle, but everyone in the palace is so sheltered from it that attacks are a huge deal. I think that adds quite a bit more excitement and mystery to the whole thing.<br /><br />Although I am still 100% Team Maxon (boo Team Aspen), there were some times when I think Maxon is being a total tool. That being said, I really think America needs to get a grip on herself. I mean, come on America. You're the one who still won't commit to the poor guy, you can't expect him to just give up on all of the other girls when he can't be sure you'll stay with him. Seriously, America. Figure it out. I feel like Maxon is totally justified in what he does - he does need to get to know all of the other girls, and all of them know he's \\"dating\\" all of them at the same time. I do like how both Maxon and America grow and mature in this book though, it feels very natural and their relationship feels very real (despite being part of a game show).<br /><br />My only grip with this book was that I didn't think there was enough of the rebels. I mean, I know they're not the main story, and I'm hoping we see more of them in Book 3, but I'm so interested in what they're trying to do. I also feel like knowing more about them will help with the world-building, which wasn't really as prominent in this book. The history was included well again, I just wish there had been more of it.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much, because I always think a book is better when there are no spoilers. But this book definitely made me feel all the feelings, and I cannot wait for The One! Is it 2014 yet? I would so recommend this to anyone who has read The Selection, and to anyone who wants to read something like \\"The Bachelor,\\" only better because there are princes and princesses-to-be, and war, and all those fun things. 5/5!'m so interested in what they're trying to do. I also feel like knowing more about them will help with the world-building, which wasn't really as prominent in this book.

B008D28HYS|5.0|Love it! Always a challenge! I have definitely played my money's with!!!  I love the different colors...all the more frustrating but fun!!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|After listening to this band on SNL I decided to purchase the album just to check it out.  I was not disappointed. The whole album has a bluesy soul vibe.  It is unlike anything I have heard in a while and I am extremely entranced by the  growling raspy notes that the lead singer is able to produce.  Overall I would highly recommend this album for anyone who is looking for something new to listen to.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This was a good one, but should have stopped after the previous movie.  Some series don't know when to stop!
B00BF11STU|4.0|I know there was a lot of controversy over this movie with the torture, but it isn't graphic and does a great job of outlining the story behind the raid rather than dramatizing it. I was very happy to see that it was more informative than theatrical.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This DVD is excellent.  The story, of course, is heart wrenching.  All the performances are amazing and surprising.  The extras are always nice as well.
1616615362|5.0|I love this miniature.  The ship detailing is great and it's actual size surprised me.  This guy is big.  It adds a lot of fun to your games and brings very unique abilities to the table.  Be sure to Pick one up.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I purchased this album after it was recommended by a friend.  I knew a few of Frank Ocean's songs, but this entire album is excellent.  The tracks all flow well together and the cd has a whole is well produced.  For anyone who is considering buying this album I would highly recommend that you do because it will not disappoint.
B008EQIK90|4.0|This was a funny movie, but one of those movies you watch once and you are good.  Nothing like the original series.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|The MobileLite has two key functions:<br />1. A wireless reader of SD cards or USB flash drives<br />2. A power bank to recharge a mobile device<br /><br />As a power bank it is limited - the product data sheet mentions 1800mAh battery, which when fully charged, would suffice to fully charge an iPhone or iPod Touch, but not iPads, SGS3, SGS4 and most other high-end smartphones. So I personally wouldn't buy it for its power bank capabilities, but it is nice addition to a wireless reader if you need one.<br /><br />As a wireless storage device, it is similar to Kingston's WiDrive product, but instead of the embedded memory in the WiDrive, the MobileLite comes with SD card slot, USB 2.0 interface and no memory. As such it leaves the consumer the freedom to use existing memory cards/usb drives, with the SD card slot especially useful for inserting the card from your digital camera and sharing photos via your mobile device without the need to carry with you a laptop...<br /><br />To get going you simply download the app, go to the wireless settings of your mobile device and connect to the WiFi network the MobileLite is creating when turned on, and that's it. You would be able to browse content loaded to an SD card or a USB flash drive inserted to the reader.<br />It takes the MobileLite about 30 seconds to get up and running - a pretty long time for a flash based device.<br /><br />The MobileLite is about the size of iPhone 5, but twice as thick. It has a clean design and is surprising light-weight. In the box you will find the reader, a USB cable, an SD-microSD card adapter and the quick start guide. It has 3 LEDs indicating battery status, wifi access (middle blue), and internet access (side blue). A different Internet LED could be helpful as from a short distance I may not be able to tell which of the two blue LEDs are on and what it means...<br /><br />SD Card:<br />The MobileLite supports SD, SDHC and SDXC cards. This means it supports ExFAT, so if you would like toload it with files larger than 4GB (think full length HD movies) or simply use high capacity cards (anything higher than 32GB) this feature would come handy. I was experimenting with it with a 64GB SanDisk Extreme Pro card and could access content on it with ease.<br /><br />The USB 2.0 receptacle works with USB 2.0 or 3.0 flash drives, so no problems here.<br /><br />Mobile Apps:<br />To fully enjoy this reader you'd like to use the native iOS or Android apps.<br />Unfortunately, it seems Kindle app is not available for this product.<br /><br />I accessed the MobileLite with iPhone 4, SGS2 and my laptop (at the same time). I viewed photos, streamed videos and listened to music so it can be used as a memory expansion device to memory-challenged devices where you could put a few full length movies and thousands of songs (depending on card or USB you plug in) for a long trip. The manufacturer claims up to 5 hours of operation, but I haven't got the chance to check how long it would stream continuously.<br />You can also offload photos from your iPhone (Camera Roll) or Android (Gallery) if you are running out of storage on your mobile device.<br /><br />The apps shows content on the drive in two ways side by side - as files and by media type (Photos, Videos and Music).<br />While mostly stable, I found the file/folders order on iPhone confusing and the both apps have some quirks I hope Kingston will fix quickly (photos and music I downloaded from the reader to my iPhone don't show in the Files view, only in the corresponding media tabs, content in media tabs is not searchable in the Android app etc.).<br />You can download files from the reader to your mobile device for later access (though if you will buy this product to offload content from your mobile device you are less likely to use this feature).<br />In the Settings menu you can check the status of the device battery, password protect your reader, rename the wireless network it creates.<br />You can and shouldprotect your MobileLite wireless network unless you'd like anyone in the wifi range of the device to be able to access your content. Password protection is available from the apps' settings menu and is as easy as it is on your home router. The Settings option to make the network invisible also helps preventing incidental access to an unprotected wireless network.<br /><br />The MobileLite features \\"internet pass through\\" - basically allowing you to maintain internet connectivity (receiving emails, browsing the internet) while connected to the drive. When doing so, you would see the reader's IP address under the device name in the application home screen.<br /><br />You can also access the reader via any web browser without a native app, but the functionality is much more limited.<br />The MobileLite allows playing iTunes purchased content (by devices authorized to access this content), but only music will play directly from inside the app. To play Movies or TV shows you MUST browse the reader from Safari (typing the drives [...]<br /><br />Documentation could be improved. The quick start guide is targeting iOS users and there is no User Manual for Android users at all. Also, the user manual and quick start guide provide conflicting descriptions regarding battery status (the manual says red means less than 50%, while the quick start guide says it is means less than 25%).<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. ExFAT support and its expandable storage interfaces (think of 128GB SD card + additional capacity on a USB if you really need more) makes it a good candidate as a movies-stash on the go.<br />2. If you already have such a device - being able to using it as a power bank is nice.<br />3. iTunes content is generally supported.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. At a price of $70 with no memory, if you consider it as a memory expansion device - you should consider buying other products (Kingston's own 32GB WiDrive for example is cheaper than this reader...).<br />2. To access iTunes videosand TV shows - you would need to browse the drive via Safari.<br />3. As a power bank - it's really limited.<br />4. No Kindle Fire app.<br />5. No user manual for Android.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game fast paced twitchy fun keeps you wanting more and chasing the achievements and power unlocks and character unlocks
B00124BNF4|4.0|If you know the talking heads, this is just what you think it is. Great music on the great Amazon Cloud Music Player!!
B004P1JEXE|4.0|Continuation of an awesome series but do there have to be SO many characters?!?!? I kept forgetting who's who and had to &#34;page&#34; back and find out.
B002WY65W4|5.0|If you like zombie movies and comedies this is the movie for you!! We laugh the entire time.  Of course if you are a zombie movie watcher you need to be able to handle blood and guts!!
B0034G4P80|3.0|Is it 1987 again already? With its big hair, bulging biceps, blunt dialogue, swooning maidens, stoic heroes, shiny sets and even shinier armour, had ‘Thor’ been released a quarter of a century ago it would have had its own animated spinoff, tie-in shampoo and a range of articulated toys manufactured by Kenner. Even the basic set-up – an age-old interglactic conflict between musclebound lugs transfers to Earth and chaos ensues – feels eerily similar to the movie version of ‘Masters of the Universe’. The only thing missing is a cheeky animal sidekick.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Holy cow, who does not love british drama which is probably a lot like american but fancier with accents! Cannot get enough!
B0014EVO4M|5.0|This is a great album from a great movie. Eddie Vedder put together a great chill album here. This is one of those rare things now a days that you can actually put on the WHOLE album and actually never find the need to skip a track.
B007QUUJMG|3.0|It was ok, but not awesome. Didn't grab me and keep me, but a good holiday read but that's all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't watch enough of DA.  Love the costumes, the estate, the formality and manners that were part of the era (Anna even calls her husband &#34;Mr. Bates&#34;), and the story line.  Things won't be the same after this episode, but I still can't wait for season 4 to kick off!
B005IZLPKQ|3.0|though he is not, I got this just out of a collerctor's wimp, however talking about the movie, it feels a bit stupid and quickly done, the lack of propaganda on it makes it more evident that this was just a last-minute movie so they could release &#34;The Avengers&#34;
