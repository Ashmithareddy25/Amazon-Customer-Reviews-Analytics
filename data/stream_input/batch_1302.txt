B0054JZC6E|4.0|Beats most mini games out there. Better on my kindle fire than on ipod. Most games on it are worth it, while some it could really do without.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Pretty much sums it up.  Not only has this app made it easy to reference Scripture at a moment's notice, but it made tracking my through the Bible reading a snap!  Pretty sure there's a reward in heaven for the people who made this, talk about spreading His Word!  Thanks, YouVersion!  Keep up the labor for the kingdom!
159102594X|4.0|I really, really liked this book. This is only the second book by Joe Abercrombie I've read, but I intend to read them all.<br /><br />His heroes are sometimes reluctant, his villains are sometimes sympathetic, his magician is...inscrutable.<br /><br />I'm not a big fantasy reader, but I like his characters. I even like the way he doesn't whitewash the horror of war and the thin line between the \\"good\\" side and the \\"bad\\" side.<br /><br />But what I really like best is the fact I can't stop reading. And when I must, I'm wondering what's going to happen to these characters next.<br /><br />Great book.
0062082353|5.0|I have read several \\"Seal\\" books and find that this is by far the best written book on a true patriot's sacrifice for our country.  I purchased the book because several talk show participants were somewhat critical of his attitude about the job he was sent to do.  They could not understand that he was proud of his kills.  Sure he enjoyed the success of his mission, killing those who wanted to kill him and his fellow soldiers, but his attitude was that he was sent by his country to do a job and he did it well.  This book is so well written that when I started it, I could not put it down until I finished it.  Highly recommend this book.
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|I bought this movie for Christmas for my mother and she loved it. She is very happy with it. She watched it more than once.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|This is a fantastic compilation that showcases Amy's true talents as a singer. I put this on my Christmas list and have been listening to it daily since I got it. With its tender bluesy notes, Lioness is a work of art. I hope there'll be more hidden works to follow this achievement.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game love playing it better than the regular game its a chAllenge for the mind and and gets you going
B0054JZC6E|3.0|kind of pointless, even though there are so many games, a lot of then are really boring and they are pointless and they are \\"instructions less\\" half the time i don't even know how to play the games

B0063GORYU|4.0|I got this game to play on the train tide to work,works well haven't had any problems plus it was free

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like how you have to unlock levels. and complete mini games and earn points and earn money it is very entertaining
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it helps keep the little ones entertain on long drives abed with so many games they don't get board as fast
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the idea, but I agree with many other reviewers - the controls on many of the games make them difficult to play, diminishing the overall fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|awesome! best bible app, has what seems like a million versions, and i love the life journal reading plan! as a youth pastor I recommend this app to all my students.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works perfectly. Took about 3 minutes to setup between my computer and phone and everything works as the video shows I love this app and will use it all the time!
0452289963|5.0|I bought this book when it was first launched and bought 2 this Christmas to give away as a send off gift to my sister & niece that came to visit us all the way from the Philippines.  It became my \\"go to\\" book whenever I need to get back to my core beliefs. I told my relatives this book made me kinder and loving. It allowed me to see what is important in life.   God Bless You ET!. May you write more books that will help us through every challenge. And bring out the best in all of us.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Great buy! Cute and different.  It fits and has a nice, lined interior.  The red is a great color--not the usual black.  A great  purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is awesome and its free whoever made this is genuis because there are multiple games in one sick
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Do not get this book. It is terrible. The first problem I have with this book is that the authors sentence structures are awful, making the story rather confusing. The end of the book is a joke and not worth getting to. I had no idea that the story was over  because the end is written like it should be the middle of the book where the story keeps going.  The book is slow and has needles information throughout the story. I am under the impression that the author just wanted to write and did not care about the story being good at all. I also noticed that this book reminds me of the twilight series in really bad form. Even if you are not a fan of twilight I can tell you that this book is ten times worse than the twilight series will ever be.  I never return books but I had to return this one. I cannot imagine anyone else suffering through this collection of words that has been mislabeled as a novel.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I bought this book and then received a second copy for Christmas.<br />This book leaves little wonder why Stephen King is such a successful writer as he manages to weave his way through many strange little worlds of his own fabrication and characters that run the gamut from ordinary to sinister to quirky..  In 11/22/63 he takes Maine teacher Jake Epping to a diner (the epitome of 1950's chic) and provides Jake with the perfect portal to enter the world of time travel. The mission here is to alter history and prevent the assassination of JFK by returning to 1958. The only limitation to this time travel thing is that every time Jake returns to the present the clock is advanced by two minutes.<br />King manages to do wonders with this simple premise. While introducing his readers to an era of Elvis and emerging space travel,<br />he provides his reader with a way back machine that is not without complications and reintroduces characters that appeared in his other novels as well as real people who contributed to the era Jake Epping is visiting on borrowed time. For long time King fans, this enhances an already meaty plot which has multiple layers of history and characterizations.<br />Did I like this book? In some ways I think this may be his best conceived and researched book to date. His writing and his level of detail star here along with his talent for plot and character development.<br />I'd like to give more away, but in doing so I'd diminish a reader's desire for surprise.<br />I loved this book so much that my friends are now enjoying both of my copies. This is a wonderful book and adds credence to King's reputation as a great contemporary writer of fiction.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this note app.  It is straight forward to use.  I also love how it is tied into Pulse making it easy to save off links I want to be able to go back to later.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is very well put-together.  Similar to \\"King Corn\\" (2007), however it is exceeding in superior content, logical flow and screen-play.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.

B0063IH60K|5.0|best game ever for my kindle fire, great way to kill time and exercise the mind! can spend a hour playing at any time!
B005DWBZZE|5.0|How Decca can deny this disc being available in the U.S. is beyond me.  Trifonov is such a natural pianist that Chopin takes on a singing, improvised quality that's almost a throwback to the past without losing sight of the composer's intentions.  The selections are taken from two recitals; one on the house Fazioli at La Fenice in Venice and the other at Fazioli Piano's own concert hall.  This is piano playing at the highest level.  I'm certain Trifonov will soon take his rightful place among the World's greatest of living pianist!    I can't recommend this disc enough!
B001URY5IU|1.0|I bought this Lego set for my seven year old son who loves both Lego and Star Wars. My son was very disappointed because the set once built is so fragile you can't even move it without it falling apart. So far we have rebuilt it three times, we've had it 10 days. Overall this set has been one frustration after another. Not a good toy at all!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|At first I had the free version and I appreciated it so much, I was happy to go back and pay for the app.  The developer deserves the recognition for providing a rock solid alarm clock and timer.  I use my phone's alarm to wake up every morning, keep on time for things throughout the day, and my kitchen timer.  It hasn't failed to go off when it should unlock my device's stock alarm.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game!!!!! I love it you need it and it free go head get it you will love it get it get it get it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is really good for someone who likes to play fun games and who have attention of a gold fish
0307949486|4.0|This mystery/thriller is set in Sweden and is set around 2 characters: Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter in the financial sector, and Lisbeth Salandar, a ward of the state who is an investigator with more unconventional talents, particularly with computer. Mikael has been set up in his quest to bring to light the unsavory practices of entrepreneur Wennerstrom and is convicted of libel, sentenced to a heavy fine and prison time. He takes leave of his magazine to protect it and is approached by the lawyer of retired industrialist Henrik Vanger to speak with him about a special project. He is asked to try to solve an old mystery- the disappearance of Henrik's great-niece, Harriet, who due to the circumstances, was likely murdered on the island by a family member.Henrik is being tormented by the \\"gift\\" of pressed flowers every year, a gift that his niece always made for him.  He will work the mystery under the cover of writing the memoirs of Henrik. Lisbeth was hired to investigate Mikael for Vanger's lawyer and we find that her circumstances are challenged by the change in guardianship due to her former guardian's stroke. Her new guardian is a monster, but while Lisbeth is a damaged person from a difficult life, she finds a way to exact her revenge. As Mikael delves into the Vanger story, he finds need of research help, bringing Lisbeth into the case.  They work together to find the answers and Lisbeth also delves into the Wennerstrom issue.  This was an intricately plotted story with two intriguing main characters and several misdirections and surprises along the way. The original title is fitting \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" and makes the facts presented at the start of each section on violence against women in Sweden fit better.
B000002JOF|4.0|I suppose that this is a bit of a coming out, if you will, comment on the fine work Chris Rea has done both over the years and on this compact disc, The Road To Hell. I am regretfully somewhat late to the Chris Rea bandwagon, however, I am delighted with this disc and find it a solid offering, top to bottom. Four stars is about as high as I can go... I'm still looking for and or listening, for THAT perfect Album/CD. But in the mean time, this won't let you down. Solid from top to bottom, Chris Rea is at the top of his form here. For those of you that are new to Chris, Think in terms of Mark Knopfler's growlsh vocals, and apply it to another, slightly different genre. If you  can do that, and like Mark's work, you should fit in well with those who appreciate the fine work of Chris Rea. He is truly a treasure, and I find under appreciated here in America. Perhaps he needs and or has to grow on you? Not to the point of being an acquired taste, but surely it seems that the more advanced listener, will be able to grasp onto this man's fine volume of work, and enjoy it immensely. Most likely you already are!<br /><br />Chris Rea's follow up album, Auberge, is a favorite of mine and I would recommend it for additional listening pleasure. You can't go wrong with either. This music is not for 'children' it is for adults. It fits in nicely under my broad umbrella of Rock & Roll Genres that I listen to and or have in rotation on my player. My only regret... as stated above, is that I did not find Chris Rea and his wonderful smooth voice, a lot sooner.<br /><br />I see the track listings are missing here, so I'll include them for your reference. Enjoy!<br /><br />01. The Road to Hell (Part 1)<br />03. The Road to Hell (Part 2)<br />04. You Must Be Evil<br />05. Texas<br />06. Looking for a Rainbow<br />07. Your Warm and Tender Love<br />08.

B000MAH5O2|4.0|It seems strange in 2012 to write a review about a book written in 2006. However, the perspective and passage of time perhaps is the reason why I write this review now.<br /><br />Having read this book, I would actually find it quite hard for anyone to be surprised at how the President is choosing to govern. By and large, in his book he has spelled out his vision for American and has spent the majority of his term executing that vision. Whether you agree or disagree with his performance or with him as a person, I think it would be hard to argue that any of his policies as President are a surprise.<br /><br />I read through a selection of the most unfavourable comments here before writing this, and with the exception of a handful, most don't seem to offer a review of the book in the context of or the time when he wrote it or why they disagree with the concepts and policies in his book. They mostly juxtapose their present day disagreements in policy implementation in their reviews. Unfortunately as usual, almost no mention that politics is a plurality in our society where one could argue that neither democrats or republicans have acted honourably. It's more scorched earth US vs Them, all who don't agree with me just don't get it name-calling ... :(<br /><br />As a liberal, I found myself agreeing with much of what he said -- both about the republicans and the democrats. And yet I will also say that I did find myself wanting at the end of the book for some more personal insight into the decisions behind some of those 20 or so bills he classified as a big deal. I didn't get the sense that he was saying he hated the GOP. In fact he goes out of his way to single out examples of people and policy points on which there is agreement. I do get the sense of the issues that were very close to him, he had a clear position on didn't hesitate to point out what he thought were the root causes and where he thought that the flaws in general conservative theory were. That being said, you can detect some instances where perhaps the explanation of conservative theory and policy is too simple and paints too broad a brush.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a book worth reading, not because of one's political affiliation, but because you get to understand perspective at the time the book was written. And I will approach Decision Points by George Bush with equal openness, a respect for the person who wrote it, and an understanding of the prism through which they think and express themselves.where perhaps the explanation of conservative theory and policy is too simple and paints too broad a brush.

B000001GQR|3.0|I have been collecting Schubert's last symphony for years. I do not claim to have heard all of them. To compare widely available recordings, take this one and Szell on Sony. Comparable price. Well respected conductor and orchestra. Both recordings are from the 50s. Szell/Cleveland from 1957, Furtwangler/Berliner from 1952. Both great performances. BUT in spite of DG's claim of original-image bit processing, the Sony transfer sounds far superior. My stereo is very revealing. The opening horns of the Berliners here sound muffled and indistinct. Same with the strings. Whereas Cleveland can rival modern digital technology, such is not the case on this DG release. There is tape hiss on all analogue recordings and some do a better job of suppressing without sacrificing upper frequencies. Some may argue that these are 2 VERY different approaches to Schubert, and I cannot disagree. Furtwangler's more leisurely approach may be your cup of tea. Across the board, his timings are much longer than Szell's, nealy 4 minutes longer in the Andante con moto and a full 4 minutes in the scherzo! I am not a fan of hurry-up tempi, as in Solti. But Szell never feels rushed. As far as the discs are concerned, the DG includes Haydn 88, whereas the Sony includes Schbert 8. Take your pick. I am singling out Schubert 9 and the quality of the recording. DG makes a big issue of this. To quote the back cover \\"Added presence and brilliance, greater spatial definition\\". If you listen to these 2 versions back to back, it sounds like DG is describing the Szell/Sony disc. As an aside, if you are looking for a good recording of Schubert 9, stay away from Marriner/ASMF 'digital' recording. It is devoid of life. I am a great admirer of Marriner and his Mozart symphonies, but they do Schubert's Great a great injustice. After all, this was Schubert's last major utterance on this earth, it deserves all the emotion and intensity you can bring. Bring it on.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this game, it started with, the games, there cool.  But hate the adds,but still a good game. Download this if you a extreme gamer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|easy way to burn some time and have some fun.  depends on your device, how well you can do in the games

B004W4N55C|3.0|I like it but it force closes when I try to transpose a song. This should not be the case and should be fixed ASAP for an $8 app. Iconia A500.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome beyond words and its. a beast gamethats about it so i just have to stop talking now and bye
B0054JZC6E|1.0|First off you have to earn your way to play the majority of the games and only get about a dozen to start.  Add to that the fact that the controls are very sluggish and they start to really lose their appeal.   But wait your still interested???  Oh yeah don't forget there are a constant stream of banner ads through every game, full page ads between rounds, and worst of all when you quit out your notification bar is full of ads.    This has been deleted, the Feb and false 5 star reviewers should be ashamed.
0143143492|5.0|This book has gave me so much insight to my own life I had to give my 2 cents. It's a master piece! Many rigid and pious religious people may be turned off by the message of seeking salvation from suffering by dissolving the ego and not through Gods and Half Gods they think is the only way. It gives new insight to the teaching of Jesus and Buddha and I just bought 3 to give to my family. If you want to see how we are all oneness and seek an authentic relationship to others and to our universe then shed this old paradigm and read this book!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I now have the complete collection of \\"Harry Potter\\" movies and I watch them frequently, Some are not dvd's but I still enjoy them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a great combination of games. It is one of my favorites because I never get bored because there is way mire than 1 game.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is awesome! Setup is super simple. I was up and running on my MacBook in less than one minute. App is simple to learn and works quite well. Can't wait to see what else this app can do. HTC EVO 4g

B005ZHBA9I|4.0|I wasn't really looking to purchase the music score but I'm glad I did.  It's good listening to read to or while doing paper work.  I really do like Carter Burwell's work and have since the first Twilight movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|when I first got this game I didn't know if I would like it but I decided to play it with my dad I'm only 10 anyway. I like this game its cool and I hope other people like it to.
1451627289|5.0|As are many Americans, I've always taken an interest in the events surrounding the Kennedy assassination. Not a fascination, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but it is compelling. When I saw the 'what if' prospect surrounding one of the darkest days in American history, and then saw it was Steven King, I was on board for the ride. And I absolutely loved it. The characters are endearing, the eras vivid in my mind's eye, and the plot well crafted and engrossing. My only wish would be that King would have written this with more focus on what happened after the foiled attempt - I went into it with that mindset. That said, it was still a fantastic tale, and a great page turner. You won't be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My opinion towards this game is that it is very interesting. When you complete the games given, there are more just waiting to be played. I like this game very much.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is stuffed full of awesome games. I like that you don't have to pay to unlock more games, like some apps. It's awesome!!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Love it. Tots loves. U NEED to GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is NOT A WASTE OF SPACE!!!!! Plz get this app.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|Great cast.  Helen Mirran is brilliant. The movie is very suspenseful and action packed. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a lot of fun challenging my kids to see who can get the highest score. getting enough points to unlock the next level is a good chance to beat each others score.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I think this video and cd is just great!!  The music is super!! The cd follows the same great music as the video.  A great buy at Amazon!
1593157134|5.0|This book was awesome, I never really noticed how I was just sleep-walking thru my life. This book helped me gain perspective on how my current situations in life are results from the compound effect, both the good and the bad. But most important it shows you how to use the compound effect to your advantage. Darren Hardy is one of the leading experts in what it takes to be sucessful in my opinion, i would highly recomend geting his \\"Living Your Best Year Ever\\" Set along with \\"The Compound Effect\\". Thank You Mr. Darren Hardy!

B0063GORYU|3.0|love playing spider, but it would be nice to know whether the puzzle can. be solved or not. can this be updated.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I like this app but it doesn't connenct and execute programs and games seamlessly, it is very off, I will click something on my tablets screen, and it shows immediately on my Pc but takes 20 seconds to show on my tablet, I am a racing game fan, so the arrow keys are very inconvenient for me because they are small and at the top of the screen, and it wont let me use 2 arrow keys at the same time. I will give 5 stars when these problems are fixed
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I am probably giving this book one more star then I really should. The timeline jumping thing is this book annoyed me so much, I followed it but with people ageing every chapter several years I never felt connected with anyone.<br />The plot of the book was, well I did not really feel there was ever one. The characters didn't really seem to care much about the game they were playing and the two people who really did care where not really in the book at all.<br />The ending was well there was not really an ending to the book, it really did not let you know anything or really close for me.<br />Some parts of the book felt magical I suppose and the writing was not bad but not great a book is supposed to make you feel emotions and I didn't get that with this book at all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and interesting. I never get bored when I'm playing the game. if u are smart then u would get this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has many different games on it so there is a game for everyone! to me a lot of the games are fun and my family like playing them to
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Awesome app. Integration with Google is very useful. Should optimize for tablets and other resolution devices. Looking forward for more enhancements. Thumbs up.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game except some are to hard and there are stupid ads every game other than that I think its GREAT!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a great thing to do when you are bored.However, you have to get so many points to unlock a level and the ads are very annoying.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok.  you start off with only a limited amount of games and you have to earn.points to get the rest. but overall.pretty fun and ok
B005HSL626|5.0|I got the free version on my kindle fire and it works great. No ads, no crash, not even slowing down my kindle. Me and my friends love it!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|unlocking gets a little tedious  but the games are fun.. and a lot of the updates aren't available for kindle fire
B0055SWM08|4.0|I'm enjoying it . It moves fast but somehow you seem to play better than you think you would.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|I never buy albums because I am guaranteed to hate at least half of the songs. I bought this album because it was cheaper than buying several songs singly.  I am glad I did. All the tracks are soulful and beautiful, though different. I can't stop listening.  I love James Morrison!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am really enjoying this app. The things I like best are the daily plans and selection of topics for devotional time.
B00003Q43A|5.0|Love this movie the first time I saw it, and every time after.  But then... one day I caught the extended version on a rare cable play.  The extra scenes are a MUST to the story.  Anyone that is a fan of the theatrical version needs to see the extended version.  Everyone else... just needs to see this movie.  5 Star fun, interesting story lines, great acting, and excellent special effects.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|works good but wished it had more levels....finished it in a day....not quite challenging enough but I was happy to see one of these kind of games for the fire..
B0054JZC6E|2.0|tho game is way too challenging for younger kids.its good for older children  not yunger children.it is way to hard.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I received my epic yesterday and I love it. I first got into Perplexus when I played on my younger cousin's original. I got pretty far and was easily addicted. When he told me about epic, I thought about it, and decided to purchase it. Even though I hadn't completed original, I am good at maneuvering Perplexus's overall, and decided to leap for the epic. Being several years over the minimum age and familiar with puzzles, it only took me a couple days to get to 125 using the practice points. However, this is definitely not an easy challenge. There are several tricky parts, even at the beginning. I found myself having to practice several times to get it right. It gets very addicting, as you are trying to get everything right and make it to the end. However, it's definitely worth it There are a lot of cool obstacles, such as the launch ramp, gondola, and teeter-totter. There is more creativity here than in the original Perplexus, and I personally love the blue, gray, and white color theme. If you are someone who loves puzzles and ball machines, this is definitely the product for you!  In terms of durability, I thankfully haven't had anything break just through ordinary play, and have definitely played this thing for several hours now. I am praying that nothing breaks within the next few days, but I'm sure it should be fine as long as I don't drop it. Unfortunately, it does feel lower quality than the original. The plastics look and sound cheaper, and certain parts, especially the teeter-totter on mine, are a bit misaligned. But, once again, the puzzle didn't seem to have any parts missing or broken when it arrived, so at least the build quality isn't terrible.  Overall, I think this is a solid, fun product!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is great its very fun and has a great collection of games. I love all of the games even the hard ones.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Runs great on my rooted Samsung fascinate . It runs smoothly because its using my laptops CPU.  The only work my phone has to do KS connecte and display the imqge

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I got this pair of headphones 2 days ago, they came in a very nice packing from sony, I have to say this first, im a BOSE fan and have in ear and on ear hedphones,, also i have to say that i use headphones to be used with my iphone and laptop only, i tried them with my iphone and was expexting a little more out of them according the reviews i red before, at least a little more of bass, i do not know, may be i have a lemon here, my iphone has to be at max volume in order to hear the bass some decent, like i said they may do better when plugged in from a better sourse.<br /><br />now the good things for buyers to know, i just plugged in from my laptop and i have to say they sound much better,<br />things i like:<br /><br />Long  and soft cord, since im a cord destroyer this is just what i needed<br />treble, man, they sound crystal clear, and can hear any detail on music  sorry bose, you cant beat this babies<br />confortable, last might i slept for about 5 hours woked up took em off, and no pain at all<br />nice design, very flat and they seem to last for ever, however i put insurance from squaretrade for 3 years 7 dlls w discount<br />they stay on your head, even  when laying down, so runners this is what you need,<br />they work nice with my keyboard, i thought i was in the concert then realized it was me playing lol,<br />they come with one year warranty, for those who said 3 months.<br /><br />I had to come back  and give one more star to this headphones, since they work twise better by adding an amplifier to them specially if you are using them with iphone or even computer,, wow its all i can say,,oh, i got fiio E6 for 26 dlls here ar amazon, and what i great devise as well<br /><br />Bose's (on ear) gime me more bass but they dont sound as clear as this ones,  so 4 stars because of the bass, perhaps i come back later and do the 5 stars when i try them from stronger source. i stared falling in love with them,, metallica is on(nothing else matters) wow.<br /><br/>sure i will keep bose in the closet for a litle awhile and test this ones longer, i will be back i can feel it<br /><br />sorry about my english folks
B0054JZC6E|3.0|large variety of games,  a good way to pass time and I like the idea of earning points. makes it more challenging and fun
B0019HQIFE|5.0|This is a wonderful BR anyone giving it less than 5 doesn't know paint from piss!<br />If you are a SRV fan you'll know what I am saying end of story!!<br />Buy it now!
B000059XUP|5.0|It's not a sequel, but a separate story, so it doesn't taint the original in any way.  But actually, I thought it was a pretty good movie.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Never seen the Tremors movies before,but I really had a feeling I would like them and enough to own them even. I took a chance and bought the attack pack. Boy was I right. These movies are adventurously funny! A mixture that is not caught on film very often. The only negative I have about the set itself is that it is four movies on two disc, so there is one move on each side. Never been a fan of double sided disc. I was expecting this due to the description saying 2 disc with 4 movies in the set so I did know what I was getting. Just trying to give others a extra heads up. Would recommend this pack for any one interested in 4 funny adventurous movies.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app lets my phone sync right up to my computer at home! It's like having my computer with me in the palm of my hand! Works great on my HTC MyTouch.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book, and P. D. James stays true to the original characters, setting, and relationships.  I've read lots of \\"sequels\\" and this is by far the best.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|not working on ics galaxy nexus waiting for game update . please fix the game I can't play it anymore
B00632HWOG|1.0|added app and coincidentally deleted ALL email from in box then proceeded to alert me like crazy!  Waste of time!
B004O3YGMC|1.0|if you say all you have to do is this and that don't make me search for reasons why it won't connect. if I have to disconnect 9 different things for it to work and you don't tell me that your wasting my time.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Placed order and received a confirmation the next day(Mon). I was expecting to not get it till the following week but I was watching my DVD the following Friday. Great fast service.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider Solitaire is the most addictive game I have ever played!  love it! I gave spent many hours playing it and Just don't seem to get tired of playing
1419702238|5.0|Had to buy book to complete the set!  Daughter loved the book and can't wait until next book comes out.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Only issue I got is that don't seem to play audio on the computer so can't really be used as a remote control but work great on all it do ...
B004O3YGMC|5.0|By far one of the best apps, can use Wifi or mobile 3 &amp; 4G speeds. Use it for tv,movies and to check on what kids are donig.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the large variety of games and the challenge to unlock them all had me playing non stop till my kindle fire died 3 hours later
B002MT3CIY|1.0|I know that fans rabid for this release will immediately balk at the one star rating for this...but please read on. This is a great show but the DVD presentation (finally realized in this first legitimate release) is incorrect as far as the aspect ratio is concerned.   This concert was originally shot in a FULL SCREEN (4:3) ratio. The previous laser disc and VHS had it right. Most of the DVD presentations up to now have been boots mastered from either of these. Although the audio for this show is good (not spectacular), this visual presentation is totally incorrect. IMMORTAL wide-screened the show and in the process stretched the image improperly to fill all the vertical information. The video screen (Floyd utilizes) for the show must be ROUND, not elliptical. All faces and bodies are stretched horizontally...  This must be corrected. I am a big fan of this group, this release and the idea that Floyd fans deserve better. I purchased the 2 CD set (from IMMORTAL, which is good) and hoped this DVD would finally be the last word on the subject...sadly it is not. Hopefully (someday) we'll get the real deal.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Try it for yourself...I think you will enjoy it too.  I would say it is well worth the cost but since it is free to try that would be a tad silly :)
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a really great app! I would recommend this for keeping up with your local weather. I also enjoy the feature of adding other favorite places.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I LOVE this game!!  I first played it last night during my 11-yr old's birthday sleepover. Midnight, on the sofa, waiting for the Nerf War to come to a ceasefire ..... and I found peace in the midst of total chaos. The music is awesome!  I am hooked : )  Thank you Fallen Tree!
0439023513|3.0|Was really looking forward to reading this book, and ending the trilogy. However, I found it to drag. I had to literally struggle through some pages, whereas I found myself totally absorbed by the previous books. Nevertheless, an exciting series, though, once again, I felt this was not for children to read.
B004UB9SKS|5.0|I travel a lot and communication barrier is always a problem being a guest or tourist in a different country. This software allows me to communicate or interact without being connected to the internet
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easy to use and install. After seeing how it worked so well on my main computer I installed it on all of them!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Would have been worth $4.99 but I was lucky enough to catch it as Amazon's free app of the day.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Crazy Stupid Love was hilarious and a movie I would consider very family friendly.  Loved it!  I would highly recommend this movie for all.
B004FOA84A|3.0|really great concept - like others said, a simplified version of myst.  cheesy ending, though, and wayyyy too short (like 25 mins)  for a paid app. ps: whoever wrote the byline for this game should be hired by a big publishing co..sure sucked me in with all those fancy adjectives and imagery.
1419701533|4.0|My seven year old daughter loves these books. Definatly worth getting the hard cover. She finished the first book in one week.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|No instructions for each specific mini game so you have to figure it out on your own which is a bit tedious. overall a great time waster.
B0000024JN|5.0|Obviously a must have CD for any beastie boys fan- loaded with popular hits<br />I would recommend this to anyone who is not a loser
B006JCC1GO|1.0|I hate this game it is so bad, you should not get this game. I also agree that little piano is way better then this game. NEVER GET THIS GAME.
B00656C6KK|5.0|My Mother LOVES it---I will borrow it and am sure I will love it, too!  Anything by Doris Day is great!
B000EHPZK4|4.0|My sister and I played this game at a relative's house when we were children.  She now has children of her own and I thought this would be a fun gift for her and her kids.  I played it myself when it arrived and it seems to be good quality and still lots of fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Lots of games.  Beat unlocked games to score points and unlock more games with scored points.  Some challenging games, others are a breeze.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Great movie, my fifteen year old grandson and I watched this movie together, I even shed some tears in this movie!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a good book but I felt it left a lot to be desired with too many unanswered questions. The last 1/3 is so vague that it left me frustrated. Did they ever figure out who dropped the bombs? Was Katniss right for changing her mind at the execution? How did Snow die? What happened to Gale besides getting a job? Also, the ending feels defeating regardless of the outcome. I was hoping for a more hopeful, inspiring end to this trilogy. A major conflict in the story is her decision to choose Peeta or Gale, yet there is no significant pivotal point where she decides... It just kind of vaguely works itself out... Argh!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love Mahjong anyway, but this game offers just enough twists and turns to ramp up the fun. In a more pensive mood?  Then classic Mahjong is also available. Graphics are crisp and responsive to touch. 5 stars!
B001GST11O|2.0|If you like Pink Floyd,you will hate this DVD.Of the 15 songs Gilmore plays,only 1 is a Floyd song.His solo career is not that good to do something like this.I think Waters and Gilmore should stick to only Pink Floyd songs.Now that Richard Wright passed away.Legally there has to be at least 3 members of the original Pink Floyd for it to be called \\"Pink Floyd\\".So there would have to be a Waters;Gilmore reunion for this to happen.Overall I would rather see Roger Waters,even though his voice is gone.He still plays a great bass.
B000068OCS|3.0|This movie was hot stuff in 1983. It still dazzles and stuns at times. But...  - It was not properly remastered: it shows scratches, and some of the images are washed out.  - Also I find the \\"accelerated human activity\\" parts overlong, and the music that goes with them, disquieting. I prefer the slower, \\"hypnotic\\" parts.   I didn't feel that way when I first saw it (about 10 years ago, not 1983, so TV, not movie theater). I guess I've become more critical. Though I would have found scratches and desaturated images unforgivable when I was 10. I'm not saying don't buy it. Just set your tolerance level a bit higher.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the app and would recommend. My son really likes the app as well. Also like that it has several different games that u can play.
B001TAFCBC|5.0|when i started this movie i didn't know what to expect but i was surprised by how far from a typical romantic comedy this story is... i honestly don't know how i would categorize this movie but i will say it is definitely worth watching.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It about time someone got it right!  This is the best remote desktop for touch devices, it offeres two styles for user interface.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is the best one by far. large graphics, cards are easy to see. This is why I gave it 5 stars
B0058VW36U|3.0|played this game on an aneroid phone and worked fine..but when I downloaded it for the kindle, it crashed and I couldn't start it up again
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This app makes selling on my Amazon storefront easy. In the grocery store, I am able to scan an item in which I think will be a lucrative sale. Amazon app will then let me know how much the same product is selling for online. Thereafter, giving me the resources needed to improve my selling experience on Amazon.com
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This has blown my mind, I don't normally write reviews but this app is crazy cool. Definitely recommend downloading it. It gives the power of your computer on your phone on any wi-fi connection. If that doesn't persuade you then I don't know what will...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|like the title says! great way to kill an hour or two on a plane.  runs smooth, don't mind the ads.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|The DVD quality is very poor .It's been a complete waste of money and I am regretting the fact that I bought the other Harry Potter movies without first checking the quality.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the progression of the games by beating others. always love trying to beat my best scores. games are all unique and fun
B000002HEP|3.0|I have listened to their previous albums and i didnt like them at all. This is the first album that i almost like for them. The melodies and riffs are good and they play something like Black Sabbath and Spiritual Beggars. The sound is old (the production reminds me of older groups in the 80s. This is not definitely bad as with the music they play it suits them. Im betwwen its just ok and i like it. A nice effort.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I ordered this extender to use for my iPhone 4S and Bose Sound Dock - it works as expected. Now I don't need to take my iPhone out of its case in order to plug it into the docking station. Bueno!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|what's up with all the one star views...great game and very entertaining ...keeps me busy during the.day while ike sitting in the car. Great for kindle fire!
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My son loves it, he carries the Legos in the bag and then dumps them and plays with them using the bag as a ship to battle on.  I have a DPO address and some sites would not ship it to the DPO for some reason, but this company did and we love it.  They were very quick with the delivery time and he loves it.
0385534639|5.0|Set around the turn of the (previous) century, this is a well-written book of the fantasy genre, bubbling with characterizations and filled with the non-obvious.  Two children are trained by caretakers for a deadly game of magical one-up-manship, but the rules only become clearer as time passes and they grow into adulthood.    And time passes in eerie and odd ways... some segments of the writing step slightly ahead, some step slightly back.  The writing is polished, and the reader, who has stepped over into the literary wall of the circus, can empathize with those night-dreamers who don't want the circus itself to end, no matter where it may manifest.    The question becomes:  What IS the circus? Is it, or is it not, larger than the two \\"chosen\\" combatants?    Black and white, and yes, greys, are the colors chosen for the Night Circus.  Where does fantasy/dream/reality begin and end?    (There are so many places one can give away plot turns in this review, so I have chosen to write my commentary this way.)    This book is highly recommended for those with the imagination to leap into the circus.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I get a black screen on my Fire. I cant find any easy steps to fix it either. If this wasn't the case I'd give it 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app and love all the different games it has to play. haven't found one I didn't like yet!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|AWESOME JOB NORDCURRENT LTD and boa blab Blair nla o do not want to write. heed hhgbgvuj bhovhovihckgg h h it gickhchocig it. h oh ihvih it if k ohoh.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|My wife and I have both loved this film since childhood.  We've owned it on VHS for a while, but decided to upgrade to DVD.  The special features aren't crazy but there is a little featurette with Pepe, which is awesome because he is my favorite Muppet.  A solid buy that you will watch year after year.
159562015X|1.0|This book is completely useless as a used book! The assessment that unlocks the entire value of the book is online and requires a single use access code. There is no notification in the description of the book that alerts you to this situation. I let the seller know and am awaiting instructions on how to return it for a refund.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It's a steal for the asking price and when free should be a no brainer. remote connect over wifi or 3g/4g with sound. I have a $30 app that is more secure but would need to dish out extra for sound. This app has good options and as-is is powerful enough. Dev awesome job and thank you for giving such a powerful app for free today.
1598875329|5.0|The brilliant Jonathan Winters voices nearly all the characters in this classic Christmas story. True to the book, only a few words have been altered or omitted (an example is \\"treadmill\\", which held a quite different meaning in Dickens' time - it was a form of workhouse torture). Sound effects are marvelous, without being overpowering. NPR stations sometimes play this in December, but I'm glad to have my own CD. I wish all of Dickens' works,in any form, would be so respectfully produced.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok it keeps you coming back for bonuses and gets their games advertised but its a good free game cause you get variety
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that this app keeps me on track and accountable for my daily reading.  It is also great in that there are so many translations for reading.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I tried some games on this app,but only half of them were even possible to play. This app was ridiculously pathetic.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun to play only thing that should be done is have no ads and have better games just some games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has become the most used app on my kindle!  I love the different versions for study purposes, the options to take notes, highlight, and the Bible reading plans available.  great download!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games, some are hard but all in all a nice app. takes a while to get points for the other games tho
B00111KDBI|4.0|When I removed them from the box, one boot had a 2 inch scuff right on the toe.  I was able to rub out most of the scuff.    Also - these dark brown boots don't look exactly like the picture.  All stitching on the boot is a very light tan color, which you cannot see in the picture.  Because of this, I am tempted to send them back.  However, the boots still look good - I just prefer less visible stitching.  Normally wear 8.5 wide, so based on reviewers' recommendations I ordered 7W and they fit live a glove.  The only issue with the fit is that they are extremely hard to get on and off for my wide feet.  I have to loosen the laces quite a bit.  Hopefully, they break in and this will not be an issue.  Next complaint is about the top of the boot that rests on the back of your calf.  It is cushioned, but very uncomfortable.  I bent and creased this area on the boots for about 3-4 minutes.  This softened it up a bit, but I guess they are just not broken in yet.  I only worn them once.  Now for the good - the cushioning of this boot is VERY comfortable.  These boots are super lightweight and go great with jeans.  I feel that I got a great deal considering how much they sell for on the Timberland site.  I am only removing a star due to the stitching that's not visible in the pics.  I'm sure they will break in fine and there really isn't a better looking or more versatile boot out there - in my opinion.
B001AZFO14|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic. A story of a man bred for war who learns emotion and overcomes superior forces to save a society that initially made him an outcast. Great stuff.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I downloaded this app because of other reviews and was not dissappointed.This was a very good game.It starts off slowly,really testing the way you can solve a puzzle and even tells you how many moves it will take to solve.It has hints to guide you,but if will cost you.It is worth your time and money to get.Truly impressed by the creators,I hope they come up with more!
1423140591|5.0|This book is the second series to the Percy Jackson series and ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! If you have a teenager or even a younger kid I recommend that you buy it for them! It is a great series and I can't wait to buy the 3rd book!
B005VPRETE|5.0|My six year daughter asked for Lego for this past Christmas. Having searched the Internet and stores I was discouraged that the selection was primarily marketed for boys with some unisex offerings. Knowing my daughters play habits, I decided to buy her lego creator apple tree house and Lego city corner. I figured that she could build a town to play with. I was hoping to buy her some female figures separately to play with. The problem I had with that was, there were precious few female mini figs.  I was a little irritated with Lego for  largely ignoring what is appealing for girls. While There are aisles of barbies and Disney princess, Lego is in the boys section of the toy store. And while we have barbies and princesses, which she has fun with, they don't really build her brain.  I remember playing with Lego as a kid. It was a hand me down from a cousin so by the time I played with it it was essentially a large tub of blocks, but it was fun to play with. I knew my daughter would have fun following the plans and creating something she could play with. I also knew she wouldn't be much interested in building the mellinium falcon. So When I saw the add in toys r us for the new Lego friends, I was delighted that Lego had finally come out with something a little girl could get excited about. While I'm still glad that I have the creator house and city corner. The friends sets complement what we already have. Our apple tree house now has a olives tree house in the back yard. My little girl spent two hours following the directions and building the tree house all by herself. I watched her young brain figuring it out and growing and I was really proud of her. These toys are good for their brains and fun. As I watch her play and create I know this is only the beginning. I expect we will buy many of the friends sets and as she develops more of the creator sets as well. I'm just so happy that there are now friends sets to get her interested and engaged.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|Works great on local network but i cannot connect using 4G. I can find my computer but cannot connect. (Bionic)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are really fun and challenging. I can't wait to unlock them all. some games are hard and some are easy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|certainly looks like lots of mindless fun ahead. I cant imaging what. I would do if I lose my progress on an update. I hope the developers fix this.
142314189X|5.0|THIS SET IS AWESOME!!!! If you are a Percy Jackson fan I recommend you get this! The books are hardcover and they come in a really cool box! I love this series and the price is way better on amazon!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is amazing! It only took 5 minutes to get everything all hooked up. I was looking at.my computer screen while using this app and seeing the computer doing stuff I wasn't doing with the computer. It is excactly like you are on your computer, and you can.even access games and programs also!
B004S699LI|5.0|This is one of my many favorites. It's like watching two movies in one. I love the way the movie goes from the hunters becoming the hunted. Awesome movie that never lets up. The cast in this movie is spectacular. If you love blood and violence and all hell breaking loose, I recommend this movie to you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|absolutely love this app!!!!!! soooooo many games to play!!!!! and you can reply your favorites over and over. because it's never the same!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|So good I want to watch it over again. Actors have all grown up so much I almost didn't recognize them. Really good ending for the series of movies this was. Feel like there may be another sequel but on a different theme. Highly recommend this one.
0553801473|4.0|I am a huge fan of this series and have read the previous books multiple times while waiting nearly six years for this edition to be published. The story remains strong but has two critical flaws. First, Martin does away with Chronological order and instead decides to use an idiotic Geographical method of dividing the story into overlapping North and South stories that lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity when any editor worth their salt would have and should have suggested he stick to a more conventional time based evolution of his story.<br /><br />Second, and a far worse offense, Martin builds the character Arya over the course of five books into one of tremendous interest. Then for whatever reason he adds only two brief chapters of detail to her story arc in the course of the entire sixth book. One can only hope that this is part of the nonsensical way his editor is allowing him to tell the story and book seven will suddenly have 85% of its chapters about Arya.
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|My husband picked out this movie and when I saw Woody Allen as director/producer I thought this is going to be a typical film of his.  I was right.  Way too much talking by Owen and too much poor acting.  Even Kathy Bates could have done better.  She was the only one with that looked comfortable in this movie.  This movie is overpriced in the stores for such a bad movie.
0525425578|5.0|I have all the John Grisham books and have read all of them. My dad also has read them all and started me to reading them.I have the whole collection and cherish it because my dad and I share this interest.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very fun game and it is great for when you are bored or just want to play a games with out buying more than just one game and it is free that's the best part you get 117 games for free and you use your points to unlock other games and you start with 10 but you get point even when you keep on losing one game and it is so fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really find this entertaining. It is fun even my kids find it entertaining. I would really recommend it to a friend l.
0307891402|5.0|Excellent guide, now my only problem with Skyrim is when to put it down.  Note* this thing is HUGE, so big that it should in fact be a weapon in the game.
055357342X|5.0|I can summarise my reviews of the previous two books in this series as so:<br /><br />Too many pages not enough oomph.<br /><br />That is not so with Storm of Swords. OK still too many pages but Damn does Martin turn up the heat for this one. He certainly doesn't hold back on slaughtering his main characters, and shows some deft authorly skill with character development (i.e. making some not-so likable folk somewhat redeemable.)<br /><br />Characters move around alot more, supernatural s*** starts to filter into the story and twists play havoc with our heads. Looking forward to sloughing through the next one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun, free app for solitaire. I recommend it. I have had hours of fun playing it and I am sure anyone who has played it on their computer at home and enjoyed it, will recognize and enjoy this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a good game for passing time if u are on a road trip and you have nothing else to do
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty fun games, definetly would not buy points for it though. I like how you can earn points by being persistant even if you don't win. so really everything you do is worth something.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|Where is the linux support? This would be a very valuable application if it had support for Linux. For me, this is useless. Free app teamviewer is better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are fun and easy. they are short games so you can play quick while waiting for something.  it is fun unlocking new games I'm always waiting to see what's next
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I'm mostly happy with it.  I got it because quickoffice pro wouldn't show Excel charts.  you can also do more and better editing with this program.  Only drawback is that a lot of Pdt content doesn't come through.  QuickOffice Pro is better for the Odds.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the variety of games was really good. it is a great time waster and is great on long road trips.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great game just dose't keep you going. some games are fun but a lot are hard and boring. not a game I would get.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Set during the summer of 1979 in a small town in Ohio, SUPER 8 revolves around Joe Lam (Joel Lamb) and his friends as they attempt to finish a Super 8 zombie movie for an upcoming Super 8 Film Festival. While filming one night at the local train station, the boys and the star actress of their production are witness to and somewhat involved with a horrible train accident that unleashes a mysterious creature. Soon after, all the dogs in the town run away, people start disappearing, and all kinds of pieces of electronics and machinery are stolen. Oh, and the military has moved in and blocked off the area around the train crash. While watching footage that was shot on the night of the crash, Joe and his friends make a startling discovery. The boys attempt to finish their movie while at the same time solving the mystery of the alien creature.<br /><br />SUPER 8 is a sci-fi movie that has very little to do with sci-fi. Instead, the movie is more of an action movie drama that's about relationships. The core of the movie is about the relationship between Joe and his friends. They are a close knit group of companions, but you know that after high school they will go their separate ways, perhaps some of them never to meet again. At the same time, you know that some of the friends will be friends throughout life.<br /><br />Besides being a movie about the relationship between childhood friends, SUPER 8 is also a movie about family. The movie begins in an incredibly depressing manner with the death of Joe's mother, her funeral, and the immediate aftermath. After her death, Joe and his dad (Kyle Chandler) attempt to hold on while forging ahead; adjusting to the new normal after the death of a close loved one is extremely difficult. There's also the relationship between Joe's love interest, Alice (Elle Fanning) and her own father (Ron Eldard). In a completely different vein, there's also the budding relationship between Joe and Alice. Oh, and there's the whole thing about our own relationship as humanity with other creatures (in this case an extraterrestrial creature).<br /><br />I really enjoyed SUPER 8. It's one of my favorite movies from 2011. The movie was directed by J.J. Abrams and produced by Steven Spielberg. I felt the film was a decent film on its own. It's a nice little story with some great moments of acting. However, what sticks out most about the movie is the overwhelming since of nostalgia that swathes every inch of the film like a college dorm reeking of potpourri incense. The movie isn't just a homage to the late 1970s and early 1980s, it's a full blown love song that blares out over Abrams's film boom box as he stands outside Steven Spielberg's office. There were a lot of movies made in the 1980s that were Spielbergian in tone or style. However, in the past twenty years, not even Steven Spielberg has made many Spielbergian movies. SUPER 8 resurrects the Spielbergian-style of filmmaking. The movie pays homage to a slew of other films (and in some cases outright steals from some): E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, and THE GOONIES are easily the largest influences. However, there are several others including JURASSIC PARK, JURASSIC PARK: THE LOST WORLD, JAWS, GREMLINS, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Also, the zombie movie the boys are making, &#34;The Case&#34; has several references to George Romero and his zombie films.<br /><br />Like most of Steven Spielberg's and J.J. Abram's previous works, not everyone will enjoy SUPER 8. It has a broad appeal, but the tone and style won't appeal to everyone (probably most particularly those over the age of sixty). Nevertheless, most viewers will find something to enjoy in SUPER 8 especially if they focus on the relationship between the characters and not the overall story.<br /><br />The DVD of SUPER 8 doesn't include many extras. There's the usual commentary with director J.J. Abrams and some of his crew. Done correctly, this often can be one of the most rewarding extras of a DVD. However, in this case, the commentary is incredibly boring. Abrams and his buddies croon about Spielberg throughout, there are long pauses throughout where there is no commentary or discussion, and there really isn't any new information revealed that wasn't already available in the promotional materials for the movie and DVD. The other special features include a short featurette with Abrams and his crew entitled &#34;The Dream Behind SUPER 8&#34;. That featurette was more exciting that the DVD commentary. There's another featurette entitled &#34;The Visitor Lives: Creating the Creature&#34; that features the main creature designer for the alien. This is an interesting look at the process of how the alien came to be created. Lastly, there are a series of trailers for upcoming and soon-to-be released movies.ing extras of a DVD.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|pretty cool...works over WiFi with fast results. works over 3G too, but just a little delay between actions. but I love it.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Great app! Already came in handy the first day I downloaded it. Would recommend. Looking forward to future updates and security enhancements. Download this and spend more than just a few seconds setting it up and you will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this game all the time. I can not get enough of it. I found this game with my friend and we played for hours having a great time!
B0052GACNM|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Francis Sinatra and Mr Bennett. I have both of Franks Duet Albums but I think that Tony's Duets are better Sorry Sinatra fans. I am not overly pleased with Bennet's voice over all but he does have phrasing etc.  Zuess
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a fun app to play. It reminds me of old warrior ware games. I like it and the achievements.
B005IA9K2G|5.0|Heve been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a long time.  I appreciated that Amazon let me know that it now was available   Service was prompt and before Christmas-So I could watch my favorite classic and gave one as a gift
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I downloaded the app, then downloaded splashdown streamer on my desktop. Literally, within seconds I had access to my desktop remotely. Works great on my EVO 3d.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|We gave my daughter this for Christmas and it is now her favorite movie. She is really into birds since watching this. It's a cute kid's movie.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This is an excellent album.  If the other reviews haven't convinced you, you must not be much of a lover of music.<br /><br />I don't know what else I can contribute to the praise of this album.  Do you enjoy genuine musicality?  Do you enjoy genuine musicianship?  Do you enjoy genuine vocal talent?<br /><br />If you answered yes to any (and hopefully most) of these questions, then you should without a doubt be paying attention to this band.<br /><br />Congrats to the band and to any listeners who decide to become real fans.<br /><br />MR
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell was an awesome game. The sequel is just as fun, with new mechanics to spice things up. Totally worth the<br />.99 it costs.
0439023513|1.0|Whoa. Never wrote a review before, but I wanted to warn others what a sheer let down this book is. I thought the author grotesquely disfigured her beloved characters' motives for action so much, I couldn't recognize them.   I loved Peeta in Catching Fire and Hunger Games for his selflessness and kindness. I loved Katniss for her spunk, her courage, and her deep concern for those she loved (Prim, Rue, Peeta, Gale's family etc).  In Mockingjay, there was no character trait to admire in her. Literally.   Everything that made me like Katniss was removed. Remember how she volunteered to become a tribute (almost certain death) out of love for Prim? Remember how she tried to save Rue and sang to her while she died in her arms? Remember how she was willing to die so Peeta could live through the games?   So, it would *seem* that the next logical progression would her caring so SO SO much about the pain, hunger, and oppression of the districts that she stands up to the Capitol. It would *seem* that she would be compelled to become the Mockingjay, the leader that her country so desperately needs because of her love for others. Why didn't she take her concern for Peeta, Annie, Gale, her country and take action to become the Mockingjay willingly not reluctantly?   Others weren't brave enough to love deeply, and this girl, with her father dead still sacrificed everything for Prim. She was courageous enough to love Prim, Gale, Peeta, Haymitch even. No one else cared as much about people in pain as Katniss. That's why everyone could rally behind her, because she cared.   Not in this book, however. I thought it bizarre that someone who cared so deeply for others suddenly went and \\"numbed\\" out her pain with drugs and by hiding in closets and putting those she should have felt desperately protective over directly into harms way.  This indecisive, sniveling girl in front of me was not the Katniss in book one and two. She was selfish. Impulsive to a fault. And still a pawn. But what bothered me the most was that she didn't seem to really care about the district or her family or herself anymore. And that was truly loosing.   If anyone at all could stand up to the Capitol and the Rebel groups and organize a peace or a new country, it should have been the girl who would do anything to protect those she loved. Nope. She didn't feel anything in this book but sorry for herself.   Her major battle of finding herself, recognizing her strong love for Peeta, never emerged. She started the book off healing from a concussion, but I think the only one who really had the concussion was Suzanne Collins.   Maybe it's Collins who didn't care either?
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This is a very cute movie. The family enjoyed watching it along with my daughter. I highly recommend the book, and my daughter enjoyed listening to it as an audiobook.
055380684X|4.0|I appreciate the clarity in this book. I've read other books on the subject and find this one more focused. The author discusses a concept and then gives good examples of how they were implemented in the real world.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is an awesome game. It is totally worth the .99 to buy it.  I mean, if an average review of 5 stars with over 1k reviews isn't enough to get you to appreciate the value of this app, then this one isn't gonna change your mind.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun!!! I love it because it is very challenging. Have you ever been starstruck by a game? It is breathtaking
B002I0J5FG|4.0|Shadows of the Colossus is an absolutely amazing game. I had always wanted to play it during the PS2 era, but never did get around to it. I am glad that I have finally had the chance to play this title. It is without a doubt one of the most engrossing, atmospheric games I have ever played. It holds up fairly well for it being an old PS2 game. Some of the mechanics feel clunky and occasionally the graphics appear outdated, but this is easily overlooked in most areas. The Colossi look stunning in full hd. Definitely worth picking up if you have never played this game before. Love it.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|To be completely honest, I did not know who Kelly Clarkson was until I heard her endorsement of Ron Paul. I'm buying the album for that reason and I encourage all of his supporters to support his endorsers.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app makes me able to utilize my PC by being able to control and view every aspect with my Kindle Fire. Hard to click a small Icon? Easy! Just zoom in and click away. With this app, you can also drag and drop, type, listen to your PC, right click, double-click, you name it. I'm sold.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|An absolute must have app that is simply amazing.  It will be nice to share pics, videos &amp; docs without clogging up my Galaxy S II.
B001E45XT4|5.0|After reading a few reviews, I wasn't too sure about how this would turn out. I had already bought it, so I waited till it came, which was hard cause I was excited. It came right when I wanted it to, and I immediately loved it.  Pros:  Mic is really good.  Sound is great.   Comfortable, wore it for 3 hrs b4 any real discomfort.  Easy to set up.  Cons:  Hard to think of any off the top of my head. They itch a bit after an hour or so, but that's minor.  I love this headset. I recommend it to all casual gamers and some hardcore gamers.
B004LUS390|3.0|For what it is this is a fantastic app for sketching and doodling. However after saving a sketch I've been incapable of relaoading it for further refinement, with the entire app crashing as a result.. Hopefully the developers read this and address the concern soon - kindle fire.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I downloaded this but I found it to be a very cool and useful app. It basically lets you control your computer (Mac or PC) from your tablet, in my case the kindle fire. The interface takes a while to get used to but works well. I'm not sure how far away you can be from your computer and have it still work, so far ive tried it in my living room and bed room and it worked just fine.  Overall I find this to be a great app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is an awesome game you will not want to put it down. It is really fun to play I love how you have to win the coins so much fun.
078322611X|5.0|This movie came in perfect condition.  This movie is a great oldie.  It was also received in more than enough time.

B001GF7WRW|2.0|I was looking for fairly cheap headphones that would provide the best sound given their price. After searching and comparing various reviews of various headphones for the price range of 60$-70$ I decided to get the AKG K99. Many reviews were positive and highlighted their clarity and open sound.<br /><br />I mainly listen to classical music, and I was hoping these would be a good fit for this kind of music (since they are regarded highly due to their clarity and open sound). But I was very disappointed when I first tried them on. The sound was muffled and muddy as mentioned by another reviewer. The highs were pretty good, the lows were decent but the middle-range were terrible. Thus making the experience of listening to string quartets and solo piano pieces unpleasant and lacking, as the balance between the different sounds is poor. Listening to symphonies was better, as I must admit that I did experience the \\"open sound\\" compared to the other headphones I owned, but it still was muddy and lacked the clarity.<br /><br />So I decided to give them a try listening to other genres. It was better, especially with Rock and some Jazz, but once again - It lacked the so desired clarity! It seems as if the music was playing underwater.<br />I managed to get better results after playing with the EQ, but unfortunately it only helps when listening to CD's or to music that you have on your computer, so when using Spotify I had to deal with the unsatisfying sound again. But once again - good headphones should play well without EQ.<br /><br />As for the comfort - they are great. I can listen with them for hours without feeling any pressure, weight or sweat. They do feel as advertised.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed. Especially because they were not as clear as I was hoping for them to be. I am still hoping that they benefit from burn-in, as mentioned by one of the reviewers and maybe it's the fault of the sound drivers/card of the laptop I'm using. I will try them soon using better set up, but for now I can't honestly recommend them.onestly recommend them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game!!! its so addicting! highly reccomend to anyone! some games are very easy others are more.challenging. love it!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is a wonderful game player and I love to play the games on it you will not regret getting this app for your phone or I pad or even your kindel fire

B005HSG3TC|3.0|My wife and myself received the new Kindle Fire as gifts. We purchased these covers to protect them, the best thing I can say about the covers is the two day free shipping. You get what you pay for.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|My grandson was so happy to receive the dvd:  Supernatural: the complete first season.  Very nicely packed.  In perfect condition.  Amazon was the only place I could find this item.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I went back and rewatched this for the first time in several years. It is still the best period piece I've ever seen, even better than Pride & Prejudice! If you love this, you should also check out Wives & Daughters. Richard Armitage smoulders. He will soon be seen in The Hobbit!
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Seems like a good app. I tried it on my Motor ATRIX, and it doesn't run correctly. I get a view of my desktop, but when I click on something nothing happens. I can see it happen on my computer, but not the phone. When my ATRIX is connected to my laptop dock or my he dock the program keeps crashing. Gave this 2 stars since it did connect and did give me a view of ny desktop even though that's all it did on the phone side.
B001B6EAOY|1.0|don't buy it only works with one 16gb card look elsewhere, shipping to expensive to return, do your self a favor look elsewhere

B002N5N5M0|5.0|If you've only ever experienced John Lithgow being all jovial in 3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN - if you missed what he brought in, say, RICOCHET or RAISING CAIN - then you may be gobsmacked when you see his stint on DEXTER, when his twisted side came out to play. John Lithgow is the reason why the 4th season of DEXTER is universally regarded as the best one so far in the series. Of course, Michael C. Hall, who plays Dexter, isn't exactly just twiddling his thumbs, either.<br /><br />Season 4 catches us up to our charming and newly married serial killer Dexter Morgan, raising three kids and having relocated to a suburban paradise so perfect there've been sightings of the Stepford wives. Dexter is now absolutely living the dream, and never mind that his spanking new baby is keeping him up nights, is affecting his job performance as blood spatter analyst for Miami Metro PD. Even more intriguingly, it's upended the routines of his dark calling. Dexter has been off his game, hasn't put down a serial killer in a while. In fact, Season 4's first episode amusingly plays off the opening credits sequence to demonstrate just how off his game he is. And when he finally gets back to his killing ways, he is so sleep-deprived that he loses track of where he stashed the corpse (or its hacked up bits, anyway). It's a lot of fun seeing Dexter, usually so meticulous and in control, running around in a full-scale panic.<br /><br />Season 4 finds Dexter in a collision course with the Trinity Killer, him what kills in threes. Keith Carradine returns, with his Henry Fonda-esque delivery, as now retired FBI profiler Frank Lundy who is in Miami to partly renew acquaintances with Detective Debra Morgan but mostly to pursue his pet project: tracking down the Trinity Killer, the only serial killer to have eluded him (of course, Dexter two seasons ago also eluded Lundy). Lundy's investigations lead him to believe that the Trinity Killer had been secretly plying his craft for 30 years, making him officially the most successful serial killer to not be caught, a revelation which awes Dexter.<br /><br />This is the most harrowing season yet. There's a parallel investigation that goes on for most of this season, revolving around a rash of tourist murders, but that's just icing on the cake. It's mostly all about Dexter's interactions with Trinity, and Michael C. Hall and Lithgow do their characters justice (but Jennifer Carpenter also again kills it with her terrific performance). John Lithgow won a Golden Globe and an Emmy for his role of the tormented Trinity Killer. This time out, the show does a sort of reverse presentation of its season's big bad. From jump we see Lithgow's character for the vile creature that he is. In Season 4's opening episode, \\"Living the Dream,\\" we see the Trinity Killer at work and he, in the first few minutes, does something which the Skinner and Jimmy Smits from the previous season were never able to do. Trinity scared the sh_- out of me. Further episodes proceed to layer in his personality, presents us his cover, how he's managed to blend in for decades. You can see why Dexter, whose own Dark Passenger renders him severely alienated from normal society, is fascinated with Trinity, why he'd want to study him. Dexter's inability to immediately dispatch Trinity will cost him dearly. I can't describe the chills that raced up and down my spine when Trinity finally figured out Dexter's true identity, when he confronted our guy. From his lips, a greeting like \\"Hello, Dexter Morgan.\\" has never sounded more menacing. Season 4, a watershed year, leaves us horrified but oh so riveted and so fascinated. Maybe it's not only Dexter Morgan who harbors these dark cravings.ally the most successful serial killer to not be caught, a revelation which awes Dexter.<br /><br />This is the most harrowing season yet.

B000EHSN9Y|1.0|The mini-dvi end is very loose fitting in the macbook, whereas an apple analog video adapter fits snugly and produces a good signal.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My daughter was so excited to see the new Lego Friends range. We already own a lot of Duplo and recently purchased the [[ASIN:B002UD8P4S LEGO Bricks & More Deluxe Brick Box 5508]] and the [[ASIN:B004GUOR2W LEGO Fairy Tale Historic Miniature Figures - Contains 227 Pieces]]. Olivia's Tree House is a great addition to our collection. My daughter was especially excited about the new mini-doll figure and she would like to collect them all.<br /><br />This was her first real Lego set and she was able to assemble it herself by following the instructions. I had to help her out a couple of times - building the brown parts of the tree was more complex than I expected. She was very proud of herself after she'd completed the 40 plus steps involved.<br /><br />The tree house set has a lot of nice touches - a little secret hiding spot for treasure, ladders that swing up & down and a very cute bird and cat. Regular mini figures also fit nicely in the set and my 4 year old son also joins in the play with his own mini-figures in this set.<br /><br />Olivia can switch her hair with regular mini-figures and my daughter likes to add the red witches cape to Olivia, so she can be Super Girl. Olivia can also hold Lego items. My daughter likes to have her use the bow & arrow from the Fairy Tale figures set.<br /><br />We will be purchasing more items from the Lego Friends line.
1400031567|5.0|I am late to the party with Mankell, a best selling author in Sweden for many years, but I strongly recommend this book, as well as the others in the Kurt Wallender series.     Walender holds the stage throughout most of the book, set in southern Sweden in the 1990s, where first a bizarre suicide and then a series of brutual murders, with a killer scalping his victims, has Wallender and his team despertely searching for answers.    An example of Manekll's extraordinary narrative skill is his success with a technique I normally dislike - using a changing harrative point of view - in this case, putting the reader inside the criminal's mind.  Usually I feel this gives away too much of the story line, but here, the approach actually builds suspense. We are in the character's head for a few chapters without being certain who he is.  But once we do identify him - knowing \\"hoover\\" is actually stalking Wallender's daughter for example, builds, raather than undercuts, the detective story.    These books move along at a brisk pace, with multiple, fully realized characters, giving us a slice of life in contemporary Sweden.  Wallender's efforts at maintaining a relationship with his adult daughter, and his father as the old man drifts away to alzheimer's, attest to this novel's claimg to be much more than a murder mystery.     To my mind the social insight and narrative power of Mankell are on par with PD James, and they are well above Donna Leon's Venice novels and the artist to whom he may be the progenitor - Steigg Larrson.    This is a terrific series, and Wallender ages reasonbly throughout, so it might be worth it to read them sequentially if you feel yourself getting hooked, as I did.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is friggin' awesome. I just can't understand the negative remarks. It does exactly what it claims to do. Sure, there are some things you need to do to make it work properly. The thing that almost got me was when my PC went to sleep. I couldn't wake it up from my mobile device. Then I realized I had to go to my device manager and set the network adapter to be able to wake the computer. However, this only works over LAN. If on 3/4G, it won't wake it. So I just set my PC not to sleep. It still turns off monitor and hard disks after a while, so that is all I want. Again, this app is the best app on my phone, and I have over 180 of them. I got it free, but I would easily pay $4.99 for it, if not more.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good variety of games, most are fairly easy. not bad for a free game. You get what you expect in this case.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Awesome app, works as expected on windows 7 and XP.  links with gmail so its easy to locate and connect to computers.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love the timing challenges. lots of different kinds of games and variety. I do think they make the higher level games cost too many points though. fun overall.
B0058VW36U|5.0|great game! my kids spent hours playing it and laughing at the animations. I had fun with it too. would definitely buy again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|spider solitaire has long been one of my favorites.  great game and minimal ads, which is always nice for free games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There's a whole lot of games in this single app, and it doesn't hurt that it's free! There's a variety, and it is fun (for me, at least) to go through and &quot;buy&quot; sequential games with in-game coins. If you don't like it, it's only a free app. Recommended.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|When I read some of the 1 and 2 star reviews, I was apprehensive about buying this cover, but I liked the design so much, I bought it.  Now, I am apprehensive about the future of this country.  I assume that the people who cannot put their kindles in this case have--or will have--the right to vote.  This is frightening to me.  This cover fits fine and feels very sturdy.  If you cannot close it, move the kindle a little more to the outside corner to align it correctly--DUH.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game to play when bored on my kindle fire, lots of fun, highly. addictive with much variety, I do recommend
1466401885|3.0|Disclaimer: I found myself working in an office in a foreign country this summer, with minimal German skills and far too much time on my hands. I got into the habit of loading up my kindle with half dozen self-published e-books every night and tearing through them at the office the next day. Cheap, entertaining, and fictional--I love a good e-book. SO, when I first read Beautiful Disaster, I read it alongside several dozen pretty crappy self-published books from the Kindle store. By comparison, Beautiful Disaster was not so bad.  I am not ashamed to admit that I have read this book three times. I don't know why I like it so much, but I do. Well actually, if you REALLY want to get into it, I probably like this book because it's about a bad boy. Like any book smart girl who has only been successful with dating the quiet, shy boys, I've always had a secret fantasy about dating some weird, volatile bad boy with a motorcycle, tattoos, mommy issues, and a heart of gold. Beautiful Disaster picks up on every cliche of my fantasy and throws it together in novel. Great.  From reading reviews, I know that I really don't need to reiterate the issues with this book--grammar and spelling, length, unrealistic college setting, inexplicable financial success, thin plot, and downright unlikeable characters. BUT, I did want to throw this opinion into the mix: I genuinely found myself wanting things to work out between Abby and Travis because they spent so much time publicly embarrassing themselves. Maybe I'm in the minority on this, but if my boyfriend picked me up and carried me ANYWHERE--whether it be down the hallway after a test, or out of some elaborate Valentine's Day frat party--I would kill him. I. Am. Not. A. Blow. Up. Doll. Put me down. And to add to that, their point-making PDA was SO WEIRD. Seriously? Get out of my lecture hall and stop making out. Since I'm clearly too doughy and female to win money in an underground fighting ring, I'm taking out loans left and right, applying for financial aid, and washing dishes in the dining hall to pay for this degree. Go back to your big ass apartment and make out and cuddle there, Abby and Travis. Oh, and the fighting in the cafeteria? Is this Degrassi? Stop. Please. Enough. I just wanted their relationship to work out so they could justify their strange and unadjusted social habits.   This book is one of the better self-published romance books I've come across, which isn't saying much. But, I think it succeeds in what it set out to do, which is to make girls swoon as they live vicariously through this description-less female poker shark who nabs herself a tattooed bad boy that sounds like the impossible love child of Channing Tatum, Ryan Atwood from the OC, and obsessive psychopath Tate Langdon from American Horror Story.  I may sound negative, but I had no delusion that I was reading a timeless romance. This book got me through the summer, and finally opened my eyes to the fact that the quiet ones aren't so bad. They'll never embarrass you in public like Travis Maddox, that's for sure.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game I like how it has soooo much games!!! I love love love love love love this game it is one of my top ten.
B003291CBW|5.0|Homage to Catalonia, written by George Orwell, is one of the most important documents of its kind.  It is about a period of time Orwell spent fighting in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. While there, he was almost fatally wounded by taking a bullet to the throat. This event, while quite painful, did little to dampen his voice. He was told he would never talk again, but little by little, he regained his ability to speak. The doctors said he was quite lucky to have survived his wound. Orwell couldn't help but thinking that if he had been truly lucky, he would not have been shot at all. Orwell prefaced his description of his ordeal stating, \\"The whole experience of being hit by a bullet is very interesting and I think it is worth describing in detail.\\"<br /><br />The Spanish Civil War was one of the most decisive events of the 20th century. While the memory of this event fades into the background, reading this book brings it vividly back to life. One is transported in time immediately back to the trenches of the battlefields with their stench of human waste and long periods of boredom and sudden periods of danger and to the turbulent streets of Barcelona where rival factions fought each other for control of the Telephone Exchange Building. The importance of such a record would be difficult to overstate.<br />As one reads the record of the events taking place in Spain, taken from Orwell's direct experience, one cannot escape noticing the similarity to events taking place in America today in the 21st century. As Lionel Trilling indicated in his excellent introduction to the book, Homage to Catalonia is a testimony to the nature of modern political life. He observes that politics is a relatively new thing in the world, and we do not yet know very much about it. That is hard to understand nowadays, given the 24 hour news cycle and the complete immersion of politics on the cable news television stations. Ideas play a large role in politics and have great power. These ideas are directly connected to another kind of power that is described in the book: the power of force.<br />In 1937, Orwell went to Spain to observe the civil war and to write about it. When he arrived in Barcelona, he got so caught up in the revolutionary furor that he decided to stay and fight. He joined the militia as private. The militia unit he joined by chance was a unit known as POUM (Party of Marxist Unification). The Spanish Civil war was a fight in defense of democracy against the Fascist enemy led by its chief proponent, Generalissimo Franco.<br /><br />There were many rival factions taking up the fight against the Fascists: POUM, communists, Trotskyites, and anarchists. We see some of these same echoes today in the Occupy Wall Street Movement. There are many and various factions protesting the inequality of the 1% of the wealthiest Americans versus the 99% of the rest. These inequalities have brought great unrest to our country along with high unemployment, economic hardship, and social injustice. The militaristic mien of the jackbooted SWAT Teams breaking up the demonstrators in Oakland, Boston, and New York are reminiscent of Franco's fascist brigades.<br />When Orwell first arrived in Barcelona, outward appearances revealed it to be a town where the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Nobody said, \\"Senor\\" or \\"Don\\" anymore, but rather, \\"comrade.\\" Practically everyone wore rough working class clothes. Orwell recognized it immediately as situation worth fighting for.  It was a worker's state where the entire bourgeoisie had either left, been killed, or came over to the worker's side. There was no unemployment and the cost of living was extremely low. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine. In barber shops (all barbers were anarchists) there were notices that barbers were no longer slaves. Orwell said, \\"A fat man eating quail while children are begging is a disgusting sight. But you are less likely to see it when you are within sight of guns.\\"<br />Orwell was quickly sent to the front to fight in the trenches. In trench warfare, according to him, five things are of paramount importance: firewood, food, tobacco, candles, and the enemy, in that order. The real preoccupation with both armies was trying to keep warm. Firewood was the only thing that really mattered. The trenches were more than 500 yards apart and in those circumstances no one gets hit except by accident. He describes a particular experience that eerily presages passages from 1984:  \\"In the barn where we waited the place was alive with rats. They came swarming out of the ground on every side. If there is anything I hate more than another, it is a rat running over me in the darkness.\\" This particular horror is to found behind the doors of room 101.<br /><br />In another scene, Orwell described a maneuver where he and his fellow soldiers were to attack a fascist position at night. The ground was muddy and wet and he was sodden from head to foot and was weighted down with a heavy rifle and bayonet and 150 cartridges. The patrol was successful in overrunning the enemy redoubt and had the fascists on the run. Suddenly the command to retire came. As Orwell and his men left the parapet and headed back across the 200 yards to their own parapet the fascists reappeared and began to attack the patrol.  He had thought earlier that he could not run being as laden down as he was, but, \\"I learned you can always run when you think you have 50 armed men after you.\\"<br />Barcelona is a town with a long history of street fighting.  While on leave in Barcelona after serving three and one half months at the front, the last thing Orwell wanted was to be mixed up in some meaningless street fight. To be  marching up the street behind red flags inscribed with elevating slogans, and then be bumped off from an upper window by some total stranger with a sub-machine gun- that was not his idea of a useful way to die.<br />When Orwell saw an actual flesh and blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, he did not have to ask himself which side he was on. Completely innocent people were being arrested owing to police bungling. He reached the point that every time a door banged he reached for his pistol.<br />Foreign journalists in Spain were hopelessly at the mercy of the Ministry of Propaganda, though one would think that the very name of this ministry would be a sufficient warning.  Watching a fat Russian agent explaining that a particular event  was an anarchist plot was the first time Orwell, according to his account, had seen a person whose profession was telling lies, unless of course, one counts journalists. One is reminded again of today's Fox News which studies have shown its viewers to be the most uniformed. Its entertainers, posing as newscasters, have a way of stating their biased opinions as fact.<br /><br />The fighting began on July 18, 1936. Most anti-fascists in Europe felt a \\"thrill\\" of hope. Here at last was democracy standing up to Fascism. For years, the so called democratic countries had been surrendering to Fascism: The Japanese, Hitler, and Mussolini. When Franco tried to overthrow the center left government in Spain, the Spanish people rose up against him. Franco was not really comparable to Hitler or Mussolini. His rising was a military mutiny backed by the aristocracy and the Church.  It was an attempt not so much to install fascism but to restore feudalism. The Spanish working class resisted by revolt. Land was seized by the peasants and factories were seized by trade unions. Churches were destroyed and priests were driven out or killed. In certain areas of revolt as many as three thousand people died on the streets in a single day. Men and women armed with sticks of dynamite rushed across open squares and stormed stone buildings held by soldiers with machine guns. Anarchists and socialists were the backbone of the movement. The entireissue had been reduced to Fascism versus democracy.<br /><br />The war, in which Orwell claims to have played so ineffectual a part, left him with memories that were mostly evil, and yet he did not wish that he had missed it. The whole experience left him with not less, but more belief in the decency of human beings.blood worker in conflict with his natural enemy, the policeman, he did not have to ask himself which side he was on.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good time waster. some of the games are a bit tough to beat. really need a stylus to play some games
B004MC8CA2|4.0|My dad showed me this app on his Android phone, and I decided to get it. The only problem is that I have to connect to the church's wireless network to read it. They say that you can download bibles for free, but so far I can't do this. But good with Wi-Fi connection, though
B004T32SOK|5.0|I love box! I can store all my files and share them to all my friends and colleagues. I can access all of them on my computer, phone and now my kindle fire :-).
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Awesome APP absolutely NEED to make this available in HD on Google TV! That would deff give this app 5 Stars! Its awesome doing stuff from my Kindle but would make this app 100xs better if I could use it from my Google TV too. Overall works well with my Kindle and works okay with playing movies and such from my other computer sometimes it freezes but I just pause and wait a sec for it to catch up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Hey you! Yes you! This game is super fun and addictive. I totally recommend getting this. I really enjoyed it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easy to download and install.  I really like the touch features. Much easier to use and navigate compared to other remote desktops i have used.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Here are some peculiarities I discovered after installing and testing:  If you can live with these, then the app is a gem.   PC (W7):    Every time you connect from the app to your PC, it resets the PC screen resolution to 1024 x 768, you can change it back from the PC.  The PC resolution does reset after you disconnect the app, but your icons and sidebar items are malarranged.  You can not stop the Splashtop Process or Service from the task manager. - maybe because I did not install it as administrator, dunno.  Even if you set it to not start on bootup of PC, it still runs a Splashtop Service in the background.  The running process does not show on the task bar.  KF:  Even though you can pinch and pull the PC screen image, you can not pinch it enough to see both the top and bottom at the same time.  You have to cause the mouse to move.  I opened a PDF that was wider than 1024, and you can not get to the extra from the KF app.  It is not on the expanded second monitor.  The resolution is never as good as on the PC, even when pulled.  The bottom of my PC screen (where the pgm shortcuts and task bar are) is set to autohide - it pops up when I put the mouse down there - that does not work from the app.  So I can not get to any of my programs.  You could turn off autohide, or load the desktop up with shortcuts.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a great app has many different types of games AND ITS FREE!!!!!! really fun I have for the kindle and I works great
B005ZUR724|5.0|I have been helping my parents and I'm definitely getting this. I watch youtube videos of this and luv the graphics. Worth the dollar. Check out jojopetv on youtube.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|works soooooo smoothly on my eee. ten times better then anything else. controls are awesome and you can watch movies from your computer. how great is that.
0439023521|5.0|I have to admit that I never expected to like this book. It's not my usual genre, so I expected I would read about 25 pages and set it aside.  Serious error in judgment.  Suzanne Collins is an amazing storyteller, and I couldn't wait to find out what happens to Katniss. I've already finished \\"Catching Fire,\\" and I look forward to starting \\"Mockingjay.\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good waste of time..its okay but the controls aren't the best. when it does work its fun.. if u have nothing to do it great
B0054JZC6E|2.0|meh I did this for the points the games are pretty lame and it takes to long to get more points to buy new ones so it's whatever.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|I Was Very Much Looking Forward to Seeing This ...  But Unfortunately, the Amazon Advert for This Item Is Very Misleading !!!  AS THE DVD COPY IS NOT EXTENDED CUT - BUT REGULAR FEATURE FILM !!!  The Extended Cut is Only Available on the Blue Ray Disc Alone - Just Sad !!!  As I Only Ordered It for the Extended Version & Since It Is NOT Yet Available  On Dvd Alone I Bought This Version as I Was Lead to Believe That It Was Included.  As It Specifically States Here: Green Lantern Extended Cut(Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)  So With That Being Said or Stated Like That ...  All 3 Copies Should Be of the Same Extended Cut Version of the Film Purchased.  It Says on the Back of the Box That the DVD is Only the Original Feature ...  But I Did NOT & Do Not See On This Amazon Advert Anywhere Stating Any of That Information  And Was Very Misleading.  I Would Send It Back for a Full Refund But I Do Not Drive at All & This is Very  Very Incontinent if Not Next to Impossible for Me, and I Already Opened It  Only to See That the DVD Disc Was Exactly the Same as the One That I Already Have  In the Original DVD Release, Then Reading Over the Entire Box Only t Find in the Small Print  That the DVD Copy is Only the Regular Feature Film.  VERY VERY MISLEADING & I BLAME BOTH AMAZON & THE DVD MAKERS FOR THIS ...  BUT MOSTLY AMAZON FOR NOT PROVIDING ANY OF THIS INFORMATION ON THERE SITE ADVERT.  SO ALL I CAN SAY IS ...  DON'T BUY THIS IF YOUR LOOKING A DVD COPY OF THE EXTENDED CUT !!!  As It's Very Sadly ... NOT THERE !!!  PLEASE GET IT TOGETHER AMAZON & PROVIDE MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE THIS  ON YOUR PRODUCTS - THANK YOU !!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I love this program! i can get to my computer from anywhere and play a video or music. i have also used it to open files that have info in it that i have forgotten. would be nice if i could copy files and place them on my phone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the variety of games is awesome, but some of them are difficult to play and the instructions for each game are sometimes inadequate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is do amazing I plover it with all my heart it'd my favorite of all times beef game ever sllove lobe mofxggyfhxfx hcuxfxjfxfh,jjf if. gfhh j. gjgx jtfx gjxx j gi vjhff, g,fhfx fjxfh, jfufxj gjux jgu
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Diverse activities offer a pleasant diversion. This product is just.what it claims to be. Tolerate the incessant pressure toward.other apps.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Decent game, good way to pass time. there is a lot of variety, so it doesn't get old too fast.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the coolest game on android I really really really really realley really really. really really like it yup
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app does exactly as advertised.  It is fast, and you can view anything just as if you were sitting in front of your desktop or laptop.  I can view photos, videos, documents, etc.  Very cool.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game! 3 Generations play this game. The completion on how far and how many coins have been earned adds spice to family get togethers.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  This allows me to access my laptop from virtually anywhere. I can even activate the web cam and see what is going on at home.  I strongly recommend this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its so fun too should get it I got to play a lot of games and you never get bored
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use this app almost daily. I use the reading plans. It does crash every once in a while which is why I only gave four stars instead of five.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover is exactly what I wanted!  It's lightweight, adds very little bulk, feels nice in my hands and it has a stand so I can set it on a table to watch movies or read.  I am shocked that some reviewers reviewed it as \\"cheap\\".  It seems very well constructed to me, and as I mentioned, I love the feel of the material-similar to the back of the Kindle Fire.  The stand is not a hard-core stand but it works fine and anything better would likely add more weight.  Love the color too.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|Absolutely AWFUL....I cannot believe that this reached Academy Award status. 1 star ....if ANY! Save your money and look for ANYTHING else!
B003L77FYS|5.0|I have enjoyed all videos and dvd's that I have bought from Amazon.<br />The quality of all items were great and I will be buying more items from them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is awesome. it is everything I like in one. it is absolutely awsome. I really require it. it is a five star game.
0143119680|2.0|There's nothing new or interesting about this book, except for the excessive amount of melodrama and stereotypical behavior. The heroine is tough, smart, strong, independent, and not about to let the fact that vast numbers of supernatural beings are trying to kill her change her behavior in any way. Go running at night? Sure. Row on the river at dawn? Why not. Take a stroll outside the safe house after you've been warned not to? That's first on the list. No one's going to tell her what to do! Yet she melts into the arms of the vampire, breathing in his scent, and feeling safe at last. Sheesh. As for the melodrama, there is more stomping, huffing, nostril flaring, and door slamming than should be legally allowed. Then there are just the flat-out stupid parts, including the heroine's complete lack of curiosity about an obviously mystical document, time travel, not consummating the relationship (night after night after night), and vampire conception. Probably the most ridiculous part of the book is when the 1500-year-old vampire is easily taken out by some vampire chick he's known for years, who basically just darts in and stabs him through the heart. If he were this easy to kill, he would've died years ago. All in all, a very disappointing book, and I won't be signing up to read Part Two of this vampire soap opera.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have had no problems using SplashTop on my Kindle Fire. My home PC is Windows 7.  I would recommend the Kindle Fire and SplashTop.  I do not need to store files on my Kindle when I can view them on my home Computer.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Aesthetically, the case is very pleasing (black). It's slim and looks very nice. The case fits very tightly and does not allow the device to move at all. I'm also a big fan of the elastic band to keep it closed. I prefer the elastic band over any magnet or clip. The overall quality of the case is pretty good. My only complaint is the \\"stand\\". When folded as a stand the case is not very sturdy, but as long as you have it sitting on a completely flat desk it works well. Oh and also a screen protector would've been a nice extra, but hey... beggars can't be choosers I guess.<br /><br />P.S. To people with greasy fingers: the material on the outside of this case easily picks up fingerprints, but is easily cleaned.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good times it makes time fly by and makes times abut better I would get this game on all of my devices
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I am using this on a windows 7 PC and an Acer a500. It works flawlessly on a LAN. I confirmed it connected over the internet but I have not had a chance to use it much.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|This item is great.  I was happy to purchase it at a reasonable rate.  The service was quick and efficient.  I would definitely use this service again.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I bought this for my husband and now I'm addicted!  This show is fantastic, so many details to keep track of.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very entertaining and addicting it has a variety of games to enjoy to help time just fly by
B004O3YGMC|5.0|wow I saws completely surprised this app is aamazing absaloutly awesome  recommand on kindle fire so buy it ok ok ok
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liked it lots of fun games addicting and easy controls simple inter face and easy rules will recommend to others  people to get
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun little games. a little addicting! just wish it ass easier to unlock some of the other games as you make progress.
B0000041WV|4.0|If you're looking for a complete set, this is definitely the way to go...especially since ithe price is so right. An alternative choice might be to buy only Symphonies 7,8, and 9, as really the first 6 are rather \\"experimental\\" in nature...most listeners tend to focus on the later ones...still, you can't go wrong either way...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the type of game for gammers and for those who need to waste time!!! AWESOME!!!! love this game!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am using this on my Kindle Fire. It is a good version of basic solitaire software.  I like the number of options - one or three draw, backgrounds, undo feature.  It loses a star because the ads between games sometimes make it freeze and they can be a little intrusive, but it was free.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is such an awesome game that can sure entertain anyone for hours to come.  If you ever are bored and don't have anything to do you can open up this gameand play forever.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I don't always win, which keeps it challenging. The app runs smoothly, with no bugs! Wish I had more time to play!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this iis fun. its goood to have multiple games in one. I would recommend adding tthis if you like to play different games.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I had previously gotten a more bulky zippered case for my Kindle and was heistant to give this one a try because of a couple of the negative reviews here on Amazon.  I am very glad that I decided to give this case a try.<br /><br />It provides great protection without adding a lot of bulk to the device.  It feels better in my hand when I use my Kindle Fire.  It is a simple and elegant solution to how to protect your investment.  The only downside for me is that I think it is slightly overpriced, but I could say that about every case available.  At least in this instance I can say it was a perfect match for what I needed.  How much is that worth to you?<br /><br />Update - 02/16/12 - Now that I have had this case for a couple of months, I thought I would update my review to let everyone know how my case is wearing.  I've seen the pictures of \\"flaking\\" that have been uploaded by other users and I am happy to say that is NOT happening with my case.  I use it for hours every day and it still looks brand new even after two months of use.<br /><br />I still think it is a slightly overpriced, but I don't regret paying as much as I did to find the perfect case for the way I use my device.  This is the one you should try!
0425241505|5.0|I guess over 100 people can't be wrong in rating this book 5 stars, it was a page turner.  I loved both main characters Dragos and Pia.  I won't go into the storyline because most reviewers have already done that, but needless to say this book was thoroughly enjoyable and I can't wait to read the next few books in this series.  My favorite thing in this whole book is the interaction between Dragos and Pia.  Dragos being such an ancient being and also dragon shifter made him set in his ways and kind of unemotional until Pia came into his life.  I found it so endearing when he tried so hard to be a better man for her.  I also loved the part when Pia with Dragos' help was able to shapeshift, and the thing she shifted into was breathtaking.  Don't miss this book it's a keeper.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|The album is a must buy. He really does take care of the ladies.I love \\"Practice\\". A woman should be able to do what she oughts.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|tons of fun time wasting mini games that will keep you gaming for a million years. once you beat a few games you can easily unlock more so you can game till you die.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|There is a reason that this app is rated at better than 4 out of a possible 5 - because it works!  This is a simple and easy app that lets you gain access to any desktop PC/Mac through a secure connection.  I am curretly using it to connect with two different PCs and it works great.<br /><br />It was very intuitive to set up and get connected and I was using it inside of five minutes of having installed it.  And, although there are some features that I haven't quite figured out yet, the basic interface is extremely easy to use and there isn't anything I have tried so far that hasn't worked.  I think this app is well worth the small cost based on the number of times I will need it and the time and travel savings of just one use.  Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun. I like how each game is so different form the others.  also beware its very additive. everyone should try it at least once
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome game. so many games in one. my brother is addicted to it, he loves it!!!!!!!!!!! so much fun. cool game!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I always thought it would be great to access my desktop from anywhere but never imagined it could be done so effortlessly.  I have installed this on my Kindle Fire and Droid X and it works well on both with the following exceptions.  Droid X - Perfectly responsive.  Does exactly what I want it to.  Its just that the screen is too small to make it efficient at everything.  I do a lot of zooming in and out which gets annoying but isn't the fault of the app, just the screen size...which brings me to the Kindle Fire.  Kindle Fire - The responsiveness isn't as good as on the Droid X which I didn't really notice until I used the Droid X.  I don't think this is a flaw with the app but with the device.  Specifically when two finger tapping to switch from trackpad to gesture mode.  On the Droid X this toggle works perfectly, on my Kindle Fire it takes a few tries.  Overall, I am really happy with this app and excited to know I can rest easy leaving my laptop at work without worrying about access to my files, software, and corporate network.  This app really lets me do a lot of detailed work unlocking the power of a mobile device.  I watched a 50 Mbps video stream flawlessly over my wireless network into both of my mobile devices.  sound and picture quality were great.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A good diversion, especially with one suit.  A lot more challenging with multiple suits, and I haven't tried that yet.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Great Movie.  One of my all time favorite movies.  Loved it on the big screen then loved it again in  blue ray my big screen at home.  Also received the digital copy when I ordered from Amazon and was able to watch on my Kindle Fire.
0812550757|5.0|The Ender Series is entirely about humanity, and what happens in the face of fear. While Ender's Game touched on the mindset of alien creatures, and focused mostly on human beings, Speaker for the Dead digs deep into both. Ender is much older in the story, and has a very different standing with society. His siblings play an interesting part that is also very different from Ender's Game. The thing that will stick with you about any Ender story though isn't the action or the strange aliens: its the reality of human behavior, and the incredible \\"what if\\"s presented throughout each story. I haven't yet read Children of the Mind, but Ender's Game through Xenocide are all fantastic.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've used a few VNC programs before this, but Splashtop is by far the best. I can't believe how well it works, and on my phone, no less!  Just a couple of missing features, I think, not worth complaining about: it would be nice if, first, tapping the scroll wheel in trackpad mode generated a middle click, and second, if we had the option to use an encrypted connection.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Unfortunately this is not at all based on Remote Desktop Protocol.  Don't be fooled by the app name.  Requires install of bloatware on your desktop.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a really cute movie that I bought as a gift. I received it right when Amazon said I would.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Exellent product. Iam enjoying my iPhone, iPad, and iPod more so than ever. My devices have spice now. They all sounded great but now it's an experience
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very impressed with this app.  It has become one of my main tools for my Fire.  Easy setup and have had no issues to date.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Watched it with my kids and very skeptical wife.  She laughed from beginning to end.  Not an east feat for any film.
0767836324|5.0|I ordered this movie as a gift and it turned out he already had it. I went to return the item and received immediate feedback and support from Amazon.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Worthy successor to Quell -- new puzzle elements have been added to make the gameplay distinctive relative to the original.
0393312836|5.0|This book hardly needs another review, but I am compelled to write on it's behalf.   There is so much to list! This book started me off with a challenge. That is, as many reviews (good and bad) have stated, the slang. The slang threw me off a bit at first, as I am sure it would any reader. However, if you keep reading and look for context clues as to what the words mean, it becomes easier and easier to understand. And, to be honest, it also becomes fun, being able to read and speak the slang that is so prominent in the book is like being one of Alex's droogs.  This book will throw you for a loop when it comes to the violence (sexual and non-sexual). However, I would ask anyone, even those who are sensitive to violence, like I am, to please see past that and read on, as the extreme violence has it's place, there is a reason for it. I would not, however, read this book if violence or sexual violence is, in any way, triggering for you.  This book comes, so I've heard, in two forms. There is one in which the last chapter has been removed. The addition of that original last chapter totally alters the tone of the entire book and I suggest getting the book with that chapter (the 7th chapter of the 3rd part).  This book will make you think long and hard about morals and ethics. I came away liking Alex more than hating him, even though I hated him in the beginning of the book. Any book that can do that, I think, is a good book.   Give it a try, but please, I beg you, don't stop reading it a third of the way through or half way through... Doing that will leave you completely unfulfilled and with only a pin-hole's peek at the big picture.  If you read it through, and don't like it, fair game. But give it a fighting chance.
B001DSNEJM|2.0|*Possible spoilers*   \\"The Lazarus Project\\" is a movie with an intriguing premise, but a not so intriguing execution. It is about Ben Garvey (Paul Walker), an ex con, who tries to live a straight life after his probation has finally ended, but who gets laid off from his job because of his criminal background and, desperate for money to support his family, agrees to go on a heist with his brother and steal gold in dust from a laboratory. The mission goes awfully wrong, however, and three people end up dead, except for Ben - who survived only because he was in the back packing up the stuff. Somehow the jury convicts him for being responsible for the deaths of those three people and he is sentenced to death. When he wakes up, he finds himself in the town of Dundee, Oregon, working as groundskeepers and being told that he needs to leave his past life behind and move forward. Strange things start happening and that is where the story unfolds.   As mentioned above, while this was an interesting story with a truly titillating premise, it was poorly executed and Ben wasnt the the only one for whom things didnt quite add up. There were just a lot of inconsistencies in there and huge plot holes that ultimately resulted in making this a totally unbelievable story.  First and foremost, no one acts like you'd expect them. I mean who gets executed, even in the state of Texass, for accessory to second degree murder and fails ALL appeals? Ben Garvey didnt even pull the trigger, he didnt even have a gun, yet he gets _executed_ and everyone talks about what a horrible criminal he is who needs rehabilitation - like he was some serial killer or rapist or some other demented violent offender, even though clearly he went stealing out of necessity and not because he is a psycho. Speaking of which: who turns to a life of crime and risks serious incarceration and losing his family because he lost his job. Why didnt he just collect unemployment and went talking to his parole officer to findhim a job? That just didnt make sense. Maybe that wasnt an option but if that is the case, the writers should have somehow put that in there instead of just ignoring it and hoping it will go unnoticed.   It is a sign of bad acting and bad writing when characters in movies dont behave like you would expect a person in real life to behave. Yes we all know this is a movie but some resemblance to reality helps increasing the credibility and quality of said movie. I mean, who greets a person they believe dead and whose funeral they attended, like he just came back from vacation? If someone I believed dead stood at my door, I would pass out, not give them a tender hug.   If this is a rehabilitation facility, does that mean an entire town has been dedicated to it? Since there were no guards and everyone could roam around freely and had internet access etc., how did they imagine to shield people from their old lives? Since the the mother and daughter at the cafe are the same mother and daughter in the second set up video about real estate, then the whole town must have been in on this. But, how is all this funded? It seems like a huge undertaking and you do wonder who would fund such a thing,  especially in a state that is notorious for harsh incarcerations and where people are apparently executed for robbery.   There seem to be hidden cameras everywhere but if they had a camera in there filming him, wouldnt they have found the picture that slipped under the cabinet? How is it rehabilitation to brainwash and manipulate a person into believing they are insane and imagined it all? How is that helping anyone? The exchange Garvey has with the project leader in the end was unintelligent and touched the issue of rehabilitation of criminals only superficially. In fact, it was done so poorly, it made people advocating for rehabilitation of criminals versus execution appear to be nothing but insane, deluded nut jobs themselves. That certainly didnt help the cause or accurately outline the debate. And what's up with the \\"demon\\" we see in the shadows? Arr you telling me that people in the business of rehabilitating criminals put on costumes and lurk on dark corners to scare the \\"inmates\\" from leaving by making them believe some demon will go after them if they leave town?   This movie is full of such inconsistencies and a lot of it just didnt make sense. Suspending disbelief is ok, but not to this degree. This was an interesting and suspenseful movie but I think it didnt do a good job at creating an even semi-solid, coherent and believable movie without gaping plot holes. I dont get why anyone would give this 4 or 5 stars as the immense plot holes and inconsistencies were staggering.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome! even though you do not start out with all 101 games, I did not think it was that difficult to get new ones
B0064Y5U24|1.0|Music for drunken, white suburban frat-boys boys with low IQs.  This band sucks beyond measure.  They are a complete joke.

0440236304|5.0|This book is a no glamor look at war from one of the men that was there.  The author Mr. Burgett is a national hero as far as I am concerned.  The book is very well written and easy to read.  I can not wait to read his other three books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game, easy to play, and enjoyable! I really enjoy the different deals and my family can all play easily as well. Great way to pass the time.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun. the viriaty of games is amazing. I play it all the time. and ive gotten pretty far
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app places many versions at the tip of your fingers. When studying the word it is important to remember these are the words that reflect the character of our Messiah and the heart of God. it is through reading scriptures that we are encouraged, strengthened, built up, edified,  and are able to grab hold of the promises. Having these translations readily available is a wonderful study aid.
B00664AM5C|2.0|Most movies have plots, character development, action sequences that drive the audience from place to place, but not Contagion. No this was just a look at what might happen in the event of a viral pandemic. So what? Do I need to know which hardware stores to rob in the event that everyone, but me, is sick? Government conspiracies involving none other than Big Pharma, a blogger's greed...you get it all, but a real story. How movies like this get produced is beyond me. So I'll ask again, what was the point of this movie?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of my favorote apps and its great for the kindle fire.  i love this game sooooooooooooooooo much and its great for little children and adults and people of all ages
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wow this is awesome~ I'm addicted!  wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is awesome. You need it. You can annoy other people on the computer at the same time or actually use it. It is good for both
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i think this is so fun!  games can be challenging but still a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend this app.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is fun but it is hard to control and gets really hard to control if there is any flinging.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|OfficeSuite Pro 5 is the mobile office app, I've been dreaming of. I am able to effortlessly create and format Word documents on my HTC Sensation. Documents look great (retains formatting) when I email/open on my computer. Interface is intuitive. (Slide toolbar to see additional options.) This app lets me capture my thoughts and start work documents anywhere. Love it! (Note: I have only used Word so far.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is really cool. I wish there were a lot more games like this. thanks for making a great game.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought two of these dolls for my 19 month old twins, and they really like them. Like others have said, they are a really good size for a toddler to carry around and they can be snuggled with at bedtime. I had read a few reviews with some concern about the \\"yellow teeth\\", and although they are more of an off white, they are not very noticeable and a child certainly won't care. The doll has a very sweet face (way better than anything I saw at the store) and the outfit is cute. I will definitely buy more dolls of this brand in the future.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved it!it creates hours of fun for all ages. I downloaded it a few days ago and I still love it!
B0055SWM08|4.0|I really think that the music on this game is enough to make it an enjoyable task. the game itself is average, though strangely addicting. Together, the two elements make a slightly engaging and **utterly** soothing experience. Great for taking a mental break from work or study.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this won amazing game to just mess around with and another plus is that it's free.v v v v v v. v vv
1451648537|4.0|I found the book an informative and revealing treatise on someone I had met and dealt with when I sold major original paintings in the Bay Area.  I was tickled to read that he felt that the most extravagant purchase for him during his life was his purchase of a Parrish oil that he acquired from me.  He asked me to deliver it and hang it for him in his house.  I noticed that there was NO furniture in his home,except for a few utilitarian articles.  When I left, however, he had a magnificent Parrish oil hanging on his wall.  Alma Gilbert-Smith
B00631VJIC|5.0|My wife and I have been loyal fans of the TV series \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" since it originally aired four seasons ago.  We have three of the four seasons on home DVD, which my wife watches over and over again, and we are eagerly awaiting receipt of Season Four from our order with Amazon.com.  When she found that the music from the series was available on CD, she just had to have the CD, so I got it for her as a surprise.  Now, when she isn't watching something from Seasons One, Two, or Three, she is listening to the music on the CD.  C'mon Amazon.....Hurry up and fill my order for Season Four!
B001BPQT8A|3.0|I own a Panasonic BDP-210 Blu-ray player, updated with latest firmware.  This is the first Blu-Ray I've purchased that does not play brand new out of shrinkwrap- Disc reads for a moment and then an \\"incompatible for playback\\" message appears within 5 seconds of load.  I've initiated a return and a second disc is en route, so my fingers are crossed that the new disc will play. A New Line/WB product. Caveat emptor.  UPDATE:  Amazon quickly shipped a new copy of the disc and it plays fine.  Therefore random disc manifacturing error is confirmed- Shrinkwrap says \\"Made in Mexico\\"- WB quality control obviously needs improvement.  Kudos to Amazon for their fast service, and defective disc is on the way back to them today for credit.  Transfer itself is excellent, and all extras have been ported over from the 2000 Director's Cut DVD.  Another classic from one of the very best directors working today, David Fincher. 5 stars for the film and transfer - 1 star for WB's decision to have discs made in Mexico instead of US = 3 stars
B0054JZC6E|5.0|easy to earn points I earn them fast play for 30 min. get points.try 5 times.get points its fun easy u turn to try
B004A8ZWXS|5.0|But I love horses and all animals. My last favorite movie was It's a Wonderful Life, so that should tell you what a dinosaur I am.  In my opinion, Hollywood makes crappy movies these days, I have no idea who the \\"stars\\" are because they are so nominal, and I've heard great reviews of this movie.  It's a matter of taste, and movies these days are mostly distasteful.  So I will buy the DVD and get back to you later.  We don't do theatres where rude people talk all the way through a movie or munch popcorn.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|As usual, Otterbox is the way to go when protecting your smartphone. It feels great, doesnt look bad and protects your phone.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I have SwiftKey installed on my Galaxy Nexus and it would not work with this program. Five Stars if that is fixed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|playing lots of games to get more games. great for kids mulitple genres of games for educational to extreme. nice
B005BZQVF2|4.0|I laughed through the whole movie.  I will say that if you haven't watched a lot of sci-fi in your life you won't get much of the humor. So many references and lines from great movies.  Plus I love Simon Pegg. Not quite Mr. Scott, but wonderfully funny!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|One of the best applications outhere. I will definetly recomend it to anyone.get it my friends you'll love it. Is amazing how you control your computer from work and best of all is free.that's why I gave it 5 stars. I love splashtop.
B004LWZW4M|3.0|The film's long title \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is sort of a spoiler. It virtually tells you all about the film. \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" centers on a young scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) and a chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis). Will learns that a new gene therapy drug, originally developed to cure Alzheimer's disease, has enhanced the intelligence level of the chimpanzee the drug is given.   Being a reboot of the series, the new film ignores some of the aspects of the Charlton Heston classic made in 1968 (especially political elements). Instead director Rupert Wyatt focuses on the relation between Will and Caesar, as well as how Caesar exercises his leadership among the apes. The film also provides several nice action sequences and Andy Serkis did a great job as Caesar as always.  But I was not impressed. Beside the fact the most viewers know how the story will end (yes, humans are on the losing side), \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" suffers from several flaws: stereotypical characters (Freida Pinto's primatologist Caroline, level-headed but uninteresting; David Oyelowo's arrogant and greedy boss, who somehow didn't fire Will when his first experiment went wrong); and some incredible coincidences (lucky for apes, unlucky for humans).  The film is arguably much better than Tim Burton's re-imagined \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" but frankly I still don't know \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" really deserves the positive reviews it has received from the critics.
0061537969|5.0|An interesting read, different from what I expected, but in a refreshing way. The story, told in 3rd person from a dog's point of view, makes you wonder just how much a pet really understands their environment. The storyline is definitely more of a heart-tug if you own, or have ever owned, a dog. It also helps if you know something about car racing, but you'll learn some of the fine points in the read. But beware, you may find yourself trying to hold back a tear or two in the final chapter.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|OMG! What a delightful movie.  The soundtrack and animation were inspiring. You can't watch this movie with out laughing, crying and dancing. We will definitely buy this one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is one of the best apps tht ive ever played i play it all the time i luv it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|to try them all. I haven't unlocked all the games yet, but I am having a great time so far!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|If you're looking for a super easy-to-use desktop remote control app, look no further. Easy, quick installs on Android and Windows.  Remote control of your PC is fast and well executed. Streams audio well. Video streaming to Droid X is good, but frame rate is slightly reduced on DVD quality video. This is still far better than any other remote access product I've ever tried. Note that media streaming is noticeably faster and smoother over WiFi than 3G, but that is to be expected.  Took one star away for lack of encryption for security. That's probably why the remote control and streaming are so fast.  However, you're most at risk when accessing your remote PC over the Internet from a public network, such as at a cafe or hotel. I'd like to have an option for enabling encryption.  It does not appear to have a direct file transfer feature, so if you're looking to transfer files to your Android device, you'll have to initiate an alternative method from your PC (e-mail, cloud storage, etc.), and then retrieve it on your Android device. I'd really like to see a simple file transfer feature added.  For external remote access without using your gmail account, you need to set up a simple port forward rule in your router, and a similar rule in your firewall. How-to details are on their support web page. Tip: You can disable these rules  when not needed to maintain your network security.  Overall, great performance and ease of use while much less expensive than LogMeIn or GoToMyPC. Works nicely on Droid X with Windows 7 PC. Highly recommended with caveat for lack of encryption. One of the best FAOTD ever.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It was very easy to use with a lot of different options.  I like idea of it auto completing for me.  would like to track high score.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok. I like how u can buy games with your money u get from playing other games. i like it a lot.
0739378392|5.0|Hotel Vendome in large print made a great Christmas gift for my Nana!  She usually needs to find her reading glasses before reading one of her favorite authors, Danielle Steel, but the size of the print is perfect for her.  This was kind of a last minute gift idea, and it arrived promptly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Have only started, but it seems cool. I liked a bunch of the ones I've played but I need more points to unlock the rest!
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Have tried this game 4 times. Every time, it force closes when the puzzle is about 80% complete. Most frustrating thing ever. Utter garbage.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a great way to pass time but it didn't explain how to play the games very well......overall it was ok
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game it is fun. you have to have skill. I reccomond it to you. good game very fun
B006JPS1OM|5.0|For murder mystery junkies this is a good one. It takes a couple minutes to get the hang of it, but I really enjoyed the gameplay. I have only played the free version so far so I don't know if it ends well but I do like what I've sampled so far.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is good for the kindel fire and all the games in it are addicting!! I love it!!!! good game
B006RUJST6|5.0|I had been seeing the link to this book for a couple of days and was skeptic at first.  I'm not an Avett fan, honestly hadn't heard of them till this book. But when the promotion came up for free, figured it wouldn't hurt.  If I didn't like it, I didn't like it.  But WOW, let me tell you, I couldn't put the book down.  I even managed to cook dinner while reading it.  Easy read and the characters really do just draw you in, making you not want to stop reading, needing to know what is going to happen next. Can't wait to read what comes next from Colleen!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Best RPG available for the kindle fire.  As others have stated it is very similar to WOW.  It's very fun and addictive.  If you enjoy MMORPGS, then get this game.  You will love it.
1595141715|5.0|This book literally made me nauseous. I read the whole thing in one sitting and I hated it and it was one of the best books I have ever read. Thirteen Reasons Why is emotionally exhausting--like The Hunger Games trilogy, where when you're done you'll be too tired to cry and all you'll want to do is just curl up under the covers and not exist for a while. This book is extremely triggering for those of us who have had friends commit suicide, but frankly those who will be disturbed the most are the ones who will take the most from this book.
B0009HLD0K|3.0|This is a good movie with fine acting and writing.  Breaking Away may seem to some a little dated, but I felt this is a good period setting film that can be enjoyed by the whole family.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|The special effects in this movie are amazing. It was great to watch the blue ray quality and full stereo. This is a must for SCI-FI Fans
B0058VW36U|5.0|I just got the kindle fire and I downloaded this game the day I got it. cut the rope is an awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works excellently over WiFi, 3g, and 4G. It appears that wake on LAN doesn't work with sprint 3g,but everything else is great.
0756404738|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss is a lyrical writer and I enjoy reading every page.  I love the way he turns a phrase and uses precise, creative language to paint the picture of this epic fantasy tale.  Ultimately, this is an autobiography of Kvothe, and this book continues the backgrounder on Kvothe's monumental childhood.  I am trusting that Patrick knows where this is all going, but Kvothe is not yet 18 in the back story. I have enjoyed it all, but, along with book one, it has been almost a 2 thousand pages. So I must ask, when does the autobiography end and the story move forward from present day?  Will it ever?    Interestingly enough, I read this book while reading Joe Haldeman's The Forever War.  I know I shouldn't mix sci-fi and fantasy, but I feel that if Joe wrote like Patrick - The Forever War would have been 4000 pages long instead of 236.  Patrick can take 50 pages to describe a walk with Denna and Kvothe on a sunny day...  I respect and appreciate the rich character development and the awesome biography of this character - but please.  My recommendation, for what it is worth, is please move the story along in the next book.  There is a huge impending event (past or present) somewhere, and I am enjoying the ride waiting for it to happen.  But, Patrick, am I really going to wade through another thousand or more pages and not arrive?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a very addicting game. I enjoy playing this very much. It keeps you pretty occupied when.you are really bored.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not sure about these books, but once i started reading I could not put them down! so interesting, and good plot and characters!! if you need a good read the hunger games are a good book for you, and even though they are considered  for younger  target, it is still for all ages and genders!!   Love these books!!!
0143116371|4.0|Just received The Sartorialist book and although it was a bit  on the smaller side, (I forgot to check for dimensions) I am super  pleased. The content is amazing- Love all the images.   The quality of the book/pages/print is excellent.   In 2005, The Sartorialist author (and photographer) Scott Schuman, began a photography blog covering the \\"Fashion Forward\\" and Fashion Week on the East and West coast of No America and Europe. He is very stylish himself! and has a great eye for spotting a Fashionista on the street! His blog has been a hit ever since. I am personally addicted.   Again, job well done, Scott Schuman!  A must book for any fashionista.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|i can do everything on my tablet that i couldnt before by streaming my computer to it. this is really cool. im having a problem with the volume however.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not bad for free except the move hints are pretty lame.  Just back and forth moving a card right back to where it was.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game. It so many games you never get bored. The advertisements do get annoying but that's the price you have to pay for a free game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the vast selection of reading plans. Really keeps you on track with your reading plan as well. Such a great selections of Bible versions too!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its fun playing games to unlock new ones. some are fun to keep playing and gain points. the more points you get the more games you unlock
B0054JZC6E|3.0|addicting and a little frustrating. some of the games wont let you move fast enough so you cant get out of the way. great way to waste s lot of time.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|it's a cool app, but its a little laggy. I like to hook my laptop to the hdtv and I can use the kindle fire as a wireless keyboard which is awesome. although sometimes it doesn't seem to wanna type...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i really enjoyed thee game on my kindle. the touch-play is challenging, but that's what makes it fun. could do without the pop-ups, though.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best free paid apps offered from Amazon's Appstore for Android. I was even able to get my elderly mother to set up her side so that I could access her home PC (I provide her tech support) while I'm out and about. She won't have to wait for me to come over or get back to my home computer for me to see what she's messed up this time. I'll be able to provide near instantaneous support. App works amazingly well.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|it works just good among my laptop,browser, iphone, and kindle fire  well. this is simply good for meeting notes capturing webpage and etc..thanks
B004EPYZSU|3.0|Cowboys & Aliens is far from being anything special in the least, but qualifies as an enjoyable popcorn flick that is best to be viewed with your brain at the door.  Daniel Craig plays an amnesiac gunslinger who awakens with a strange and powerful bracelet-type weapon on his wrist, and finds himself a wanted man by the law to boot.  Before you know it, he runs afoul of a nasty Harrison Ford, and eventually the alien beings that the film's title implies.  This Extended Edition provides a stronger story than the theatrical cut (as well as some decent amounts of bloody violence), but despite that though there isn't really anything all that special about the film, other that the draw and appeal of its two stars.  The action sequences are well orchestrated by Iron Man director Jon Favreau, and there are some surprisingly creepy moments to be found as well.  Olivia Wilde provides the requisite eye-candy, and Sam Rockwell, Adam Beach, Clancy Brown, Paul Dano, Walton Goggins, and Keith Carradine are all on board as well.  All in all, if you're looking to a kill a rainy afternoon, you could do a lot worse than Cowboys & Aliens.
B005STGJHQ|4.0|The music of the Foo Fighters is amazing, they're down to earth people that are honest with their fans 100%. This LP, reissued in Nov 2011, is not 180 gram, though it carries an audiophile pressing price. I find this perplexing as this LP and the others (Color and the Shape, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, One By One, In Your Honor, Skin and Bones) have jumped in price over the past two months from a reasonable twenty bucks to an astounding 30. This vinyl reissue also includes a 320 kbps (killabytes per second) mp3 version of the album availible for your listening pleasure. I have ordered all the remastered Foo Fighters LPs from seperate sellers to decrease costs. The only drawback being they arrive spiratically and on seperate days in seperate packaging. Never the less, this LP sounds amazing, and if you're into vinyl and Foo Fighters, definitely pick this one up! 4 stars out of 5 for not being on heavy vinyl.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The best app on the appstore hands down. The best feature is the Google service that let's you connect remotely from anywhere. I've tried similar apps but nothing works as easy as this one. 5 stars for the Google integration!
B004SIPA4G|5.0|The product was shipped to me very quickly and the quality was very good. The movie appeared brand new and played without flaw. I was very pleased with my transaction
B005FITIGO|4.0|**Spoiler**<br />This story is about the first day of the financial collapse of the US banks and market and then the world financial markets.  The movie starts as a massive layoff is being done to let go of 80 percent of the employees of a financial firm. A typical black Monday! One of the middle bosses being let go gives a data chip to his brightest subordinate and tells him to look into the data but to be careful!  What unfolds is the realization that the Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) market is about to collapse and drag their company and the world markets down with them.<br /><br />The management meets all night and decides that their financial future means more to them than honesty and trying to help others.  This is a shockingly terrifying movie about the realities of the USA and global financial markets where a handful of people make millions (Or billions) at the expense of everybody else who invests in the market or saves their money in a bank.<br /><br />This movie hits the problem head on and shows how the people sold bad securities knowing that the buyers would lose everything so that they could make personal financial gains of millions of dollars in a few hours.  The buyers purchased the securities knowing something was going on but their own greed made them make bad decisions.<br /><br />I am sorry to have spelled out so much of the plot of the movie but I see the disaster that this kind of thinking caused and that we are still conducting business today with the same rules.  Watch this movie and then decide if you will ever trust a stock broker or firm again.<br /><br />The movie features some great actors and they do a good job of bringing forth the story of greed and corrupt financial polices! It is worth 4 stars just to let movie watchers see the mentality of the people they trust their money with!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|set so you can read the entire Bible in 1 year. multiple translations. big downside, must have wi ti to read. took it to church and my Kindle became a barbell.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is absolutely phenominal. I can't believe it's free. You will stay busy and entertained. multiple games you play to gain coins to unlock even more games.
B0054LRR3S|5.0|I'm a new listener of SBTRKT, but via a recommendation I checked this album out and was blown away! It seriously is in my top 3 favorite albums of 2011. The sounds keep you moving through the entire album, taking you through a range of emotions. The mount of thought and detail that went into the production is staggering. I can only hope to hear more like this from SBTRKT! Also, the collaboration songs are pretty fantastic; Little Dragon and Sampha are the perfect match for SBTRKT's sound.
B005GVF95O|4.0|My First Puzzles is a nice starter game for young children to start to learn about puzzles and how to use a tablet.  The puzzles are easy and colorful and contain a lot of cute creatures that they can learn the names of.  Learning how to complete the puzzles will improve their hand and eye coordination using the Kindle Fire and is a good lesson on how a tablet works.<br /><br />I liked that the 14 puzzles are animal based and really cute characters.  Children can relate to the animals and have fun learning.  This is targeted at ages 2 to 6 but to be honest the puzzles may be too easy for a 6 year old.  I do wish they had added one level higher for slightly older children with increased challenges for their learning skills.  It still rates a solid 4 stars for youngsters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is a wonderful tool.  It is a convenient way to have the bible with you at all times.  The audio capability is a great feature.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I have been looking for an auto matic watch for some time now/ I found this on at Amazon, and purchased it about 2 weeks ago. I t reminds me of my first automatic watch I bought when I was 17,called Leondias with a luminous dial.I have had it all these yrs, but it died last year. and the luminous dial. always  worked in complete darkness.. This new watch from Seiko, works fine, sometimes it  gains a few minutes in  a  a week, No problem, I adjust and its fine. The only comments I have . is this  watch , I prefer to have a nice leather  band, instead of woven cloth. Dont know how long the cloth strap will last before I have to replace it. AS far as the Luminous dial goes, i found the only way it will glow in the  dark, is to put it under a deck lamp  for about 2  minutes, and u will see it glow for about 10 minutes. After that, forget it.You cannot see the face dial in the  dark. I have  had this problem with all the luminous watch dials that I have bought in the  last 5 years. This is going to be the last watch Automatic that I will ever buy.I usually wear this  watch during  the  day time. Have to wind it  up before I put it on, and  shake it to start it  working. I take it off, before i watch TV at nite, and put my cheap Timex on with Luminous dial, and light to see in the  d ark, as the Seiko does not perform for me in a  darkened  room.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Awesome graphics. No glitches so far!!  Runs very smoothly. Probably one of my favorite apps so far games wise.  Worth every penny!!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|It was a gift for our Grandson so it will help protect the unit. Seems like a good deal.He likes it as his brother could mess with it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun, you can play it forever without getting bored. I'm not sure how to use my remaining words so I guess ill.  wrote this.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|I looked everywhere for this and finally found it on Amazon! It was so hard finding Casper in Full Screen!!!! My mom hates wide screen so I wanted to find exactly what she wanted. As always shipping was fast and it arrived perfect.
B002ZG974M|5.0|This is an amazing movie in many ways.  The similarities and differences between the children very interesting.  The director did an incredible job showing the babies as naturally as possible, without narration or interference.  The film is very artfully filmed and has really enjoyable background music.  My favorite baby was defiantly Bayar!  I have seen this movie countless times because my 1 1/2 year old daughter is obsessed with it.  She's always asking to watch \\"Baby\\"!  My three other children love this movie also (ages 6, 8 and 10).  I like that it shows a natural and positive view of breastfeeding- and I hope it will influence my kids views of breastfeeding in the future.  My only problem with the film is that I feel the filmmaker tried to make the African mother look like a better mother (by showing more interaction with the baby).  I feel that this may be a little biased and that he was trying to compensate for the poorer living conditions.  Absolutely recommended for everyone!
B006LS7DQE|5.0|puzzle quest is well worth the money great game I'm so happy its on the fire just as good or better than the ds version,very happy!!!
B00164GDD2|5.0|Another rare item I found on Amazon! Geez, they made my Christmas shopping so easy and to find a new Ghostbusters in blue ray was just awesome! Came fast and was in perfect condition!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|time can be spent here, but the ads get annoying. Too heavy for my taste. also, playing the same game over and over hers repetitive (you only start with ten.)
B005HSL626|5.0|awesome game the best app ever everyone don't listen to those mean coments listen to the nice comets because it is a awesome game.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This program is excellent. I've been using it on my laptop for a couple of months and loved it on there, to save ideas for speeches, prep work, notes, quotes, and links that I want to remember.  Now I can sync that with my fire and take it everywhere with me, adding things as I go, and it'll sync back to my laptop whenever I'm online.  I think I'll put the book I'm writing for my kids on here, so I can write whenever I'm inspired.  Great app, great program for your pc, too.  Love it.  Works well with kindle fire's touch screen, too.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|If you want a complete Beethoven sonatas set (without #24 and 28) look no further. Great sound quality, great playing by the legendary Gilels.<br /><br />The Eroica Variations fill the gaps however - it's the first time I heard these and they are quite a listening experience!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I have downloaded the youversion app to all of my devices, including my kindle fire! its great to be able to have the Bible with me on the go. thanks youversion!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its honestly so addicting haha. i forget about everything I'm doing when i play this haha. reaallyyyyy love it (:
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Everything I need & more.. The eae of setup. Now I don't have switch inputs on my tv just to do different functions on my pc...
0446547654|5.0|This book was soooooo good until the very last sentence!  I read it in 2 days and it normally takes me a week to read \\"really good books\\"!!!  I loved how this book was written, too.  The characters felt real, the descriptions of places and things made you feel like you were there, and conversations between characters were thoughts I would think in those situations. Definitely one of the BEST books I have read in a long time  =)
030726999X|5.0|Excellent transaction. It didn't take very long to get the book as it was just before Christmas when i got it. The owner did a good job and the book was in great condition. No problems whar so ever!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Give gave it only 4 stars cause the keyboard needs work other than that its a pretty good interface and us pretty smooth
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. .I like the one touch moves and the auto-complete functions.  It is a great. game for all ages. The different cards and backgrounds are great too!
B005HSL626|1.0|normally my small kids can play a free game, BUT the ads are SO many and varied, they end up in some website... I will gladly pay the $.99 to get rid of this PITA!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use a cloud based software system for my business but it requires internet explorer which no messing with browser UAs on my phone was working to fix - the software is apparently just too relient on IE. Anyway, with splashtop, I can now access the actual desktop that I usually use, pull up IE, and do what I need to if I'm on the road or in a pinch. Sorta laggy over 3g since it has to send a command and then wait for a visual feedback, but totally worth it! Excellent app so far! :)
1596432594|5.0|This was a much-appreciated gift!  Apparently it 'hit the spot!' Many thanks for sending this book to me.  It is most satisfactory! - Julia
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great way to pass time most games are fun with a few bad one but that is easy overlooked when looking at the amount of content
0062101897|4.0|Got this book at about 1/2 off by buying on Amazon instead of at a book store.  Retail value is $75, whereas I spent $40 on Amazon.  This is not a bad thing--but the book is MUCH bulkier than I imagined.  The size/shape of the book reminds me of being in college Biology!  After sitting and reading for awhile, I felt like my hands would fall off from holding such a heavy book up for so long.  Also, the pages are super glossy in some parts, so finding the right angle to hold the book and for such a long time makes it a bit disconcerting.  Having said that, this is an absolutely wonderful glimpse into the making of the Harry Potter movies.  Copious notes, pictures and actor interviews make this a thrilling read.  The book has a separate section for each movie, for each character, monsters, quidditch, locations, and so on and so forth.  Also, at over 500 pages, I found it to be a very quick read due to how it enthralls you from the first page.  You just never want to put it down!  I read it from cover to cover over the course of my free time in one weekend.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a comprehensive look into the Harry Potter movies and their creation.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|great concept but with the amount of ads and lack of quality make this app not worth keeping. removed the app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great app if you are looking for some simple yet fun games.  I find myself losing track of time when I play
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This book is amazing, I immediately wanted to read it after hearing a very brief description of it. Once I picked it off the shelf, I was captivated. I reread parts, especially parts about the amazing island. I recommend this book to anyone who loves to get lost in their imagination.  I questioned the reality in this story on every page, the end leaving me with no answers. You are left to come to your own conclusions. Enjoy
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well, I didn't know we had to win the other games. &amp; I think they should add directions to all the games. but overall the games are fun!
014312093X|1.0|I have not been able to figure why this author is considered such a wonderful writer. AS usual he never gets on with the damn story. Boring, boring, and boring.  I cannot call this great reading. Total waste of time. It is the first time I ever just threw a book into the trash bin to be preserved in a landfill. Maybe I am not cool enough to appreciate such drivel and pleasantly so!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it its fun and if u get bored you just play a different game I think everyone should get this for little kids
B0055SWM08|5.0|Only a buck, you won't regret . Just the right level of challenge. I like the way new mechanics are introduced gradually without overwhelming the player.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is great for car rides as there is lots of games. the bad part is you have to unlock most of them and this takes a long time
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The product does what I bought it for. Add protection for the Kindle Fire.  The Fire fits perfectly, snapping into the hardshell back, holding it firmly. Much better than others that have corner straps.  The front flap covers the front of the Fire and the elastic strap adds security to the front flap.  The one thing I'm going to keep an eye on is the durability of the front flap. Appears a bit on the wanting side comparing it to other covers of the same type. May not be an issue. I'll add an update if it becomes an issue.  Over all, I like the product and recommend it for the Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it! It so easy to use. The plans and devotionals are convinient and with reminders I never forget to read the Bible daily!
B0037UUZQY|4.0|I ordered this doll for my daughter's 8th birthday, along with a few other items. But the one thing she wanted most was a Repunzel doll. She was thrilled when she opened it and that's what really mattered!! A good doll for a good price! Mommy is happy too :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|very good time killer. the controls are decent but it would be nice if they explained the controls before you start. the ads are not that bad, and easily skipped.
B000HF6ZR0|3.0|While about 20 minutes into this movie I decided to pause it and read some of the \\"official\\" ratings from film ratings sites like \\"Rotten Tomatoes.\\"  Their rating had it as pretty dismal.  I wanted to see, because after the first 20 minutes I felt the movie was actually pretty good.  Intrigued by the low ratings, I was wondering what was so terrible about it.  So as I continued to watch, a number of things struck me about this film:  1) The acting was actually pretty good.  I'm not a huge Dustin Hoffman fan, but I felt that his acting in this was just as good as any of the other performances I've seen from him.  Liev Schreiber actually gets the best lines with the helium induced vocals in a chamber the main characters entered; followed by a really amusing helium induced refrain from Samuel L. Jackson.  That's about the only humor in the film.  2)  The sets were terrific.  I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.  3)  The special effects were well done.    4)  There was enough suspense to keep me interested.  5)  It has a great cast of big name stars (Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Dustin Hoffman), some well-known supporting stars like Liev Schreiber and Queen Latifah, as well as a minor cameo appearance by Huey Lewis as the helicopter pilot.  So with these elements, what could be wrong with this movie?  Well, for starters, the ending, like in so many science fiction films, does not seem to know where to go.  It was a bit of a letdown.  So the script needed a more intense bang-up ending.  And I guess that's the main problem here; the script.  While the dialogue was not half bad, where the story takes us is rather bland.  I had a sort of \\"been there, done that\\" feeling at times throughout the film.    It had elements of several sci-fi films, which I felt were just copies of scenes I'd seen elsewhere; especially the scene where Jackson swallows a piece of deep-fried squid (which he believes is an onion ring), gags on it, and you immediately expect an alien to emerge from his chest.  I noticed that like in Alien, there was cornbread (in the form of muffins) present in the mess hall.  I'm sure it was intended as a bit of a tease, but what happened next was another let-down.  Another film that comes to mind is 2001, and similarities between the computer Hal and Jerry, the mysterious entity of the Sphere (who communicates through the underwater habitat's computer).  I think we've all had quite enough of computers with personalities as characters in sci-fi movies, so I was a bit bored with that aspect.  Most of the characters who died in this film did not have enough character development to make you care that they died.  Not to be cold in any way, but in order to make this a bit more suspenseful, I would have expected a scene or two more involving these characters so that I'm hoping they don't die.  That's what you want to feel in a film like this.  Either they're such terrible and evil characters that you are not disappointed (or are in-fact happy) that they die; or they have become so likable that you hope they don't.  This film does not deliver with caring for the characters either way.  They are like the red shirts in a Star Trek episode.  You're not supposed to care, and that creates part of the disappointment here.  Queen Latifah's character dies early on, and the most intense acting you get from her besides a few lines at the start when they first arrive at the habitat, is the acting she does when being attacked by an army of squids.  Who would care about that unless they knew something about her?  There's no evil characters in the film (not even Jerry, really); which also minimizes the suspense.  It's like the film tried to bank on star power by giving the 3 main stars most of the screen presence; thus diminishing the excitement factor.  The film also seemed to rush into the premise that the characters were being controlled by their own fears; without an adequate explanation for how that was so.  I don't buy much of the premise behind these sorts of psychological thrillers.  I would rather their fears be real (like in the Alien films) rather than figments of their imaginations.  The only film where I was actually frightened by psychological fear was 1997's Event Horizon.  That film had it's flaws too, but the fear factor in that film was much more intense than here - perhaps because the characters who were killed off were much better developed, and you cared about them.  Event Horizon, like Sphere did poorly at the box office, and I'm not quite certain why.  My guess is that in the late 1990s people had tired of the sci-fi/horror genre altogether after having their fill of such films as Independence Day, The Arrival, Species, Alien: Resurrection, Face/Off, Cube, Jurassic Park: The Lost World, Mimic, and Starship Troopers (all films released the previous few years).  Since then several of these films, including Event Horizon have gained cult followings.  This film does not have all the important elements to make it into the cult-following club.  While good as entertainment, it isn't frightening enough to make you want to say to your friends who haven't seen it, \\"You've got to watch this!\\"  So all-in-all, the film is rather bland.  That's why it earns about 3 stars for me.  While it's not as terrible as most professional reviews assign to it, It's not a film I will go back to and watch more than once.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This gem came and went in a week, banished to some inland empire theater as the only screening house for all of LA. Such a travesty, as this is that rare film that parodies an entire genre without being precious. Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk have perfect chemistry as the hillbilly friends inaugurating their \\"vacation home,\\" only to have their dream home invaded by college kids whose bias towards hillbillies learns towards Deliverance. Hilarity ensues. Much hilarity. Enjoy
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great free app.  It is a perfect Bible, it has all the major versions, it is easy to switch chapters and/or verse, and the included Bible studies are great.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|for a free app it is fun.  controls are not the best that is why I gave it four stars instead of five.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|when I first got this game I wasn't sure about it then I started playing I got better at it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|My friend and I play this constantly and can never put this down! But let me say that the controlles are terrible! There is this one game called tornado hockey which is not even worth playing this is like playing air hockey with no eyes and using only your pinkey finger. but otherwise it is strangely additive. I recommend getting it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app!!!! my brother is always playing the games. even my mom loves it........ never put my kindel fire down now
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This Amazon order came in on time for Christmas! It was a great gift and they really enjoyed receiving this item!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these are fun games even to repeat.  the kids also loved playing the games. makes a very long road trip extremely shorter for them.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I will be very honest.  Having seen this movie a few days ago, it's still very much on my mind, and probably won't leave for a while to come.  There are strong parallels to this story and the old Disney film, Greyfriar's Bobby, but the fact is that while the latter had something of a much happier ending, this one just had me in tears about three times.  My boyfriend was laughing because I couldn't turn off the water works.<br /><br />Richard Gere was the idyllic dog owner whose wife didn't essentially want Hachi after he brought the puppy home, and it was easy to see what made man and dog bond.  It reminded me a lot of the relationship between our favorite of three labs and my brother, both no longer with us by only a matter of months apart (Bucky went first because he was very old and sick).<br /><br />What this movie represents is the undying love and loyalty a dog has for its master--a lot better than most people have for each other--and that's saying something right there.  There is a lot of harsh criticism here about how the dog was just left loose to hang around near the train station and had nobody taking him in.  The daughter and her husband tried, but Hachi would not stay put, and I don't think he would have stayed put if anyone else had tried either.  He was too devoted to the memory and reunion with his master which (I hope this isn't considered a spoiler) he inevitably got.  As one of the characters said to the dog, \\"You have to do what you have to do.\\"  Nobody bothered him, and people didn't exactly neglect him.  He was never discouraged from his mission, and it wouldn't have been right to deny him his choice.<br /><br />The problem with this story is that it shows a dog who spends the rest of his life sadly waiting for something he wasn't going to get in this life, and that was what was so difficult to take.  That poor thing!  I also didn't care for the professor's wife, because it was obvious she was only putting up with Hachi for her husband's sake, and it made me angry that she didn't keep him in honor of his memory.  True, the kids liked and wanted him, but I wanted to slap her one when she moved away without seeming to think about it twice until returning to the town years later to encounter and old Hachi still sitting at the train station.  Maybe she couldn't handle the memories if she'd kept the dog, but I have a hard time swallowing that one.  We tried to keep my brother's other lab, Boomer, for over a year after he died, but he was just too big and energetic for us, and we had the breeder he got him from help us find a very good home for him.  Believe me, it was hard to do, but he's got a family that just loves him, and he's not bored like he was with us.  We called them and asked how he was doing a few times, and I'll always be glad we did the right thing in that way.<br /><br />While the idea of love and loyalty lasting a lifetime is a very romantic gesture, somehow putting a dog in the picture makes it twice as hard a subject to deal with, which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I just don't know if I could watch this again because it was so painful, but at least it taught the grandson a good lesson about love and loyalty, and I like that touch at the end.  If you like movies that are guaranteed to make you cry, this is definitely a good one.  If you love dogs a bit too avidly, you may only want to view this once, because it will definitely get to you and stay with you for a long time to come.she didn't keep him in honor of his memory.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty fun game I guess you could say has a viriety of games to keep the User interested and you can unlock stuff so it doesn't get to boring
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a well made, beautifully presented, fun game (i love spider solitaire) BUT the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of the 5 a game this easy to enjoy is the fact that every time i start a new deal i get an add for another game.
B0034G4P9E|2.0|I can't really believe the reviews on here... am I the only one that actually watches mma? This movie is so unbelievable it kills it. Weight classes are all off and who can actually take 30 direct hits to the face and still fight? Yet to see a good and believable mma movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the variety that it offers. for games.I also. like that they are easy to play one handed as I play them most nights in bed.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love Gods Word! I don't like the big heavy book! Now it all fits nicely on my small and lite kobo vox reader. I also like the many reading plans. Only thing I would change, more options for highlighting. I would like the option to highlight without having to save and label each time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the many times you get rewarded! I have this on nintendo and it is way better on the kindle fire.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|I received the CD within 4 days of the order.  It came in very good condition, like new.  Music was great! totally enjoyed it.

B0062NAX1U|3.0|My wife has been bugging me to watch this for some time, we finally got around to it.  I knew it was going to be a religious movie, and being an atheist, I knew what I was in for.  My wife is a Christian and our friends are all Christian, that being said, the movie is really well done to a point.  It's clean cut, realistic, and there are some downright touching, funny and dramatic moments.  My one problem with this was the overlying, and overly acted, religious portion of the movie.  Growing up in a Christian household, having a Christian wife, and Christian friends who know my personal view on religion, I have never had any conversations with anyone like the overtly religious conversations these characters have, the preachy dialogue is a bit much, not only is it a put off to what could have actually been a much greater movie, but the actors seem to feel it too, almost forcing the unrealistic dialogue, it is like watching an uncomfortable play where the players a all wrong for the parts.  Don't get me wrong, I expected a Christian message within the movie, and have no problem with one being there, it just seems a little over done, I half expected to see the cops knock on a drug dealers house and ask if they have a personal relationship with Christ before making an arrest.  Don't get me wrong, the rest of the acting and dialogue within the movie is entirely believable, there is great potential for these movie makers, but, unless they are doing a movie about a preacher, they should leave the preaching in the pulpit and tell the story without the insanely Christian overtones.  To further make my point, the movie's target audience is Christian, so they are preaching to the choir.  I'm simply saying that if they wanted to reach a non-christian audience, they went about it all wrong.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like using this app for weather. Keeps me informed. rreally like it. Also have it for my blackberry ,z
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great way to pass the time, my son and I are constantly bickering over who's turn it is. I love it, more importantly, he loves it! I see us spending hours unlocking games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has a ton of games that can keep you busy in down time. At the start of each game it gives you instructions yo pass and earn points.
B003X5UFWW|2.0|While IP Man has decent action, it represents its story as true-ish (based on a real story) and it barely reflects the facts of his life.  This movie is pure revisionist propaganda backed and funded by one of the worlds largest governments.  Watch it for the fights and skip on the false drama. IP Man 2 is an even worse film.
0451232577|5.0|Downton Abbey meets World War I and the Russian Revolution in Ken Follett's Fall of Giants.<br /><br />Follett is one of my favourite historical fiction authors - if you enjoy historical fiction, you must read his international bestseller Pillars of the Earth and its sequel, World Without End.<br /><br />Fall of Giants is the first instalment of Follett's Century trilogy, in which he plans to follow the lives of five families over 100 years.<br /><br />There's Lord Fitzherbert and his sister Lady Maud, their housekeeper Ethel Williams and her brother coalminer Billy, German spy Walter von Ulrich, Amercian presidential advisor Gus Dewar and orphaned Russian brothers Grigori and Lev Peshkov.<br /><br />Follett takes us from the homes of the British aristocracy to the coal mines of Wales, from the battlefields of World War I to the frontline of the Russian Revolution, from the corridors of power to hunger on the streets.<br /><br />He covers life, love and politics, giving us an insight into tensions and changing dynamics between the aristocracy and working classes as well as the fight for women's rights.<br /><br />Follett has undertaken meticulous research and attention to detail, giving the reader an insight into everyday life at the time - what people wore, how they spoke and etiquette of the day right down to the type of artillery used in war.<br /><br />Be warned - Fall of Giants is a hefty 850 pages and there is a lot of political manoeuvring and military strategy to keep track of.<br /><br />But Follett creates lovable (and not so likable) characters, sweeping the reader into their life stories as they navigate their way through the horror and politics of war.<br /><br />Click on my profile above to find more of my recommended reads.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played many different versions of this game and this is one of the best.  My only complaint would be that all lines must be filled with a card before a new set can be dealt.  Overall it is awesome.
B004478GN8|5.0|I purchased this for my son. He is always a Lego Fan, He is already 14 turning 15, but he still like play lego and also like to collect them.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is a very fun and addicting game. Its format here works well, and it sticks to its roots. Well done overall!
1440503257|4.0|I bought this for my girlfriend, who is a Harry Potter nut and also works in a high end restaurant.  This cook book has everything in it, and also has a great caption at the top that refers to where in the books the recipe comes from.  A lot of the recipes are interpretations of what may have been implied in the book.  It was obviously stretched pretty far for some of the recipes, as the book only vaguely lists what was eaten at the time.  That doesn't bother me or my girlfriend, but take it as you will.  All in all, a pretty great cookbook.  My only suggestion is to make it a bit larger print, larger overall book, and spiralbound so it can be out on the counter to cook from a bit easier.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app does what I need it to. used it about 3 weeks now on my fire without any issues.
B002RL7VKC|5.0|I bought this for my nephew.  He and his Dad put it together and he was having alot of fun with it.  It made a great Christmas present.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun. I play ot every day and you don't even need wifi probably the best app ever! I love it. and so will you.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Some would be okay, but there were way too many! I tried it but it wasn't for me. The games are pretty simple.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a fun game it is really coocause it has 101 and more gswms cool cool cool cool cool
B0015AARJI|5.0|This device works as advertised for my PS3 but I purchased it for my Android based Droid X. I use it with the SixAxis app and it works flawlessly over bluetooth. Trust me this isn't spam. I now have 2 PS3 controllers(not intentional) and a wireless remote for my phone. The phone has been aching for a wireless remote. Every gaming app doesn't support the use of this controller but that is a developer addtion that must be made as wireless remotes are more sought after in the future...   Great buy!!
0240815807|5.0|I have to concur with most of the other reviews here. This really is a great book chock full of tip, help and mixing ideas! I also have the Roey Izhaki book, Mixing Audio. Both books compliment one another and are both worth having if you can afford it. One other thing, I sent an email to the author with a question and he took the time to send me quite an informative answer a few days later. Amazing!
1423136802|5.0|i was so happy to find these books here on Amazon for such a great price.<br />I read these books though my local library and i wanted to get them for a friend of the family who has a young girl really into books and loves this type.<br />So i got them for Xmas for her and she loved them
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is nice because there are so many did options. The game works deal well on the kindle fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It has a ton of translations. It has definitions to help with understanding. It can even reads to you. It's a great app.
B0063GORYU|4.0|love this game, looks good on my kindle fire. used to play this on an old work Pc, and I was happy to find it as an app!
0756655730|5.0|I'm a nerd -- big science and book guy, and this is my favorite book ever and of course favorite coffee table book.  Great layout/organization, pics, and information on all species types - microscopic, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates throughout history, as well as the extensive section on the prehistoric evolution of man, and the large section on the earth itself (geology and such).  I learn something every time I pick it up.  Huge thumbs up.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|If you are looking to purchase this book and are coming across this review, consider yourself lucky. I'll make this short and sweet. This book stinks.   Let me first say that I am a military guy. 28 years old and very conservative. I like it when an author can mix it up, and I crave a good war story but this book is a joke. The authors writing style reminds me of something that of a 6 grader with a basic understanding of the English language would write just to finish a paper the morning before it was due.   The stories are there, but I only say that because I found myself drifting off, using my imagination to fill in most of the details that were completely absent. If you still are thinking of this book I'll just cap off my review by saying this. If you were a friend of mine, I would insist that you read a couple chapters just to get a sense of how badly this book was written so we could talk and laugh about it afterward.   There are a million books about the seals out there and I know this one is tempting because it's modern, and the guy has more confirmed kills than anyone else, but trust me, reading this book is more of an exercise in patience than a light reading of pleasure. I you still decide to buy it, don't say I didn't tell you so.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app it is just like playing in Las Vegas.  I look forward to downloading more of their apps.
0307949486|2.0|Spoilers!<br />1/9/12: I feel I should edit my review, because this book has lingered in my mind more than I expected. For all its flaws, there is something about the characters and mood that sticks with me. Also, now that I've read more about how the book came to be published, it seems slightly unfair to come down too hard on the author. It is a first novel and it seems Larsson never had the chance to hone and polish it with the guidance of an experienced editor.<br /><br />Perhaps the book would have worked better if the author had ditched the entire Wennerstrom plot. I couldn't get involved in that at all. However, the mystery plot itself is problematic, peopled with unpleasant characters, has too little suspense (for mystery lovers), and an unsatisfying resolution.<br /><br />The male protagonist, Mikael Blomqvist, is something of a male wish-fulfillment character. As stated above, however, he grew on me in recollection.<br /><br />I believe the best-seller status of this book is down to one thing: Lisbeth Salander, and her story. She begins as a fascinating character, startling but believable. It's disappointing that she later devolves into a fantasy figure who operates outside of the personality constraints originally placed upon her by the author. What's the good of a character who can just magically do whatever the plot requires?<br /><br />The writing is uneven, possibly in part because it's a translation. There were occasional bright spots. I did enjoy the Swedish setting and background. When Blomqvist first set up in the cottage on Hedeby Island, Larsson made me feel the cold of the winter weather. Even the incessant coffee- and sandwich-making didn't bother me, as they set up a kind of rhythm for that part of the book. But overall, I don't get the hype about this series. Maybe you have to read all three books.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I really like this; the information is well-organized and you can find a lot of stuff on a small screen. You can see who is on your subnet and drill down to the services that those machines offer.  I've also got this on my iPhone, it's also free there, and I recommend that one as well. It's nice having one app that you can put on all your devices.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Initially I was apprehensive about even trying this app.  I have never been able to sync anything together.  But I thought what the heck and tried it.  I downloaded the app and before opening it I went to my laptop and downloaded Splashtop Streamer from the internet.  I installed and ran the program.  Then I opened the app on the Kindle Fire and the first thing it said was \\"Found Richards Computer\\"  I tapped on the words and there was my laptop showing on my Kindle Fire.  WOW was I supprised!  I Monkeyed with it for awhile and found that it makes the Kindle Fire work like a pc.  I went to Facebook, played farmtown, slotmania and other games.  Then I wondered if I could pick up the webcam in the Kindle Fire.  I went to my laptop and started the webcam and my goodness I went back to the Kindle and there was live webcam from my laptop showing on the Kindle Fire.  My laptop was in the bedroom and i was in the living room.  I had mom go into the bedroom, and there she was waving at the webcam and I could see her on the Kindle Fire screen!<br />I think the possibilities are going to be limitless for this app!
B001TH16DI|2.0|Nice to have the movies on Blu-Ray, but be warned -- these are old versions of the movies, not the newly released Directors Cuts.  Paramount has gone George Lucas!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is a fun game to pass the time. Kids will definately enjoy it too. it has great graphics as well.
030788743X|5.0|Having been through the 80's as a young man, I was looking forward to this book as a nostalgic appetizer. At first I wasn't too keen on all the videogame references - never enjoyed them, never will - but the book quickly develops into a quest as exciting and enjoyable as The Lord of the Rings. The younger readers (under 40) may not be able to relate as well to the many 80's references but if you're 50ish, you will relish this. Easily the best book I've read this year and as enjoyable as any I've ever read. Looking forward to the movie adaptation.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The app is amazing the only gripe is the kindle fire needs a controller app to use a Pc controller because I play games like Nba 2K11. Still haven't tested it from a far away location yet. Hope it works. All in all great edition to the Fire. Worth it. Remember though a lot of games require windowed mode and a controller.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Adequate on Kindle Fire but could be much better with improvement of card graphics and smoother play.  Also menus are awkward and not intuitive.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|This is a very funny film. A different kind of funny from the first film. But a real side spliter. Theses are a bunch of guys that should never drink anything stronger that water.
B005V20JKI|4.0|this game is absolutely amazing! I think I've spent hours on it! I have 2 reasons for not giving it 5 stars. 1. it is behind on updates please update this Amazon!!!! 2. it lags and freezes up sometimes and I have to take out the battery when it freezes which is annoying because I have an otterbox! but otherwise it is perfect! Samsung fascinate
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This was a gift for my son. My baby boy. Now twenty years old. He loves this film.Has seen it many times in dvd. he wanted it in blue ray.I havent seen him so pleased since he got his first electric train. it is awasome in blue ray
B006JTIZGM|5.0|The Kindle edition for this book is incompatible with a regular Kindle.  You can read it on iPad, but it's just page images so it's really hard to read.  Amazon refunded my money with a push of a button, so no problem there.  Also, the book is excellent.  I have already read the paper based version of this.  If you want to learn GOF patterns, I highly recommend this book.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|Enjoyed this movie very much.  Special effects were really good and love the fight and God scenes.  Love the gold costumes the Gods were wearing, they really stood out in the movie.  One of the best movies I think for 2011.  Can't wait for Blu-ray to come out!
031250926X|5.0|my nephew's daughter loves to look at books. She looks at it over and over again.  This book was one of my favorite books when I was her age. Also my children loved this book when they was young too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are so many mini games! They are fun to play as a time killer. It is also cool how you have to earn in game points to unlock more of the games. Addicting App!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|This dvd is my nephews sons favorite movie. He loves woody and buzz in this movie. He wathes it over and over again.
B005HSG3VK|2.0|If all you are looking for is a light weight cover for you Kindle Fire, this is a fine option.<br />The stand-up feature, however, doesn't deliver.<br />If you can get it to stand at all, it falls if it is slightly bumped or you try to scoot it over.<br />This is pretty irritating if you are going to try and watch movies and videos with your Fire.
1451627289|5.0|I'm a Stephen King fan, as are many of you who bought this book. The concept of going back in time and changing the events that occurred on 11/22/63--the assassination of President John F Kennedy, was enough for me to want to grab this book and read! Somehow, Stephen King truly made the past come alive with characters that we cared so much about. We almost, but not quite, lost sight of the reason why Jake Epping was back in the past. The characters were so fleshed out and fascinating. We were back in the land of ago, and it felt good. It saddened me when the story came to an end.<br /><br />I have always felt that in our last century, John Steinbeck had written the Great American Novel. It was delightful that Stephen King paid homage to John Steinbeck within the pages of this novel. Now, in this century/millennium, I feel that Stephen King has achieved the Great American Novel with 11/22/63.<br /><br />Is there such a thing as an over 800 page, page-turner. YES!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I have only started playing this week so have not used my points to unlock any other games but I am enjoying the first ten.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|AMAZING game it is really a good game, if you have a touch screen get the game, you will not be dissapointed!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I just want to say that i love this movie.It is in my book at the top neck and neck to return of the living dead 1&2 for zom com!!!!third place gose to fido.Shaun of the dead is a must see it reminds me of me and my buddies back in the day you know alot of dude stuff xbox,alot of pubs and even some of us were slackers for some time all in all this movie is a classic gem and a must have for any dvd/movie collector i watch it one or two times a week love it!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful.  It has so many different versions to choose from and I love the way you can bookmarks verses, create notes, color coordinate your notes and bookmarks.  It is so easy to use.  I am completely satisfied with it.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|these movie was a great little story but I think it didn't have chance with the big monry movie, but i  enjoy it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is amazing! I have seen my teacher use it with her iPad and SmartBoard for our lessons so I decided to try it when I saw it free in the Kindle App Store. This is very useful because I sometimes forget to add files to my Dropbox when I'm on the go. It does lag a little visually, but not so much that it disrupts usage. It's like my desktop in a tablet.  Very glad I happened upon such a handy app for free![[ASIN:B004O3YGMC Splashtop Remote Desktop]]
B004O3YGMC|2.0|I only tried the app for a bit, while sitting at my computer. It connected, I could drive around my desktop, launch apps, etc. Seemed to work OK.<br /><br />My first concern was when setting up a security code, it didn't allow me to use a special character (A '?' in this case). This is a bad sign for security. So is the maximum of 20 characters. It means there is a good chance they aren't hashing the password.<br /><br />Also, no where on the site did I see mention of encryption. The support pages I looked at said there was none.<br /><br />This boils down to the fact that if I am on open WiFi (like Starbucks where no password is required) that anyone sniffing the WiFi traffic (trivial to do) can see the password, then log themselves into my machine.<br /><br />That is a bad thing.<br /><br />If you need an app like this, look for anther solution.
030788743X|5.0|Every minute of reading this book feels like the moment you beat Mega Man II. If books were video games, \\"Ready Player One\\" would be Pac-Man- infinite replayability, quarter-gobblingly addictive, and respects those that respect it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think 101 games +16 is a fun game to play. it is also very frustrating when you don't get all the points nesasarry. all in all it is addicting and fun.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game instant classic nothing better than free I totaly recommend this game I wish they had a free version for angry birds Rio, that would be awesome, wicked awesome to sum it up ...  AWESOME!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|works amazing on my kindle fire. if you want to watch/listen to your favorite music artist then this app is for you. plus its free, so what more could you ask for.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|Series two of Downton Abbey is as good as the first. It picks up in Nov of 1916 where series one ended. The entire series concludes in Dec of 1919--and already there is production for series 3, a continuation but in the 1920s. There are plenty of cast members back so it is advisable to watch the first prior to the second, but not mandatory for entertainment. 15 cast back for the entire 2nd series, 12 more back for specific/multiple episodes, and 3 new major characters added.<br />You will be as enthralled as the true series of comparison, the amazing dramatization of Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition). Both are period perfection, a look at British life in the war years, some intense suspense and mystery mixed with bits of serenity and romance. It's the WWI years with all the good and the bad, but the acting and writing make it all seem good somehow, at least from an entertainment point of view.<br /><br />Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess, or Violet to her family and friends, is a show within a show. She is perfection. Watch her face, enjoy her lines and relish the delivery. \\"Snobbery in splendor.\\" Stellar isn't an adequate superlative.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend the full series, even the past series one, and of course I'll be purchasing Series Three as soon as it is available.<br /><br />Episodes do have SUBTITLES available.<br />Episode 1: NOVEMBER 1916;<br />WWII fighting on the front depicted as well as any series.

0385535139|2.0|I absolutely love John Grisham and this one was such a HUGE disappointment.  It still has all his wit and the fact that his other books are page turners made me plow though this one, but it's a snore until the last 100 pages.  What a huge waste of money.  I pre-order all his books and pay full price for them and I can't wait to read them.  I never in a million years expected to read such a boring book by one of my favorite authors.  Sorry, wish it wasn't so.....
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|Love the game but now it does not work on the nexus it does not seem they are going to address the issue
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Today's free app from Amazon pays for the Kindle Fire purchase all by itself, in my opinion.  I now have remote access to my PC on my Fire with any wi-fi connection.  I literally have my PC at my fingertips!  How incredibly awesome is that?  I would rate this app 6 stars if I could!
B006NXIO7O|4.0|The reason why her father was killed could have been explained much better giving you some more buy in.  Also some people complain about lack of character development which is fine but if you go in expecting an action flick you'll be very happy.  This movie was actually better than I anticipated.  The pacing was good and very little over the top scenes.  I'd like to see a spin off with this character.  Zoe was fun to watch.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|why pay when teamviewer is free and does this and more? 5 dollars for an apparently like this seems like a rip off.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Bible reminds me each day so I don't forget. There are a lot of different plans to choose from. I am very happy with this app.
B004GCK6XO|4.0|It's great to finally have this movie on Blu-ray, although it cries out for the special features found on the so-called \\"ULTIMATE EDITION\\" DVD, mainly the fascinating 9 1/2 minute behind the scenes interviews with the cast and director -- I particularly like it when Brad Pitt, looking like he came directly from the set of \\"Fight Club,\\" describes director Martin Brest as a conductor conducting a symphony.  But this Blu-ray release has no special features whatsoever, which is frustrating, especially the lack of an audio commentary.  Otherwise it's a fairly good HD presentation of the film, noticeably better than either DVD release, although there's more grain in the images than I would like to see.  An annoyance for me is the large menu that pops up in the lower part of the screen whenever you pause the movie, making it impossible to view the entire frame WITHOUT that intrusive and unnecessary menu -- why why why???  But I'm still relieved to finally have this movie in this format, however imperfect it may be.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on every device in my household.  I have tried several different reading plans and translations.  This is my #1 app and I use it very often.  YouVersion is constantly making improvements, and I see this being one app I will never uninstall!  Highly recommended over all other Bible apps.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|Truly a great game. Really fun, reverse tower defends, lots of active stuff not just passive like most td games. So far really stable as well. Highly recommended, 5/5.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has come in handy for me in so many situations. It has amazing features, and doesn't force.close hardly at all anymore. Must have on every device.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far so good.  some games.are a lil cheesy.  over all om though.  my kid loves it, wishing game especially
B005AUWY90|5.0|My husband and I took our 3 year old daughter to see this in theaters and were very happy to find it was just as good as the first cars movie! Full of great humor and a good story line! Equally entertaining for kids and parents! :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not very bad, just not very good either. the games are easy but there are way to many ads. so yeah.....
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app everyday for work and personal notes. It's amazingly quick easy to use. I make notes with photos using my phone, then add tags, etc later at my leisure on my kindle or Pc.  So glad to have this app. Highly recommend.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day, so I'm more than glad to review it. Honestly, I'd buy this for $5 and not think twice. Should be a no-brainer to buy if you're the type of person who is always on the go. The setup was very quick and easy. Just download the Splashtop Streamer program from the internet for your pc/mac and choose a password. The first time I tried to connect from my EVO 3D, it failed. But just trying again was all it took. I played around on my phone while my laptop was next to me. How cool to see it working perfectly. If you missed this today and wonder if it's worth buying, the answer is yes.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|really excellent app, way easier to set up than similar remote desktops I've tried. I'll certainly buy the app for additional devices!
B004N6369Y|4.0|Found this book moving and realistic.  I had a hard time putting it down.   The characters were very real and it had a smooth flow.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app!  It works great on my t mobile G2x.  I highly recommend this app!  it does require that you download an app to your desktop as well, but it is also free and well worth it!
B004O3YGMC|2.0|downloaded this in hopes it would work as a remote for my ubuntu htpc. but it requires installing a windows or mac app on the pc.
B0063IH60K|4.0|kindle fire netflix sucked bad pic quality and now since they updated pretty damn awesome...no audio lagged and good picture...just fix the interface and we got a 5*
B0064T6LV8|3.0|The three pinball games are good, but one game takes essentially two Kindle screens to play, and following the ball can be difficult. I also had some trouble with the flippers: although it says you can press anywhere on the screen - left or right - to activate the flippers, this can get squirrely. And the graphics are not colorful enough to make it easy to see where the ball is. Seems to rely on sound more than sight to give the pinball illusion. Enjoyable, and maybe good that it isn't addictive.
B000AP04OM|4.0|I ordered this DVD to give as a Christmas present to some German friends of mine who had never seen it. They grew up in Dresden and diden't have access to American films until they moved to the West in the late 1990's and had told me that they have always wanted to see The Sound of Music since they were familier with the musical score by Rogers & Hammerstein. They live outside of Munich and have a daughter the age of Liesl and a son the age of Friedrik. I can hardly wait to hear from them by email on what they thought of the film.
1419702238|4.0|I bought this for my son who has enjoyed the first 5 series and the 2 movies.  He hasn't read all of it yet but what he has read, he likes.  It was he who requested this book.  He is a visual person and if you read any of the Diary of the Wimpy Kid books, you can understand why my son likes this type of format.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Coldplay fans rejoice,for this group is still evolving musically!  The underlying sound is still unmistakenly Coldplays but this lastest release has deeper dimension and an ethereal feel that borders on spiritual. These new songs are sparkling,epic and anthem like producing a positive mood elevating affect on the listener.Personally, it's just what I needed to get me through this blase month of January!  My rule of thumb is that truly exceptional music should be movie sound track worthy.  Note to movie producers: This CD is worthy! Feel free to use ANY of these tracks in your next blockbuster because each and every one of them is solid!  In my opinion,there should be no hesitation in adding Mylo Xyloto to your Coldplay collection for you are sure to wear it out just as readily as you did the ones that came before it.I know I will.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|We ordered this set because we really enjoyed the series and wanted to enjoy them again.  Unfortunately, sometimes we miss some lines of  dialogue because there are no subtitles.  The sound isn't bad, but it's often colloquial Brit....  I'm giving it a 4 for the series, but be aware of the downside, too.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|I ordered this movie for my granddaughter and she loves it.  She has watched it many times since Christmas.  Actually, my husband and I enjoyed it too.  Good storyline, adventure, good vs evil etc.
B005VPRETE|5.0|my daughter - who is five - spotted the purple section when we visited our local lego store yesterday. after looking at all the new sets, she chose \\"olivia's tree house.\\" i am thrilled that lego has created a girl-themed product line. i have no complaint about what lego has offered so far, as our son and daughter have enjoyed our many lego sets throughout the years. i just read an article on yahoo that chastises lego for its gender stereotyping. but come on! my son and daughter have a variety of lego sets. the holiday-themed sets that we put together each christmas; the \\"pink\\" starter box. countless DUPLO sets that they have both played with. but she is a girl and she likes \\"girly\\" things too and that includes \\"girly\\" colors AND she is able to tell you the name of all the planets in order and has the space shuttle lego set. creating a \\"girl\\" themed product line in no way forces her into a gender role, limits the possibility of what she can achieve in life nor does it undermine her equality; rather it gives her the option to play with sets that appeal to the girly part of her personality. thanks LEGO!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|it is like running Windows on my tablet.  it is definitely worth the price, and am very happy I got it.
1451627289|5.0|Just finished reading this on my kindle, awesome book with great historical accuracy built in, the afterword notes the few things king changed to fit the storyline. I think this is my new favorite SK book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Getting use to the screens, some screens are slower then others. Overall not a bad game. I may let my kids play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome the kids love all the different games! the games are easy to play and easy to learn. the more you play the more games you unlock.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|I use these when I play online shooters such as Call of Duty, Battlefield, ect.  I cannot imagine going back to using the T.V's sound.  This makes me sound like I am in the game.  I can hear people walking around, where people shoot, and everything.  Buying a high end headset is a must for any gamer that logs in a considerable amount of hours.  On the other hand, they have given me a fair share of problems.  First, you need to buy rechargeable batteries or else you will end up spending a lot on batteries.  I usually change my set once a week or so.  Whenever someone uses a wireless device, it messes up the signal that the stand is producing to the headset.  This creates an unbelievably annoying crackling sound that gives you headaches instantly.  After a few months of use, my headphone jack got messed up some how and I had to hold it in place so I could hear others, and it would prevent them from producing the worst echo you will ever hear on xbox.  I recently bought a new knock off wire because the replacements on the website are around $20.  The product I bought was decent but was not as good as the original.  The echoing kept on continuing until I placed a rubber band to hold it in place.    Overall these are great sounding headphones that provide players with a fair advantage and a whole new style of play.  The cons however make this product almost not worth getting.  I have owned the x11's and they are good, but the sound quality isn't nearly as good (41's have the surround sound).  I cannot judge other brands but if these issues are not a factor with other types I would suggest these.  If both have similar issues, I would stick with these.
B003ZSI9YI|5.0|Phil Collins is one of the best entertainers ever.  I have followed him since he began.  This album puts together an excellent artist with some excellent music - motown.  Love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this but the update erased all my stuff I was peeved..... but I guess its fun and I keep playing it.. my 10 yr old brother likes it too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game rocks. great for mini game lovers. gets boring after a while though. over all is a great game to pass the time
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome I would mostly recommend for kids great as a free game and can unlock new games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so awesome. I can't put it down, it makes we want to never put it down ever.  it's crazy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good if you like a lot of games I like this app because I'm good it it it it it it
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is one of the best running apps of this type I've ever tried. You'll like this one! Give it a try.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|loads of fun for me and my freinds all around I always enjoy getting a new game. I hope they make more
B005DKLPRE|4.0|The Smith's Complete was a gift for my Daughter for Christmas.  Having been a huge fan of the Smith's in the 80s she was thrilled to received the Smith's Complete
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun game with lots of options, would recommend to anyone that likes this type of card game.  easy to learn, easy to play.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game that is hard to stop playing once you start.it can keep you busy tor hours.
0545128285|4.0|I love it when authors construct a whole new world for their characters to inhabit.  They go as far as writing spin-offs to successful series that are still set in the same world.  Even writing guides/encyclopedia and making it feel authentic.  JRR Tolkien exemplifies this beautifully with his invention of Middle-Earth used not only in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, but in everything else he wrote.<br /><br />It looks like JK Rowling is going down the same path.  After ending the hugely successful and much loved Harry Potter series, she released The Tales of Beedle the Bard, a supplement especially to the 7th book.  It is a collection of five short stories for children that tells tales of bravery, wit, tragedy, and survival of wizards and witches.  It even has notes by the late professor Albus Dumbledore at the end of each story.  And I also must mention that this particular edition was \\"translated from the original runes\\" by former Hogwarts student, Hermione Granger.  Haha, see what I mean?  A huge Potter fan will get a major kick out of this.  I know I did.<br /><br />My personal favorite is The Tale of Three Brothers which is narrated in full by Emma Watson in the seventh movie (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallow Part 1) as Hermione Granger.  Dumbledore said in his will that his copy of the book will go to Hermione on the event of his passing.  This story is directly connected to the 7th book for it explains what the \\"deathly hallows\\" are.<br /><br />This book says something about JK Rowling's imagination.  She gave the readers seven books to enjoy.  And then she goes on and releases actual Quidditch Through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, and The Tales of Beedle the Bard.  She is so creative and it makes me appreciate her so much more.<br /><br />Overall, it is an easy read.  I am not sure how non-HP readers will take this but if you loved the seven books in the series, you will definitely love this.<br /><br />Rating: 4/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: Every Harry Potter fan will love this.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|First, it is an absolutely great film.  Second, the color in this rendition is superb.  Great holiday classic.  Every family should own it.
0307949486|5.0|You do not need to read the second and third volumes of Stieg Larsson's bestselling international trilogy. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a complete story with a satisfying ending.<br /><br />What genre does this novel belong to? Before reading it, I was unsure. I supposed it was a high-tech action-suspense-thriller, like the Bourne trilogy. There is some tech: mobile phones and a good amount of laptop computer activity, though that's not HIGH tech. There's some sex and some action, but not a lot of either. As I read it, I learned that this novel most appropriately belongs to the genre of mystery. Its prose reminded me of Rex Stout or Agatha Christie, with background details about the setting and background details about members of a large family, from which the reader tries to identify the killer.<br /><br />What made this book a bestseller? The plot is not the answer. It is hackneyed. An investigator is hired to learn about the events of a murder, question family members, and solve the mystery. The setting is Sweden, a bit refreshing for me, but I'm sure the setting alone did not make this a bestseller. Nor did the unremarkable tech or action. No, what made it a bestseller is the charm of the heroine. As I absorbed myself in THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, my best moments came as I learned about her.<br /><br />I won't go so far as to say that I ADORED her, but I guess my feelings were along that direction. At least for me--though other reviewers don't think so--she was bright, shiny, new, and original. But I don't want to describe WHY she was so. A description would spoil your own moments of discovery, which await your own reading.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|A superb pagan metal band. They glorify our European heritage. Vikings were technologically the most advanced people in terms of building ships and organizing wars for their profit. They had a superior religion. This is why they could dominate Europe for quite some time. Christianity weakened them. Now their posterity is on the brink of disappearance due to low birth rates, mass immigration, and a weak will to win the struggle for survival. Amon Amarth gives some hope that this battle is not completely lost yet.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit I am a Literature major, an Austen fan, and a general book addict. That said, I LOVE this movie! The cinematography is beautiful, and the essence of the book is completely maintained in this particular adaptation. My one critique would be that the accents can be difficult to understand at times (and this comes from a girl who studied in London). Put the captions on the first time you watch it and that should take care of any words you miss when you aren't completely paying attention. Overall great movie that captures the emotion of Austen's classic!
B006IO045S|5.0|This is my favorite Castle episode from season 4. I highly recommend any Castle fan watch it if they haven't already
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So far it seems like a good app with tons of games. Can't beat that for the price of $free. I like that you earn points to open new games. Makes the simpler games more fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really liked the 101 in 1 games. But the only thing I disliked what that there are so many interruptions when you finish a game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it lets you play so many games you cant make yourself get off it is so addicting!!!!!
B0049P1VHS|4.0|My husband and I started watching the series together and he mentioned that he wanted season 1 on disc, so I bought as a gift. We still have not watched it, but really haven't had time. It will bequality time when we do get to watch it. Can't wait.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love this game. cant stop playing it. good game to waste time on it and the kids love it n enjoyed it.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Developers got this game right with simple interface and no spectacular effects ruining the experience.<br />My one issue is that the app crashes to Home EVERYTIME I am about 15 moves from completing. Perhaps that's a feature. 3rd and 4th time I had 0 active applications (1st two times Messaging and Flickr where open but come on those aren't really intensive).<br />Using Samsung Galaxy S 2 Skyrocket
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like having all the versions at hand. Great app for all who travel and don't have room for the book.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|Just a short review to state that sonically, this CD box set is amazing. I own the original Rough Trade releases and this box set is far, far superior. Cymbals are crisp, bass is tight and Morrisseys voice is just right. Thumbs up to Johnny Marr!  Also, fyi, Amazon.co.uk sells this for 30.47 pounds. The VAT tax (approximately 17%) will be deducted for shipments to North America. So final cost is approximately $41 plus shipping. I always scope amazon.co.uk before purchasing as prices are frequently much cheaper, even having to pay for shipping  For about $5 per disc, this is a bargain  Cheers
B000O8OTNC|5.0|The size and weight are comfortable for holding the sharpener in one hand whilst holding a blade in the other.  The carbide blocks brought my abused (and cheap) old pocket knife's blade into order, and the ceramic blocks gave it a usefully sharp new edge.  I'm neither a professional knife user nor an expert knife sharpener - for me, this sharpener is perfect for maintaining my (common quality) knives.  It's more convenient for me than oiling up my old stone.  I've had it only a couple days, so I do not know how long it will last or how well it will function with long-term use.
0307594777|5.0|I loved these books. The first was a little long and took a bit to get into. The second two I could not put down. I knew the Characters and I was sad when I finished the books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|me gusts le app. because its cool you should get no matter what.  I would beg if if I were you.  what posses me off on this game is it takes forever to get points
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome game too many ads after you win, would be nice if you could change background. runs battery down to quick.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|ok first off this app is a virus that almost destroyed my kindle fire amazon NEEDS to delete any and all youtube apps they're all viruses! watch out!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a fun Game.  Love the one touch moveability. multiply play types too.  My daughter likes that you can play winning games each time too.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Fun gamer at the beginning, but solved everything really quickly. This game is really short with no continuation to another game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|So got the game cuz I was bored. Figured it would give me something to do. Why is there no variety in the required score? And the games are kinds sucky too. But then again, I cant deny that i am no longer bored....
0307454541|4.0|This was a good book. You should have a stomach for thrillers if you plan to read this. It's not too graphic, but do not expect a fantasy or romantic novel, even though this book has a bit of everything
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I expected to hear Ella Fitzgerald singing the Cole Porter song \\"I Love Paris\\" in this movie, but since it had been used in the romantic comedy \\"French Kiss\\" starring Meg Ryan and Kevin Klein years ago, he left it out. At any rate, the beauty and charm of the City of Lights would still be hypnotic even if there had been no music.  This time-travel fantasy was enjoyable, though I could see why some people wouldn't think so. The artsy in-jokes thrown in by Allen would fly over the heads of many who weren't familiar with the writings of T. S. Eliot or the paintings of Salvador Dali, among others.   As he has done in other movies, Allen poked fun at pseudo-intellectuals having Paul (Michael Sheen) believing himself to be an \\"expert\\" in just about everything, e.g., art, architecture, wine.   It wasn't the best movie by Woody Allen, but it wasn't the worst either. 3 1/2 Stars
0440244870|4.0|If you're looking for an ultra-deep reflection on life, this book isn't it. It is, however, a light-hearted and fun read. Friendly characters, I enjoyed reading this and will read another Sophie Kinsella book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Nice clear view of screen. Watched Hulu over wifi on my Kindle with no problems. Some connection issues with my Galaxy S over 3g, but with patience I was able to get things done.
0670022950|5.0|This is one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read. It has enormously deepened my understanding of contemporary civilisation, and modern history.<br /><br />The subtitle (The Decline of Violence in History and it's Causes) is a simplification. This book isn't fundamentally about the decline of violence: that's just the thread Pinker uses to tie together his ideas. It's more properly a narrative of how, over time, human societies have become relentlessly more rational, peaceful and civilised.<br /><br />Pinker's core point is that much of the doom and gloom regarding the contemporary world is profoundly misplaced: the idea that the past was good (and the present bad) is inconsistent with the facts to the point of absurdity. The reason for that misperception, as Pinker points out in a typically cutting phrase, is \\"the innumeracy of our journalistic and intellectual culture\\". This age is far more enlightened than any previous one.<br /><br />While that broad narrative should be relatively uncontroversial to anyone familiar with the data regarding human welfare across history, the breadth and scope of what Pinker offers is unlike anything I've seen. From intercommunal violence and state-directed violence, all the way through to homophobia, gender discrimination and racial discrimination, the human world is getting better - rapidly and decisively - by almost every measurable parameter.<br /><br />Pinker attempts to dissect, and offer explanations for, all this, via a mixture of philosophy, evolutionary psychology and narrative history (not to mention masses of data). The breadth of his academic knowledge is remarkable. As the subchapters roll by, he collates and paraphrases information on everything from the statistics of war, to the neuroscience of aggression, to the psychology of nuclear disarmament.<br /><br />For the non-expert (like me) prior background knowledge will go a long way when reading something like this. For example, I found some of the sections on neuroscience hard going. An understanding of evolutionary psychology is probably a prerequisite to properly appreciate `Better Angels'. Professor Pinker is an accomplished and stylish writer, but this is a 700-page tome, and it's not a light read.<br /><br />But you get a lot of bang for your buck. I found myself introduced to new branches of learning (understanding `the moralisation gap' gives one pause for though in respect of every personal relationship one has ever had), and provided with insight after insight regarding today's social and geopolitical realities. From the nature of the American north-south divide, to the Iranian nuclear programme, Professor Pinker has as much to offer as any commentator I've come across.<br /><br />Collectively, it appears, the human race has the option of building an ever brighter and more enlightened world. We'd be mad to work towards anything less. Pinker's insights will have made that happy future ever more likely. I was gripped. A staggering intellectual achievement.<br /><br />Peter Baker<br />[[ASIN:1906316856 Jolly Pilgrim]]olutionary psychology is probably a prerequisite to properly appreciate `Better Angels'.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a blast there are so many game. its a blast. it is such a good idea to download this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|sends push notifications even when not playing the apps this is unacceptable. it is not enough that there is an ad on every game and that they give you a pop up every so many games. ads I don't mind and fully understand but this is too much.
B0028R3NCU|3.0|I've had 2 of these.  They are absolutely wonderful until they quit working.  I started getting \\"USB device not recognized\\" errors after a few months on the first one I bought, so I sent it back to Kingston and they replaced it.  Now less than a year later, the replacement reader is doing the same thing.  It's a hard error once it fails; it's not an intermittent thing, and it fails on all computers even with different operating systems.  The microSD card is fine if I take it out and put it in a different reader.  It's handy enough I might buy another one... haven't decided yet.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is really good, if you're really bored. but the ads get annoying, otherwise its cool, and there are multiple games on it.

B0041KOVUU|3.0|I'm 25 and have been a fan of the Pumpkins since I was 10. This means that although I have loved the Smashing Pumpkins for the majority of my life, there are still many people who have been fans for longer.  From what I can say, the price I paid (~$17) for this EP is worth its weight in album art.... the box is great, the CD is good, and the record is absolutely beautiful. The music is already free, so listen to it and decide for yourself whether it is worth the cost. Personally, \\"The Fellowship\\" sucked, but the other tracks were pretty good. The vinyl-only B-side is streamable on youtube and will probably be so in the future... and it's really not worth the purchase.  A lot of people say it is for the \\"hardcore fan\\"... but really, no pressure. I have a bit of a pumpkins collection (albums, EPs, compilations), but i don't consider myself a collector. The art is nice, but I really don't think Billy Corgan was all that involved in the design.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I am changing my review. I think this apps stinks. I did not know that once you run out of coins you have to buy more. What's up with that?
B0054JZC6E|2.0|i like this app but the size of the apps diplay is to large for my screen. it makes the games hard to play because i cant see everything. the ads also cover some of the games display to. im using an 8in tablet so idk what the problem is. its not like im using a small phone.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I don't hate the game but I don't care for it that much. There is some fun games but still a waste of time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game was fun and sometimes challenging. it is a great game that's free. I am glad I downloaded. it.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Just loved this series; never  boring; continued character and plot development. Read all three volumes with each one read in 2 sessions. I just couldn't put it down. I will always look out for another book by suzanne collins. Great storyteller. Wild imagination.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent solitaire game.  Only thing I don't like is the ads after each game but you can easily skip them.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing solitaire but this one is too easy to win. Win almost every hand. Though I to like the replay this hand feature.  That allows good evaluation of each play n how it affects final outcome.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It is awesome. Everyone should download it for free. I paid $19.99 three months ago for web os. The only thing better would be if it had wake on lan.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Really impressed with this app......works well with my kindle fire, a little slow but works as intended. A must download!
B000KIPT30|1.0|Too noisy to use in a studio environment.  Sounds like your music with static.  No likee.  Get a better one.
1400069181|4.0|Blake Mycoskie's, Start Something That Matters, tears down the walls of doubt and uncertainty that once kept my creativity below the surface. As Mycoskie relives the creation of TOMS Shoes through each page, one cannot help but develop a sense of motivation and fearlessness to take on any challenge or newly conceived idea. Through real life testimonies and heart-tugging dialogue, Blake Mycoskie gives any unmotivated individual the tools they need to break the veneer, and start something that matters.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good time waster and its free how can you beat that its a little repetitive but again what can you expect for free
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. it is is just pure genius I will probably never get another app again it works perfect with the kindle fire
B005D0RDKW|5.0|This is by far the best Rush/Rash concert of all time. The beginning video bit is worth the price of the bluray. Great quality sound and video.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I was at the Planet of the Apes 1968 showing in NYC at the Capital theater and I can still remember the enthusiasm it generated. I became a fan instantly and have been waiting over 40 years to get a new Apes picture that even Arthur P. Jacobs would be proud of..and we got it. Rise has all the elements of an Apes film and coupled with todays technology is a wonder to behold. The film gets better after every viewing. Their is to be atleast two more Apes pictures in the future and I believe Fox is going for a 2014 release though I heard if something of a miraculous script happens it could show up in 2013. Anyway, a great film and a great performance by Andy Serkis as Caesar. Make sure you wait till the end credits are about a minute through or you might miss the great \\"real\\" ending. Take care, John M.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Followed instructions and the web page didn't load. Now I know why its free. Not worth down loading on kindle.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its alright. yes lots of games but the controls can be kind of difficult even tho the game is fairly simple.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great stats and settings for this game, tells you your winning percent and other important stats about your playing.  you can reset them too.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app is great for a student like me now Im not out of luck if I forget a paper at home works great on my kindle fire
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I just wanted the movies and I am very satisfied with this purchase. There are no special features but there are not supposed to be. The title screens are cool though and are a nicely edited loop instead of just a picture. I didn't expect that but it really makes the DVDs seem polished. The packaging is somewhat nice but is very simple. If you are a die hard fan this collection isn't for you. But if you just wanted the movies like I did then it is absolutely perfect.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a hard but addictive game.i love it.there is a lot of addvetisements but not that many and you can skip them
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Wow... About time amazon got a must-have, good FAOTD! this has lots of cool features. Wish there was a way to remotely turn on the laptop at home. App works great tho, only trouble I've had is I had a little trouble connecting over 3g, but I think it's crappy verzion wireless service and not an app problem.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|se las recomiendo muy buena tiene varias versiones, no es dificil. de usar, Cristo es el salvador del mundo vajala. esta. buena
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is what it is...a bunch of games designed to be time wasters ....it does state in the description that you start with 10 games and earn points to unlock the rest....that's part of the challenge so not sure why people are giving bad reviews for that....I really liked some games and didn't like others so I just play the ones I like to earn the points to unlock the rest....was definitely worth downloading as even my daughters had fun playing some of the games!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad for a free app. misleading that it says 101 games, when u only get a few games and have to &quot;unlock&quot; the rest. overall, it is OK
B0029LHWFO|1.0|I went into this with an open mind.  The result was not pretty:  In this book, Obama vows to embrace his black half and denounce his white half.  That is unquestionably racist and contradicts his promise to be the \\"Great Unifier.\\"  That was profoundly upsetting, yet wonderfully revealing.  More people should read this book.  They wouldn't be so enamored of His Majesty.  It was also disturbing to learn that his exalted father, whom he admires and adores, lost his legs driving drunk and subsequently died driving drunk.  Daddy Obama also fathered eight children with four women and at one point was married to three of them at the same time.  He abandoned Barrack.  Mommy and her parents raised the future president.  Perhaps Obama should re-think that race preference thing.  And there's sooo much more.  This book tells you what Obama really is... in his own words.  Read it and weep for the country.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not an amazing game and controls are a bit sluggish, but overall a good app and I find myself playing for quite some time.
0307455874|1.0|Good lord what an arrogant self-absorbed narcissist.  I gave this a fair shot and can't believe what I read.  I suggest you read this book simply to \\"know-your-enemy.\\"  And get it from the library.  Don't give this worm another penny.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Very simple: SSL.  It's 2012 and the security risks are too great to NOT encrypt your traffic.  5 stars once they implement SSL.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its tons of fun and I really like to play.  lots of different games, there is something for every person out there in the world
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a simple yet fun basic solitaire app. It has a high replay value for game after game of solitaire goodness.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This item arrived quickly and undamaged in new packaging. The movie was all I expected and I will watch it again. I enjoy historical dramas.  Thanks
B004O3YGMC|5.0|How nice is it to plug the desktop into the TV and play Puzzle Quest 2, controlled by trackpad on Android, from the couch? Pretty sweet, I must say. Totally worth the price. Even better if you got it on Amazon today. ;-)
0446547654|4.0|Amanda Collins and Dawson Cole fell deeply in love as teenagers, but they came from such different backgrounds their love didn't have a chance. Amanda was the daughter of one of the most prominent families in the small town of Oriental, North Carolina, while Dawson was a member of the notorious Cole clan, which the townspeople feared and tried to stay clear of. Feelng their love couldn't survive under the circumstances, Dawson gave Amanda up and their lives took extremely divergent paths. Amanda went to college, married, and had three children, while Dawson spent four years in prison for an auto accident in which a local doctor was killed, and then he went to work on an oil rig in Louisiana. But the young lovers never really forgot the past. So 25 years later when their mentor, Tuck Hostetler, who had befriended them when they were kids, dies, they return to Oriental for his funeral. And suddenly when they see each other all the old passion returns, and they realize they've never stopped loving each other. Tuck had left letters for each of them and as they carry out his instructions on one unforgettable week-end, they discover truths about themselves they never suspected and wondered if love can survive against impossible odds.
B005GVF95O|5.0|My three-year-old son absolutely loves this app!  He enjoys putting puzzles together, and while it took him a little while to get use to using the touch screen, he does great with it.  I highly recommend this app for any busy mom looking for something to keep a little one busy when needed!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this app because it actually does what it says and does it very well!  I am remoting in to all three of my home computers.  Very easy to setup and use!  Get this app you will not be disappointed!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its.fun and I'm doing this.for.25000000 point gril8 sand dy dhfh well guess what choliken.butt. for fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app for all of those little games that help you pass the time. as long as you aren't looking for a Ps or xbox game on your phone or tablet this is great. very responsive and easy. to figure out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game was a great deal! I love it but the instructions don't really tell u how to play. over all id say I enjoyed this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a nice and simple collection of games. it plays like those mini game collection you would find on a nintendo DS.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|App has many many games that are really fun and have great replay value. Use points to unlock further and harder games, overall great app. I reccomend this app to everyone!
B0063IH60K|4.0|a very nice simple solitaire app.  works great without problems.  would like it tell me when there are no moves left.  also be cool to.be able to change card fronts and backs to customize a bit.
0767817664|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch. It suppose to be scary. But I don't see it like that. I see it more of a fun comedy. This is a great movie for all ages.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|it works great at home can't wait to try it from a distance. it was super easy to set up and works with multiple monitor outputs
B0015DROBO|3.0|I checked this out on my Kindle via my local library (thank you Amazon for finally coming through with that!).<br /><br />Wasn't sure what to expect. Didn't want to spend money on it if it wasn't any good, and I have high standards when it comes to mysteries. First, the author can't cheat and introduce the culprit in the last act. Similarly, they can't give the protagonist clues that the reader isn't privy too. And finally, they shouldn't be too easy to figure out. Only one has followed all of those rules and stumped me, and that was Scott Turow's debut novel \\"Presumed Innocent\\". Too bad none of his subsequent novels have lived up to that!<br /><br />I was also a little leery of buying this because I had heard the author was an avowed communist and I certainly didn't want to pay for something that would be supporting a communist agenda. Thankfully, at least at a superficial level, I don't see any evidence that that is the case even though the culprit is wealthy (no, that doesn't give anything away) and the book certainly makes a lot of mileage about mistreatment of disabled/mentally troubled people by the Swedish government/culture.<br /><br />Mr. Larsson did meet the first two of my standards. But he failed on the last one; before I was 1/3 of the way through the book I knew who had done it. Did I keep reading? Yes, I did. It is certainly a deep, dark, disturbing story at times. Particularly the back story for Lisbeth. It is well written and well paced. It was rarely dull. Will I now buy it? No, I've no desire to read it again. But I will check out the sequel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app its amazing I love all the games and the excitement of playing it!! I fully say you should get this app. its even free!!! free is way better then buying! :) I hope you get this app!! please do! and when u do rate it and write a great review!! have a great day don't forget to get the app!!! lol. :D
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a great game. fun and cures boredom. download it and give it a shot. you'll love it if you like the card game :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|What I like about this game is that it gives brief, but informational descriptions along with simple gameplay. Really fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is fun when you're bored. I'd give it five stars if not for the annoying ads. but they have to make money so..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so hard but a lot of fun I hope you make another like it or even better. awesome
B0037VNX44|1.0|I made it about 1 hour before I had to turn this off. I found the title character to be so unlikeable.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I thought that this game was going to be fun because there were so many games. It is actually not fun.  I have no idea how to play any of the games because there is no instructions on how to play them so it is kind of hard to unlock any of the other games without any instructions.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|great app does as stated, quick too. easy set up. would recommend. Easy to access my computer from my fire no problem
B005HSL626|1.0|I will play it a few times then all of a sudden it freezes then goes to my main page. I re-downloaded it and it still happened. I love the game but this is making me mad.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Installed this app on my G2x and on a mac and PC computer. connecting to both worked flawlessly. A little concerned about the security of the connection to the desktop(s), however. Don't know if I *need* this app, but nice to know I can access my computers anywhere.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A fun way to waste some time or keep someone busy for awhile. Some games are so easy its frustrating, but a nice variety.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great! yeah u have to unlock the games but.they give away free points all the time!  get it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome game to play with some free time the ads aren't that bad or intrusive either I'm so very cool (20 word minimum)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Although I really enjoyed these games, they are a little hard to finish. Plus I couldn't find the instructions sheet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun with enough options. There are ads but they are not a bother and are pretty applicable. Very easy to use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you only start with 10 games and then you have to unlock the rest. However there aren't any instructions for the games so you have to figure out the controls yourself.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Last night my hubby and I watched In Time starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried.  I loved the previews and the plot was unlike anything I had ever seen or heard of before.  After the first five minutes I was completely captivated by the star-studded cast and intriguing plot.  I really enjoyed In Time and definitely recommend seeing it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a copy of this movie for review purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really liked this app. It is great for kids. fun, fun,fun. get this app now. it is very interesting.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|My daughter asked for this for Christmas. I listened to it in my car and really enjoyed it! A good CD!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Installation was trouble free, works very nicely with all my computers. I am using it on my Kindle fire to monitor my on line backup. Great job!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|simple games to kill the time. controls are not great, but it is free. thanks for the fun. go hockey.
0061537969|5.0|In The Art of Racing in the Rain Garth Stein cleverly draws philosophical analogies between car racing and life. This is none amazingly well, particularly since the narrator of the book is a Golden Retriever named Enzo. It's a delightful read.
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|I enjoy the literature that came out of Paris in the 20's. I enjoy the idea of Paris although I've never been there. I did not like this movie. It was typical Wood Allen. The main characters just argue their way through the movie. Boring! The characters from the 20's were dealt with in cliches. The Hemingway character was over blown. The Owen Wilson character loves his girl friend, but then jumps to a girl from the past then switches to yet another woman at the end and this is supposed to be romance? Dull and contrived. A few laughs, but very few. I give a star for the beautiful photography of Paris and one for the great music.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I've been waiting for weeks to read this book.  You see, I tend to read books once.  So, given that I wind-up-with nothing tangible to lend/re-read/etc, I'm unwilling to pay a fifteen dollar \\"rental fee.\\"  It's too high.  So, I placed a hold on the local library book.  I simply refuse to pay that much for an eBook.  If you buy this, you support these outrageous prices (the hardcover is less than 10% more).
B005QI4TP8|5.0|This is the most spectacular, epic sounding record of 2011. Florence + The Machine takes it to a whole new level mixing alternative, soul, some indie pop and the unmistakable powerful voice of the British goddess Florence Welch.  Recorded at Abbey Road Studios, with an excellent sounding quality, this album deserves the top spot on your shelf. From the quiet sweet whispers in Breaking Down, to the raw percussion in Heartlines, this is a must have record. Trust me, you won't regret it at all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game will always keep you entertained and you will never be bord and it has 100s of games so have fun
B005UDD1R6|3.0|AVia was easy to install and has a nice UI.  It found all the music, video, and picture files on my Windows 7 PC, and offered options to see them in an &quot;all&quot; view (good for music) or as they're organized on the machine (folders).  It can basically see anything Windows Media Player can see (read:  not your protected iTunes files), which is great.  However, it could not play most of the videos, which has more to do with Android than the app (the app is a conduit, your device actually has to support the file type).  It did not locate my DLNA TV, though, as similar apps did...hence the average rating, as I wanted an app that could &quot;talk&quot; to the TV.  Overall, a good app, just not the one for my purposes.
B004W4N55C|5.0|I love this app, but have sight issues and can't use while trying to play straight through a song without having to stop and figure out what's written and scroll some. Please make it available for kindle fire. I would happily give you 5 stars then.
B00656C6KK|4.0|This album is beautifully done.  It was done in honor of Doris Day's son who died in 2004.  He sings one song on the album and it is beautiful. Brought tears to my eyes.
B004I9CXHW|1.0|The heading sums it up... showing close-up photos of the connection points would greatly assist products from being returned. Neither end fit, even on my ipod classic which I thought would have been a universal connector.
B005V1WZ10|1.0|Finally, Korn has squeezed every last drop out of their sound from the music.  Why do they need drums, a guitar and bass? All Korn needs now is JD and a computer and BAM!  A new Korn CD.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|I definitely like the look and user interface of this more than astrid. But even the free version of astrid has an feature to add a task to your calendar as well. This one doesn't seem to. Hmph, there's always one thing missing isn't there....
0307279189|5.0|Received as promised and in the condition expected.  Received as promised and in the condition expected.  Received as promised and in the condition expected.
0385338910|5.0|This book was excellent. It is filled with angst, laughter and a surprisingly sharp sense of humor that has you laughing out loud. You fall in love with the characters and strive to see them succeed in their own ventures. I loved this book and will be reading it again!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's an okay game but some of the games are hard to control on the kindle fire. like the serpent game. Good  time waster and makes time pass very quickly. like it. I would recommend it to others who are looking for a time waster.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this so much that. I am not alspeel and it is ina school day and its 12:39 that is how addictive it is
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of mini games, most of which are challenging but not so much that you get frustrated.  great for a free download.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game will keep you thoroughly engaged.  The lack of a timer allows you time to contemplate your strategy at your own pace and the refresh button enables you to return time and again without penalty.  There is no score, only the number of the perfect,  most efficient moves is given.  You will gain access to the next level as you solve the current puzzle whether it takes you 100 or 4 moves to complete.  Stumped?  No worries, hints are offered through facebook or in the game itself.  Perfect for the Kindle Fire!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is so fricken handy!  I don't know what I did before I had it.  Don't second guess getting it, just do it, you won't regret it!
B00005JMJG|5.0|This might just be my favorite movie of all time.  Perhaps tied with Royal Tenenbaums.  Definately off-beat and quirky, this is the love story of two imperfect, slightly damaged people who somehow find each other, lose each other and then are inexplicably drawn back together despite great odds.  It takes a totally different road to get to the teary moments than any other romantic movie you'll see.  Creative plot and great acting.  It made me completely fall in love with Jim Carey.  Definately a must see at least once.  For me it was a \\"must buy\\".
0061733199|5.0|Great book.  I think it's the best of all the survival books and it can be carried with you conveniently.  Very detailed explanations and it also has good illustrations.  I keep up with the new editions and I think that they do a good job not allowing themselves to become dated.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|What an amazing app! I use it with my windows 7 laptop with the free Splashtop streamer program installed on the laptop and it works perfectly. Thanks Devs, I love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|extremely fun games. all the games are fun in their own way. haven't come across any problems yet. would definitely recommend to others!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great remote desktop client!!!! I hope the key board feature gets up dated, it doesn't play nice with swype. Also encryption would be great! Over all fantastic app!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I just loaded this and it was easy and works like a charm in my Kindle Fire. I love being able to print from my Fire. I give it an easy 5 stars
B00634GHJA|4.0|I like the functionality of this app. It's great at sharing between mobile devices, it just needs an easier way to share to PC.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Just a fun game that passes time.  some of the games get pretty challenging but other than that it is a great game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|grreat because it has lots of games hard game but easy. after you learn how to play you should. download this game
B00005JM4Z|4.0|Great product, got just what I wanted. The cover was in good condition and there were no scratches on the actual cd.
0439023513|5.0|Well, this book really did make the trilogy. This book is about Katniss being in the war and how she is the Mockingjay. It shows the true brutality of war, and she finally decides... Peeta or Gale?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a lot of fun. with a lot of options. not over challenging at all. def a game to download. easy fun even for kids.
0439023521|5.0|This book left me with true suspense anticipating the rest. A page turner and a really hard book to put down. The plot was well thought and the characters came to life. It was gruesome and bloody which just made it awesomer! ;)
1439170916|5.0|I started reading this book because of my current research on academic entrepreneurship in life sciences, then also because I have some relatives and many friends with cancer.<br /><br />Mukherjee drives a fascinating journey of the reporting, discovery and treatment of cancer. Exquisitely written, the author takes us by the hand from the pharaonic times to few years ago... so much research has been put into this book that it amazes me...<br /><br />It is the type of book that leaves you uplifted, touched and stimulated. One of my best reads last year.
0439023491|5.0|This sequel to the well loved \\"Hunger Games\\" in troduces some scary facts. Snow hates Katniss for \\"rebelling i his sick little games. And the battle over \\"Peeta or Gale\\" gets more intense. Its a great read
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy playing this bundle of games, they are each different and addicting.  I love unlocking the new games with my points.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is fun since you have so many different games to play. Once you beat a game you can move onto the next.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is pretty fun but doesn't tell you what to do al I don't know how to play some of the games
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very good and easy to use.  Simple to navigate. I am thinking to use it instead of Logmein.  I highly recommend it.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I liked this cover for my kindle as soon as I received it. It fits beautifully and it's a nice design. However, I don't think it's worth $29.99, but it's a lot better than what is out there.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I had this up and going in less then 5 minutes. works ok on 3g, WiFi is spot on. A large tablet would make this the best.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is simple but entertaining, and also challenging.  Its by far my favorite. I go to sleep thinking about raindrops.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|extremely easy to setup, video/playback is very excellent and sound plays back thru device. with limited storage on my fire, I can watch full screen with audio 720dpi anywhere from my home network. amazing app!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Super easy to setup and use. No problems whatsoever.  It did rearrange the icons on my desktop, but that was understandable since I use a huge monitor on my desktop. I highly recommend this program.
B005GT3XGS|5.0|With a high quality HDTV with good black-rendition, the quality improvement delivered by a Blu-Ray DVD is noticeable. Otherwise, the normal edition is sufficient.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is great and very easy to use. find that i am doing my daily readings and love it
B0054JZC6E|3.0|but I wish it had a wider variety of games at the basic level.  I didn't like some of the things I had to play to unlock better content.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I like this app - it's able to connect through my work firewall without the need to vpn. However, it only supports the stock keyboard on my HTC EVO3d - does not work with swift or swype or thumb or even the stock on my NC. Apparently this has been a long standing conplaint that has not been fixed - it is also not even mentioned in the app documentation - seriously, the developer needs to address this issue.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think its a good game. I like the games,I like every game about it I think you should play it to play 101in 1
B0063IH60K|4.0|great app for whiling away the moments; waiting at the docs office, or waiting at the car wash or just about anywhere!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is so addicting! I love it! I especially like the auto complete feature and also the one click moves! it is so helpful especially if I don't see the move(:
B0054JZC6E|5.0|all the games kn hear r really fun :) I like how instead of just one game its 117 in 1 :) I haven't unlocked all the games but the ones j have they r fun lol:)
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|The Cardinals and Yankees are the only 2 teams to win more championships than the A's. The A's have always played second fiddle to the Giants in the Bay Area, thanks to a biased media and bandwagon fans. Until 2010, the Giants didn't win any (in SF)...the A's have won 4 (in Oakland and 9 overall). The A's have been catagorized as a small market team. This movie was a great insight on how the A's must cope with an owner who may or may not have any money (Schott in the movie) and is as cheap as Charlie Finley was (Wolff is this now). The A's have had much more success than the Giants historically, though the Giants pour tons of money into new ballparks and players. This is the beauty of baseball and it is depicted well in this movie as the A's (as the ugly step-sister) have had success regardless of who has owned them. Back in 2002, Beane was doing the right thing as shown here in the movie. Unfortunately, it is as if nowadays he has grown a bit weary and trades players like it's a habit for him; much makes absolutely no sense at all. The movie is an excellent portrayal of Beane at his finest from about 1999-2003...GREAT movie!!!

B005OK722U|3.0|I was a little skeptic about watching this because of all the negative reviews. But I actually liked this movie. It was different from the first two. It could of been much worse. Go watch it for yourself, and don't listen to the negative reviews until you seen it.
0920236162|5.0|It's so wonderful to be a Princess, and it's even more wonderful to learn that you don't necessarily need a Prince to be one -- especially if that Prince amounts to nobody you could ever rely on! This story and illustrations are mega-entertaining and just might stay with the reader for years to come. Your child will want to read this story over and over again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|soooooo funnnnn!!!!!! but the snake and the fish games are hardd! you should get the game.but the soccer is easy.
B0061S073A|4.0|Great a wonderful, except you can't make it come back automatically after reboot.  I bought [[ASIN:B004W7WGPY Autostart]] by Cyberlink to take care of the problem. Autostart is not a free app but is not expensive, and I set it to start Kids Place automatically at reboot.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|According to Amazon and the Splashtop specifications the Samsung Galaxy Prevail is a compatable device...but it is not. It downloads, and begins to install but almost immediately stops the instillation and displays \\"instillation incomplete\\". Stay away if you have an SCH-M828C

B006NXIO7O|4.0|You never know what you will get in a movie about a 90 lb girl kicking around alot of large angry men and not even getting scratched. All in all, this movie was entertaining with good characters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Other than it being slow a few times while I was at church trying to find a scripture the app is great. I recommended it to both my parents.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I thought this would be a good case for the Kindle Fire.  I was very wrong.  I had only had my Kindle Fire for two days and had trouble with it on day three.  My kindle would not turn on.  I followed the trouble shooting for Kindle and was able to get it to restart.  I then put it back in the case and it did it again.  Did the trouble shooting of holding down the on button for 20 seconds for the second time.  Kept my Kindle Fire out of the case and it has been fine since. What was happening was this case was causing my Kindle Fire to over heat.  I do not recommend this product to anyone and think that Amazon should get rid of it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first book in this series, I loved the second book, but I can't get through this one!

B0063IH60K|4.0|great game if you are bored out of your mind or need a nap. it is not for the fast paced person
1250006341|5.0|I put this book on my Christmas Wish List because I am a huge Downton Abbey fan and thought I would like it \\"no matter what\\".  When I opened the gift containing the book and leafed through the pages, I was ecstatic!  It far exceeded my expectations and is, by far, my very favorite gift this year!    The photos are incredibly beautiful and there are loads of them.  Scenes from the series, casual shots on location in-between filming segments, historical photos, etc., etc.  The written content is equally rich and wonderful.  Lots of interviews with the cast, much information about the house (Highclere Castle), and very interesting sections discussing British history, culture, politics, and so on.    My only caution is that includes a lot of information and photos from Season 2.  So...if you haven't watched all of Season 2 and the Christmas Special, and don't want to spoil the suspense of watching them, get the book but don't peek until you've watched all of those episodes.   Other than that....if your a Downton fan, you will LOVE this book!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Before, during, and after every tiny, hard to control, and altogether unenjoyable game is an ad. One second you're trying to guide a bubble--that you can't see due to it being UNDER you finger--the next second, you're inadvertently signing up for a discover card, or being tricked into spending REAL money for these &quot;FREE&quot; games. No thank you.
B0001932ZA|4.0|This is an old movie.  I still like it and the plot is good.  The picture is not like the new movies of today but still the picture was okay.  I recommend this movie and it does have alot of action.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is the best thing ever espeshaly science that it is free today its even better I play world of warcraft with it and listen to my I tunes when I am not near my computer I love it thanks
B00005JMCN|4.0|This is another movie based on a true story.  I really enjoy movies which are based on true stories.  Accordingly, I thought this was an outstanding movie with a great plot.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is not bad. there are a lot of fun games. the only problem is the time it takes to get the games
B005CMSDLE|4.0|I bought this movie because I thought it was more.  The movie is average at best.  I like the action but a little slow for me.  It does have a plot but I thought it was weak; not real weak, but weak.  I'm going to leave it up to you as far as recommending.  I bought it but it wasn't the best.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works well in all versions whether reading, search or spoken word. I am most pleased in using it. I have one suggestion, allow for the reading of the Bible plan to only pertain to just that section instead of the entire chapter . I don't mind listening to everything but other would make a great app excellent . Thank you for contributing to the enrichment of my life.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|This movie was returned because it would stop in the little.  I received my money back and have never gotten another movie in return.  I always hate when you receive a bad movie.  In this case I got my money back.  However, I can say in another instance, I was not so fortunate.  As you now know, I don't buy from that vendor any longer.  Idon't know what to tell you on this one.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works well and is easy to get up and running, which was a very pleasant surprise. I installed this on a Kindle Fire and my home Win 7 PC, and was able to access without difficulty remotely. This works so well that I will be installing it on my mother's PC since it will make walking her through applications much easier than the guess method I use now.<br /><br />Works like it should!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B00005S6K8|3.0|I bought this movie for my daughter.  She enjoys it and watches it often.  I would recommend this movie.  Its a good clean movie for the family to enjoy.

B003UESJHO|4.0|This is a good movie with a plot.  Actually, this movie is based on a true story.  I liked it and the acting.  I would recommend this movie as part of your collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a handy app to pass the time. Very basic games that keep you interested and entertained for hours.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Are you kididng me.  This is a funny and crazy movie which I enjoyed.  I think it has a good plot and these guys are just stupid when they're drunk.  I recommend this movie; I think you will enjoy it.
1452101248|5.0|Oh my, these recipes are pure deliciousness. They are all vegetarian, but the majority of the recipes call for cheese or eggs. The flavor combinations are fresh, healthy and inventive, and appeal to both eye and palate. The book is beautifully illustrated too, so you don't need to guess what it should look like.<br /><br />There is a strong Mediterranean/Mid-Eastern influence, seen in the exuberant use of fresh herbs, garlic and olive oil, alongside an urbane sophistication seen in recipes like Potato Tarte Tatin or Mushroom Ragout with poached duck egg.<br /><br />The ingredients list tends to be longer than you might be used to, but since these dishes would probably be the main course, you don't mind investing the extra effort - especially since the result will be gourmet quality. It's no wonder Ottolenghi's London restaurant has been such a success.<br /><br />Another nice aspect is that Ottolenghi gives you his recipe, but then suggests ways you can change and personalize it to your own taste. This is a great addition to any cookbook library, and makes for inspirational bedtime reading for any foodie.
6304806418|4.0|My daughter loves this movie.  I bought it for her and she enjoys the music and the plot.  I would recommend the movie because my daughter enjoys it so much.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|games are hard to control and there doesn't seem to be a point?  This game is like one of them deals where you get a 500 dollar gift card if you just sign up for 300 things.  about every 5th round you get an &quot;opportunity&quot; to download something to get points for something and I couldn't take it.  DELETE!
B004A8ZX28|3.0|I bought this movie because i like action.  It not one of the better movies done by Liam Nelson but its okay.  Actually, he has done better.  I won't recommend this movie; its up to you.  I'm just saying its okay and not great; its average.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|One of Joss Whedon's best works.  If you love musicals and Neil Patrick Harris and comedy, then this will be something that you will enjoy.
B002VWNID6|1.0|I bought this movie with high hopes.  This movie was a disappointment.  The picture is terrible.  It not only looks old; its old.  the picture looks like it came from 1973; I don't know when color TV came out; but this picture is a joke.  Don't buy this movie; its a waste of your hard earned money.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|Prefer much more the older version, which is much more entertaining.  This version is too violent and hard to follow, but I'm glad I have now a complete collection of the James Bond films.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a very good movie.  It taught me a lot about actual life in those times.  As a white woman I was appalled to know that these people were treated like that.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|This movie is action packed and has a good plot.  Mark Walberg is a good actor and makes this movie come alive.  I would recommend this movie.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|The item arrived in perfect condition.  The transaction was easy, convenient, and service was efficient.  I've used this seller on other occasions and have never had a problem.  I am completely satisfied and would highly recommend to others. In this case, I chose the seller because of good experience in the past, despite a slightly higher price-- and still a great bargain!

0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick won the Caldecott Medal in 2008. As I'm sure most of you are aware, the Caldecott Medal is awarded annually to the artist of the most distinguished American Picture Book for Children. It's akin to receiving the Newbery Award for children's books, or the Printz Award for young adult.<br /><br />Hugo Cabret was an especially interesting win for the Caldecott, because although it does contain a lot of beautiful illustrations (284 in a 533 pg. book) it's a 533 page novel. The front jacket describes this as a book \\"combining elements of picture book, graphic novel, and film\\" which \\"breaks open the novel form to create an entirely new reading experience.\\"<br /><br />The dust jacket does not lie. Reading this book was unlike anything else I've ever read and it was wonderful. I was hooked from the first page, \\"A Brief Introduction by Professor H. Alcofrisbas\\" to the last page as we visually watch the moon as it disappears from the sky. The illustrations are... beyond brilliant. Designed to look like sketches, they are surprisingly complex and deceptively simple. As I mentioned in my review of American Born Chinese I am increasingly shocked by what you can portray and how much story you can tell with just one picture.<br /><br />The story itself was wonderful. Hugo Cabret is a wonderful character just trying to find his place in life. He is a young boy living alone in the middle of Paris in the 1930s, trying desperately to survive. He has no money, but he feels bad every time he is forced to steal something to survive. He is such a good character. He is so confused and desperately searching for something tangible to bring him hope. I loved the secondary characters as well. Questioning and spunky Isabelle, hurting and bitter old Georges, and loving and protective Jeanne. Each of the characters are incredibly well developed. Even the minor characters are given more depth than we normally see.<br /><br />This book was marvelous. It's definitely one that I am going to want on my own shelf sometime soon. It's beautifully illustrated and wonderfully written. This is a book that can be enjoyed by people of any age, at any stage of their life. I'm enjoyed reading this one so much, that I am definitely looking forward to seeing what else Mr. Selznick has to offer the literary world.t on my own shelf sometime soon.

1451648537|5.0|This without a doubt has to be my favorite book of 2011.  Not only is Steve Jobs a fascinating person but the book is well written and seems to give an accurate portrayal of Jobs.  Unlike many biographies which offer little new substance this one is enthralling ... it was truly a page turner.  Cannot recommend highly enough!
0802136834|4.0|Although I have always enjoyed history and love learning about the past, a lot of non-fiction tends to be very dry and tedious. It is informative and the information itself is interesting, but the delivery often leaves much to be desired. It is always a treat to find an author who can write history and keep it interesting.<br /><br />The Six Wives of Henry VIII by Alison Weir is a wonderful example of that. Ms. Weir delivers a very informative, yet highly entertaining account of Henry the VIII; one of England's most notorious monarchs. Henry's desperation to father a son led to one of the greatest scandals in English history. Before reading this book, I knew the basics about Henry's reign. I knew that he married 6 women and had a reputation for beheading those women who displeased him, his desire to marry Anne Boleyn initiated the break between England and the Catholic church, because the Pope wouldn't grant him a divorce and his two living daughters were both rather famous monarchs in their own right.<br /><br />Because I knew very little actual information about this period of English history, but have always been fascinated by what I heard, I decided to pick up this book and learn a little more about King Henry and his outrageous court. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed reading this book. The book was very well written and flowed from one sequence of events to another very smoothly. Although this was non-fiction, it read more like a novel than the typical dry recitation of historical facts.<br /><br />The first half of the 600+ page book was dedicated to Catherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife and Anne Boleyn, his second. Catherine was married to Henry for 24 years and is the only wife to have been married to Henry for longer than 4 years. During the later years of his marriage to Catherine, Henry's attentions began shifting toward Anne Boleyn, one of the ladies of the court. While it makes sense to devote so much of the book to these two women, the history here did get a little repetitious. I was also a little disappointed because none of the other wives were given as much detail as the first two. Although I did wish for a little more detailed information to be given on the remaining 4 wives, I understand why there was less to say of the others. I mean, Katherine Howard was only 19 when she was married to King Henry, and she was executed after only 2 years of marriage, and Anne of Cleves was married to Henry for less than a year. I did love that interspersed throughout the story of each of these women was the connections to the other women in Henry's life, as well as information about what had happened or what was happening to each of the previous queens. That is something that would have been missing from individual biographies on these six women that I was grateful was included.<br /><br />Overall, this was a book well worth reading. The facts were well researched, the history informative, and the writing engaging. I will definitely be picking up other books by this author in the future.e repetitious.

0312641893|5.0|I was so excited to get this ARC in the mail! I loved the book cover, it grabbed my attention right away.  I would have picked this one up in the book store based on the cover alone.  It was perfect reading during the busy holiday season.  Lite and fast read that was thoroughly entertaining. (One of the many reasons I love the YA genre.)<br /><br />Cinder is based on the Cinderella fairy tale, but with a unique spin.  It's set in a futuristic si-fi type environment in \\"New Beijing\\" of all places!(There is not much of an Asian feel to the book and I do wonder about the author's choice of  this setting.)  The strangest part of all is that Cinder is cast as a cyborg. She has some really cool abilities as a result of being a cyborg.  Even one of her feet is mechanical.  That gives the glass slipper part of the fairy tale a whole new set of problems/possibilities.<br /><br />Cinder has a wonderful \\"R2D2 type\\" of android sidekick with loads of personality. It seemed that personality in an android is considered an undesirable trait by this society and the personality of Cinder's android was considered a programming glitch making the android an outcast worthy of Cinder's company.<br /><br />The defective android is Cinder's only friend until she meets Prince Kai.  That's when the story takes off.  Some of  the plot is predictable, but isn't that what why we love fairy tales in the first place?  This story does have some characters that are cast a bit differently from the original Cinderella tale, so don't expect a  si-fi regurgitation the original story.  The Cinderella tale is just a starting point for the plot.<br /><br />My only criticism of this book is that New Beijing has many rules, laws and concepts that are presented as fact, but not fully explained to the reader.  The idea that cyborgs are considered  to have less rights than humans seemed to be a law that had a big impact on the plot of the story.  This was just presented as a fact. There is potential for some really  thought provoking situations within this story.  I say potential, because none of them were fully examined in this book. The author, Marissa Meyer, does lay the ground work to do so in the future books. I look forward to seeing if the other books in the series will take advantage of this. Did this affect my enjoyment of the book? No.  I really did have fun reading this story!<br /><br />Now I have to admit that I peeked at some of the reviews already out there (and there are A LOT of them) before I wrote this review. It seemed to me that some of the reviewers forgot that this is a YA book. Not that YA is a genre to be discounted or considered less valid than any other genre of books. Just meaning that you need to remember the intended audience here.  It seemed like some reviewers were expecting more from this book.  Even though many adults are reading YA, it is still meant for young adults.<br /><br /> My 15 year old daughter saw this book come in the mail and was begging to read it.  I handed it off to her as soon as I finished reading it.  She loved it and finished it in one day.  It is important to note that my daughter reads, but she has never read a book in one day.  I anticipate that my copy will be passed among all of her friends and coveted by others that are not lucky enough to be her list.  She and her friends ARE the intended audience. I predict that this book (and the others in the series) are going to be considered  a  \\"Must Read \\" among this group, and many of us more mature readers as well!<br /><br />****1/2  ( 4 1/2 out of 5 stars)<br /><br />Thanks to the author and publisher for providing me with an  ARC and the opportunity to read and review this book.n this story.

B00005B4GT|5.0|I own everything Radiohead has ever done... embarassing, but I mean EVERYTHING.  DVD, CD, Vinyl... you name it.  Have travelled across the country to see them.  A bit of an addict, admittedly.  Does that mean my opinion/review is worthless? I don't think so.  Admittedly, I am a musician, and I am jaded. I like things that shock me, rub me the wrong way, fly in the face of convention. But, when I hear Radiohead fans dismiss \\"Amnesiac\\" as noise, I flat out get PISSED.  This is NOT noise, people! There is insane structure and musicality in here, people! If you want music that you can complete absorb and comprehend at first listen, then enjoy this weeks \\"Nickelback\\" album.  Allow yourself three listening sessions, back to back, of this brilliant way ahead of its time album, and you will \\"get it\\".  One of the bands greatest achievements.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I only gave this book two stars.  It is not badly written, but the central premise is profoundly absurd. It involves a fake science(which ends up being a red herring), and the assertion that the CIA would dispatch a hit team inside Washington, DC to prevent some public officials from being embarrassed in the media. While his earlier books were about religious mysteries, this book is about the mysterious Freemasons, and how they have guarded the Ancient Mysteries that grant mankind unspeakable power.  The secret has been carefully hidden in our nation's capital since the days of George Washington, but the masons have a traitor in their midst and their greatest secrets are about to be revealed.  The CIA is called in to stop this \\"national security crisis of unimaginable proportions.\\" Is the world about to end?  Is some terror about to be unleashed on an unsuspecting public?  NO. So what is this unimaginable horror?  Someone videotaped the secret indoctrination ceremony of the Freemasons and is threatening to post it on Youtube.  No, I am NOT kidding.  Poor, misunderstood Freemasons could be publicly outed, so the CIA sends in a hit team to try and take out Robert Langdon.  Much better to murder a prominent scientist and let a kidnap victim die than suffer a little public embarrassment.  The entire premise is absolutely, profoundly preposterous. While the history of early America was fascinating as was alot of the info about the Freemasons, the plot was too flawed to salvage this book. I could buy that the villain was trying to blackmail government officials who were masons into revealing the secret ancient knowledge they were supposedly hiding (the secret is a major disappointment <SPOILER ALERT: the secret code is \\"Praise God\\" and the secret \\"word\\" is the Bible- yes the ancient mysterious secret of the masons is the BIBLE>).  But other fundamental flaws in the story were too silly to swallow.  For instance, the villain's lair and his real identity were discovered, and he openly realizes in the book that he must go into hiding.  So what happens next?  He returns to his lair and continues his plan virtually unimpeded. Fun to read in some ways, especially if you have an interest in early America and Freemasons, but it has two solid strikes against it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|amazing solitaire game!! highly recommended!! love that u can chose a winning game so if you play it right u always win
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I learned of this documentary a couple of days into December and decided to purchase it for my boyfriend for one of his stocking stuffers for Christmas.  I was worried that it wouldn't arrive on time because some sellers on Amazon can take a while, but this DVD arrived so quick!  Back And Forth was such a good documentary.  A coworker told me about this documentary; he said he saw it on VH1.  So immediately I looked it up on Amazon and bought it.  When it arrived in less than a week, I was super pumped and couldn't wait for my boyfriend to open it so we could watch it.  He loved it and said it was one of his favorite Christmas gifts.  The story is really great and gives you an insight on how the Foo Fighters became the incredibly awesome band they are!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes their music because it makes you want to go and see them live (again).  Great Price, Super Fast Shipping, and a Great DVD!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is wonderful. its become my nightly routine. I love that I can have it read for me too.
B005SZAEYO|5.0|This show surprised me. I loved it and loved the actors. Jessica Lange was perfection, she ruled this show and made it even better. Each episode was surprising and full of action and I really just loved it. Even looking at the inside of the beautiful home was a treat. I have watched each episode 5 times and each time I go into a little trance. Get this series for great entertainment and just to watch Jessica act. She is something else!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very fun! So many levels! The required points get kinda tiring sometimes. Adds as well. All around fun! Great app.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop is great. If I hadn't looked at the free app of the day I'd not have found out. I can notes poul up all my school documents and work on then while I'm at work our on vacation without touting my laptop around.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is the best app in the whole wide world . I can be anywhere and control my laptop. Beats every single app on the apple app store!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this app bcuz it made me work to get a higher score at advance to a new level. which I like
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is an ok game I wish allow the games. were all un locked though. and the graphics could be better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app is excellent. I have on all my aneroid devices. If you study or even just read the Bible this app will be perfect for you. I love how you can highlight your favorite verses. I strongly recommend this Bible app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are a bit childish but super addicting. I cant stop myself from playing! keep earning points to unlock new levels. if you are having a hard time doing so, its super cheap to buy points. :0)
B00007GZQZ|5.0|We purchased the movie for my 2 nephews and my son who all have bought houses in the last year.    I think they are enjoying the movie,  most of them had not seen it before.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just downloaded this game and I spent so much time on it.  its definetly entertaining!  I totally recommend this game for everyone!
B005HP2J66|4.0|The film is presented as an exploration of the local area and a tour of the caves. I believe that the theater version of The Cave of Forgotten Dreams was in 3D which must certainly have enhanced the depiction of the cave paintings since the contours of the cave walls greatly influenced the art. None the-less, the quality of the photography was ample to demonstrate the sophistication of the paintings. The history of the caves was also very interesting. The actual visual input was limited and it appeared that the same shots were used many times over as the story was told. This DVD is definitely worth seeing although I would want to see the theater version given the chance.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Got this with the Amazon free app of the day but after using it for an hour I would have gladly spent the $5.  At 30fps this is great for watching movies on the remote PC or even playing strategy games, etc. that don't need a lot of quick reflexes.  I even downloaded the free PC client and prefer that to tightvnc for remoting into my local networked computers.  The 30fps refresh is just great....
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  After reading reviews of many covers I decided on the Kindle Fire Lightweight mostly because of the weight and I chose the white cover so it would contrast with the black on the kindle.  I called my daughter after she had been using it for awhile and she said she loves it.  It does everything she wants, very lightweight and protects her Fire without being too bulky.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is so much more than I was even looking for!  the daily Bible reading plans and the multiple translations and versions were added bonuses I didn't expect to find. The app is web-based but with the option to download favorite translations for offline viewing. Love it!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|not really an intellectual achievment-characters and plot about as complex as the back of a cereal box. waste of time.
B005DZMODI|5.0|The collaboration between these two great artists leads to great song choices. The band backing them is a world class outfit.
0062060554|1.0|I decided to read this because I found it on some best fiction of the year lists.  I was very disappointed.  I just got back to reading novels and after this one, I'm making a new rule where I won't finish the book if it's not engaging after 30-40%.  This book is really not interesting until the last 20%.  The rest of the book just drags on and really isn't interesting at all.  It's like the author makes the book boring to save for a good ending.  Anyways, it wasn't worth the read, the only decent thing about the first 80% is that something could happen that is interesting.  I compare this to Michael Crichton's Micro, which gets you hooked within the first few chapters, after laying the groundwork, and it's a roller coaster from then on.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this app on both my Kindle Fire and my IPhone and enjoy playing while I watch tv or on my lunch hour at work. i recommend it as a brain exercise
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have uSed a few remote desktop apps and this is by far the best.I do have to disable Swype when using this app on my Samsung gs2.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I've used this app for over 18 months. The reading plans are a real plus. Love the ease of getting various translations. Would recommend to anyone. When I use on my phone, the highlighted function is a little touchy. Overall, great!
B0061JPYX2|3.0|I was delightfully surprised by this album...still the AW we know and loved, but with her voice a little more bare and with less studio production.  I'm pleased with my purchase, not your average B-side album.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I love this movie and lost my copy so ordered another. To be honest, this time I purchased it so I could study the design of Diane Keaton's house! Still a great movie. FABULOUS house!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app literally turns your mobile device into your computer. I could access all my music, pics, movies, everything. I was even able to pull up my browser on my computer and check on things I had been viewing at home while I was out. Really an incredible app.
B00005JLEX|5.0|If you like fun and entertainment, with a life lesson, then this is the series you want to get! I recommend the entire collection. Jerry S is an awsome and I love his work!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is amazing! I can access my computer from my kindle!!! You can do every thing from typing to printing, to drawing on the computer!!!!!!! Get this breakthrough app!!!!!!!!
B000LPS4BG|5.0|When I saw this Blu ray on Amazon for $5 I had to grab it. This is De Nero's best movie ever, as well as Liota and Pesci. This is the best gangster movie ever made, and it's all based on real events! Beautiful transfer and the soundtrack is amazing!
B001E45XT4|5.0|When I ordered these, my gaming friends teased me, saying that these are a terrible off-brand, and that I should buy Sennheiser. Much to my delight, these have proven to be really good. The padding is very comfortable. The sound, especially the bass, makes the gaming experience more real. You can hear the explosions really shake you. the build quality is great. The volume control is very nice, with a smooth circular dial to adjust volume, and a simple switch to turn the mic on or off. They are solid, and large. The cables are thick and tough, and the connectors are solid. If you are thinking of spending tons of money on gaming headphones, you should really check these out first. They are really nice headphones, and a great value.
B003O86FMW|4.0|There's not much to say about this one. Katniss still has no personality, but it's way better than the first. Even though you would probaly have to read this one before the first,this book is much better.
B004GYY714|5.0|i live this app on my kindle fire when i am traveling i just listen to this the whole time this app is super easy to ause
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|This book is just AWFUL!!!!!!!! There is absoulutely ZERO point in reading this. The ending is just AWFUL.  It's like Suzanne Collins wrote this over Night and had no one look at it. It's horibly violent, gory and just flat out unnecassary. The ending stinks, and it's just a fail. REALLY don't waste your time on it.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|cool app but in order for it to work I have to have my laptop on, open, and connected to wifi so I might as well just use my lap top or keep it turned on 24/7 lame
B004O3YGMC|3.0|If you run 2 or more monitors, make sure the apps you want to use open on the primary one or you won't see the app on your device. Good responsive program. With WiFi, bring your desktop to dinner through your phone. Did not try through Google yet.
B002VECM6S|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  Sandra Bullock did a great job and deserved to win her Acadamy Award.  The story was very uplifting and heartwarming.  What a wonderful family to take in this basically unknown young man and give him a warm and loving home.  They are very special people.  If they had not taken him into their hearts and home he might have ended up like his mother or the friend of his that died much too young because he got mixed up with the wrong people.  I don't think I could have done what they did.    I had seen clips of this movie long before purchasing it and many of my friends had seen it and said it was a movie not to be missed.  They were right and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has not yet seen it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was written very well. I especially liked the ending where you could figure somthing out before the characters figured it out. Very good buy.
B000I2JI80|5.0|This product came quidkly and was exactly what was ordered/expected.  I will recommend this site/product for future purchases.  Rated it as excellent.
B0063GORYU|5.0|awesome game. convenient settings. old school spider solitaire. always loved the game. nice that it is not a spin off of the original.
1577314808|5.0|The book arrived sooner than expected, in excellent condition. I am very pleased. And am also enjoying to insights of the book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app works just as promised on the fire. I use it daily and very reliable. easy to set up. I appreciate having multiple locations as favorites.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|At the age of 66 all of this is new and thrilling to me. To say that I'm impressed would be the understatement of a lifetime!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this app is very good and has tons of different versions of the Bible.  It does however get pretty buggy and crashy at time so I hope they continue to improve it.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|It is a refreshing to hear music for a change  as opposed to noise. It is a style of music  rarely heard anymore  If anyone likes the music from Cabaret,  then you will love Burlesque
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works flawlessly on my EVO. Makes managing my home PC from my phone a snap! Great features at a reasonable price make this a must have for anyone looking to connect to a PC or Mac.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing spider solitare. It is so much fun. I'm glad I was able to download it onto my tablet. It is addictive!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS UPLIFTING, SAD , HAPPY AND REALISTIC AT THE SAME TIME. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE SENIOR CITIZENS AND BORN AND REARED IN THE SOUTH, WE RELATED TO THIS MOVIE IN A PAINFUL WAY. THE ACTORS DID A SUPERB JOB AND THEIR ROLES WERE PERFORMED NATURALLY..NOT OVERACTING. THIS MOVIE TEACHES A GREAT HISTORICAL LESSON ALSO BECAUSE THESE THINGS OCCURRED AND OTHERS COULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED BUT WERE NOT,SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO NEGATIVE AND WOULD HAVE  BEEN TOO PAINFUL AND NOT ENTERTAINING. I PURCHASED THREE OF THESE, TWO AS GIFTS AND ONE TO KEEP FOR MY FAMILY ...ALL FROM AMAZON..
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I only wish the app plans could have stayed on my devise vs. the cloud. Very good searching and version capability.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is very good value for the price.  In this backpack right now is a Canon SX40 + Canon HV40 + Fujifilm X100 + Sony NEX-5k + 200mm lens + 85mm lens + 3 small battery chargers + shotgun mic + tons of small stuff.  Lots of cushion to protect your gear.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|wonderful app, works better than the apple streaming connection! this app connects to your video,picture,music library seamlessly and put box art on your videos!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this multi game app, has several fun and challenging games. I spent an hour playing the first time I played.
B005POK858|5.0|I've played many different RPG games for Android, and this is definitely one of the best.   It has a somewhat generic storyline, but it's more than enough to keep you interested and immersed in the game. It has a final fantasy style battle system. It does tend to get a bit annoying with the constant random battles, but you can purchase items that reduce the battle occurrence.   A must for RPG fans!
B005T87QCI|1.0|you cannot kill the fat robot it is the stupidest game ever so fix it..Never play this game its a waste of money
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Good hotmail app. Easy to use and great one for kindle fire. I love the logo while accessing from kindle fire home page.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love it! its a fun way to pass time. id give it 5 starts but the games are very hard and directions arnt very clean
B004EPYZSK|2.0|I'm a big sci-fi fan, but I found this poorly written and directed blockbuster to be pretty disappointing.<br /><br />Daniel Craig proves once again that you need more than a buff bod to be a leading man.  He has zero charisma here, and like many second-rate British actors, he can't pull off even a broad regional American accent (like Western) to save his life.  Apparently the giant budget here didn't include a dialog coach -- or Craig just has a tin ear.<br /><br />Fortunately the man can fight better than he can act, and the early scenes, where his gunfighter with amnesia tangles with some bad guys, pack some genuine punch.<br /><br />Then come the aliens lassoing townsfolk -- it seems that the aliens hadn't discovered levitation rays back in the nineteenth century -- and the film gets relentlessly more silly and incredible.<br /><br />About the only actor who rises above the nonsense here is the luminous Olivia Wilde, as a friendly (and extremely comely)alien.  I hope to see her again in movies much better than this one.<br /><br />The DVD includes a number of extras, including making-of featurettes and director's commentary, if you have any curiosity about the production after watching this plodding \\"floater oater.\\"<br /><br />The long and short of it is, you need more than a high concept to delight an audience, even a contemporary one with lowered expectations.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game and the point system is nice but it gets difficult at times and will take a while for even one game
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Nothing like buying all 3 movies on blu-ray for a low price! You get a decent amount of features on the blu-ray to make them worth it and the picture and sound is much better than it is on DVD.
B005CGI4EG|2.0|The package of the DVDs is poor, and the information that is subtitled, like we see on Amazon description on \\"Format: Box set, Color, DVD, Full Screen, Subtitled, NTSC\\" is wrong. Dont have any subtitles at all. Badly made menus and poor image too, unfortunatly. Ive seen lots of bad movies and bad series being released around the world, but this series never got the treatment it deserved. One of the best shows ever and got this very poor treatment by Sony. Hope someday we get a proper release.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is just amazing there is absolutley no reason for this to be a bad app. It's an amazing free app that you should download.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Songbook is one of those performances that documents a career.  While it is Chris Cornell and the various guitars he plays, the songs span his time with Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, Audioslave, and his solo career with the oldest going back 20 years.  I've followed Cornell through this entire period.  While I didn't always like everything he did, he was a unique vocal talent.  That is the centerpiece of Songbook, and it is what makes it incredible.  This CD haunts from the beginning with \\"As Hope And Promise Fade\\", and it rarely lets up.  Don't buy Songbook if you are looking for something to cheer you up.  However if you want a masterfully dark and sparse performance that spans Cornell's entire career, you have hit the jackpot.  Hearing songs like \\"Call Me A Dog\\" and \\"Black Hole Sun\\" took me squarely back to my college days while \\"I Am A Highway\\" and \\"Scar Upon The Sky\\" were more recent.  While I wish I had caught his live show when he came through Dallas in 2011, I'm glad that I have Songbook to allow me at least some of what that experience would have been like.  I highly recommend this as a musical retrospective for one of grunge music's greatest contributors.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is GREAT. I am working on the one year chronological study plan. love the reminders and the encouragement through facebook. Love this app.
B00008G8LW|5.0|I remember when this movie came out, the special effect were totally awesome.This is one James Camereron film I can say I actually liked with a great storyline. I believe what sent this movie to the top of the box office in the day was the special effects, story line and a superb cast. The only thing that seemed to be missing from this DVD was the 28 minutes of additional footage, because I did get the special edition? I will have to see the theatrical verison, because when I watched it it was really late and I haven't seen the theatrical version since the 90's. All in all I was pleased with the film and as 4 the complaint it was probably there I just couldn't remember the difference from the 2 versions.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B004O3YGMC|2.0|the app is so unbelivably laggy! I have to tap on something like 5 times for the app to recognize that I'm tapping on something. It's very annoying. If that gets fixed, it would be an awesome app. otherwise, it's a crap.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are lots of good classic games and a points system that will keep you playing for hours and hours!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|i thought that it looked like fun @ 1st but then i tried the bouncer game and the ball wouldn't bounce to my touch it would hit the ground.
B0037AGASG|1.0|I do not know where to begin this is probably the worst album on the planet. The lyrics feel like they're written by a 10 year old. My sister (11) listens to this crap day and night, along with Kesha. I hope she and all other little girls will have good taste in the future. This is simply a disgrace to the art of music. I also hope people stop raising their kids with Hannah Montanas, Biebers and Jonas Brothers, and introduce them some quality music. I would give this 0 point but that is unfortunately not an option.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a really good game never gets old because its a constantly changing games all I can say is that I gave it four stars and I'm sure you will to
B004UXUUDA|5.0|I received the DVD very quickly.  It was purchased at a very reasonable price and arrived in good condition.  The movie is very compelling.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app has a great collection of card layouts. The winning hands are great practice for other solitaire apps. Hope you all enjoy this app.
0316926345|2.0|This is the most excruciatingly drawn out, tedious, highly overrated novel I've read in a long time. I do not care that it's considered a \\"classic\\". That does not save it from its numerous shortcomings, the biggest one being that the plot was pretty thin and uninteresting, dealing mostly with the subject of religion (Catholicism) and how it can potentially destroy lives. The ending in particular was very jarring and dissatisfying. The whole Charles-Julia relationship towards the end of the book felt forced, given the fact that previously there was little interaction between the two. Be aware that Evelyn Waugh himself was mildly disparaging of his creation in hindsight. In his correspondence with Graham Greene in 1950 he wrote \\"I re-read Brideshead Revisited and was appalled.\\" He continues, \\"It was a bleak period of present privation and threatening disaster - the period of soya beans and Basic English - and in consequence the book is infused with a kind of gluttony, for food and wine, for the splendours of the recent past, and for rhetorical and ornamental language which now, with a full stomach, I find distasteful.\\" If you are someone who reads books merely for their beautiful prose, then by all means read this book. However, if you are someone like me who values exciting plots and strong fully developed characters more than the use of flowery language, then skip this book. Pick any book by Graham Greene instead or even Muriel Spark, a little known Scottish author, who would always be remembered for her terse prose but incredibly imaginative, fascinating plot lines.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Its great all you need to do is download then go to your gallery app to watch. Its really easy as well.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|The zoom is a great product and works great. Everyone is giving it bad reviews but if you use kinect tuner to set it up and then use your calibration card it works perfect. I play in 3 to 4 foot area and this works flawless. I would recommend this to anyone using kinect in a small area.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|best in class, hands down. no other app like this comes even close. not even log me in. tons of features, impressed with speed of refresh using galaxy nexus
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Cowboys and Aliens is a rock solid fun action film that does what it sets out to do. I really cannot understand what it is people were expecting. I thought it was well acted, well paced and overall satisfying for a sci-fi action film. To me the strongest element was that the aliens actually feel like a threat. They're pretty brutal and really cool looking. Clearly however borrowing from previous genre films like \\"Alien\\", but that's not a bad thing. You have to go into this realizing it's not a classic western and take it as an alien invasion movie set in the old west. In that capacity it works very well. I really do not get what all the complaining is about. I'm very picky and cannot stand much of the garbage that comes out of the Hollywood machine these days. But C&A is a fine entry into the sci-fi action genre in my opinion. Give it a chance.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|several versions of the bible, chapter and verse search, lots of devotional choices, and the ability to share. an all around great app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I use it on a daily basis to read my Bible reading plans. I love to have the Bible with me everywhere I go. I use it on my phone to listen to my 1 year Bible plan in the car. I also like that I can download versions to my Kindle Fire to use when I'm not connected to wifi. Best Bible App EVER! Thanks LifeChurch.tv!!!
B005K2YZ5E|4.0|I wanted a case that would allow me to throw my Kindle in my bag and go. I got this case and the Marware SportGrip for Kindle Touch Cover. I love the combo. With the Cover on the Kindle the fit into the Timbuk Envelope Sleeve is a little snug, but not so much so that it's difficult to get the Kindle in and out of it. I feel like what I have and it works well for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|there are great Bible options with all the versions I could think of. wonderful devotions. so many to choose from. I start my day with daily praises.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I listened to the cd of the set on a two hour car drive.  That meant I got to listen to most of it twice, and I know I'll be listening to it for years to come.  Adele's voice is one of those joyful musical instruments that few are blessed with.  I know that she wasn't at her peak, performing, because of medical issues, but, you'd never know it, to listen to her.  She had me singing along, as she also had the audience.  Her infectious giggle warmed me.<br />The DVD is a separate joy.  Live performances are rarely the same on a disc as in person.  But, you'll have a great seat with this one.<br />I hope one day to hear her perform in person.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is incredibly handy.  the huge variety of study plans make it easy to find one that relates directly to you.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I hate wasting battery life on my Fire but, unfortunately, this is the app that is apt to do it. You may close it whenever you want, but it keeps on running in the background. You have to force it closed by accessing the 'applications' area. It should shut down when you close it. Is it an accidental oversight or a keystroke recorder?
B001GWK2MC|5.0|this is our 2nd one from the same company.  it is very sturdy! we really beat the first one up at our 2 year olds birthday party.  too many big kids with shoes on in it. that one popping was definitely our fault. this one is pretty big, so that's the only bad thing. we couldn't move it between rooms.  the other one we bought was round, so you could turn it on it's side and roll it out of the room.  this one stays in whatever room you put it in! lots of fun with balls in it!<br /><br />**UPDATE***<br />this thing is still going strong even though the front part completely deflated.  my husband cut the front off and the girls are still playing in it! it has multiple chambers to inflate, so you cutting off the front didn't affect the rest of the bounce house.  of course this isn't as safe, so don't follow our example.  but this thing is still up! awesome!
1440503257|4.0|I got this as a Christmas gift for my sister, as we are both huge Harry Potter fan (we are true dorks at heart, both being over 30 and staying true to our love of HP).  It was fun to look at the recipes that the author came up with and some of the stories behind the recipes in relation to the Harry Potter Series.  Butter beer was not a recipe in the book-but you can find many on line. This was a great gift and the right price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great pass time I play this game a lot and it is great fun for any age. It is a better pass time than baseball
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really love this app it works so well on my kindle fire and is loads of fun!!! I would definately recommend this!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun the only thing wrong is that some of the games are impossible to do.other than that its great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|highly recommend.  it reads verses to you. relaxing and up lifting.  very easy to use the whole can and should gather around every evening for at least one page.
0066620996|1.0|I cannot believe anybody in their right mind is still buying this book. Collins' analysis was flawed from the outset when it was published in 2001 and 11 years later it has proven to be a failure. Four of his so called \\"GREAT\\" companies are Fannie Mae (mortgage scandal), Circuit City (declared bankruptcy), Wells Fargo ($25B bailout) and Gillette (bought by Proctor & Gamble). See a pattern? Great, huh?  So much for Good to Great. Didn't anybody learn from his \\"Built to Last\\" book when most of the companies touted in that book did NOT last? Wake up people. Jim Collins' goal was to put YOUR money in HIS pocket. He feels GREAT about that.  You better hope Jim Collins never puts a company you work for in one of his books. If he does, start looking for another job quick.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is great and thee are tons of great fun games and lots of ways you can get points it is a great app I definently regimens it
B0054JZC6E|2.0|it would be better if the games were all free and you didn't constintly have to go through the hastle of downloading games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can only echo what other reviewers have said, I love this app. On a personal level I have been able to remain consistent with a daily reading plan for over two weeks... that may not sound like much but for me it is huge. I love having lots of different translations at my fingertips. My husband enjoys the ability to listen to the Bible as well, he's a slower reader and it really helps him stay focused. This is a life changing app!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is pretty fun, lots of advertisements, and lots of boring games, but most of them are fun. If u want something you will be committed to, this would be great.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a really good game. fun to play.  easy and really fun to do all.of the time.  I really like it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a pretty cool app...for being free its pretty nice and entertaining... it also has a pretty good selection of games
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a good time -passer and I would have given it five stars but I do not like how many points it takes to unlock some.of the games I also do wish it did not have adds that you sometimes press on by accident. overall it is a very fun game ecspecially to free so you should get it
B004O3YGMC|5.0|does what it claims to do. it runs smoother than I expected it to run. my only complaint is that I won't go to landscape mode.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|thank you so much amazon for making this the free app of the day. I've been wanting to try it out, and now i got it for free. works great with my computers. love the app so far
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Got these only two days ago and I'm I'm extremely pleased with the headphones. The sounds are crisp, they're comfortable, and fairly light. They even dull outside noises pretty well, which I was a bit surprised by.<br /><br />Sound- I have used a good amount of over-ear headphones, and these are the best I've tried. They look very neat and professional, don't need batteries and are WELL worth the money. All of my previous headphones were less than $100 so I cant compare these to anything super-fancy, but these were the best I've had by a landslide. Comparing these to my last pair of Skull Candy G.I's ($80), I immediately noticed the sounds were brighter and significantly clearer. I was able to hear instruments/sounds in songs that I did not notice at all with my G.I's, which says a lot about these headphones considering G.I's are much better than average headphones. I even could comprehend background lyrics in a song that previously (a day prior) sounded like mumbling. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the amount of bass and low bass these provide, I have not heard any  comparable non-battery operated headphones (which sometimes distort, so watch out).<br /><br />I produce house music using FL Studio, and these headphones have made my mastering and EQ'ing MUCH more precise. There's never even a hint of distortion, even when using some high quality, CPU gobbling VST plugins and heavy kicks. There is a reason most sound engineers use these headphones, these are the real deal. If engineers use these to master, you can be assured that this is the way their music was intended to be heard.<br /><br />Practicality- The wire is thick and durable, no worried about it fraying, and the coiled wire can stretch pretty far if you need it to. It does not take up any more space than other over ear headphones if you tuck in the wiring into the collapsed structure. I personally don't like running with headphones on, but it seems these fit snug enough to run without a problem, provided you have some of that cable in your pocket. Like I said earlier, they're pretty light and quiet some outside noise. These fit comfortably on average sized ears, but I would imagine are also good if you have larger ears because the cushion is very soft<br /><br />To sum up, I guarantee you will not regret purchasing these. Sounds is phenomenal, it's great for the price, and it's comfortable
B0063IH60K|5.0|great I like that you can chose a winning deal instead of starting a game that you would have no chance of winning anyway
B004O3YGMC|3.0|If you have a Mac for your remote desktop - the helper app requires OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or higher. Good thing I didn't pay for this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The bible app is a must have. Has all the different versions available and most also offline. The notes feature is great and the plans available are unbeatable.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I really loved the concert! Not only did it arrive super fast, but I actually felt as if I were at the concert. This is a really great buy, any Beyonce fan would enjoy this.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|CD by Theory of a Deadman.  Purchased for my 18 year old neice.  Personally, I have not heard any of the CD, but my neice loves it, so I guess it was a good buy!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|hard but I love it. my favorite app ever. kill all the pithiest and my cousin who is eight loves it more
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is one of the best apps I have ever received. I can access documents, play games, watch videos, all from a single device; my Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My favorite feature on this app is the audio feature that you can access while reading the Bible. I also like the plan feature.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Highly recommended.  When I finished it, I thought... 'ok, now I know how it really happened'.  Then realized no, it was a fictional story.  But it made me really think about it.  I always wondered about time travel and the repercussions that can occur.  Stephen King, of course, is an awesome writer.  He gave a story that most people, no matter their reading preferences, would enjoy.  I know I'll read it again.  It was that good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if you do not know what game you whets this app have a lot of game it is a lot of fun so you sould get this app
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I am tough to impress.  This is very easy to setup (I would hardly call the process a setup,  more like an install).  It is remarkably fast too.  Im shocked!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is awesome! I didn't know there was an app that could do this! It is great when you would like to get something from your Pc using a portable tablet or phone. I got lucky and got this app on the free app day. Would have payed for it before now if I had known this app was available! Great app! =)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Zero problems, zero money, tons of fun on kindle fire. A must buy, no doubt about it. Great unlocking system keeps you entertained.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get this game is awesome the pie is good I'm just putting random words la lake river tooth grasp spenger
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app was so easy to install on both my tablet and my pc that I was surprised how quickly I was able to control my desktop remotely, I was literally up and running within 2 minutes. I recommend this app to anyone who wants to control their pc remotely from a tablet or phone :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. I love it . it is adicting and it is free. it also has 117 games even better
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The best  At time good rap  Will always buy from this people  Real happy  Review is a paind in the ----- here
B004O3YGMC|5.0|and i can see it being quite useful for some people. i just spent a few minutes trying it, and surely like it a lot.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Only worked for a few minutes. Would of liked to see it work , it seemed like it would of been a cool app.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|This is a historically important novel (and will be more important 30 years from now than it is today) as it documents a way of life & a manner of political discourse in suburbia.  The characters are simultaneously real and caricatures.  Patty Berglund is as tedious and self-absorbed as some people I know.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great and I have yet to get bored of it as I do others. I think this is easy to understand and has classic games along with their own.
0385534639|5.0|This is a unique story. A story that focuses on two individuals but really intertwines the lives of several patrons. There's an air of mystery, adventure, excitement and romance flourished throughout the tale.<br /><br />As great as I think this story is, not everyone will have the patience to enjoy it fully. While the story is told to you, subtle significant components of the tale overall, will not reveal themselves as easily. That's not to say that the reader will fail to comprehend the story, but the one might end up being a little frustrated and confused by certain plot points. *It is up to the reader to enjoy and interpret the tale.<br /><br />Each entry of the story is dated and one should try to be aware of how the timing plays out. Because of this format I would advise against reading this story over a stretched period of time. Better to wait until summer or winter vacation to pick up this book. And this is a novel that will make more sense the more it is read. This is a book that requires one to think. I can see how others would dislike this book due to failure of investing themselves in the book.<br /><br />I personally loved the the fantasy of THE NIGHT CIRCUS. The atmosphere and overall mood of the story was quite enchanting and the characters had personality to make them believable. While the writing isn't precisely clear cut in certain aspects, the writing style or choice adds to the ambiance of the tale.<br /><br />I found THE NIGHT CIRCUS to be a captivating read and would recommend it to others. However, since this story is a tad more refined than other novels I would suggest readers in high school or younger to wait a year or two before picking up this book.
B00006IM9Q|4.0|Blondie / Greatest Hits:  Silly, funny, wonderful Blondie finally gets a nice single CD of their hits.  Got a good beat, easy to dance to, I give it a Four.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|( Blue Ray set only )  After reading some of the reviews of this product - I can only wonder what these people do in real life ?  So George made some minor changes - improved the continuity and flow of the entire series, cleaned up some of the glitches, and made for a better viewing experience.  If the die hards want to see things only in the 1st unimproved version does that mean they only watch video on 12\\" black and white tube TV's to get that 'Nostalgic\\" experience ??  I for one am perfectly happy to have the whole set on Blue Ray, with cleaned up picture, sound, minor tweaks, and all.  I can watch the original VHS tapes if I want nostalga, or the original laser discs, or the VHS box sets, or the regular DVD's, or the classic versions on DVD from Laser masters.....there are so many versions floatinga round why worry about it - watch what makes you feel good.  MY favorite version was seeing Ep 4 \\"A New Hope\\" in Cleveland, summer 1977, when it was still just \\"Star Wars\\", and the theatre had just shown Midway or some other picture in Sensoround with the big add on subwoofers and amplifiers -  in the opening shot of the Corellian Cruiser over Tantooine the rumble made the floors and walls shake & rattle - and the rest of the movie was just plain awsome -  ITS NEVER been that good anywhere since then.  If you are not into the changes and new versions - don't buy them - but let the rest of the world enjoy their moment.
B0000009SY|4.0|\\"This is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER... again. Hi!...It's me again, the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER... Joe says Lucille has messed his mind up, but, was it the girl or was it the music? As you can see... girls, music, disease, heartbreak.. .they all go together... Joe found out the hard way, but his troubles were just beginning... his mind was so messed up... he could hardly do nothin'... He was in a quandary... being devoured by the swirling cesspool of his own steaming desires... the guy was a reck... so... what does he do? For once, he does something SMART... he goes out... and pays a lot of money to L. Ron Hoover... at the First Church of Appliantology!\\"<br /><br />\\"(Eventually it was discovered that God did not want us to be all the same. This was BAD NEWS for the Governments of The World as it seemed contrary to the doctrine of Portion Controlled Servings. Mankind must be made more uniformly if THE FUTURE was going to work. Various ways were sought to bind us all together, but, alas SAMENESS was unenforceable. It was about this time that someone came up with the idea of TOTAL CRIMINALIZATION based on the principle that if we were ALL crooks, we could at last be uniform to some degree in the eyes of THE LAW. Shrewdly our legislators calculated that most people were too lazy to perform a REAL CRIME. So new laws were manufactured, making it possible for anyone to violate them any time of the day or night, and, once we had all broken some kind of law, we'd all be in the same big happy club, right up there with the President, the most exalted industrialists, and the clerical big shots of all your favorite religions. TOTAL CRIMINALIZATION was the greatest idea of its time and was vastly popular, except with those people who didn't want to be crooks or outlaws. So, of course, they had to be TRICKED INTO IT... which is one of the reasons why music was eventually made Illegal.)\\"<br /><br />Freedom of speech can get gross at times...Four Stars
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazing is all that needs to be said. Runs smoothly without glitches!!! Very little lag between devices. Bonus its free! couldn't get more perfect!!!
B003ZZAXFO|5.0|Peter Gabriel (\\"3\\", \\"the melting face album\\"): This extremely dark album is fascinating to the point of being addictive.  This one demands your attention and concentration, right down to the last track about the Black South African, Stephen Biko, who was murdered by the apartheid government in 1977.  Five Stars
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Very good dvd. Fast transport to Danmark. Everything excellent.Items in perfekt order.  Will use Amazon again. Secure and safe. Thank you.
B0000009UG|5.0|David Bowie / Scary Monsters (Rykodisk with four bonus tracks): Not only is Major Tom revisited but Bowie revisits his very best styles in this album.  RYKO's version of the CD adds four terrific bonus tracks which are not to be missed.  The first two are fine re-recordings of \\"Space Oddity\\" and \\"Panic in Detroit\\".  The third bonus track is a single that was released in Japan called \\"Crystal Japan\\".  The forth, and the best, is the U.K. Single of Bowie doing Kurt Weil's \\"Alabama Song\\" (a tune you may remember from a version that Jim Morrison and The Doors had done years before).<br />This album, and RYKO's edition, get Five Stars.

B000002C1W|4.0|Pink Floyd / A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1997 anniversary CD):  After Roger Waters left the group, some simply refused to accept anything new from Pink Floyd as Being Pink Floyd.  Those people were only partly right.  Although Waters is missed, this album is still very good and, now, very much an essential part of Pink Floyd's fine history.  \\"Learning to Fly\\", \\"Dogs of War\\", and \\"On the turning away\\" have all become important tracks to the fans of Pink Floyd.  Of course, there are still those who still don't realize that Pink Floyd was a Progressive Rock band, and while they condemn the band for being too commercial if they make a `hit' song, they also foolishly curse the band when they experiment.  This may not be their best album but it is a very good Progressive album.  This one gets Four Stars.
B004U52VPS|4.0|So I was pretty stoked when I initially saw this and was even more stoked when it arrived.  My cubicle is pretty plain and I try to find all sorts of things to try and spice it up a little bit and this definitely helps out a lot.  I love the fact that you can stack it any way that you want.  I mainly use it just to decorate my office but it mainly functions as a game.  It comes with cards that show structures you can build and how many tries you get to try and knock down all the pigs.  its actually pretty cool.  I love the fact that they have an actual catapult that launches the birds.  This set comes with 3 birds (red, yellow, and black).  All in all good fun for all ages and I get people stopping by my desk all the time to play with it.
B003Y8YXH6|4.0|John Lennon & Yoko Ono / Double Fantasy / Stripped Down (2 CD set):  This is a good album, not a Great album, but those who make Personal attacks on Yoko for even being on it are showing hate towards the woman John loved and the music John loved that came from her, which means they are ultimately showing their hate towards John himself.  If you understand the artistry of both John AND Yoko, this is the album for you.  If you hate Yoko, don't buy the album.  If you loved John, buy the album and appreciate His love for Her.<br />This album gets Four Stars.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Last Year in August I had a pleasure to watch 2 Cellos live in Medevial City of Dubrovnik. It was spectacular, the best concert I have watched live. They're amazing, enjoying the music and playing it with full lungs. There was no single song that didn't vibe excellent; altough my favorite one was With or Without You. This Album is must have for all 'crossover' fans.
0060936223|5.0|Just Kids by Patti Smith   I couldn't put this book down. Patti Smith is brutally honest about both her ups and downs, before, with, and after Mapplethorpe. The feisty New York art world in the late '60s and '70s blooms in the background.        Smith met Mapplethorpe when she arrived in New York City in 1967. They were both broke and slept out in parks and doorways. Smith soon found jobs in book stores, Mapplethorpe worked on his extraordinary collages and on their room/studio, and both drew for hours at night. Friends who were artists or dealers lent cameras, gave advice, and offered contacts. And Mapplethorpe began to move away from their sexual relationship into exploring male partners and rough sex.    The two became part of the busy New York art world, including Andy Warhol`s gatherings, Fifth Avenue gallery shows of Mapplethorpe's photographs and of Smith's drawings. Smith, acted, read her poems, and eventually wrote songs and started her own very successful band. They moved on to other partners, but remained friends. Patti was there when Mapplethorpe began to be disabled by the first assaults of AIDS.   Photographs of Smith with or by Mapplethorpe are throughout the book. Somehow--and this is minor--I miss seeing just one of Mapplethorpe's elegant photos of a bare male torso, so we see what he acheived.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|I've used it a few times now and have found it to work well if you follow the instructions provided with the product.  The reviewer who said it scratched the heck out of his Kinect rushed through the installation I think. I used the protective plastic wrapper for covering the part of the Kinect that the Zoom clips on to. I had to remove mine to re-align the lenses. This was easy to do if you take your time. I used one hand to pry gently on the back clip while my other hand pulled forward the zoom lens side and then lifted. The zoom thus wasn't touching the Kinect at all when I did this.  As for where to place it. The Kinect instructions state that higher is better BUT the ZOOM instructions indicate that the zoom works better when put on a tv stand or mounting between 2' 4\\" and 4'. Mine is mounted about 3 feet off the ground. With this configuration my Kinect Zoom is able to easily recognize my movements. However, for my 4 year old it only works OK. I think that's the Kinect itself that's the issue as it recommends people be at least 40\\" tall for it to work properly.  I also think that most issues are with the software companies that release the games. I state this as I've noticed different games have differing abilities to recognize my movements.  For example, \\"Kinect Adventures\\" is very accurate while \\"Jillian Michael's Fitness Adventures\\" was just absolutely terrible at recognizing faces and I was only able to actually get to the game once out of 15 attempts.  So for the games programming for movement recognition:  1) Kinect Adventures - excellent  2) Once Upon a Monster - good  3) Jillian Michael's Fitness Adventures - terrible in a small space like mine. This game really needs at least 8 feet of room. Wish they would state that on the game.  4) Fruit Ninja - excellent
0307959856|2.0|I looked forward to this book as being something beyond the usual book that targets Austen fans like me. Alas, this book was much the same as all the others. Heavy handed reminders of the plot features of Austen's books filled many pages. The characters of Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam Darcy were washed out, and had none of the conversational wit or interesting human weaknesses of the original characters. The best characters were in fact the new minor parts of the innkeepers wife and others giving testimony at the trial, and Sir Selwyn Hardcastle the magistrate collecting evidence. I am still looking for an author to give new life to Austen's world and characters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is great. it has so many wonderful options and plans. you will really enjoy using this fantastic app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun and challenging.  Nice that it was free because I wouldn't have paid but it is fun.  Some are kind of hatd.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok games.  short and simple but pop ups get really annoying.  good idea but takes a good bit of time to get everything
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing music, fair puzzles that don't stress you out, all makes it so you can enjoy this challenging puzzle game without making you throw your tablet across the room in a fit of rage.
B006SV2LWA|4.0|My husband grudgingly agreed to watch this movie with me.  He thought it was going to be like \\"Outbreak\\" but admitted after seeing it that they were different stories.  This movie describes the rapid global spread of a new virus which ends up killing 26 million people.  The CDC, WHO, and other government agencies are actively trying to find a cure, or more specifically a vaccine to combat the aggressive new virus.  This movie has an all-star ensemble cast including Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Winslet, Lawrence Fishburne, Jude Law, Elliot Gould and others.  (NOTE:  Damon and Paltrow had smaller roles that I thought they would.)  The immediate breakdown of society due to panic over the virus and subsequent limited vaccine supply was disturbing.  It was a reminder how quickly we can lose our humanity in times of desperation.  I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys conspiracy theory (Jude Law story line) and thought-provoking plots.

B004O3YGMC|1.0|Installed the app on a Droid Bionic and home PC. This app is supposed to allow connection across the 3g/4g network in addition to wireless. Worked fine inside the house where I could log in via IP but using the network discovery mode it would never connect. It found my PC just won't connect. Glad I had a chance to try it for free courtesy of Amazon's daily giveaway because I'd have been dissapointed to have paid for it and found it didn't work since it takes more than 15 minutes to set everything up. Sticking with [[ASIN:B006LRUVUA TeamViewer for Remote Control]]
B0063IH60K|5.0|This has been a great app on my Fire.  Great for when I don't want to read and need to kill some time.

0385738773|1.0|I will admit first that I did read this book in one sitting, in a manner of hours, but it was not because it was a \\"page-turner.\\"  I really enjoyed the first 2 books and when I finished the 2nd I was extremely curious to see how it all ended, but now that I know I regret reading any of the books at all.    I am sure that I was supposed to feel sympathy for Thomas throughout the story, but I was frustrated with the series of events and choices he made almost from the very beginning.  I kept reading, hoping that he would rectify the mistakes I believed him to be making but when I arrived at the end of the book I was extremely frustrated.  I have read a number of Dystopian series and novels in the past couple months and I have loved each of them.  I understand that happy endings are not what the world is always about, thus understanding that not every book can end with bliss and joy, but all I can say with this one was REALLY?!?  I recently read the Hunger Games trilogy for the second time, and there are a NUMBER of parallel situations and thoughts between the two trilogies.  Both involved extreme loss and sacrifice; but with the Death Cure, rather than endearing me to the main character and making me believe in his thoughts of the world and reasons behind his actions, I felt nothing but indifference to whether he even lived or died.  No, I take that back, by the end I hoped that he would not survive.    The first two books in the series were probably worth the read, but I would never recommend them to anyone simply because of how truly awful the Death Cure was.  I highly suggest that if you have read the first two but have not read the Deaath Cure yet, don't.  Make up the ending in your own mind of how you want it all to go, because is you read this book you will highly regret it.
1400064287|5.0|Communicating a great idea poorly is like having the best BBQ pork ribs at the Vegan jamboree. If people don't understand or remember my idea then I've squandered its greatness (and how often will I have a great one anyway). This book teaches how to get those Vegans to tell their friends \\"I bet those are damn good ribs.\\" We spent a long time learning how to analyze and create ideas. Spend some time learning how to share those with others.

B006RUJST6|5.0|Truly enjoyed reading \\"slammed\\"!  Thank you for sharing it with us!  Can't wait for your next book to come out!  Book was easy to read and very enjoyable!
0143038583|5.0|A must read if you eat food. \\"What should we be eating\\" and \\"how should we get it\\" are key questions explored by this book. Find out not only about our industrial food system but also symbiotic alternatives where farmers stack different crops in the same space nourishing the land as they feed us. In addition, we journey through the fast and slow food movements with some hunting and foraging adventures as well. A great read that fosters many questions.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I like this CD very much. It is such a great mix and it shows how versatile she was. Such a waste of this great talent.....
1594481717|4.0|A worthy read about how using both our analytical/linear and artistic/intuitive sides yields a more complete person able to engage in a meaningful career. Not only does the author provide a great argument but the end of each section has a portfolio of tasks, sites and book. This book has fed my curiosity and my to-read list.

Its suppose to be for teenager (young adults), im 14 and am a bookwarm but i felt like i was reading a manual. i wont suggest this book to my friends.. sorry...

B001KZVQJI|4.0|The start of this movie is slow but once its gets to Skull Island then it starts to pick up. The star of this film is Andy Serkis he dose the motion cap of Kong and he's just great and brings the character to life.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|- nice that it has a speed control so it's up to the player as to how difficult it is. The only change I would make is to add instructions screens when a new switch is added rather than putting it on a board making the player read about it and die a few times to figure it out.
1576754227|3.0|When I started reading Eat That Frog I was disappointed that it seemed to be no more than a rehash of ideas that have been around for donkey's years, such as 'do the worst first', or indeed the frog eating quote by Mark Twain on which the title of the book is based.<br /><br />By the time I finished reading I'd rather come around to thinking that this book is a useful summary of such ideas about time management, self-discipline and motivation.  It's true, as at least one other reviewer has said, that there is contradictory advice in the book - shall I persevere with my task and complete it in one go, or salami slice it - but having tried both methods, I find that both work, so having both spelled out in the same book at least saves shelf space.<br /><br />Some have said that this book will not help a procrastinator to stop procrastinating.  Will any book, however well written, do that?  Reading about the psychology of procrastination doesn't eliminate the moment when you have to take a deep breath and just do the thing that has to be done, call it eating a frog or by any other name.<br /><br />Although I'm fairly positive about the content of the book, I do feel that it represents a somewhat cynical money making exercise by Brian Tracey.  There is not enough content, and no original ideas, to justify the price.  I'm glad I was able to get the Kindle edition on special offer for 99cents; I'd have been pretty miffed to pay full price for either the Kindle or paperback edition.<br /><br />I'd recomment Eat That Frog as a useful little book, but only if you can get it cheap.

B004GJYR7I|4.0|Was a cute and entertaining movie. I am trying to view the old classic movies and even tho it was old, I enjoyed it very much.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is pretty awesome I like how there's so many games on it I would sugjest it but I wouldn't pay more than 2 bucks for it :)
B000QI2ZWW|1.0|i watched half an hour of his non sense and the only story in it was about penguins dancing, and expressing their feelings for each other. The story is boring, retarded and pathetic, and i remember when it came out so many people wanted to see it, and some asked me; hey did you see happy feet? and i reply Yeah that boring piece of trash...  This is the dumbest movie ever it is long, boring, offensive, and wastes your time.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this game is a wast of time don't even play it and don't download this game take my word for it please.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy the games even though I still cant beat them but points are easy to accumulate. They are fun and very entertaining and some are a little addictive.
B005JU5JTI|5.0|I just love Cameron Diaz, she is great at comedy. If you're looking for an Oscar worthy movie..pass this one. If you want to laugh & let go of whatever you are stressed about. Watch this:)<br />For more Cameron Diaz [[ASIN:B004EIMDWM In Character with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz of Knight and Day]]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are a little hard to me but it is exactly what it advertises to b i just started so there arent many unlocked games yet my boyfriend was naturally much better then me soo...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is very fun. Personally, I like this app even better than the videogame. The greatest part of this app is that it's free. I recommend to any gamer.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I would love to purchase it, though if this game doesn't get an update and the fixes all the stuff customers been complaining about, then I wont bother, which really sucks, =(
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ok is is a ok app some games a stupied but over all it is a great app! ! get it
159102594X|5.0|If you enjoyed the A Song of Ice & Fire series by George R.R. Martin then you will most likely want to read this series as well. It has everything I want in a great book (and series). It is dark, violent and has great characters. There is plenty of humor and sarcasm that will leave you chuckling and laughing out loud. The characters are refreshing and the story keeps you wanting more. I highly recommend this book. :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is pretty cool and fun for when your bored. some games are annoying tho. and some of them just wont work.lil but its a good time waster :)
B006BDHAX0|2.0|I like the game and have been playing on & off since I could no longer play real Mahjongg. Bought the full version, but while I enjoy the game itself I can't get the deal with the game shutting down repeatedly in the middle of a level. You just find yourself looking at your home screen. The Icon is blurred at first, then the screen resets and comes up normal. Developers need to get on that. No point in going further otherwise.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Fruit Ninja: Puss in Boots is a great app game for the Kindle Fire.  Bold, colorful graphics. I have not once had a crash problem, as a prior reviewer said he had on his Galaxy.  You slash (not just tap)fruit as it flies by - but watch out for those bombs!  In Bandito mode, you have to very quickly figure out and complete each 10 second (or so) challenge as it pops up.  Great fun and highly addictive.  I like that a single game can take just minutes (or less), then I move on to something else, but I always come back for \\"just one more\\" Fruit Ninja fix!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is okay but some of the controls are hard but it is a very goods app when you are extremely bored
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This application is so convenient. I can access my computer in my dorm from all of my classrooms. The multiple of input methods is very convenient, so if you don't like the default, there is a setting for you.
0446613444|3.0|I've already reviewed a number of Michael Connelly's books and I intend to keep reading his work. So, take it as given that I like his style. The Black Ice is a bit of a road trip for Connelly. He moves around more than is usually the case in his later books. This works against him in this novel.<br /><br />His strength is in his understanding of police proceedure, the court system, and jouralism. As long as he stays home, so to speak he is strong and believable.<br /><br />In some of his books his knowledge of firearms comes up a bit short, but he has taken some advice and done his homework. Now he, and his characters, handle guns well too.<br /><br />I particularly liked the psychological/sociological resaoning which motivated the report keeping and cover your buddy's back mentality which prevades The Black Ice. It is not his strongest storyline, but I keep on turning the pages. He must be doing something right.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games for kids there is a lot of different types of games. you really want to unlock more games on it because the games are so very very very cool
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome app. Have it on Blackberry and my Fire. Love it! Highly recommended. Also has great reading plans and devotions available.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I got this for my kindle fire and have loved it. I can be more involved with Bible study with three English translations I use and a Greek translation.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|just incredible. just got it today but amazed by it already! computer needs to be on in order to access ur desktop tho but it is still an amazing app!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Saw this movie 4 times in theaters, pre-ordered on first available day!  I've already watched it a dozen times at home...LOVE IT!  The extended version isn't great, it's only 60 seconds longer than the theater version.  Love the extras too.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is fun to pass the time.  Like some of the other reviewers have said, the controls in some of the games don't work very well.
B004FOA84A|3.0|The reason I rated this game 3 star is I got very dissapointed that the game didn't give any hints or clues.  It's a short game and considering an app that we have to purchase I would think it would be longer and user friendly.  ;(    I love these types of games and I would say I've highly dissapointed, such a shame.
B004FOA84A|1.0|I cant figure out the globe by the fire place in the beginning. does anyone know how to unlock it?
B0063IH60K|4.0|great and easy to see has good graphics would love to rate it 4 stars and have told family and friends
B004J4WLPU|1.0|If found the writing dull and lifeless, the characters annoying and stereotypical, the plot ridiculous and the \\"bad guy\\" predictable from the start (that \\"beautiful man\\" BS).  There was no suspense whatsoever, the \\"trick\\" ending didn't move me in the least.  This book was like a bad made-for-TV movie.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|they need more support for more operating systems. There are those that use Linux, BSD, UNIX based operating systems, among others. The world isn't just on Windows or Mac.
B005KMX866|5.0|Chris Issac has the kind of voice that would've made him a mega star (not that he's not already on his own terms) in the 50's and 60's.  The 2-CD package is top-rated and produced.  A pure pleasure to listen to, OVER and OVER again.
1419702238|5.0|My son is a big fan and was very excited to receive this as a gift. He has enjoyed reading it several times in just a month.
B0061JPYX2|3.0|I actually listened to the samples before my purchase.  It is definitely NOT in the same caliber of Back to Black, including some same songs and some uninspiring covers.  However, for Whitehouse fans, this would be CD to complete the collection (only 3 CDs so far, so not that hard to collect them all).
0895260131|4.0|Quite informative. This is not mainstream information but certainly exposes Islam for what it is - a violent, imperial religion that cannot rest until all the world is brought into its submission. I bought the book for the read on the Crusades as well. This is one subject not enough people in the west know the truth about anymore. The Crusades was a necessary evil, just as defending ourselves from Islam will be a necessary evil in a few years time. The terrible realization is, though, during the Crusades the battleground was in territory conquered by Islam, whereas the future battle will be in our own backyards.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This might be THE collector's item to keep forever.  With Adele's vocal cord concern, this might be the best live concert Adele might ever have.  Like the playfulness of Adele throughout the concert.
0312576463|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this book. I fell for the hype and bought this in hardcover from our city's main bookstore a week after it came out. I thought the story was mediocre, the characters ill defined and the writing absolutely tragic. It read to me like the author through the text together in a couple hours. Not recommended.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is awesome use it on my kindle fire and it works great fast easy setup Thanks for making such a great App!!
B006IVBSBU|5.0|I went into the theater skeptical, but left with my mind blown. It had so many themes and underlying plots that my wife and I continued to talk about it for days. It had an interesting take on the role of physicians. It shows them as both authoritative and reassuring, but almost powerless at the same time.  It had a lot of big name actors, but all of them played very realistic characters that weren't completely 'clean.' Stellar performance by everyone involved.  A++ in my book and perhaps one of the best unsung movies of 2011.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is the solitaire we know and love. you will not always win but the undo ablnd replay options are great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I became addicted to this game while in college and this is a great version. It has a great feature that allows you to choose between a winning hand vs a random one. I think its great to build your confidence. animation is good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are a little to easy. though it gives you coins for easy things like losing 5 times in a row.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining. I will sit play it for quite a while. Can this game get better?
B0053KWDES|4.0|I have been itching to purchase a headphone amp since they seemed to be the cat's meow when talking about soundcards and headphones. I also wanted one for my Ipod and Ipod Shuffle.  I read that the Fiio's were great for the Ipods and had a nice size and portability, so that was the main selling point for me. I expected a okay job handling the un-amped sound out of my soundcard, but I really underestimated it on that aspect.  So far, six hours in and I am just amazed at the difference this little amp makes. It is a night and day difference in the clarity and sound seperation.  First off, it is \\"the\\" perfect thing for a Ipod. I tried it with my Klipsch Image S4 earbuds and my Creative Sigma Tactics3d headcans.  With the Klipsch I set it on the low amp setting and use the 1 EQ and the sound is just perfect (ramping it up to High Amp and EQ 2 can cause a bit distortion). My only gripe with the Klipsch have been their lack of any real oomph in the bass department when I use them on the Ipod. Not anymore with the Fiio providing a nice kick in the amps.  The Tactics pretty much ignore the Low Amp and need the High Amp setting. Depending on the music either EQ 1 or EQ 2 are great, no distortion but you occasionaly can have too much bass (occasionaly). No matter what EQ setting though, this thing can really punch up the sound on the Tactics. Very nice.  Secondly, I know now why soundcards with built in headphone amps are often recommended on the forums.  When I hook the Fiio up, the sound is unbelievably better. Even with a Titanium PCIe soundcard this little box took what I consider to be great sound to begin with and added a level of clarity to the my music and games that is incredible. Plus, there are times that the sound can get 'muddy' no matter what I tinker with in the Creative settings. It really adds more dimension to the stereo/soundscape.  The only thing I regret is not getting the added battery and charger. It would be nice to have a battery charged on backup because I am sure this thing will get used 99.9% of the time.  But since it uses standard cell phone batteries, I can just order up one with a charger from Amazon.  Also, with the USB based male plug on the charger cable, I just plug it into my Ipod wall wart and away I go.  Four stars since it is still new. Gotta give a full week or so run down before slotting it up or down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun little game will keep you entertained for a solid 20 minutes. plus it is a free all so try it out
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the app is okay, but games are kinda boring, the only time i play this game is when i get really bored
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a funny app with lots of small games. it is suitable for all kids and adults. it would be better for less points to have those games.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Terrible, such a sad lazy rip off! The first one still makes me laugh, this one just makes me want my 4 dls. back.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is soo cool! I've been looking for something like this for free, for soo long... way to go! Works EXACTLY how I imagined it would
