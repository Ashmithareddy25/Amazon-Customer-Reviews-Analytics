0316044695|4.0|Marcus Luttrell tells the story of being the lone survivor of a SEAL team on a mission in Afghanistan. Luttrell tells how he became a Navy SEAL, the mission he was on, and how he survived.    I found the book to be a \\"page turner\\", meaning I kept turning the page to see what happened next. Luttrell narative isn't always the best pose wise, but he does get his story and feelings across.
0132350882|4.0|This book provides some really good principles that all developers can benefit from using.  If you have been developing software for any length of time, then some of the principles and techniques laid down in this book will not be very shocking.  But even if that is the case it is still a good refresher course.  After awhile if we are exposed to really bad code sometimes if wears off on us and this book can help you to shake off some of those bad habits you may have picked up.  For myself, I found that this book really hits the nail on the head when it talks about the importance of readability and good OOD.  As a developer that has maintained many legacy applications, I can appreciate the clear understanding these authors have of writing code that is not only functional but is maintainable. I also like how the authors walk you through the exercise of cleaning bad legacy code.  It really helps you learn the principles that are discussed in the first part of the book.  I also found the code snippets in the book to be very helpful and did not find many mistakes.  In general I would recommend this book to both new OO developers and even experienced OO developers just looking for some fresh insight into our craft.

The recordings and song arrangement were good, making for a pleasant listening experience.  We only wish this CD had included a few more songs.  We liked it, very glad we purchased this!
B0016MJ6T2|4.0|If you expect to watch a plot driven movie,this is not for you. This film uses a murder to draw you into the time of the Club Kids, a time when it only mattered if you were seen.<br /><br />I sat down to watch this out of boredom. I am not a fan of Macaulay Culkin and did not think I would last the entire film. Instead, after writing this review, I will be watching Party Monster again.<br /><br />This film is almost as much about the time as it is about the people. Michael Alig and James St. James happened to be the people who took us to the late 80s, early 90's pre-Giuliani New York night club scene in this film. My exposure to the Club Kids prior to viewing this film was limited. I had managed to see them on Joan Rivers and thought what they were doing was a cool idea, just living to be seen, in a sense. The young men and women were existing for the next party, the next person to give them attention and the next high (both natural and chemically induced).<br /><br />This movie transports you to a time and place that most of us will never experience, and it manages to do it quite well. The beginning and end did not fit in with the rest of the film and the attempt to bookend the film did not quite work out well, although the end did tie in reminder that Alig only cares for attention in case we had forgotten what his driving force is. I still found these scenes to be tacked on. They did help me travel from now back to the time period of the film and back again but it still seemed a bit disjointed.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this film is low budget. This was especially obvious in a couple of scenes that take place outside the club on the street. I could almost see the tape for the roped off area, the lack of natural foot traffic was obvious. The two main actors (Seth Green and Culkin) both had several scenes where it was clear they had not had time to work on practicing their lines, and that rehearsals were needed (the beginning of the first scene in the fast food joint comes to mind).<br /><br />I was surprised at the performances by Chloë Sevigny (yes, gay men can have friends that are girls), Dylan McDermott (who played an excellent role in Wonderland -- another low budget gem, around the same time) and Marilyn Manson as Christina.<br /><br />This is a good movie to view if you want to leave the world you are in for a couple hours, but a better budget would have really helped this film.int comes to mind).<br /><br />I was surprised at the performances by Chloë Sevigny (yes, gay men can have friends that are girls), Dylan McDermott (who played an excellent role in Wonderland -- another low budget gem, around the same time) and Marilyn Manson as Christina.<br /><br />This is a good movie to view if you want to leave the world you are in for a couple hours, but a better budget would have really helped this film.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|In my opinion Pixar is the gold standard for film quality. They have always excelled at bringing films that can and do appeal to all ages. Rarely is there a false note, Pixar leaves cloying to Disney. While I have enjoyed all the Pixar films, and have my favorites, no Pixar film is \\"bad\\". Both Wall*E and UP achieve an emotional resonance that is rare in live action films, let alone in a \\"cartoon\\". The only movie I have on my iPod is Wall*E-it's the only film I've bought with a digital download that I actually wanted to download. It would have been nice if Disney could have included a digital download with the regular DVD release. I don't own a Blue Ray player, so I can't comment on the kerfuffle going on with the 3 disc Blue Ray. I won't ding the film for what Disney does or doesn't do. I also don't feel the film, which was shown in 3-D in theatres will suffer from not being a 3-D disc. I saw \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" on disc at a friends house, on a big screen TV. I had a blistering headache at the end as I couldn't see the film in good registration. (I wear prescription glasses, so cheesy cardboard glasses present several difficulties for me.) 3-D is immaterial to UP. It was nice to see it in 3-D at the show, but it has no impact on the plot or action of the film on disc. There is no paddle ball moment in UP as there is in \\"House of Wax\\". This is a terrific film, and if you're a human being who isn't embarrassed to be moved by a movie, especially an animated one, then you should be able to enjoy UP. Everyone involved did a terrific job. This is an excellent film.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was sad, joyful, empowering, inspiring, hopeful and dark. It had a great ending, and wonderful characters. It had depth, and read like poetry at times. It my plain words, compared to the author's, this book was glorious. I love anything that is unique in concept, and this book is that. Spun words of magic about an miraculous little girl in a time of darkness.

B0007MVXQG|1.0|A long time since this album has come out, I decided to remove the dust and cobwebs and give it a second chance. I have to be TOTALLY honest...this is the same atrocity I skipped through the first and last time. Most of the songs are mindless chug...not even worth writing a track-by-track interview about. Absolutely NO creativity seeing as MOST of the songs are in the same key as well, not to mention a 5 year old could pick out where the chord progressions are going off the cuff. My biggest disappointment, however, is the modern mastering done to the songs. Something about all recordings from the 60's to early 90's that just has a complete feel to them is missing, and leaves the CD sounding empty.    I'd have to say \\"Angel\\" is the only song worth listening to, bringing me back to \\"Before the Dawn\\" times.    Overall, I give this CD a \\"2 Girls 1 Cup\\" rating....disgusting.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I'll make this brief.    The packaging is astounding. Each LP sleeve is faithfully reproduced, down to the last \\"Paul is dead\\" detail. Very nice collectible.    The sound is nice. The mixing, when compared to the stereo, is very different in many instances. It's fun to spot the differences. Does it sound better than the stereo versions? Some songs do and some don't. That's why you should really have both sets. To my ear, these sound more flat, overall. Very pleasant. The stereo has a little more punch in the low end and mid-range, but you have to tolerate the excessive separation and reverb that was applied by the engineers to accentuate the stereo \\"effect\\" of the earlier albums (Please, Please Me through Sgt. Pepper).    So, there you go. Buy both. Be happy. Yeah, they're pricey, but hey, you can't take your money with you when you die, right? Well, you can't take these either but...well, just buy 'em.
B002NHIK1E|5.0|I've read the books and fell head first into the characters and the world that L.J. Smith created, so I had certain expectations of this show. In seeing all the promotion and reading all the tidbits about the show and the cast before the show aired I set myself up to be disappointed. But I thought, 'Why not, it's free'. I have to admit that once I hit the play button and the show started, I was caught up in the world created for TV. Sure there are differences from the book, but you don't get caught up in that at all. I was instantly swept into the world of Mystic Falls and carried away by the actors portrayals of their characters...I really and truly have become a fan of The Vampire Diaries TV series and it all happened by watching this pilot episode.

B002NHBNWW|5.0|I truly enjoyed the pilot of the new series Vampire Diaries, the angle of the diary was a nice touch along with bits of history tying it in. Unlike the past series with a modern day vampire slashing at monsters, here the monster is within which made for a longing to connect. I will definately be a follower of the series, nice to escape in the love battles of good and evil for one hour a week.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you, like I was, are feeling overwhelmed by the choices involved here, let me try to help a bit.  First of all, you have to decide where you fit in the spectrum of Beatles fans.  Specifically, ask yourself, how were you introduced to the Beatles music?  For myself, I was 8 years old when Beatlemania made its way across the Atlantic in early 1964.  In the early 1970's, when I purchased most of the albums, the only choice were the American versions in stereo, which was really mono that was reprogrammed with echo, etc. to simulate stereo.  So, those versions were the ones that I became familiar with.    I bring this up because it really makes a difference how you originally heard these tracks.  I have no argument with the purists that claim that the mono releases are how the Beatles recorded them.  However, it was not how I and many others stateside were introduced to the Beatles.  So, when the CDs came out in 1987, I bought them all but was not only disappointed somewhat by the sound quality but many of the recordings were different.  Thank You Girl was missing much of the harmonica.  She Loves You, different than the one on the Beatles Second Album.  I'm Looking Through You, different intro, etc.  And, I wasn't crazy about the first four albums on mono.    Now, however, if you get the stereo remastered versions, you will hear these like the original American stereo albums had them, except much better.  There is absolutely no room for argument:  these remasters sound much better than anything ever before produced, including the original British LP's, which I own in a wonderful Beatles Box, that was released back in the 1970's so I have heard them at their previous best but these are much better!!    DO NOT HESITATE, GO OUT AND BUY EITHER THE STEREO OR MONO.    Now, if you were raised on the mono, go out and buy that.  However, if you don't want to spend the big bucks on the box, I have a hunch that the individual mono albums will soon be available for purchase.Second big bit of advice:  Unless you love the idea of having a cardboard box to put these in, don't spend $180 and wait three weeks for amazon to send them to you.  Go right now to Target this week and buy the stereo albums individually.  When you factor in the gift cards, it is a savings of over $30!!  And from what I can tell, there is nothing in the box set but the 14 albums and a box.  The individual albums all have the embedded videos.    I hope you enjoy listening to them as much as I have.  Best $150 I have spent in a long time.  BEATLES FOREVER!!!
1582701709|5.0|In my opinion, this is a book of inner awakening.  It is a confirmation of who you truly are. It confirms a realization of having the ability to create your lives in a very positive and affirmative way by the law of attraction which has existed from the beginning of times.  It's very soul searching and comforting.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I finally got this.  Christmas in September.  I have been off all week killing vacation time, and finally at 3:30 PM I see that my present has been delivered to my office.  Do I calmly stay home and wait until Monday, when I resume my normal work schedule, to retrieve my present?  Who am I kidding!  I packed up the dogs and drove the 30 minutes to the office to the best present I have had in a while.  I just started listening to this so this review will be edited over the course of the next several days.  While listening to Please Please Me (specifically Twist & Shout and I Saw Her Standing There)  it reminded me of listening to these songs on a transistor radio (I am 54 so do the math) and for those of you who are not familiar with them, you were not there in the beginning.  What a great sound!  Mono was what those of us who were introduced to The Beatles in late 1963 remember, and this CD immediately reminded me of being 8 years old and listening in my bedroom while doing my homework.  Like I said, I just started listening to these, but thanks to those who contributed in all the forums here who convinced me to purchase the mono set over the stereo set.  I don't think anyone who was a fan from the beginning will be disappointed.<br />This is off topic, but also pick up the re-mastered stereo Let It Be and Abbey Road.  You won't be disappointed.  If this box set put a dent in your wallet, ask for them for Christmas.<br />Oh, and the packaging is awesome!  Mine arrived shrink-wrapped to a cardboard base, factory-sealed, and in pristine condition.  Thanks, Amazon, for coming through for me.  I was originally notified that delivery would be September 21-September 25, and for those of you that missed the first round, please be patient - it will be worth the wait!
B002K8BLSA|4.0|This is a new album, recreated from the tapes begun in 1992, as a follow-up to Jordan, the Comeback.  Heavily laden with synths, which sound slightly dated, and a few too many religious references for my taste.  He calls it sort of a follow up to SMile.   \\"I put everything I had into the songs, some of which employ-funnily enough-overtly spirutal metaphors;music as a consoling force, an inspiration even\\" says Paddy in the liner notes.       The vocals are strong because the album was recorded in 1992. These are the demoes for the never to materialize CD by the four members.  The drums are cheesy, a drum machine programmed by Paddy.     The lyrics are the most complex and artfully written of any Prefab Sprout album.   \\"Music is a Princess, I am just a boy in rags..\\" is my favorite for this Friday morning.  Beautiful meoldies, ala Jordan, or Andromeda, but again, some 90s synths???  Great long instrumental passages, think of the suite in \\"Never Trust a Spell\\" which to me is the most beautiful five minutes of music I have ever heard, tied possibly with \\"Steal Your Thunder\\".  Well, \\"Earth, the story so Far\\" has a similar opening theme; \\"Earth, earth, the story so far. Welcome to EARTH!   \\"Science announced the only absolute is light, (Save Me, Love Me)   Wasn't that the message of the star on Christmas night?\\".  No \\"Who Let the Dogs Out?\\"   Jeez Louise, that's nice music.    My point is just a reference that the average buyer does not buy Prefab CDs for religion lessons.   5 stars. A worthwhile follow up to Jordan, one of the best CDs in the history of music.
0307588335|4.0|the first 3 chapters are exclusively devoted to the story of the author's life which is irrelevant to the title of the book and i wasnt the least bit interested in knowing anything about mr.mcdonald's personal journrey. however, it appears that the co-author's contribution begins in chapter 4 and what follows is an entertaining read. it does provide an inside glimpse into how much of wall street has people with staggering levels of stupidity, but who make tons of money anyways. i could go on and on about the fundamentally incorrect the model of wall street morons being rewarded for acts of idiocy while the rest suffer because of their mistakes, but sticking with the book - it gives you a one-sided version but engaging take on how lehman collapsed. i'd wait for another unbiased book on the topic to give you the actual story but for pure entertainment value this one is worth a read.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|I purchased this used dvd movie which was claimed to be \\"used, very good\\". The second half couldn't be played on any of my dvd players including those on my computers.    Lesson learned: don't buy used dvds.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|First heard and saw him on HD Network doing a concert, couldn't believe the range he has, the words to his music and the music itself. If you like a variety in your listening this guy has it from soulful to pop to reggae-ish to New Orleans blues like. And one song in the concert was a catchy tune, fun to listen to and yet I could only understand maybe a half dozen words in the whole song... am guessing it was new and not released yet, but I can't wait till it is, it was Awesome !!!

B001N26GFM|5.0|We have all heard of the horrors of concentration camps and seen some documentaries and feature films. But none of them could have the same impact as this film. That is because this movie looks at the Holocaust from the perspective of two children, one within the camp and one outside. Both are caught up in a chain of events dictated by circumstances beyond their control.   Even wars cannot stop children from becoming friends. Children have no enemies. Even as the Nazi propaganda machine denigrates Jews, Bruno, the eight-year-old son of a senior SS Officer forms a friendship with an eight-year-old boy in the concentration camp located just beyond their house. Both of them have little idea of what is going on. Genocide is a concept they know nothing about.  This movie evokes memories of the Italian movie Life is Beautiful, because they both focus on children caught up in war. But the message that emanates from The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is even more powerful. Life is not only beautiful, it is precious. How could a man with a family send so many innocents to their deaths? That is a pivotal point in the film. When Bruno's father realizes the futility of his actions, it is too late.  This is one of the best movies centered on World War II. There's not a gunshot in sight, but the smoke from the chimneys is all that is needed to show the depths to which man could sink in times of war. It will appeal to children and adults alike - this movie is a good teaching aid as well if you want to tell your children about the Holocaust. Shot on location in Hungary, the period costumes, cars and houses in the film look authentic. This a must-see for all.

0385495323|5.0|This book is not just for geeks!  It's very readable, no difficult math, plenty of figures supporting the text,  many witty asides.  Not the least bit dull.  It traces the development of message concealment - and discovery - from early times to the near-present, and credits those who played notable parts in this history.  Of special interest to me was the account of the WWII codebreakers at Britain's Bletchley Park, their methods, nachinery(!) and accomplishments.  The sheer wartime volume of intercepted encrypted messages meant that great numbers of men (and women) had to be recruited to Bletchley, and they had to be promising producers; you'll be amused at how they were chosen.<br /><br />I especially liked the long chapter on the decyphering of the Rosetta Stone and the \\"Linear B\\" texts, and the light that such cast on our knowledge of ancient civilizations, their societies and languages.

0399236201|4.0|After Ian Rider dies in a car accident, fourteen-year-old Alex Rider discovers that his secretive uncle was not in fact a bank manager, as he'd always said, but a spy who died while on a mission. Alex is recruited by MI6--not quite willingly--to take over where his uncle left off, trying to uncover the evil schemes of a billionaire philanthropist whose plans to benefit England's schoolchildren smell fishy.<br /><br />Stormbreaker is a sort of James Bond adventure for the 9-12 set. There's a version of \\"Q,\\" for instance--the man behind Bond's clever gadgets: Smithers equips Alex with a number of helpful goodies, including a pimped-out Nintendo GameBoy Color. The bad guy's an evil genius whose henchmen have inventive ways of disposing of enemies. And the villain also enjoys one of those Bond-ian, spill-all moments near the book's end, when he explains his master plan right before the hero's imminent death. (I love the fact that the madman's father is described as a \\"failed oral hgienist.\\")<br /><br />Stormbreaker is the first book in Anthony Horowitz's bestselling Alex Rider series. (The book was made into a 2006 film starring Robbie Coltrane and Alex Pettyfer.) I can understand the series' success. It's a good read, filled with action and decent writing. I would argue that a couple scenes in the book have credibility problems, but I wasn't too bothered by it. I'd certainly be willing to suspend my disbelief for as long as it takes to read the next installment.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
B002OPYUSM|4.0|This episode was funny.  It is clearly written by hollywood about hollywood, with alot of references to movies, and tv.  Particularly from the 80's.  I think it has the potential for being a great series.  Or falling flat by beating the same jokes and themes to death.      It has a Bill Murray, John Candy, Chevy Chase Movie from the 80's feeling.  It does this with deliberate self mocking by labeling various moments with Movies reference.      I liked it. The cast is large so hopefully they will expand in possibilities of the various characters and situations and not let it become old in 3 episodes.

0385342020|5.0|I have read each of the Sophie Kinsella NON-Shopaholic novels, and liked each one more than the last.  This one, however, had me completely smitten.  I truly lapped up every word, every new twist and turn.  I laughed out loud for pages at a time, and I cried huge tears at the end, partly for the story, and partly because I had to leave these characters behind.    The unfolds almost perfectly.  Every detail becomes, in some way, important to the plot and to the characters.  Not only has she crafted a fine romance and nice little mystery (perfect for grown-up fans of Nancy Drew books), but she has also created a unique and wonderfully grounded vision of what it must be like to live with a ghost who can only partly interact with our world.      Clever, funny, and genuine, this book has all of the characteristics of basic \\"chick lit\\" (first person storytelling, female protaganist, kissing) but it is so much more.  Like another fantasy classic, this novel is practically perfect in every way.

B002BSHXJA|4.0|The Beatles Mono Box Set  (Capitol/EMI, 2009)  --------------------------------------  This is a great collection of some of the finest pop music ever created, and the re-release of mono mixes is much welcome. When these records first came out, in the 1960s, monophonic sound mixing was the standard used for music that was intended to be broadcast on the radio (which was primarily dominated by lower-fidelity AM-band stations; FM did not become the standard until the 'Seventies). Mono mixes were loud, bright and punchy -- meant to be heard through a lot of static and other radio interference -- and the production style was particularly well-suited for the melody-and-rhythm-oriented pop-rock of the Fab Four.    It is kind of cheesy, though, that EMI has issued these mixes as an entirely separate (and rather expensive) box set, instead of doubling up the stereo and mono mixes on single CDs, as was done with the Beach Boys catalog. For some albums this would not have worked (the White Album in particular) but dual mixes of most of the early albums would easily fit on a single CD.  I'm sure many fans, who can't afford to shell out hundreds of dollars to get two copies of the same darn records, will wait for the next technological upgrade to get these mixes bundled together.  Right now it just feels as if EMI is simply taking advantage of the collector nerds, and squeezing out as much money as they can. (Axton)
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Pro:  - clear sound, especially drums and bass are now more powerful and better audible (at least as good as vinyl)  - great packaging, nice booklets with lots of pictures    Contra:  - panning problems are still there (vocals in 'Rain' ...could have been centered by creating a 'conservative remix' - no need to remix the whole catalog - only where obviously necessary, on some Rubber Soul, Revolver, Yellow Submarine tracks, e.g. 'Taxman', 'Hey Bulldog'...)  - no SACD or DVD-Audio (would have been a better limited time feature than the senseless mini-documentaries)  - Mini-documentaries to short and too little information (they could have been used better) - and the name 'Mini-documentary' shouldn't have been printed on the back cover beneath the tracklist (strangely they were less conservative in this issue as concerning the music)-also too much use of recycled material from the Anthology (e.g. Ringo's Anthology comment about Revolver 'we were well into the record...' was now recycled for Help!)    As a Beatles-Fan you need this box. These versions will remain the official ones for long. On a decent stereo system the sound quality is great - but on headphones you will not have a satisfying result (even if you do your own additional Audiomastering at home).
B0029NY9YO|3.0|The first half of this movie was pretty intriguing. I don't hold it against the director for making it rather Blade Runnerish. However, by the second half, forget it! Talk about convaluted! Christ Mr. Snyder, but most of the people watching this movie were raised on MTV and video games. Give us a break! I don't think Siskel and Ebert on their best day could follow the second half!    The more positive attribute is Jackie Earle Hailey's Rorschach. His performance demonstrated a perfect marriage of both the visceral AND the cerebral. THIS IS WORTHY OF AN OSCAR NOD!    Just curious: Who all out there besides me thought initially that Hollis (played by Stephen McHattie) was being played by James Remar (\\"Ajax\\" in \\"The Warriors\\")? I don't know if he's dead or alive, but if the latter, did casting consider him for this movie?

I purposely read the last part of the book very slowly because I did not want it to end.
B001QOGYFE|2.0|While many have found graphic novels to be an excellent template for film adaptations, not all of them translate well to the big screen. Sadly, such is the case with Whiteout, which suffers in everything from the major (lackluster characters, crippling flashback quantities) to the minor (shoddy special effects, blatant continuity errors). As Kate Beckinsale trades fangs and skintight leather for parkas, she also leaves the entertainment value out in the cold. At least the suspense is handled with some care, though the harsh weather is far scarier than the ice-pick wielding villain.<br /><br />A troubled past finds U.S. Marshall Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) stationed at a remote scientific research facility in Antarctica. With only three days left before the base is plunged into a six-month-long darkness, Stetko is called upon to investigate a mysterious sighting. Uncovering the mutilated body of a scientist, she must race against time to solve the murder before she's trapped with a killer in the coldest, most isolated place in the world.<br /><br />The flashback doesn't have to be a painful storytelling technique, but Whiteout manages to horrifically abuse the tool. In poorly derived moments the film flashes back to the opening scene, to hazy, orange-colored character establishing memories and, in perhaps the most idiotic moment, to less than one minute ago. It's nothing short of staggeringly insulting to the audience. Carrie's history has almost no affect on her ability to catch the killer and is so simple that it could have been summed up in a routine conversation. Early on, the film even misuses fading to black, repeatedly creating a disorienting sense of missing footage.<br /><br />Movies like 30 Days of Night or The Thing have already, more impressively, utilized an abnormally cold setting and toy with the viewer's fears of extreme isolation, distrust and paranoia. In Whiteout, claustrophobia, asphyxiation and being buried alive are also introduced, along with the common, location-specific \\"freezing to death.\\" What isn't so notable is the whiteout of the title, a snowstorm with 100 mph winds that prevent visibility beyond six inches. During the brief scenes dealing with the storm, the lack of sight is frequently anticlimactic, particularly when the blurry, fighting figures are nearly indistinguishable.<br /><br />Director Dominic Sena (Gone in 60 Seconds, Swordfish) must have been exceptionally proud of the special makeup effects department, donating generous amounts of screentime to disturbing shots of badly mutilated bodies. To make up for the grisly images is an immoderately gratuitous shower scene with Beckinsale that somehow produces no inappropriate nudity. Apparently the clarity inside a bathroom is as hindered as outside in the blizzard.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins-specific \\"freezing to death.\\" What isn't so notable is the whiteout of the title, a snowstorm with 100 mph winds that prevent visibility beyond six inches.

B00007LTIA|5.0|I guess I have a masochistic element in my psyche in that I often read negative comments on something before reading anything else especially if I am already favorably disposed to the item.  Because I love this album, I went straight to the negative comments first then the positive.  In the case of Tales from Topographic Oceans, the juxtaposition of the two tells an otherwise uniformed buyer how to decide their purchase decision.     If you really love Yes,    If any time you listen to a Yes composition, you find yourself wishing it would not end,  If in listening, you find yourself reacting to all the twists and turns in a given song,    If you appreciate, or even take pride, in that all the artists in the band are classically trained musicians,    If you find Yes lyrics compelling BECAUSE they are often inaccessible on the surface,   Or, if you are willing to take your idea of concept rock to entirely new place,  Then you will love this work.    Otherwise, it is likely not for you, and you can keep your unenlightened comments to yourself.    This was my first Yes album as a teenager.  If there is a downside to my love of this album in all it's musical glory and lyrical inventiveness, it is that I became so completely absorbed by the group through my formative years almost to the exclusion of other great artists of the time.  As I look back on my first experience with Tales, and I read the negative comments about its length and obtuse lyrics, I realize that what took me away was the ability to almost come to a meditative state (without any other external help) in trying to more fully appreciate it every time I listened to it.  And that is why I will buy it for the first time on CD -- I hope it can have the same affect on me some 38 years later.  Who couldn't use a little meditation in their day these days.

And Florence Welch and Co. produce a solid debut, \\"Lungs,\\" that blends delicate polished instrumentals and different genres -- there's little splatters of pop, punk and soul woven together, and cemented in place by Welch's lovely voice.<br /><br />It kicks off with the plucked intro of \\"Dog Days Are Over,\\" with Welch's sweet voice singing about \\"Happiness hit her like a bullet in the head/Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that.\\" While it starts off as soft, ethereal pop, the melody is swathed in eruptions of orchestral pop-rock -- it gets loud'n'catchy, with Welch yelling, \\"The doooog days are OVER-ER/the dooooog days are ALL DONE!\\"<br /><br />She continues the high note with \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up),\\" a scintillatingly colorful melody that sounds like a thunderstorm in a flower garden. After that she unleashes a bunch of other great songs: the soulful \\"I'm Not Calling You A Liar,\\" the urgent piano-pop of \\"Howl,\\" the wandering twangy \\"Girl With One Eye,\\" the bouncy wistful \\"Between Two Lungs,\\" and the sweetly macabre \\"My Boy Builds Coffins.\\" An especially fun one is \\"Kiss With A Fist,\\" a blazing punky tune that celebrates rough'n'passionate relationships (\\"You hit me once, I hit you back/you gave a kick, I gave a slap/you crashed a plate over my head/and I set fire to our bed!\\").<br /><br />But Welch and her revolving-door band really shine when the music overflows into a steady river of fiery rock'n'roll, wrapped in twisting gossamer synth and soaring rich vocals. \\"Howl,\\" the hymnlike \\"Drumming\\" and the bleak \\"Hurricane Drunk\\" all fit into this category -- and these are absolutely stunning songs, if not as immediately accessible as the catchier tunes.<br /><br />Florence and the Machine has a pretty unique sound -- there's a lot of punky rock'n'roll, a spattering of pop's catchiness, and some jazzy overtones woven into a few of the songs. As debut albums go, this is a pretty spectacular one, with a distinctive flavour that sounds like little else in modern music -- the closest comparison that comes to mind would be if Joanna Newsom formed a punk-rock band and went for pop stardom.<br /><br />In particular, Welch has a very pretty voice -- it's a little wavery and girlish, but she sculpts it into a flickering, roaring presence in the louder songs. And she has a knack for dark, evocative lyrics (\\"Louder than sirens, louder than bells/sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell!\\") with a quirky edge (\\"He's made [a coffin] for himself/One for me too/One of these days he'll make one for you\\"). There are a few lines that need some smoothing out, but not badly enough to distract.<br /><br />And the instrumentation from The Machine is a gorgeous accompaniment -- lots of rich, swirling instrumentals and straight-ahead rock'n'roll, usually depending on Robert Ackroyd's strong electric guitar and Christopher Lloyd Hayden's solid drumming. Isabella Summers wraps the album in gossamer-soft synth, and Tom Monger adds to the ethereal edge with a harp -- it also helps give it a more classical sound, rather than straight rock-pop.<br /><br />Florence and the Machine's debut \\"Lungs\\" really shows why this band has been getting so much attention across the pond -- it's passionate, eclectic and a lovely piece of work.

B000TEUSJK|3.0|I should not have been at all surprised at the Guccione film on the life of one of Rome's most notorious emperors, the infamous Caligula. The legendary decadence of Rome is exceeded only by Guccione's depiction of it -- excessive, often gratutious sex and cruelty were, I assume, intended to frame the story of the rise and fall of Caligula, certainly a 'man of his times'. The effort, however, is an uncomfortable mix of cinematic sexual indluence and the telling of the story of a decadent and corrupt Roman imperial state. The cast, including McDowell, Helen Mirrin, Sir John Gielgood, among others is exceptional; but, their efforts are frequently overshadowed by the directors obsession with putting his perception of sexual decadence on screen. It is as if there are two movies, here: a tale of a corrupt emperor of a #politically# decadent state, and a tableau of  sex, physical deformities, torture, executions and the like. What may have been shocking and riveting in the 1980s is fairly boring by the standards of the 21st century. Viewing this \\"nororious\\" film my reaction was 'been there, seen that'. I am sure that at its premier it caused gasps and empassioned deep breathing. Now it inspires bemused yawns.

0786838655|3.0|Reading this book so far, I can see why it's liked, especially by boys. It has a breezy, contemporary style (cf. Hilary Duff namechecks) that reminds me a bit of \\"Holes.\\" It's just a bit striking how familiar this might be for Harry Potter fans: an ordinary adolescent suddenly discovers he's a member of an over-race instead of a mere screw-up. He goes to a magical boarding school (here described as camp, even though people stay there for years) and embarks on a quest with two sidekicks, one a girl who knows everything (suggest anyone?) and one a guy who's a hapless source of comic relief (hi, Ron). Yes, he's even \\"The One.\\" There's even some Latin along with the ancient Greek for anyone who's been missing their daily dose of dead languages. On the other hand, Percy's a likeable guy and plot points are more screwball than deadly-serious, which will probably put this series on top for some readers, but nota bene -- you've been here before. Those who claim otherwise are thinking wishfully, but it won't ruin the story for most.

Crisp writing, compelling characters, and sharp, witty observations make it a must read. Flynn is a much-needed breath of fresh air. No near-perfect protagonists, no over-inflated egos. Not here. Camille Preaker is flawed ... seriously so, which in my opinion, makes her even more endearing. She is wonderfully complex, vulnerable, and deeply multi-dimensional--in other words, very, very real. You can't help but find her fascinating. But it doesn't end there. The other characters follow suit-- kind of like rich desert at the end of a satisfying meal. Some will make you laugh, others will make you reflect, but none will disappoint.<br /><br />If you like dark characters and even darker stories, this novel is for you.<br /><br />Flynn has a new fan.

B000NU2CY4|3.0|First things first:<br /><br />I have watched this Blu-Ray disc in my home theater environment. I am not reviewing this based on screen shots on a PC monitor. I really think this is the only fair way to truly evaluate a film, which is inherently a moving medium that is intended for viewing in a darkened, controlled environment.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Paramount's \\"Sapphire Series\\" has debuted with a double-barreled blast of action - Gladiator and Braveheart. But one of the rounds didn't fire, and I'm sorry to say it was this one (On the other hand, Braveheart is probably the finest HD video transfer of a 90's film EVER).<br /><br />Video is problematic throughout. The beginning shots of the film, which feature a text intro superimposed on a background of golden mist, betray serious color banding and posterization - usually a sign of Digital Noise Reduction or Edge Enhancement gone awry. And while DNR is tamed to some extent for the rest of the film, EE remains present throughout.<br /><br />Had these effects been present throughout the whole film, it might not have been as noticeable. However, the \\"Extended Edition\\" features scenes which were edited into the film from a 2005 master - and these shots show much more fine detail, much less edge halo, and better color fidelity. So it kind of slaps you in the face when you return to the film proper.<br /><br />I do not want to give the impression that I freeze-frame my way through an entire film looking for problems. I try to let it breathe, and if it is still a pleasing presentation despite flaws, to enjoy it on its own terms. \\"Gladiator\\" does deliver in this respect. I would say that 10% of the film, and not just the new footage, is competitive with some of the better Blu-Ray discs out there. Usually, the strongest elements are close-up shots of faces and armor. Well-lit scenes fare much better than dark ones, too, which is unfortunate, since Ridley Scott has such a dark, muddied hand for cinematography.<br /><br />But when it's bad, it's almost DVD-level bad. Medium and distance shots, especially the Rome fly-over upon Commodus' return as emperor, are positively CRAWLING with false information created by edge enhancement. Black levels also refuse to remain steady in darker scenes - some are nice and inky, while others are a gray mush.<br /><br />At its best, this BD looks better than the previous two DVDs. But at its worst, it aggravates anyone who truly craves top notch HD. If you're a casual user, this probably won't bother you terribly. But if you are an A/V junkie, be warned.<br /><br />The soundtrack is fine, in a generally well-balanced DTS-HD track.<br /><br />Extras include two strong commentaries, an EXTREMELY long and exhaustive making of feature on disc 2, and many, many, many small vignettes on Roman history, production, and all sorts of minutiae. It really is an impressive assortment, except that all, sadly, are in Standard Definition.<br /><br />So essentially, Paramount did everything right with this edition of Gladiator, with one small exception - the film itself.<br /><br />The Film:<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"Gladiator\\" has not aged well. This is probably more a statement about me than about the film. When I first saw it, I found it an engaging swords and sandals affair with a nice historical flair and a rousing storyline. I've now seen it a good 10 times, though, over the past 10 years. I'm sad to say I now find it rather trite and pat Hollywood storytelling, especially when contrasted with the much more interesting real history of Rome.<br /><br />To be fair, as Russel Crowe bellows in the protagonist's role, \\"are you not entertained?\\" It's still a rousing action spectacle. Crowe is an action star par excellence, as well as a fine dramatic actor. Joaquin Phoenix cuts a dashing and creepy figure as the villain, Commodus. Various supporting characters are also nicely portrayed.<br /><br />But it just rings so empty. Many characters are posterboard cut-outs, only serving to advance the plot, without an internal life of their own. If you want to see a telling contrast, watch Stanley Kubrick's \\"Spartacus,\\" another gladiatorial epic. Granted, that film has the likes of Kirk Douglas, Peter Ustinov, and Laurence Olivier, who would have to strain to make a bad movie, but still. As they say, \\"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.\\" Well, it's just not on the page here.<br /><br />Much of the problem, in my opinion, rests with the film's utterly ham-fisted treatment of historical events (another Scott dud, \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" suffered the same faults). There really was a Commodus who succeeded Marcus Aurelius, and he really did fight in a few gladiatorial games. But that's where the film departs with reality. The writers seem dead-set on draining the real events and persons of all possible subtlety, and on reducing the story to a trite hero-vs.-villain tale, in which the heroes fight for democracy, and the villains want to french-kiss their sisters (See also: \\"300\\".)<br /><br />In the end, it's a big, dumb action spectacle. If decapitations and gushing spurts of blood are your thing, you will not be disappointed. Perhaps that's all I wanted when I was 20. But I guess I'm older and wiser now, and I need my entertainment to suit those things, too.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I am rating this Blu-Ray on the quality of the disc itself, not on the film. I may just be in a curmudgeonly mood at the moment on the content. It is still entertaining. Maybe it will even inspire a viewer or two to research the real story.<br /><br />But as a Blu-Ray, consumers should know what they're in for. A/V enthusiasts will find a disc that only meets the standards of some of the early Blu-Rays from 2006. It is by no means a perfect presentation. It also seems unlikely that Paramount will re-issue this disc any time soon. So it's a tough recommendation.<br /><br />If you're a more casual viewer, however, or if you have a smaller screen (40 inches or less), the faults of this transfer will probably not be as evident or mean as much to you.<br /><br />So call it a qualified recommendation with a caveat emptor for the enthusiast crowd.<br /><br />Are you not entertained?watch Stanley Kubrick's \\"Spartacus,\\" another gladiatorial epic.

B0007PALZ2|4.0|Director Terry Gilliam got his start doing animated shorts for the British comedy program Monty Python and then directing their feature films. An early non-Python project, Brazil, nevertheless contained Python cast members. No pythons were harmed during the making of Twelve Monkeys, but the same can't be said of the audience members. Look at Twelve Monkeys as a cinematic experiment that ultimately failed, but valuable information was gleaned from the experience, mostly about what not to do.<br /><br />First, if you are going to have a post apocalyptic scenario where all but a small percentage of humans are killed and the ones who survive live like worms underground, don't factor in time travel as a plot device, because it is just not believable that such a society could achieve time travel, given their obvious setbacks. Next, don't cast Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt (more about them later), and third, have a less ambiguous ending, where they either save the world, or not, but don't leave the whole thing unresolved, where you have to question what was the point, if any, of this novel cinematic experience.<br /><br />I can vouch for Gilliam. Brazil was quite inventive and creative, and The Fisher King was fantastic. Great performances from Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges in The Fisher King, but more important than any individual performance, the movie worked as a whole. Would that the same could be said of Twelve Monkeys.<br /><br />----------------------<br />James Cole: I'm here about some monkeys.<br />Jeffrey Goines: Monkeys?<br />James Cole: Monkeys. Yes. Twelve of them.<br />===========================<br /><br />James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner with a violent past who is 'volunteered' to go back to the past to find out how the deadly epidemic started, and how was the virus spread. He gives his usual smug action hero performance with just a touch of self mockery, to fool you into thinking that he doesn't take himself too serious. But he does take himself way too serious, and so all the smug mugging and ironic winks are for naught. \\"All I see are dead people,\\" he says at one point. Whatcha talkin' 'bout, Willis? Is this meant to mock his role in The Sixth Sense? If so, then that is a pretty clever little joke -- but not clever enough to save this film.<br /><br />-------------------------<br />James Cole: I'm looking for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.<br />===================================<br /><br />James (Bruce Willis) Cole ends up in a mental institution where he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). On the way in, we see a television monitor where some of the patients are watching Tex Avery cartoons. This is way too heavy handed symbolism to show that Brad Pitt is going to be acting like a cartoon. Just like Johnny Depp based a character on Pepe La Peu crossed with Keith Richards, it seems that Pitt has a similar design in mind for Jeffrey Goines. Was he trying to simultaneously play both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd? There were moments of brilliance, but overall it just didn't work. Brad just dug himself deeper and deeper into a Pitt.<br /><br />-----------<br />L.J. Washington: I don't really come from outer space.<br />Jeffrey Goines: Oh. L. J. Washington. He doesn't really come from outer space.<br />L.J. Washington: Don't mock me my friend. It's a condition of mental divergence. I find myself on the planet Ogo, part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on Pluto. But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in every way, nevertheless Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?<br />==================<br /><br />That was a tremendous scene but the character of L.J. Washington is just a throw away. It would have been a much better movie if it had followed L.J. Washington's divergences instead of Pitt's and Willis' amateur attempts at acting.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|After two decades of The Beatles musical output on Compact Disc becoming sonically obsolete as well as latter day compilations (Anthology,The Beatles 1,Yellow Submarine Songtrack,Let It Be...Naked,The Capitol Box 1 and 2,Love)and remastered solo works, making the initial 1987 CDs sound more archaic,The arrival of both Stereo and Mono boxed sets couldn't have come at a better time.  When comparing the two sets,Mono wins hands down as these mixes were given more attention to detail while stereo was treated as a novelty,knocked out in relatively little time.But as recording technology of the day became more advanced, mono became an endangered species.The Beatles \\"White Album\\" was the last album to be released in mono, as well as the Get Back/Don't Let Me Down single.   As for the Stereo Box,not only are we treated to remastered sound, but a DVD of the making of each album,improved packaging and the first four albums in stereo (released on CD in '87 in mono,but many songs made their stereo CD debut on the Capitol Boxed Sets).Well worth the money due to the care and attention to detail.   The only flaw in the collection is the decision to use the classic mixes instead of remixing for this age of 5.1 surround.The Yellow Submarine Songtrack from 1999 remixed many songs from the movie which makes the tracks sound more superior  than the original mixes which used \\"Sound Separation\\" in the stereo spectrum (example, Drums and vocal in the left channel,Guitars and background vocals on the right with nothing in the center) which lacks the fullness of the mono mix.No more evident than the first two albums (Please,Please Me and With The Beatles) which were recorded on two tracks on the former and not yet got a grasp of the four track on the latter.   The Stereo Box,definately the more commonly available of the two will be in most Beatlemaniacs music collection,but maybe in a decade or two someone will finally remix the music more befitting to the technology of music reproduction.

As for the Mono Box,after being spoiled by the stereo mixes, the mono mixes offer an insight into the Beatles music as it was meant to be heard.Many songs benefit from not only the fuller sound, but nuances that have gotten lost in  the stereo mixes which used \\"Sound Separation\\" in the stereo spectrum (example, Drums and vocal in the left channel,Guitars and background vocals on the right with nothing in the center) which lacks the fullness of the mono mix(differences heard in the more prominent bass,vocal reverb in Paperback Writer,and the sped up She's Leaving Home).   The only flaw in the collection was the decision to not only make this a separate, more limited boxed set when combining both mono and stereo on one disc would've made more sense (with the exception of Pepper and White Album which would've broken the 80 minute disc limitation).   The Stereo Box,definately the more commonly available of the two will be in most Beatlemaniacs music collection,as this collection will be for those who want to hear the Beatles as they were intended to be heard.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I just bought this set today - and paid too much for it at K-Mart ($40.00). But I'm happy anyway. I came home and immediately played the first disc on a blu-ray player and an LCD widescreen (32 inch). When this saga ever comes out on real blu-ray, I can't imagine how it is going to be any better than the clarity of this set. Although I was there (32 years ago) for the original release and remember very well the awesome impact of the original, I like the expanded edition and the upgraded special effects. Sometimes, when you go back to a movie you loved, you find the effects dated and disappointing. So hats off to Lucas for doing the work to keep his beloved trilogy current and entertaining. It's also convenient to have the thin cases to make room in an overstuffed bookcase. As for the content, which practically everyone knows, Star Wars is a fairy tale of good guys, evil villains and magic enchantment. To be honest, I prefer it to the prequels where good guys go bad and the innocent suffer. My advice: sell your old copies here on amazon and buy this set.

B000008H24|4.0|I've been listening to Tull forever and pretty much all their albums stand the test of time rather well. I still try and watch them live every chance I get and have often driven long distances to do so. War Child is an excellent album that always sounds fresh every time I listen to it. The hallmark of good music is that it sounds good every time you listen to it, even if it is after several years. My personal favorite is Sealion.
0786915749|5.0|I thought Dragons of Autumn Twilight was a thoroughly enjoyable book. The beginning of the book will be a little slow since the author is spending most of that time giving detailed descriptions on the main characters but it picks up quickly. It is left open for the next in the series but the ending is satisfying enough for the end of the first book. There is a lot that happens that makes the story seem hopeless, but there are other characters that are comic relief and create a feeling of hope. There are dwarfs, elves, dragons and other people and creatures. Some are easily recognized but others are not. It was a very fun fantasy book.
B000006O7C|5.0|[[ASIN:B000006O7C Sketches (For My Sweetheart the Drunk)]]I purchased the 2 disc edition of Sketches. The first disc: Sky is a Landfill,Everybody Here Wants You, Opened Once, Nightmare by the Sea, New Year's Prayer, You & I, is easy and makes for very enjoyable listening. These recordings were done with Tom Verlaine as producer. Listening to the first disc, naturally causes one to speculate on which direction Jeff was musically growing in his astonishing professional development. Most of the songs strike me as less musical, not as instrumentally active, as those in Grace. Some have noted that his vocals are less elastic than in his previous album. However, one must always remember that what is found in Sketches are unfinished, rejected products. Jeff was dissatisfied with the Verlaine recordings, and did not want these songs released. He decided to start over with Andy Wallace as producer, but alas, that was not to be. Because Jeff rejected these songs, no judgement can legitimately be drawn, based on what one hears, as to whether Jeff was musically moving to a more \\"metallic\\", less vocal genre or not. We will never know just what Jeff disliked about the Verlaine recordings and what he eventually would have created in their place.<br /><br />The lyrics of Buckley's music have always impressed me as at first difficult to understand, and therefore, slow to evoke emotion. However, with repeated listening, they become easier to decipher and take hold in one's heart and soul. So it is with these lyrics.<br /><br />The second disc featuring, Haven't You Heard, I know We Could be so Happy, Murder Suicide Meteor, etc., is very difficult to listen to, and should not have been published. The recordings are nothing more than raw, very raw, demos. For percussion effects, for example, Jeff would tap on the microphone. There is no backup instrumentation. Jeff would simply, and justifiably, have been mortified to have these rudimentary works released to the public.<br /><br />I have rated \\"Sketches\\" very highly, based on the first disc. Though, as I have indicated, I am ambivalent despite the more developed, polished state of this disc. It is natural for any listener, any fan of Jeff's, to inevitably draw inferences based on what one hears in Sketches, about what would have been, could have been, in Buckley's future, had he lived. Yet, hopefully the listener will remember that these songs, being rejected versions, do not really represent Jeff Buckley music.  Moreover, Jeff was a perfectionist, and would have been opposed to any release of unfinished works. As for the second disc, I recommend that it be ignored: it is nothing less than an insult to Jeff Buckley's memory. In my humble opinion, his mother, the executor of Jeff Buckley's estate, has acted quite unwisely, and has done her son, my favorite musician, a great disservice in allowing release of this disc.<br /><br />Despite my stated reservations, however, I recommend the first disc. Jeff was a singular artist of enormous potential. The likes of him come all too infrequently. Therefore, enjoy whatever scraps he has left behind. As musician and Jeff Buckley fan, Duncan Sheik, has quipped, even his failures (in Jeff's own eyes), are my favorite songs.<br /><br />Love you, Jeff.highly, based on the first disc.

0064407667|3.0|Not my cup of tea. I don't like the fact that there isn't a single adult that listens to the kids and that there is no hope for a better tomorrow for the kids. The author tells you through the hole story that things wind up horribly for the children. I also didn't like the fact that the main bad guy in the story physically and emotionally abuses the kids.     Although I did not like the story the author is a great writer and I enjoyed his brief moments where he lightens the mood with his explanations about words and their meanings and the context they are being used in. If you, or your child, want a happy ending or a glimmer of hope this may not be the book to read.

B0000028WD|5.0|This album really shows how broad Bob Dylan's influence has been in the music world. The list of performing artists reads like a who's who of most major music genres.  While I can't say I love all the performances (the Carter/Cash rendition of \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\" comes to mind), the majority of them are marvelous and one may never hear these renditions again.  I had this album on Cassette but had to get it on CD as well.  This album is a great buy for any Dylan fan.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I have listened to ALL the CD's in this remastered set and have read most the reviews posted here,there and everywhere    :o)  For All you \\"nay sayers\\" I have only one thing to say, You'd find something wrong with a \\"sunny day\\",not a happy bunch are you ?  Now, I have listened (played) Beatles songs for 45 years, Through all of it's recording formats,including mono/stereo .You name it.  When the CD versions made their appearance in the early 80's they left alot to be desire, the sound was flat,missing alot of the unique sounds  from the analog vinyl.   Well !,  CD digital technology has come a long way in 30 years so the old argument about analog being superior (sound) does not exist anymore.  The remastered Beatles CD's are stellar in every possible way. The highs,the lows (frequencies)are ALL there. You could not ask for (better) more.  You have to Thank the many talented people that obviously worked so very hard to remaster these Beatles Masterpieces, a reality of pure listening Pleasure.  And finally, all you (The Beatles Fans) people have to THANK     \\"John,Paul,George, and Ringo\\" because without THEM there would not have been \\"The Beatles\\".(music).  nuf said,.....................
B002NHIK1E|5.0|When I watched the first episode, I wasn't really sold on this show, but I kept watching.  It just got better and better and better, and I ended up loving it.<br /><br />I thought at first that it was maybe taking a bit much from the old Dark Shadows, but as the story developed, that was certainly  not the case.<br /><br />Ian Somerholder as Damon is GENIUS.  He's totally hot too.  He has become my favorite vampire EVER.<br />The show has a typical love triangle.  Girl, Elena, with 2 brothers.  As the show progresses, I came to realize there was another triangle here too - the love between the two brothers is a very constant element and struggle in the show.<br /><br />Great writing, lots of eye candy, great lines - all in all a very entertaining show.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|I've always been a casual Beatles fan, but over the past 5 years, they've truly become one of my all-time favorite  bands. So when the remastered catalog was announced to arrive on 9/9/09, I decided to buy them all!  The first one I want to review is my favorite Beatles album, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\".     Before I get to the sound quality, I want to address the packaging. The packaging is near perfection. I have  a friend that proudly owns all the original vinyl releases and these packages reproduce all the great album  art, along with new photos and expanded liner notes. The insert booklets are printed on heavy stock, uv coated  paper that are top-shelf! The digi paks are also printed on heavy stock uv coated paper. Unfortunately, where  they fall short is that instead of using a plastic clear tray to place the disc in, they slide into paper sleeves.  I know everyone wants to go green, and ditch using plastic, but every time you remove the disc from the sleeve,  you risk scratching the disc. This is my only complaint with all the remasters. I've solved the problem by storing  each disc in a separate paper CD-R sleeve to preserve the disc. Use the paper sleeve insert at your own risk!    Now, for the sound quality. Some folks will love it, some will be indifferent and some will hate it, but I love  the new sound of the recordings. I don't have much to compare them too, because I only owned   [[ASIN:B000002UAU Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]], [[ASIN:B000002UDB Magical Mystery Tour (1990)]]  and [[ASIN:B000002UB6 Let It Be (1990)]], but to me they sound brighter and more vibrant than before.  The biggest change is that the recordings are noticeably louder than previous releases. And, to me, they  sound like they were recorded today, with still retaining their vintage 1960s sound, if that makes sense.  I've picked up on little things and sounds that I never noticed before. The cleaner sound also reveals more  of the live feel that these recordings had - as compared to the computer driven quest for perfection that  all of today's music sound likes. You'll hear the sounds of fingers making chord changes, the little sounds  that a live drummer will make, etc.. The music, to me sounds more alive and vibrant than it ever has. Bottom line:  the recordings retain their vintage sound, but have been polished using 21st century digital audio technology.  Guy Massey & Steve Rooke did an excellent job of preserving the integrity of the original 4 track recording of  Sgt. Pepper. On Sgt. Pepper, I thought \\"A Day in the Life\\" really benefitted from the remastering process. That  song sounded completely new to me thanks to the clearer sound. I'm hearing all kinds of little details in that song  I've never heard before!    Overall, if your a vinyl purist (nothing wrong with that) or someone that frowns down on remasters, than chances  are, the remasters are not for you, but for a new generation of listeners that are discovering the Beatles for the  first time (thanks to these remasters & [[ASIN:B001TOMQUS The Beatles: Rock Band Limited Edition Premium Bundle]])  this is an excellent starting point for what many regard as the world's greatest band. And for my money, there's no better  album to start your Beatles education with than Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
B000NQRE0K|3.0|Braveheart is and always will be one of those \\"stuck on an island, what 10 movies would you take\\" films.  UPDATE:  Mel has turned into and maniacal racist, causing me to have a 'metallic-taste-in-the-mouth' feeling about all of his films.  Having said that, and witnessing what can be done with respect to older films (james bond films come to mind), i was somewhat disappointed with the final product.  Comparing this BluRay production to, say, Thunderball, there is no comparison.  They could have digitally mastered this movie, frame by frame, to remove noise, correct fade, etc.  They obviously didnt.  I was hoping this would be the version i could rely on for a long time.  [...] It does have TrueHD sound which makes a difference, but the video side looks like it was just a straight-up transfer.  In short, they didnt process the film at all, at least thats my take.

B000YPUFA6|2.0|Too many things that make no sense make this difficult to get emotionally invested.  E.g. the desert installation has a chain link fence that can hold up against 500+ zombies leaning on it, with no zombie even climbed it (we know they can do it per the first 2 movies).  Where did this batch of zombies come from anyway? The installation supposedly was isolated from the start, so how did the zombie figured this out (w/ no brains).  The corpses of the cloned Alice stay nice and fresh for days on end.  Out in the open desert.  With no crows eating them.  Why do they have to throw them in a ditch--why not just chuck it over the fence and feed the zombies (help a brother out).  That's just in the first 10 minutes of the movie.    action sequences are so-so, nothing that hadn't been done the last two times.      Quality of the video transfer is excellent with very few undesirable enhancements.     The sound seems too clean, lacks a desert ambiance.  E.g., Alice's voice over of what happened to the world lack a desert grittiness, sounded like a nice voice over in an expensive studio.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Prime Cuts:  I Didn't Know My Own Strength, Million Dollar Bill, A Song for You<br /><br />Whitney's \\"Look\\" is worth more than a million dollar bill.  After three and half years in the making, \\"I Look to You\\" not only lives up to its hype, it's also the crowning magnum opus in Houston's hit studded portfolio of albums.  By enlisting a red carpeted list of music industry's greatest luminaries such as Diane Warren, Alicia Keys, David Foster, R. Kelly, and Akon as the album's producers and writers, label chief Clive Davis and Houston herself have all cylinders out this time.  Care is not only taken to ensure that every single track here is worthy to be a hit single, but that there's something for everyone across the entire spectrum from big-voiced signature ballads, to trendy R&B blinkers, to stately pop anthems, and to catchy dance anthems.  Nevertheless, what is the apogee of this new disc are Houston's soaring pipes which are at the up-front.  Never lethargic or understated, Houston invests herself so much in each song that she sings as though each song is her life statement--this is passionate singing at its most glorious best.<br /><br />The album gets off to a good start with the Alicia Keys' penned \\"Million Dollar Bill.\\"  A potent feminine anthem about not settling for second best, the sizzling \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" brings Houston back to the dance floor with a retro vibe harkening back to her \\"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\\" days.  \\"Call You Tonight\\" will have the kids eating out of Houston's hand.  Cushioning by some trendy beats, this R&B mid-tempo \\"Call You Tonight\\" finds Houston cruising along in her velvety best.  Stretching out of her comfort zone, Houston sways with the palm trees in the company of Akon on the tropical-sounding song of reconciliation \\"Like I Never Left.\\"  Shedding at least 20 years off her age, \\"For the Lovers\\" is a youthful clubber that is destined to be a future crowd puller.<br /><br />Described by Clive Davis as \\"the greatest balladeer of all time,\\" Houston lives up to her encomium with the Diane Warren-penned \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength.\\"  Autobiographical of Houston rise from a debauched life of abused substances and a failed marriage, \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" is testimonial of the strength of human spirit.  Houston's performance here is first class punctuating each syllable with strong willed aplomb.  The title cut \\"I Look to You\\" is the big ballad--an inspirational piano-led ballad about finding solace in God despite a turbulent past.  Though written by R. Kelly, Houston sings it as if it's her life's anthem: the way she nuances her hope in God in the midst of her pain is just life transforming.  A wizened Houston imparts her knowledge of what constitutes true love in the infectious \\"Worth It.\\"<br /><br />No Whitney Houston CD would ever be complete without at least one cover.  And Houston is one of the few elite who have a way of tackling her covers in such a way that dwarf the originals.  The buzz here is Houston's take of Leon Russell's \\"Song for You.\\"  Starting off slow before exploding into a dance anthem with Madonna-esque European beats, this is truly a highlight.  Listen especially to the way this Grammy winning diva holds her notes is just breathtaking.  Trendy without selling out, heartfelt without going mawkish and bombastic without going overboard, Whitney Houston is still the voice of the music world.  With songs this good, Whitney Houston is indeed back.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|If you can't tell a huge improvement in the sound quality over these remasters and the 87 releases then I'm really puzzled.  Like many of the folks out there I've owned the Beatles music on all the formats over the years. Album, eight track, cassette, and of course on the day they were released in 1987, CD.  I think these stereo remasters sound beautiful.  I think it's like a fog has lifted over the music to let it really shine through.  I don't listen to headphones so the whole stereo seperation issue is not a problem.  Good speakers and proper speaker placement render this so called problem resolved.  I own the mono box set too and it's fantastic also.  To compare the two is like comparing apples to oranges.  One other thing.  It really bothers me to see people who don't even own this set review it.  I'll never understand that.  Be happy and enjoy the music.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Great!  absolutley the best remaster I have seen in a black and white film.  The razor shapness and brightness brought about by High Def Blue Ray makes viewing this movie better then ever!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Having been a Beatles fan since I was kid in 63 and having owned many of their mono albums I couldn't be happier with this fine set.  I own quite a few Japanese import CDs and nobody can match the care and detail given to the mini LP design that the Japanes are capable of.  Glorious sound and beautiful presentation.
0740748475|5.0|My son wanted this.  He got a lot of cash for his birthday, and reasoned that he should be able to buy something with some of it (we normally put it all in his untouched savings account).  So, we got it for him.  He read it all in about four to five days.  Didn't feel like we got a whole lot for about a hundred bucks, since he read it so fast.  But, it IS a collectable set.  Not exactly a bunch of paperback editions, which are more for the casual reader.  And we knew exactly what we were doing when we ordered it.  It was splurging for the sake of a birthday gift.  If you're not a collector, or not looking to get an uncommon or extra-special gift, then don't get this.  Otherwise.... go for it.
B001NS063E|5.0|This was my first Dire Straits purchase back in 1979. I literally wore out the grooves on it. No release of their's or Marks has taken me like this one did. In fact I rate it as one of my favorites of all time. Every song is exceptional.    I was at the time anti-pop and Sultans of Swing had attracted me to the band because of Mark Knopflers soaring guitar riffs. \\"Communique\\" had just been released and \\"Lady Writer\\" was getting some airplay (it was released as a single). I was not immediately sold on the album. I liked it, but was buying records at a rather fast pace in those days. Communique grew on me quickly, though.    This record is an excellent example of what album making USED to be all about. It has a great flow to it. The songs seem to be made to follow one another. Add in that marks songwriting was the best of anyone at the time and the overall talent of the group and we have one excellent album.    Make no mistake Mark Knopfler was recognized by a great many musicians at the time. Jerry Garcia, Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton all revealed Dire Straits to be a favorite new band. They were so much so, that Dylan and Clapton covered his songs.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I started reading the book series before watching the first season. Each Season is equivalent to a book. The tv show is great and addicting, My sister and I couldn't stop watching, and everyone who I introduced the DVDs to got hooked right away. The only downside about the TV series, is that it is ALOT different from the books, it seems like they just kept the main characters and there characteristics the same and change the story line. It is still a great show and worth buying, but I still perfer the books.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|We love watching the video... It is the best and really takes you back in time when MTV actually played videos.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like this DVD.  It's been hard to stay with it though.  It is tough on your body.  One complaint... I gained weight instead of lost.  My body shape changed and I could wear some smaller clothes, but I gained weight both because of muscle and I was SOOO HUNGRY all the time!  Good purchase, WAY better than the gym.  Try it out.... if its not for you, just use it as a way to warm up to the gym.  Definitely worth the money.  :)
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Though an avid music fan, I'm by no means an \\"audiophile\\" who has the latest amazing stereo system or who really worries about things like that, but even I noticed the lesser quality of the 1987 Beatles CDs. Despite owning all of those albums, I felt it was worth it to buy them again in their newly remastered form. I was worried that the box set would arrive and the improvement would be so little that it wouldn't much matter, so I was more than a little relieved when I put in the first disc, \\"Please Please Me,\\" and heard The Beatles in the cleanest, purest sound I've ever heard from my pretty ordinary SONY speakers. These CDs really do sound better.<br /><br />Some people don't like that the albums have been remastered, rather than remixed. I personally like the way The Beatles used extreme separation in their stereo mixes, putting voices and instruments far from each other in the mix. I enjoy the way you can make out the individual components of the playing, so I'm glad they didn't change that particular aspect.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that the soft digipaks were used for each album, rather than a sturdier standard plastic case. Given the frequency that I listen to CDs at home - and these are sure to be in high rotation - I'm not wild about the idea of sliding the CDs in and out of their cases. The booklets, however, are a high quality, glossy paper, and the original liner notes for the earlier albums are really fun. The box, too, is not just some cheap-o job. It's a sturdy box with a nice, basic design.<br /><br />The bottom line for me is that The Beatles' albums - the best recordings of all time - have been gathered in one place and made to sound even better. If that's not a 5-star product, then I just don't know what is.

1442135034|1.0|The book is great, but this edition, by Classic House Books, is unacceptable.  It looks home-published from cover to cover, including the ridiculous blurb on the back and the junior high graphics.  The real problem, though, is that I am now up to page 26 and the typos have been so numerous it's really almost unreadable--after just encountering the word \\"furtile\\" I had to stop and write this review.  What's the point of this edition?? Buy a different version, reader!

The price was fare and the delivery came faster then expected. if I were to order something again I would order through this place.
0312360266|4.0|Do not expect this to be a series that is a literally genius (even for the fantasy/horror genre). The storyline is cool and the characters are interesting. The love interests are a little over played in the series, there is a definite need to tone that down. I have no idea why I am so addicted to this series! I think the writing is very poor , but I love it.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|ABBEY ROAD has benefited greatly from Appel Records remastering project. Due no doubt cos it was originally recorded on 8 track, less bouncing of tracks allowed greater clarity in the final mix. If you want to get an idea what this remastering improvement sounds like, and you have the \\"BEATLES ONE\\" CD (the red one with yellow \\"1\\"), compair COME TOGETHER and SOMETHING off your original Abbey Road CD, with the same songs with 24 bit remastering from BEATLES ONE. Immediately the 24 bit remastering songs from 2000, give a preview of the HUGE difference this remastering is providing. First off, there's greater compression, increasing the overall LOUDNESS on the remastered ABBEY ROAD CD.  It makes the bass PUNCH, and DRIVE, as well as the bass drum, and floor toms. As far as the sonic improvement, the remaster provides greater clarity across the board. Everything from the bubbles on OCTOPUS'S GARDEN, to the MOOG playing that George smothered the album with, the improved sound's clarified and distinct, especially apparent during quiet passages.  When you wear glasses and you put them on, everything you saw previously as blurry and undistinguishable, suddenly becomes recognizable and defined. That's what the remasters acomplish with sound, instead of sight. Think of the remastering as a new pair of glasses, and a brighter light bulb, that lets you \\"SEE\\" Abbey Road with 20/20 vision.  I keep hearing sounds and instruments I'm SURE I'd never noticed before. You can hear John say \\"shoot me\\" during COME TOGETHER. (Its most noticable the last time he says it over the lead-in bass figure, just before the verses start.) The only improvement that could possibly happen from here sonically, would be to REMIX into a 5.1 DVD AUDIO format, something like the DVD sound on the newly remastered YELLOW SUBMARINE film.  But I dont think that APPLE RECORDS will do that anytime soon. The guys at APPLE worked hard on this remastering, especially since the 1987 remastering had such a bad reputation with so many, for its cold, overly bright EQing.  I'm convinced everything possible to make the new CDs reflect what's on the analogue mixtapes WAS done.<br /><br />I'd like to say a word or two about the new packaging, artwork, and quicktime mini documentary.  Like all the remasters except the double CD packages, the CD covers open into a three panel triplyct. When you open the inner panels, you find photos from the Beatle's last photo session. (Two of the photos provided the front and back of the HEY JUDE album cover, along with a third photo from the August '69 photo shoot.) Like the whole remastered series, it's tastefully designed. But my disappointment was the booklet that came with the ABBEY ROAD remaster. Its only 16 pages long! MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, SGT PEPPER, WHITE ALBUM all had booklets literally TWICE that size. (38 pages long.) REVOLVER's booklet was 34 pages, so skimping on ABBEY ROAD's booklet is uncalled for. I'm sure they could have put the lyrics in it, or had extended recording session notes.  I'm not knocking what IS in the booklet. Most the pictures stem from the last two Beatles photo shoots (AUG and APRIL 69), as well as outtakes from the album cover photo shoot. Also in the booklet are the two short essays, duplicating the format in all the booklets for the Remastered CDs. The first essay explains the historical perspective of the album, and its place in the Beatle's discography, followed by a short essay about recording technics and/or innovations used on the album. Of course  the new booklet is WAR AND PEACE compaired to the 1987 ABBEY ROAD jewel case insert. ( A slip of glossy paper folded in half, the outer half showing the front and back of the ABBEY ROAD LP, the inside some bricks with the tracks listed. UGH!) HOWEVER, the mini documentary compensates for what the slim booklet lacks. In fact, its the best mini-documentary I've seen in ANY of the remasters.  The documentaries play on any computer newer than a MAC G4 running OS X.3+,or any PC pentium 3 with minimum windows 2000.  The ABBEY ROAD mini-doc has a bit from an early take of COME TOGETHER, with John saying something bizarre when it brakes down. (Freaky Beatle humor of course.) There's lots of little jokes from the recording sessions, like when John calls everybody bunch of middle aged wankers. These guys definately had fun making this album. While parts of the SOMETHING video play, Paul mentions that George was finally given an A-side single release. When the mini-doc ends, you'll want to play it again right away.<br /><br />Anyone who loves ABBEY ROAD will no doubt enjoy this remastering.  If it's playing in the backround, you may only notice small improvements. However, turn up the volumn and turn off the TV, and it's ALMOST like hearing the album for the first time.  So much was buried in the mix, sounds blurred together which are now distinct, little vocal bits that jump out, not to mention the VAST improvement in the drum sound, that it'll blow your mind.  At times it sounds as tho Ringo's hi hat and ride cymbals are just inside the speaker cover, crisp and resonant. When the Beatle's had a final mix prepaired back in 1969, and they played it back over the reference speakers in the mixroom, I'm CONVINCED that what they heard, was EXACTLY what we are hearing on this CD.  The historical importance of the Beatle's legacy provides the perfect rationale to purchase these remasters. However, if you're short on cash, at least buy one, as a way of testing the waters.  Anyone who's into HIGH FIDELITY will spot the differences instantaneously.  AND IN THE END, REMASTERS PROVE, THE SOUND THEY MADE IS EQUAL TO THE SOUND NOW PLAYED.PC pentium 3 with minimum windows 2000.

0061537969|5.0|One of the most moving and inteesting books I have read in years.  it will break your heart but you will not be able to put it down.  An amazing new writer.
B0010358CQ|5.0|Japanese animators continue to push the envelope in creating drama in animated features which seem to blur the lines between reality and fiction. The complexity of the plots and characters is a testament to their attention to detail and has a tremendous influence in American films(The Matrix, Transformers, etc.). This film is an animated feature and not a cartoon which addresses the idea of man vs. machine and how they co-exist. Filled with cyborgs, hybrids and heavily armored vechicles this movie is very entertaining and never lets go of the throttle once the action starts.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan. Naturally when Inglourious Basterds came out I was at the theater opening weekend. This is his newest movie. Written and directed by one of the greatest directors of our time, this movie is phenomenal.     We start off in Nazi occupied France and follow the story of two people with one goal. Shosanna Dreyfus, played by Mélanie Laurent, is a crazy young Jewish girl who escapes the massacre of her family and finds refuge with her alleged aunt and uncle. Lt. Aldo \\"the Apache\\" Raine, Brad Pitt is the southern born leader of the Basterds, a group of American and French soldiers who cruelly slaughter Nazis as a hobby.     The plots are intermingled as both Shosanna and the Apache, ignorant of the other, plan and attempt an assassination on not only Hitler, but also most of his regime during a movie premiere.     The acting in the film is superb. Pitt is as hilarious as ever, and with his southern accent you'll be cracking up every time he opens his mouth. I was wary of Tarantino's choice to cast friend and co-director Eli Roth as Sgt. Donny \\"the Bear Jew\\" Donowitz, a presumably mad Nazi murderer, however the pick was spot on. The part couldn't have been played by anyone else. Some of the lines were delivered with a little less skill, Marcel, Dreyfus' African-French lover, but overall the acting was great.     As always Tarantino is a master with the camera. He is an artist and the camera is his brush. Throughout the entire movie I was amazed at his perfectly set up scenes. He drives just near enough the conventional to have the audience fall asleep before flipping it on its head to remind them they're watching Tarantino. He breaks every cinematographic rule, but always with a carefully planned reason.     The plot, while a little unorthodox, (what would you expect?) is very easy to follow and quite fun. This movie is a Western at heart, and it's really fun to see how Tarantino changes this genre. I really sympathized with some of the characters, and others, while not quite deserving of my sympathy, were definitely fun to watch on screen.     If you can't handle watching blood on screen this is a movie to stay away from. There are things shown I never thought I'd witness in my life. Many Nazis are scalped, (at the request of the Apache) and some fall to an even more brutal fate. Violence might be a theme in this film, and more is witnessed on screen than off.     If violence is a theme, then suspense is her twin. More time is given the audience to imagine the ensuing bloodbath, than time to actually witness the bath itself. Like with any good narrative, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you won't even notice the nearly two and a half hours that pass.     This film is not for everyone. Squeamish people, nursing mothers, and the elderly would do best to avoid it. Other than that, if you like action, suspense, and people getting cruelly dismembered, this is a must see.
1439102813|4.0|I don't always enjoy our book club's selections from both a topical and a literary view point. This book, written from the perspective of a smart, professional woman who has early onset Alzheimer's Disease, was thought-provoking and well-written.  It's not too long, it's not too maudlin.  The writing is sparse and touching.  I have often found myself thinking of a scene from the book.  Ms. Genova has a wonderful touch on writing a tight, compact scene.

0061537969|5.0|At first I didn't think I would like this book.  The idea of a dog narrator was a little difficult to swallow.  However, Stein creates a narrator who \\"speaks\\" eloquently, albeit clearly exhibiting a dog's attention span and loyal point of view.    Some reviewers have said the story line relating to the custody dispute was melodramatic and unrealistic.  I found it to be factually plausible and emotionally accurate.      If you love dogs, formula one racing, or have a spouse and/or children, you will find something to like about this book.
B000TEUSJK|2.0|What drew me to purchasing this item was that I was lead to believe by the reviews attached to it is that it came with a commentary track where Mirren, O'Toole and others discussed the film. Alas this was not the case and all you get is the film which is nothing to write home about. Hearing the well renowned actors explain how they landed in this debacle though would have been worth the price of admission on it's own. Worth purchasing if heavily reduced in price for curiosity value only. I think the two disc set, although 'cut', would prove better value for movie enthusiasts. [[ASIN:B000TEUSJK Caligula (The Unrated Edition)]]
B000002LRX|4.0|'Angel Dust' is one of the most bizzare \\"pop\\" albums ever made, and vocalist Mike Patton is often given credit for this. However, while Patton is obviously a freakish talent, it's important to remember that Faith No More were a band, not just Patton's backup group. Also, such nutty gems as 'Epic' and 'Falling to Pieces' from their previous album were written without a significant input from Patton. It's clear that the rest of Faith No More are just as ambitious, talented, and insane as their vocalist, and this really comes through on this album.     Obviously, Patton's vocals are a highlight, as he switches easily between singing, rapping, howling, sneering, crooning and yelling. But the instrumentalists do a great job too, particularly Roddy Bottum, whose keyboards are at different times cheesy and sinister. Only guitarist Jim Martin seems a bit marginalised, and perhaps it's no coincidence he left after this.     Opening track 'Land of Sunshine' starts off in the same mould as their previous album, but by the time of the chorus- maniacal laughter over demented fairground keyboards- you know you're in for a weird ride. From there it just gets odder, the intense 'Caffiene', the redneck \\"tribute\\" 'RV', the bizzarely funny 'Kindergarten', the cheerleader chant 'Be Aggressive'. Even the most normal-sounding songs and singles such as 'Midlife Crisis' have odd samples, sound effects, or vocalisations included.     What is such a pleasant surprise is that the songs are remarkably catchy despite their weirdness. 'Land of Sunshine', 'Midlife Crisis', 'Everything's Ruined'....and who hasn't sung along with 'B.E.A.G.G.R.E.S.S.I.V.E\\"? Despite their ambition and apparent anti-commercial stance, Faith No More still produce some strong melodies and hooks. If you're not put off by the deliberately odd nature of the album, 'Angel Dust' proves to be a true grower. One of the best albums of the 90's.

B0006L16N8|3.0|'X&Y' is the sound of Coldplay graduating from clubs to stadiums. The songs, arrangements, and production here are all cranked up several notches to create a huge arena-rock sound. It could be seen as a blatant grab for American glory, or is it a middle finger to those critics who claimed they didn't really \\"rock\\"?  Or maybe it's a bit of both. It's much bigger and bolder than anything Coldplay have done before, but is it better?     Sort of.    The best thing about such a huge sound is that the rock tracks are given a real kick. The fantastic opener 'Square One' and the Radiohead-influenced closer 'Twisted Logic' are the two best songs here, and also the two biggest departures from the typical Coldplay sound. The other rockers; 'Low', the retro 'White Shadows' and the Kraftwerk rewrite 'Talk' also have strong riffs and memorable choruses. Another plus is that the instrumentalists are given greater exposure, and for the first time Coldplay sound like a proper band and not Chris Martin's backup group.    On the negative side, the ballads are now blown up to epic arena-rock proportions. Gone is the simple beauty of 'Sparks' or 'Amsterdam'. Here, everything follows the rock ballad cliche to a fault, starting with a simple piano/guitar passage and building up to the Wall of Sound conclusion. Another minus is Chris Martin's weak lyrics; Coldplay's early songs had plenty of raw emotion to make up for the clumsy lyrics, but here the stadium gloss just makes everything seem banal and cliched. It's ironic that such a self-consciously 'big' album doesn't actually have anything important or interesting to say.    The good mostly outweighs the bad, I suppose, although some fans of Coldplay's early work might find this a bit pompous and overblown. Still, six pretty strong songs (the five rock songs mentioned above, plus 'What If', the best of the ballads) make the album worthwhile. It's just hard not to wish the rest of the album, and the lyrics, reached a similar level.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Overall, I love this movie and watch it every time it comes on.  It's the perfect movie for a wintry cold day all bundled up drinking some tea with some freshly baked cookies.<br />It's the story of a man, played by Christian Bale (pre 'Batman' and 'Terminator'), with help from his best friend, played by Gerald Butler (pre '300' and 'P.S. I love you') lead a make-shift group of men, women, and children, in England trying to survive in a world where dragons have taken over the skies.  Enter Matthew McConaughey, who has tracked down the origins of the dragons to England, and who flew over with this band of dragons killers from America.<br />Great story, loved the characters and the alternate futuristic story.  Nice Visual Effects too (remember this movie was made in 2002)..  Matthew's acting was awesome!  And a great edge of your seat battle at the end!
B000002L82|5.0|After the lacklustre 'Movement', New Order slowly began to incorporate electronc elements into their sound over the next few years. The end result is 'Power, Corruption and Lies'; their best, most focussed, and most consistent album. And this re-release is generously augmented by a batch of non-album tracks from 1983-4, containing a couple of New Order's most groundbreaking and well-known singles. A classic album just got even better!    Part of the reason for 'Power, Corruption And Lies' classic status is that there's really something for everyone here. About half of the album is dominated by the icy electronica that characterised their smash hit 'Blue Monday' ('5-8-6', 'Your Silent Face', 'Ultraviolence', 'Ecstacy'), but there are also nods to their Joy Division past on 'We All Stand' and 'Leave Me Alone', and to their poppier future on 'Age of Consent' and 'The Village'.     The other big plus is the album's consistency; only on 'Technique' would the band again make an album this uniformally strong. No song sounds weak or out of place, and the musicianship and lyrics are some of the strongest in the New Order catalogue. Above all, the band sound confident and assured, which is a welcome sign after struggling for a few years to develop their own sound.     Included in this 2-CD re-release is a disc containing the band's non-album singles from the period. 'Blue Monday' is obviously the standout, a defining track for both the band and the time, but there are plenty of other great tracks here; the hip-hop tinged 'Confusion', the synthpop-meets-blue-eyed-soul of 'Thieves Like Us', the pretty good pop/rock song 'Lonesome Tonight' and the intensely tribal 'Murder', with a couple of instrumental remixes rounding out the collection. These tracks are all worthy in their own right, but they also fit very well in the context of the rest of the PCL album. 'Thieves Like Us' and 'Lonesome Tonight' are especially valuable as a sort of bridge between this album and the follow-up'Low-Life'.    'Power Corruption and Lies' is a classic of its time, and one of (if not the) best New Order albums. An already strong album complemented by some of the band's best singles make this 2-CD collection an essential purchase, for die-hard and casual fans alike.

B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. The music and the humor are still there with Leonard. The band on this DVD is also great. I have never heard of a laud or an arcilaud before, but Javier Mas is excellent on them. Dino Soldo is great on the wind instruments as well. Then there is Roscoe Beck on bass, Rafael Bernardo Gayol on drums, Neil Larson on keyboards, Bob Metzger on lead guitar, the beautiful voices of Sharon Robertson, Charley Webb and Hattie Webb. Leonard also picks a great guitar. His music is timeless and much of it fits in with todays events. If I had to select a favorite song on this DVD it would be hard. I would have to narrow it to two. \\"Dance With Me To The End of Love\\" and \\"Who By Fire\\". Oh, did I mention that he mentions his band members a few times? :-).... What a pleasure to watch.

B000SINT52|1.0|I have not yet viewed this, so cannot rate.  Am presuming it will not please me, as I do not think Michael Moore is much of a person.
B00005QGAV|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST IN THE MICHAEL JACKSON COLLECTION.  EVERY SONG ON THE CD IS OF THE FREAKIN' HOOK.  IT WILL HAVE YOU EITHER DANCING AND HAPPY,OR CRYING AND SAD OR ALL OF THE ABOVE! YOU CAN SEE MICHAEL SO CLEARLY THROUGH HIS MUSIC.  I IMAGINE HOW HE WOULD DANCE WHEN I HEAR SOME OF THE SONGS.  IT IS MY FAVORITE MICHAEL JACKSON CD OF ALL TIME! THE BOY IS BAD... THE BOY IS DANGEROUS!     L.N.   SHERMAN OAKS, CA
B001EYGOEM|4.0|It's good when you want to hear some music that's not too noisy. I like it.
B0018YIFEK|5.0|This book was in perfect condition and arrived in a timely maner. I would buy from this seller again.
B000YYQFHO|1.0|I was very dissapointed in the video I ordered from this user. The entire movie was scratched and would skip all throughout the movie. I strongly suggest not buying from this seller. I tried playing it on three different dvd players and all ended with the same results.
076790592X|5.0|This book was in very good condition . I would buy from this seller again.
B001E2JNA6|4.0|The Blu-ray version of Pride and Prejudice is stunning. The graphics have a wider range of depth and are just amazingly clear.<br />The Story - Wonderful, the acting just as good as it has always been.<br />Now for the problem, or what I see as a HUGE problem. The story is broken into chapters complete with opening credits and ending credits that are not there in the Extended DVD version I own as well. So rather then putting the first on in and watching a complete unbroken story, there are these breaks, where you have to fast forward through sections. The end of the starting credits is not even at a break point so you can just `skip' ahead through it. This is extremely annoying to me. Other wise, it's great!
0618001905|5.0|This is not a book for the faint-hearted. It is a brutal history of the subjugation of Africans particularly focusing on their treatment by the  Belgians.  It is extremely well written and an excellent reference source for anyone interested in the history of Africa.
1416562605|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary India to better understand the enormous challenges the country faces as it goes through this extraordinary period in its' history while at the same time enjoying a page turning story full of characters, thrilling turn of events and, well yes, mystery. If you loved \\" A fine Balance\\" by Mistry still my all time favorite book on Indian life, then you will simply adore this book.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Being a lifelong Beatles fan(yes I remember watching them on Ed Sullivan), I was very sceptical of yet another re-release of the Beatles catalog. But, hearing this album now is like hearing it for the first time in '69'. The clarity and seperation is astounding. Tight bass, etheral vocals, and multi-tracked instruments that lie hidden in every other mix of this classic album. And, this isn't just a case of everything turned up full gain, like so many other so-called digital remasters these days. No distortion at all. They've allowed the music to breath, with passages of quiet, punctuated by crystal clear instrumentation. Listen to this on a good set of headphones, and wait for the hairs to stand up on the back of your neck. Very highly recommended!
B0025KVLRY|5.0|When EMI and the Beatles decided to release their wonderful music to CD back in 1987, I was a happy camper. Then when the first four British release were in Mono, I was sad. It was kinda ironic. MEET THE BEATLES had \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"This Boy\\" were 'electronic rechannel' stereo, and the rest of the album was in true stereo. If the die-hard Beatle fans wanted to create there version of MEET THE BEATLES from CD's, \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"This Boy\\" were in true stereo, and the rest of the songs were in mono.  That's what I call BACKWORDS!<br />As time went by, I was hearing about Mobile Fidility Sound Labs (MFSL). People who had the Beatles MFSL (released in 1978), burned them to their CD-R's, and capturing the Best Stereo Sound of The Beatles I have ever heard in my life. I compared the WTB 2009 Remasterd and the WTB MFSL CD-R and it is Very Close. The channel seperation was a little better on the MFSL CD-R, while the 2009 Remaster has a few of the songs lasting a 'half a second' to a second longer. Very Tight.<br />Anyway, after 22 years of waiting of the official release of their cataloge is long over due. I'm extreamely happy that EMI brought the First Four in Stereo to light.  I don't have PLEASE PLEASE ME, A HARD DAYS NIGHT & BEATLES FOR SALE yet, but I will soon and I will review them as well. 5 Stars for WITH THE BEATLES 2009 Remastered.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|If it were not for The Beatles I doubt that I would have the huge collection of music that I have. I have music from before The Beatles until the present. I preordered both the stereo and the mono set. So far I have listened to part of the stereo set and it sounds fantastic. I actually bought a copy of the White Album by itself too because that is the first album I really ever remembering having.  I was afraid it would not be included in the set. I became a major Beatles fan when I was 11 years old and I finally bought the 45rpm \\"Hey Jude.\\"  I was buying 45s, but I would not get that one cause they were supposedly such hippies (according to my father) when I saw them on I think \\"The Smothers Brothers.\\" Of course, I wanted to get it so bad. So finally I did and around the same time \\"The White Album\\" came out and I got that for Christmas. Everyone in my family said you can play it on the stereo. I did, but at the time it was like now playing Marilyn Manson for your family at Christmas. Anyway, at that point in time, I started collecting anything I could by The Beatles. There is still nothing like The Beatles even though I have gone through all phases of music through the present. Hey, I had T.I. \\"Paper Trail\\" on my CD in the car before this CD came out. This new remastered set of The Beatles sounds absolutely incredible. I was surprised at how good it actually sounds. I have not listened to the mono set yet. The stereo set sounds exactly as The Beatles are, incredible!!!
B0000TG9E2|5.0|A hard to find last minute birthday suggestion from my niece (22 years old!), but it got here in time.  It looks factory new.  My niece has played it several times and it is the classic disney version.
0670451495|5.0|Book was as advertised, promptly sent.  Like new condition, and suitable for a gift.
0307450570|5.0|I absolutely love this product. There is so much information in this book and the pictures are amazing. If you love to craft and create then this book is for you. It comes with very detailed instructions to help you.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|For those who are not fans of the show, there is a lot to discover and enjoy with this season.  The characters and plots are well developed, thoughtful and clever.  The show is unique from the other crime show procedural offerings on television today because the true draw for the show is the characters and their relationships to one another.  Fans of the show actually watch to see what one character is going to do and say to one another each week, rather than the actual crime or case that needs to be solved.  If anything, the case/crime of the week is immaterial to the enjoyment, while it is the affection, cameraderie, and dare I say love the characters have for one another.  This is a family of a father, a mother, an uncle, and four neurotic kids with a funny cousin or two.    For huge fans of the show (are there anything but huge fans)
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This is a glorious revenge fantasy that is a blast to watch and totally plausible to those with kids and any sort of military connection.<br />The bluray itself is fantastic. Lots of great sound effects and LFE usage. The 24p video is superb and really captures the film stock qualities. No DNR present.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|This is a realy amazing movie of the way it was 500 years ago, too bad these days are gone!!
031604461X|1.0|Spoilers:    I read everyone's comments and thought 'how bad could it possibly be?'.  Well I got my answer.  It was almost laughingly bad.  And somewhere Ms. Meyer totally lost track of the feel of her books.  What was a rather sweet and exciting love story turned into some really bizaare, gory mess.  The characters I came to love in Twilight, was rather fond of in the other 2 books became entirely other people.  And come on, a mutant Reneesme?  Nessie?  Pretty ridiculous. And Edwards wonderful quirky family, who have always been such a great part of the books are almost not there (other than ooing and ahing over Bella's incredible tranformation) other than a rather nasty Rosalie.  I couldn't even finish it 2/3s of the way through.  I just skipped to the end.  Even then it really didn't matter.
0140544518|5.0|I read this book in grammar school n' just absolutely loved it! It's funny n' witty. So I bought it for my young niece to enjoy the same experience I did as a child n' she just loves it too, even if her favorite pic in the book is of the lil' piggies butt in the air! Definitely a great read, and a must buy for any age.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I never thought I would be the vampire type of girl..... but I got hooked to True Blood on HBO.  After that, I just had to own the DVDs.  What I love about this series is that it doesn't follow the Sookie Stackhouse books.  I don't normally like deviations from the books...but this series is just awesome.  It is funny, scary, and sexy all in one.  The characters are interesting and the adventures awesome.  I highly recommend the Charlaine Harris books (reading them for the third time now on my Kindle)but I also highly recommend this DVD series.  The books and DVDs provide enough similarity and difference to keep anyone interested!
B000GPIPD8|5.0|This is by far the black keys best album hands down. I love every song on here. Some of their earlier albums plus the one that came out after this I have to skip some of the songs, but not with this album. Every song on here is GREAT. Buy it NOW. You wont be disappointed.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I knew there would be some controversy. I will refrain from glorifying my opinion by listing my credentials, as some feel necessary, to somehow add worth or significance to my comments. My opinion, for what it is worth, is that this is IT, At least, for me. I have heard it all - from Capitol and Parlophone vinyl, from the US, Germany, England and Japan, from Ebbetts to Millennium Remasters (oops - am I listing my credentials?....) The \\"Help!\\" album was the clincher. I'd never heard a mono representative that didn't sound weak and muddy. Now I have, and I'm listening to it right now. I'm thrilled, and you will be too. It all comes down to personal preference, folks. That's why there will always be controversy. And with (not necessarily) all due respect to opposing opinions on which \\"version\\" is best, I will say this - I can't imagine ANYONE listening to the remastered mono set and walking away saying, \\"Boy, that sucked.\\" Sgt Pepper is everything it should be. Revolver has all the punch the '87 stereo version lacked. Don't even get me started on the White Album. If you are looking for accuracy - rather than ear candy - in these historical recordings, look no further than the 'Beatles In Mono' box set.    \\"Of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong\\" - Dennis Miller  (...nah...)
0312933541|5.0|You begin this book and think it is a little different, then it falls into a start here get to there undercover cold war CIA, M6. KGB story and then it slams you with with a great kick in the surprise ending that made sticking to it worth while.
1573300403|5.0|I loved this dvd!I hope that there will be an anthology realeased with all MJs video. I want them all! Even though this dvd has a few of the same videos as history vol 1 its still a great buy. There are several other videos to enjoy! I've purchased all the MJ dvds I could find on amazon. My favorite is the Dangerous Tour as well as the Dangerous on film!!! Enjoy.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|About three years back, the Beatles Capital Ablums were release on CD in two separate packages, Vol 1 and Vol 2.    They went up to Rubber Soul and each CD contained both stereo and mono verisons of each song. There was no detail information on the remastering process with these releases except for a sticker that read, digitally remaster and presented both in stereo and mono.    My question is this, has anyone compared the American Relasese against this recent mono release? If anyone has made camparison, please share your results.    Lawrence
B001PPLKI0|5.0|I have always loved Elvis Presley, but this collection is very well put together with awesomes songs. I would recommend it to anyone. I am sure you will love it as do I.
0307269981|5.0|Larsson died having completed three books dealing with the same characters. That is a pity for readers everywhere. Our main characters fight their own demons. These battles are then woven, masterfully,in tense, page-turning stories. If you enjoy mysteries and well written prose then you should enjoy this book by Stieg Larsson.
B000654YRY|4.0|Great music! Good lighting! If you don't know the words to the songs get the lyrics or be prepared to strain your ears trying to understand Mr. Knopfler's vocalizations. I was disappointed at so much material being cut out because I'm sure this concert was longer than this DVD.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|Yes, I have the VCR and a DVD recorded from the Cinemax airing, and the cassettes,<br />but I'm happy I got the remastered anniversary edition. I used it during a<br />Woodstock 40th anniversary promotion in my small shop and celebrated by not taking<br />a shower all weekend. As a result it played continuously for 3 days. On the fourth day,<br />I took it home and watched it again that evening. To watch it that much is a testament<br />to the significance of the event.<br /><br />Or....I'm a moron. OK, your point is well taken. But, it's still an excellent product.<br />The packaging was fun too. The best $483 I've ever spent.<br />What? Amazon has it for how much.............? Crap.
0937381888|5.0|This is quite possibly the best brew book on the market.  It was recommended to me by some homebrewers and as it turns out most of the local micro brewers also use this book.  Definitely worth every penny.
0786838655|5.0|When Percy Jackson realizes he's a half-blood--the offspring of his human mother and a Greek God--the entertainment begins.  Percy and his closest companions, a girl half-blood named Annabeth and a satyr named Grover set off on a quest to retrieve Zeus' missing bolt.  As the clock ticks down to their deadline on the Winter Solstice, the three friends need to use all their courage and wits to conclude the hunt. In this first book of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, author Rick Riordan creates a wonderful combination of thrills, mystery, and humor.  Mix it up with Greek Mythology and you've got a combination to please parents, librarians, teachers and kids!<br />--Reviewed by Michelle Delisle

1439102813|5.0|This was an amazing book.  Very well written.  For anyone with someone they know (or themselves) diagnosed with Alzheimer's, this is a must.  It's very  sobering, but filled with real life, and a reality check for many of us.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Hard to believe the King of Pop has passed but his gift to American Music will always be remembered.  No other artist can duplicate the \\"Magic of Michael\\".
B000Q7Q2WM|5.0|Uma Thurman and David Caradine do an excellent job of getting the message across.  I recommend it only to mature people.
B00005QGAT|5.0|The 80's was one of the best for R & B artist Michael Jackson.  His style of music and dancing was phenomenal.  The music industry has lost an astounding performer!
B001U0D77C|5.0|Extreamly well done movie in blu-ray, with Edward Norton and Jessica Biel. Based loosley on some of the Europen history of the period and with lots of Magic tricks thrown in, the plot has many twists and turns which will keep your interest in the film till the end. I highly recommend this film
B000MV8DB0|5.0|Thank god for this young kid who had the sense and thoughfulness to put these old master blues artists on film so we could all enjoy their philosopies, their mastery and their humor.  Fabulous, fabulous flick!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The remastered DVDs produce excellent video as played by my Blu-Ray player and displayed on a 52\\" HDTV.  There's very little image noise, and the colors are brilliant. The remastering is a fantastic improvement over the original copy.
B001IHJ97E|2.0|Not criticizing the movie, which has been a favorite of mine since I was a teen, but just the Remastered DVD that was recently released: When the point-of-view goes to that of the Brainstorm machine, the film looks and sounds fantastic (2.35:1 widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital surround) - Unfortunately, that's only about 15% of the movie. The rest of the time there is a serious cropping issue in which your viewing screen becomes 1/3 smaller, maybe more, and the sound is nothing spectacular. I watched this on a 40\\" HDTV and a 27\\" analog set, same disappointing effect. I'm sticking with my original 2000 version, which is shown mostly in 1.85:1 ws, then switching to 2.35:1 for the point-of-view special scenes. A little lower video quality, but much more enjoyable to watch, and the stereo soundtrack sounds almost the same.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Great series and season 3 is just as exciting and awesome as seasons 1 and 2. If you love Showtime shows and haven't seen this one buy the seasons. It's so worth it.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I read all the reviews for these little babies and was very impressed with what others had said. Since there are some bad reviews I decided to only get one set of these to try out. [...] bucks is not my life savings, so no big loss if I hated these. When I first got them and tried to put them on, I got what a few others have as well where they seemed to fall off. A little observation of the clip and all that is needed is to press on them harder in a slight downwards direction and towards the controller. They snapped into place and have not come off since.    These little babies are a real addition to my gaming. They give the controller a trigger feel, more like a gun and since I play a lot of shooter games this is a real PLUS. They also add a bit of a better grip on the controller. They are also great in that they allow for a more sensitive touch when you press them from the far edge.    As for what others have said about these as far as the bad reviews, I have to assume these people have not clipped them on fully or got a bad set. I have now purchased 4 sets of these and not had an issue with any of them. As for people saying that they pinch their fingers, well that has to be a one off situation or how they hold them, maybe small or chubby hands. Some have said that they have tried them on the Dualshock 3 controllers and had issues, that is another case of users error. I have these on two sixaxis and two dualshock 3 controllers and they work and feel the same. Lastly, people have said that they don't like these do to them being too sensitive, I say hold your fingers higher and they are just fine, in fact the higher you put your fingers, the less sensitive the button becomes.    If you are looking to add a little extra to your controller, get these bad boys over silicone covers. The covers had to be removed to charger on a dock and tear or get sticky from use.
1573300403|5.0|A MUST have for any Michael Jackson fan for sure!! Loaded with greatness. If you haven't seen this one you need to.
068485743X|4.0|If you are serious about writing a novel, you need to read this book. Noah Lukeman outlines exactly what problems literary agents and editors look for in a manuscript and explains how to avoid making them and how to correct them so that your work does not end up in the rejection pile. For each type of error he enumerates, he also provides an example block of text, so you, as a writer, can see precisely what he is talking about. He takes the guess work out of the equation.<br />This book is helping me take a second look at how I present my story. I am currently writing a science fiction novel titled Freedom's Sanctuary, the sequel to Finding Sanctuary. Rereading my work I have found places that just didn't sound right, though I could find nothing technically wrong with them. This book helped me identify what was bothering me and showed me how to make corrections. Now I can avoid making those same mistakes in the future.<br />Whether you are an experienced writer or a novice, this book will help you improve your tradecraft. Each chapter ends with writing exercises designed to help you break bad habits and build up your skill and confidence.<br />This is a must-read book for anyone who intends to publish. It is definitely worth it.
B001UXJQHE|5.0|Andre Rieu is the showman of our generation. An \\"enormous\\" talent, as he so often praises his orchestra and soloists. You'll probably spend some time being astonished at the magnitude of this show. His early DVDs have the colorful performers and soft lighting on the stage, and as time progressed, Rieu has opted to \\"go for it,\\" dreaming up even more elaborate locations and sets. Here, he duplicated the facade of a European castle, full size, where he'd performed before. Except he added two ice rinks and a ball room dance floor. The packed football stadium could take in the full scene or move in close to the action with the large TV screens.<br /><br />There is a definite shift in Rieu DVDs between the before/after use of TV screens. IN the before, you'd see enthusiastic armwaving response from the first few dozen rows only, but here, the entire stadium is enthralled.<br />It was fun to see the tens of thousands singing along on unfamiliar Australian songs.<br /><br />The performances are always first rate, many genuinely moving, but always done with an \\"even more surprises\\" attitude. Many who bemoan the fall of live classical music performances...and WHAT can be done?... can only look to Andre Rieu for the right direction. His orchestra is allowed to sway with the music, to look at each other with knowing glances and winks. There's one lame joke sequence about Hungarian goulash that can be scraped, but other than that, bring on the bagpipers. LOTS of them, of course. ;-)
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I decided to buy this show off amazon because everyone was talking about how the new season was starting and i wanted to catch up. After watching the pilot episode i was hooked. This show is amazing and it has something to offer for anyone. I highly recommend people purchasing this.
B0009UC810|5.0|This is an awesome movie. It does have several scenes that are not in the original release, but nothing worth buying this if you already own the movie. In addition, there are many bonus features that are both interesting and funny. Many of the actors tell stories of John Belushi. I highly recommend this movie. It is my favorite of all time. It also held the record for the most cars wrecked in any movie.
B001GCUER0|5.0|What an excellent series. For someone like myself who grew up in the sixties it's easy to relate to the story lines. Can't wait for season 3. Doug
6305678715|5.0|The Presidio was a really good movie when it was released, and it is still good today! If you are a fan of any of the actors, or just like a very good \\"who done it\\" without all of the flashy computer generated action scenes of more recent films you will enjoy this.
B000VR824S|5.0|A few incredible guitar players on this DVD. John Mayer and Jeff Beck are really amazing. You also get an introduction a female bassist that plays with Jeff Beck. She is incredible.
1582701709|4.0|I'm a reader that's not very familiar with self-helpbooks. This book attracted my attention mainly because it had gotten good reviews in a Swedish magazine. And I've seen it being marketed a few times.     When an offer of getting the dvd-book appeared I took it, it wasn't so expensive so I thought that if it's a lousy book I can count my losses.     I started to watch/listen to it one morning and found it to be very interesting. It's common knowledge that the mind can move mountains (Swedish saying)and I thought it could be a challenge to see if it worked! I started by making a thankful list, stating the big things in life that I was thankful for. A couple of days after I started watching/listening to the book and doing the list a company called me for an interview. I'm unemployed and had naturally wished for a job. The woman that called had an old application from me and wanted to meet up with me for a position at a big store. Yay!    I haven't been there yet but I'm sure I'll get a job there.     A small thing you say, I would have happened anyways. Well, maybe it would but since I started watching/listening to The Secret my mind isn't as occupied with negative thoughts as it used to be. Positive thinking is better for you and your self esteem amongst others.     So, my advice to you is; read the book. It doesn't harm you, it just makes you review your thoughts a bit. And hey, if it works? Well, good for you!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams presents a dramatic and gritty portrayal of early life in America and abroad. The entire cast delivers believeable and authentic portrayals of key figures in early American history.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a great story, moving drama, and a step back in time to the roots of our country[[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]]
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I bought this specifically to play WoW. The button layout, and the macro features work great. I haven't started writing LUA scripts for it yet, but the possibilities are wide open with this game pad.
0064430227|5.0|When I was a tadpole, this was my favorite book. I was in ecstacy when I'd come across it at a library, a friend's house, a doctor's office, etc. I don't know why I didn't ask for my own copy! Now I have my own copy! Please get your kids ther own copies!     The story is simple but not simplistic. The drawings are basic but absolutely spot-on. The storyline is logical and clever, and it's actually challenging trying to figure out how it will resolve. The ending is immensely satisfying. And Harold is a neat little guy!
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Once again Hosseini takes a tragic and heart breaking story and makes it captivaing.  While it certainly can't be called a &#34;feel good&#34; story, you walk away with a picture of a woman's life in Afganistan and an incredible story of survival and adaptation.  I really enjoyed reading this book.
0440238153|5.0|To be honest, I am only half way through this book and cannot wait to finish it.  It is even better that the first two in the series and it is really too bad they are unlikely to make movies of these last two books.  This book is blowing me away, it really makes you think about things differently.  Now I understand why \\"the church\\" was so against the Golden Compass...because it leads to this book.
B0015DROBO|5.0|There are many suspensful books but I greatly enjoyed the \\"twist\\" in Stieg's book when he makes his reader's think about violence against women and about prejudice. This discussion coming from a man is very important and I hope many men and women will enjoy this wonderful mystery with all of its complex twists and turns. I couldn't put it down. I'm sorry the author has passed away but his books will go on to fight prejudice and abuse each time someone picks up one of his books.
B0026RHR6K|3.0|What a terrific show!  The thinking person's science fiction, asking questions about what makes us human, what makes us conscious and spiritual beings, where we came from, and where we're going.  Raises issues of militarism, species-ism, and religious diversity and tolerance.  But what terrible packaging.  The little cylon centurion toy does not make up for the fact that the individual discs are so hard to remove from their cascaded cardboard packaging that it is easy to damage one while trying to get it out.  Putting them back is just as hard.  Skip the toy and put the money into better casings.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I completed the 30 Day Shred in 6 weeks, exercised 5-6 times per week. I am not exactly a fitness fan. I workout because I have to, not because I want to. I have not exercised for over 5 years except for my daily walking. I have never been overweight, but also not in the best shape, had flabby upper arms and fat belly.    After 6 weeks, I didn't lose any weight (was not trying to) but still dropped one dress size, my body is firmer, arms are visibly toned and belly flatten. I was not following any special diet, but I do pay close attention to portion control.  Nevertheless, this summer was my first time wearing bikini after 5 years hiding under tankinis, and I am very happy with the result.    Pros:  -3 different fitness level with modifications for beginners   -Efficiency, definitely not time consuming, roughly 25 min from start to finish   -Effective, result as promised, I did look much better within a month    Cons:  It gets boring. After 2 weeks doing this routine almost every day, you'll know the moves by heart and Jillian's motivational talk gets old, it was harder to maintain the excitement. Even though this is a very good workout I cannot possibly bring myself to do this all over again as my only exercise. I'd do it maybe twice a month alternating with other short exercises.     I was torn and wanted to take one star off because of the con, but I couldn't. This is the most effective exercise I've ever had without having to leave the comfort of my home. I would definitely recommend 30 Day Shred to anyone who couldn't find the time to go to the gym or take classes, but still would like to keep in shape, or in my case, to get into a better shape.
B001GCUO4I|4.0|I admit, I was skeptical when attending a screening of the latest installment of the Final Destination franchise.  Yet, it served on many levels and succeeded in being an entertaining diversion.  Yes, it doesn't offer up much different than previous chapters, but the approach was fresh.  The musical score by Brian Tyler was fun and complemented the montage of CGI visuals peppered throughout the piece.  The actor portraying the security guard was great, and the teen cast, although expendable, kept things interesting.  It was very tongue-in-cheek--the filmmakers are probably surprised by the popularity of the theme and are trying to push it to new limits.  I myself am looking forward to another sequel, especially if the creative team behind this horror venture continues to layer the twists and turns so that audiences keep guessing.  Kudos to the creative forces behind the main titles and the clever x-ray flashbacks to previous FD kills.

B001QWBM62|4.0|4 Stars with reservations.  A great unit BUT there is still room to make it killer.    First, and importantly as far as I'm concerned, the advertising of a built-in limiter and compressor is misleading.  It needs to be understood that these are not analog but digital and come AFTER the A\D converters. You WILL get digital clipping when you submit signal that is too hot.  This severely limits the usefulness of these effects and, to me, makes their addition a toy that verges on false advertising.    Secondly, if you use external microphones you should be aware that dynamic mics sm57\58 etc will not provide very satisfactory results due to the high noise floor.  Phantom-powered condenser mics ($) do tend to fair much better.  Your mileage may vary.    Thirdly, as mentioned in other reviews, the built-in mics are not the quietest and do tend to exacerbate sibilance in my experience.      So, for the H4m, please add ANALOG (pre A\D) compressor\limiter, graphic eq, and noise gates + preamps\built-in mics with a little less noise with the ability to use dynamic mics without penalty.    I should say though that for the price point you sure do get a lot of b-f-t-buck!  But the missing\substandard features will cause it to miss the mark for worry-free professional use for some (like myself).
B002BSHXJA|3.0|This Beatle fan plunked down money for the mono box and also purchased the individual stereo versions. After sampling and spending much time just listening this weekend, my preference is for the stereo albums/stereo box set. I would recommend the stereo albums for the casual fan-the mono set being for completists. I am playing these CDs through a high end system utilizing B&W 800 series speakers and a Rotel CD player. The stereo versions even though they suffer from the \\"right-left\\" speaker dilemma as others have pointed out, sound sharp, clear and dynamic while (with the exception of the Beatles first few mono albums), the mono versions to my ears generally sound muddy, dull, and lifeless by comparison. Stereo versions like the White album and Abbey Road just jump right out of your speakers and sound sonically fantastic! So to each his own....

B001NFNFF8|1.0|In the Electric Mist With Conferate Dead was the first novel I had ever read by James Lee Burke and I immediately became a fan. When I heard that a movie version was in production and starring Tommy Lee Jones as Burke's protagonist Dave Roubiceaux, I assumed that it would be a box office hit and a classic movie. Not so. The fact that it was released directly to DVD surprised me but curiousity made me go ahead and buy it through Amazon. Unless you've read the book first, save your money. I found this movie to be a confusing mess of a great novel. Burke's writing is poetic but you'd never guess it by watching this movie. A major disappointment.

B000RZIGVS|2.0|This is one of the best TV series that existed in it's time, and can still hold it's own in today's market. Now, for the review of THIS release......<br /><br />PROS:<br />  - Small, compact size, so as not to take up a lot of shelf space<br />  - Special Features not available on previous releases<br /><br />CONS:<br />  - The packaging is VERY CHEAP! Fragile plastic trays that can break during<br />  shipping (or almost just by touching!)<br />  - Quality of discs is POOR. They even look & feel thinner than a standard DVD.<br />  - Picture quality is WORSE than the original \\"silver-box\\" releases.<br /><br />Also, MOST of the episodes in the set I received won't play (DVD player stops in the middle of the episodes). This happens on ALL of the discs around the second episode. I know it is not the player, because I play MANY other series' on it, and I don't have a problem with any of them. The only DVD's I have a problem with are from this set. I have tried these on 12 (yes, 12!) different DVD players (3 of my own, as well as several friends') & keep getting the exact same problem.<br /><br />My recommendation? Wait for a better edition to come out, or spend the extra money & get the \\"silver-box\\" releases of this series. Sure, it takes up more room on the shelf. But it makes up for it in better quality of discs, packaging, picture, sound, & play ability! I (personally) would rather have something that WORKS RIGHT than saves space.

0545123267|3.0|After reading Maggie Stiefvater's debut novel, [[ASIN:0738713708 Lament: The Faerie Queen's Deception]], I couldn't wait to get my hands on Shiver.  Sadly, it didn't grab me in the same way.<br /><br />Shiver tells the story of Grace, a high-achieving but quiet high school junior, who is engrossed by the pack of wolves that roams outside her Minnesota home each winter.  She has a special connection with the wolf with yellow eyes, as this wolf saved her from the pack's attack when she was eleven.  We quickly learn that the wolves are actually shape-shifting humans that turn into wolves each fall and winter and then become humans again in the warmer months;  as time passes and the cycle repeats, each person gets less and less time as a human until he/she ceases to change back anymore.  The yellow-eyed wolf is Sam, an eighteen year old boy who has cared for Grace since he saved her six years prior.  Due to some unfortunate events, Sam changes back into a human during cold weather, but he is finally able to meet and be with Grace in his human form.  Sam and Grace must fight against the increasingly cold weather and other forces to keep him human and prevent what may be his last change into a permanent wolf.<br /><br />I liked the author's variation on the werewolf fable, even though there were a few times that the temperature/season argument didn't work.  The romance between Sam and Grace is believable in its human form, albeit sometimes boring, as they do regular things that grow a relationship, like watch TV together, go to the book shop and candy store, steal kisses, etc.  Their love was sweet and sometimes sexy, with all the trappings of a first real relationship.  However, the relationship seemed inauthentic in how easily they got along, with little conflict other than trying to keep Sam warm so he didn't morph back into a wolf.  Even though they claimed to have been in love for the six years since the wolf version of Sam saved Grace, it was questionable and a little bit creepy to have that love translated automatically and without hesitation into a human form.<br /><br />This book is told from both protagonists' POV, as indicated by a name at the top of each chapter.  However, the two voices of the characters weren't distinct enough, and I found myself sometimes checking the top of the page to see who was speaking.  Sam's voice was also a bit too overdeveloped and wordy to be believable for a boy of eighteen who's spent much of his life as a wolf.  Each chapter also shows the current temperature.  Other reviewers didn't like the temp being shown, but I thought it provided a heightened sense of urgency regarding the risk to Sam and his impending change that the book would have lacked otherwise.  Compared to other YA authors, Stiefvater has a wonderfully lyrical and well-written style of prose, full of description and imagery.  However, it went overboard at times as each description was flowery and dramatic.  There were also some gaping plot holes in that Grace has completely absent parents, who never noticed that a boy was sleeping in their daughter's room for weeks;  the whole \\"cure\\" was implausible in how the characters came about obtaining it; and the maturity, sensitivity, and emotional development of Sam seemed unlikely given his past.<br /><br />Despite these qualms, it was a nice, enjoyable read overall, even if it didn't impress me like Lament did.  I look forward to more from Stiefvater in the future, though, and I hope that some of the weaknesses in this book will be resolved in the next two in the trilogy, Linger and Forever.to have that love translated automatically and without hesitation into a human form.

0307266303|5.0|Born to Run is well written, easy to read and will hold you captive until the end. It is a great story, but more importantly has a great message to be taken from it - we are runners and can thrive from running. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would challenge anyone to read it and not go out running afterward. I have been running in vibram fivefingers for almost four years and they are fantastic and since reading the book I have increased my running and even on occasion go barefoot - go Barefoot Ted! As a result I feel great and my ankles, knees and legs work together perfectly and without injury, unlike the problems I used to feel years ago running in brand name \\"running shoes\\".

1932100660|1.0|Review of the China Study    I am a scientist, not specifically in the field of nutrition, though I have touched on it as an aside of my main focus, and I know how to research and interpret (correctly!) scientific work. I have read The China Study and the China Project (a publication of the actual data from the study). Normally when reading bad science information I would just shrug it off and move on but thought that there would be people out there that would just take the authors word of the truth of the book, resulting in unnecessary dietary alterations and damage to health all with the aim of trying to get healthier. As such I have written my thoughts on the book - take from them what you will.    The China Study is an attempt by Campbell to promote veganism as a dietary lifestyle through scientific research. Unfortunately the scientific basis of the book if full off misinterpretations, omissions of conflicting data, and conclusions and statements based on unreferenced facts (possibly not facts?). I began reading the book with an open mind but from the outset it was clear that Campbell had one mantra - animal based food is bad, plant based food is good, and this is repeated over and over throughout the book.     Let's first look at Campbells own laboratory studies. In the presence of Aflatoxin, a carcinogen, rats fed a diet of 20% casein, a milk protein, develop cancer while those that are fed 5% casein do not. Okay, I am willing to accept that study on face value. How much casein causes cancer then? In a dose response study Campbell found that 10% casein doesn't contribute to cancer development, but above 10% does. Again, I am happy to accept that. A diet made up of 10% casein contributes to cancer development. How does that apply to humans? After describing a study about nitrosamines and how the dose wasn't relevant to the human population (page 45), Campbell has done the exact same thing with his Casein study. Casein is a milk protein. In 100ml of whole milk,the macro nutrient content is 5.2g of carbohydrate, 3.25g of fat and 3.2g of protein that equals 11.65g of nutrients, the rest of the 100ml mostly made up of water. Milk protein is 80% casein, 80% of 3.2g is 2.56, so out of that 11.65 total, 2.56 is casein which equals 22% of the total. Oh no! Milk will cause us to develop cancer! But don't worry, as long as we get the casein down to 10% we will be safe. How do we do that? Eat 13.95g of anything that is not casein. Pretty easy to do. So as long as we are not living of more than about 50% milk, then we are safe from cancer as a result of the casein in the milk. Do you know anybody that has that much milk? And that is ignoring the fact that casein extracted from milk for the purposes of his study is not exactly a healthy, natural source of protein purely as a result of the chemical extraction.    But hang on, what if other proteins contribute to the development of cancer? Campbell thought that so he investigated gluten and soy and found that neither of them had the same impact as casein. That clearly shows that not all proteins contribute to cancer, and having tested 2 plant proteins and 1 of the many animal proteins, we must therefore conclude that ALL animal proteins lead to cancer and ALL plant proteins do not. Does anybody else see a problem with this? All that we can conclude from these studies is a diet made up of above 10% casein, may contribute to the development of cancer and a diet below 10% casein does not contribute. That is all. Other proteins, both animal and plant, like gluten and soy, may behave differently and unless you have a milk fetish or you are downing large amounts of casein based protein powder (like the rats in the study) then the study is largely irrelevant to your diet or your health.    Before moving on I have one more observation; To test the impact of decreased protein from 20 to 5% they replaced some of the protein with carbohydrates to keep the calories the same. Commenting on the addition of carbohydrate he says \\"the extra starch and glucose in the low-protein diets could not have been responsible for the lower development of foci because these carbohydrates, when tested alone, actually increase foci development\\" (page 351). So carbohydrates, which come from plants, increase the development of foci? PLANTS CAUSE CANCER TOO?? Could this be something worth elaborating on or including in a conclusion? No, better not, lets keep that brief mention of carbohydrates causing cancer stuck away in an appendix in case anybody gets the wrong idea.    It is apparent from his casein studies that Campbell has come to the conclusion that \\"20% casein causes cancer, therefore all animal protein is bad\\". It is with this mindset that he then set out on the giant study of the China Project, a commendable effort that could have had many beneficial outcomes. Unfortunately, possibly as a result of his previous work, Campbell has gone in with blinders on, and all he can see is animal protein and the negative health outcomes associated with its' consumption. The project itself and the original publication arising from it produced a vast amount of data that provides some interesting insight into health and disease. However, what Campbell has shown in the China Study is but a fraction of the information to be gained from the project. It would require a whole new study (unbiased this time preferably) to go into all the beneficial knowledge we could gain, but I will touch on a few things here.    Campbells main conclusion in the China Study is that all animal protein contributes to disease and all plant protein prevents disease. In the original project, they performed a diet survey over 3 days, analyzing all the food consumed per person in that time. Guess how many of the measured mortality factors (about 50 of them), were associated with animal protein consumption measured from the diet survey. Zero. Zero. Zero. Okay, so Campbell can't have come to his conclusions from there. They also had study participants fill out a questionnaire that included one question on meat consumption. Guess how many mortality factors correlated with that? One type of cancer (naso-pharyngeal or something I think it was). An example of some of the many other inclusions in the questionnaire are canola oil and potatoes (not sweet potatoes) which both had a number of positive associations with the development of different types of cancer. Apparently that wasn't worth mentioning in the China Study. Speaking of oil, Campbell makes reference to %fat in the diet being a good indicator of animal protein consumption, despite the fact they clearly use enough canola oil (a vegetable fat) to measure in the study.    So a 3 day food consumption survey shows no association between animal protein and mortality and a questionnaire shows an association between meat and one of many cancers measured. From where can Campbell come to his evil animal protein conclusion then? They also took plasma samples and measured them for blood biomarkers of animal protein consumption. These biomarkers, listed in the references for chapter 4 #39 are \\"plasma copper, urea nitrogen, estradiol, prolactin, testosterone and, inversely, sex hormone binding globulin, each of which has been known to be associated with animal protein intake from previous studies\\". No mention of these previous studies of course. So the associations with most of those biomarkers and mortality rates are dubious, and the only biomarker statistically associated with cancer mortality is copper. Many places show food sources of copper and I went to [...] find the best sources of copper. The best? Calfs liver. The next 40 best? All from plants. 42 and 43 are shrimp and venison, the only other animal source in the list on the site. So for copper to be a biomarker of animal consumption then the participants in this study must be eating a lot of calf liver and avoiding a lot of vegetables. Sound realistic?    So from an association between blood biomarkers, the only real one being copper, and cancer mortality, Campbell has concluded that animal protein gives you cancer, despite the fact that the majority of dietary sources of copper are actually from plant sources. So that basically leaves Campbell with no actual evidence between animal consumption and mortality as a result of the original China project.    A final note. In his eating right section Campbell says supplements are bad (principle 2). Principle 3 then says \\"there are virtually no nutrients in animal-based foods that are not better provided by plants\\"(page 230), but over the page he says plants are not a good source of vitamin B12 and you probably should take a supplement. What? Then in the how to eat section on page 242 he says \\"the findings from the China Study indicate that the lower percentage of animal-based foods that are consumed, the greater the health benefits-even when the percentage declines from 10% to 0% of calories\\". As I've clearly shown, the China Study does not show this, and his own study with Casein proved that there was no benefit in eating less then 10% of your diet from Casein.     Clearly Campbell is a vegetarian, as he states in the book, and promoting vegetarianism is his main goal, which he tries to back up with scientific research that actually disagrees with him, but that he has interpreted in a way that makes it agree with him. Bad science, bad book and definitely bad recommendations as far as health. While I'm not saying go out and live on animal products alone, I don't think you should stop eating them, especially because they are tasty, but even if only for a natural source of vitamin B12.

You need a small set of hand weights and a mat for sit-ups.  I liked the fast paced part of it.  She changed exercises every 2 minutes.  That way if it is difficult, I knew I could last for 120 seconds.  Includes jumping jacks, took me back to grade school.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Season one condensed well, removal of comercials was done with very few glitches,very nicely done.
B0026ICAOS|5.0|You never saw the monster in that movie which kinda sucked. The sound was True HD 5.1 SUPERB SOUND. The ultimate in high definition experience picture wise. Stephen King Rules!!!!
B001PPLIFU|3.0|You really need to remember the last Bond movie to enjoy this one. There is so much of the plot that relates back; if the last movie is not fresh in your mind you will be asking why, what, who. Other than that, lots of mayhem, not too much mystery.
B000FFJYB6|5.0|Hubby had this movie on on one of the movie channels on TV. We didn't see the beginning but did see the end. Might I say I cried like a baby! We purchased it & shared it with other family members who also loved it. Very good family movie.
006135323X|4.0|This book is full of excellent information about consumers and people in general.  For example, when is free not the best offer presented to you?  Also, how are we influenced by those around us?  Will we act independently or while we conform unconsciously?  How do we judge the character of our friends?  Are we accurate? This book answers those questions.  It is an excellent read.
B000BO0LKY|4.0|By the time 2005 rolled around, Mariah Carey was considered a has-been. But as soon as \\"We Belong Together\\" topped the charts - and held on for 14 weeks - her Glitter days were long-forgotten. That single was a perfect combination of Mariah's big ballad past and hip-hop present, with its heavy bass line and a grand finale of her trademark belting. It also notably references old school slow jams from Babyface and Bobby Womack. That old school style is present throughout The Emancipation of Mimi, and it's the main ingredient in this enjoyable collection. Big Jim Wright assists on \\"I Wish You Knew\\" and \\"Circles,\\" tracks that recall Diana Ross - with added runs and high notes, of course. \\"Mine Again\\" is a big-voiced plea for a second chance that ranks among Mariah's most soulful and believable songs. Most of the hip-hop numbers are infectious, like the summery \\"Say Somethin,\\" with a classic Snoop verse, and \\"Get Your Number,\\" featuring a chorus from JD (who oddly sounds just like Nelly). Ironically, her collaboration with Nelly himself, \\"To the Floor,\\" is underwhelming and forgettable. Some of the songs do run together, but this is ultimately one of Mariah's finest and most consistent albums. Several years of unimpressive sales made this return to form that much sweeter. It was great to hear her finally sing with her full voice and look to the past for inspiration. 4 Stars.    \\"Don't Forget About Us\\" and an excellent hip-hop remix of \\"We Belong Together\\" are great additions to this re-release.
0307266303|5.0|I can't believe that I got this book for under $15.00! It is life changing. In fact, I'm minutes away from making a Pinole drink (read the book). Every chapter keeps it interesting. This is one of those books that you will have a hard time putting down. You don't have to be a runner to benefit from reading Born to Run; I am an athlete and I run, but I'm not a runner. This book is worth its weight in gold. I highly recommend it. It was just the inspiration and motivation that I needed.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|I grew up in the '60's with two older sisters and Beatles music was the soundtrack of our home (along with Frank Sinatra from our parents!) Just got the remastered Please Please Me yesterday. It's fantastic. For the first time, I can really hear Paul's baseline and the vocals are clearer than anytime before. Wonderful to hear a slight \\"fluff\\" of the lyrics on Please Please Me that makes John laugh on the phrase \\"Come On! Come On!\\"...never caught that before. Even if you opt to buy the cd's individually (which it what I'm doing-it gives you something to look forward to!) the remastered collection is well worth it!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|What can I say? You just have to watch it. I can say that I don't think any other band could stand up to the awesomeness of Pompeii and make it actually work.

B00004RJ74|4.0|This movies is JUST a tad bit over the top. Not George Clooney's finest, but still a typical Rodriguez film. It has its moments and what stood out to me was that Harvey Keitel's performance was probably the best, I personally thought he did a hell of a job in a movie that doesn't quite seem to fit his genre like lets say a Taxi Driver. The script is just hideous, I understand Tarantino is known for his one-liner movies but the writing was so horrible it was practically comedic. The movie is I'd say about one hour and forty five minutes, you dont learn of the vampires until they hit the Titty Twister in Mexico, about an hour into the film so to recap, 2/3 of the movie is about escaped fugitives one a thief, the other a psychopathic serial killer who by the way are brothers go figure who go an rampage, kidnap a preacher and his two teenage children and threaten their lives in exchange for a safe ride across the border. That was the first hour of the film. Then comes the vampires... almost completely out of know where. They stop at this strip bar called the Titty Twister where only bikers and truckers are allowed in and everything is going well, people are drinking and getting horny from cheap strippers and then suddenly Tarantino and Clooney get a rude awakening from one of the bar's figureheads, they get into a huge fight and Selma Hayek gets excited over the blood gushing from Tarantino's hand and she obviously cannot control her actions at this point and morphs into this bloodsucking being. From there, all HELL (literally) breaks loose.     Listen, I get it, this is suppose to represent exploitation films of the 70s, it has that kind of grimy and gritty style to it with the cheap effects and the outragious amount of violence and gore and one-liners, its ok, its what actually makes the movie work but the problem is you have a talented cast and a somewhat talented director who has had much better films in his career and all of sudden it appears that they've hit a road block. The movie has its moments, don't get me wrong but the plot and storyline suffer, the whole fugitive / Vampire hunters just doesn't seem to mesh properly. Its a fun movie to watch but not to be taken seriously. This is a Tarantino film, not a Keitel and Clooney film, they are much better actors than what is portrayed in this shoot-um up action / horror flick. Rodriguez's Sin City was much better than this and that was extremely gory and violent but Sin City was true to Noir and Pulp movies and comics whereas I'm not too convinced that From Dusk Till Dawn was true to exploitation films of the 70s. You want to see a real violent and gory mimic exploitation of the 70s? Watch the Devil's Rejections by Rob Zombie, you're in for a real treat.    There are some things I liked about the movie and alot I didnt. I actually enjoyed Clooney and Tarantino and their struggles trying to get across the border but the whole vampire image in the last forty five minutes really turned me off and Cheche Maron, there's a reason he's in movies like this. The way I look at, this is a cheap drive-in movie and actually your seeing two for the price of one... not a bad deal, but wasn't that how exploitation movies of the 70s were shown, two for one or a double feature?     This movie definitely will have its fanbase, but its not for everyone. Be weary of what your getting into.
B0027ZEHGO|5.0|I missed SiCKO in the theater but boy was I glad Moore had done it; it is a primer for the current debate and no one should be shouting SOCIALISM! in fear or to obstruct our reform process if s/he hasn't watched this excellent explanation of our problems.
0439023491|5.0|The Hunger Games was an extraordinary novel.  I devoured it.  I, like others, worried the the sequel wouldn't hold up to the first, but was oh-so-happily wrong.  Catching Fire is phenomenal!  I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />The book starts with the Victory Tour that Katniss and Peeta had to take around the districts.  It is written with such depth and poignancy that I was absolutely drawn in to the story and felt myself wanting to become a part of the action, too.  I really saw a different side of Haymitch.  I have to say that he didn't win me over in the HG, but CF was a different story.  For a drunkard, he sure seems to be able to make some deep choices in other areas of his life.<br /><br />The rest of the book is shocking.  I can't even count the number of times I was thinking to myself, \\"I can't believe this!\\"  It's simply great work.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about the other victors and how the Games had affected them.  I really appreciate that we weren't left to assume that once characters left the arena, that everything was hunky-dorey.  As ironic as it sounds, it seems as though the much-hated Hunger Games may actually be the element that finally unites the districts, contrary to the Capitol's intents.  Katniss is the spark.  I'm very much looking forward to the third book in the trilogy.  The cliffhanger at the end filled me with sadness and anxiety and I need to find out more... soon, hopefully!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|WARNING: This review may contain a few Spoilers.    Dexter continues to get better with every season. It was very hard for me to get into the beginning half of the first season, but once you get through the middle of it, there's no turning back. From the Ice Truck Killer (Season 1), through the Bay Harbor Butcher (Season 2), all the way through The Skinner (Season 3), this series rarely has a dull moment. I highly recommend Season 3 to any one who enjoys a good story, and what makes things even more interesting is that the story is told from the point of view of the bad guy (if you would call Dexter that as some may call him a Hero (I do, although I don't think it's right that he's taking justice into his own hands, but he is doing the world a service)). I wouldn't say that you have to watch the other two seasons in order to understand this one, but it would make some plot points make a little more sense (especially parts concerning the Ice Truck Killer). This season gets even more interesting when a high ranking Defense Attorney in Miami wants to join Dexter (or rather the Darkness) for a few \\"Side Projects\\". Can Dexter handle having a partner? Watch Season 3 and find out!
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|This is a well acted, well presented adaptation of Ayn Rand's wonderful novel of individual rights. Ayn Rand herself wrote the screenplay and it is presented with the same style as her writing. While this style may not be for everybody her message definitely is. At a time when our rights are under brutal attack from our own government, Ayn Rand's works are more important than ever. This movie adaptation will help to remind Americans of why we are Americans and what this country stands for. I urge everyone to not only watch this film, but get as many of your friends and neighbors to watch it as well. Then read [[ASIN:1440422753 Anthem]] and [[ASIN:0452011876 Atlas Shrugged]] to see exactly where we will end up if we stay on the road to statism that Obama is leading us down.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Listen this amazing CD with the original soundtrack of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has the effect of provoking the same feelings and emotions when I was watching the movie...I recommend it specially because of the spectacular songs of Dario Marianelli (R. from Brazil)
0385495323|5.0|Just like a thriller novel. Outstanding quality of writing!! Illustrated mathematical ideas with nice analogies and went for intution rather than mathematical rigor. You can find the exciting turns of history of code making and breaking.

B001QOGYFE|3.0|I didn't quite know what to expect when I sat down in the theater today to watch Whiteout. The trailers led me to believe it would be some sort of supernatural type film set in Antarctica, but I wasn't really sure if it was just the weather that would be the evil force or some sort of creature. It was none of the above. Whiteout is really just a typical thriller/mystery that happens to occur on the coldest land mass in the world. It involves some murders back in 1957 and few more in present day that Kate's character investigates. Within the first ten minutes you get the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale stripping down to her undies (always a good thing), but I didn't expect that to be the films only true highlight. Other than her obvious use in that particular scene, I can't believe they casted a good looking woman only to cover her up from head to toe and in multiple layers for the last 90 minutes. Not to mention a giant snow hat on her head. Anyways, most of the acting was okay I guess. Kind of bland, but nothing noticeably bad.<br /><br />Whiteout is actually pretty darn entertaining if you take it for what it is and don't expect anything special. It deserves better than all the negative reviews it is receiving from the critics, but I have to admit that without the early gratuitous scene or the atmospheric location, I probably wouldn't give this thing more that two stars. You might get a couple of shivers from this one, but those looking for some true frostbite should stick with John Carpenter's The Thing.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I own both The Beatles stereo box set and the more pricey \\"limited edition\\" Beatles mono box set and the mono box set wins hands down. The sound on the mono box set is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JPMZ|4.0|Great flick for fans of the original cartoon form the late 80's/early 90's.  Sure, the tone is lighter than the original source material (comic books), but it's still a fun ride.  The sibling rivalry that plays throughout is a nice attempt at a mature storyline, and there's a fantastic fight scene between Leonardo and Raphael, but it's way too short.  'TMNT' is a great throwback to Saturday morning cartoons before they became too watered-down.
0385341008|5.0|This book was so good I bought it for a friend from England.We need to know our history to help us with our future.
B0012GVKW8|4.0|Made when Arnold still had a great deal of muscle to spare. This movie, like a lot of science fiction, assumes aliens will be a hostile group. Those races that make it to space would have the intelligence and capacity to engage new races more amicably than depicted. How else would such a race even reach the level of achieving the ability to travel in space unless they had learned to live in peace. Otherwise they would not have lasted long enough to do so.
1433502410|5.0|I have found footnotes in this study Bible that are not in others, and I own many.  These are not opinion type notes or notes that simply recap what you just read, but notes giving historical facts  and archeological findings that support the text.  I just wish they did it in NIV also.
B001UW58WW|5.0|ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT! I love this CD!!!! I was first introduced to David Garrett on PBS during the airing of \\"David Garrett, Live In Berlin\\". I was mesmerized by him as a musician and as an entertainer and have been trying to get a copy of the performance ever since. Pure inspiration! I think kids and people of all ages viewing this performance would be moved to try this instrument for themselves. I know I am! I really enjoy classical music with a contemporary edge and it's the same with David Garrett. It's what makes this CD so very special. My favorite--- \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" by Queen. A side note: The tempo is perfect to listen to if you enjoy moderate to fast speed walking.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight is possibly the best movie ever.  Heath Ledger is amazing and terrifying, and you get an extra hour of movie footage after it seems like the movie is ending.  Awesome!
0307454541|5.0|Fast-paced and unexpected, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is hard to put down once you've begun reading it. I love the two main characters, especially Salander, a strong female character that defies the typical female and 20 somethings stereotypes. I read the second book in the trilogy, The Girl who Played with Fire and it is even better than this one. I can't wait to read the final book.If you enjoy a complex mystery with many plot lines and multi-layered characters, you would enjoy this book.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|I don't care for this series just because it's reminiscent of the way things used to be in the business world before women got in more top level positions.  I can't criticize the acting--they are all good.  It's just not a show for me.
B001DSNF8C|3.0|I've mainly written this review to warn those who purchase this item from Amazon instead of one of the independent sellers. I bought this Blu ray from Amazon and when it arrived, the Blu Ray box was not in good shape. The plastic had that cheap wavy quality to it. I'm sure that all of their copies aren't like this one but I'm just warning you. Other than that, the disc was fine and it looks great. But if you are a stickler like me, it might be best to not take the chance and buy it from someone else!
B0025KVLS8|5.0|Okay, I know some of you will disagree that this is their masterpiece; you may possibly point toward the utterly fantastic Revolver, or perhaps Sgt. Pepper as thier finest moment. Perhaps artistically that may be so (remember, this is subjective). But, for me, and MILLIONS others, the early Beatles albums were and are the most exciting that they ever released, the most exhilirating music ever made possibly; THIS is the sound of Beatlemania! And man does it sound wonderful! GLORIOUS! Okay, the reviewer below me made some good points about certain songs sounding better on a couple other CDs (one being a comp., which I steer from except for Past Masters; I am amongst those who simply cannot afford to buy a CD for one song; so congratulations if you can afford that, or the stereo box --let alone the mono one, with the original stereo mixes of Help! and Rubber Soul, and the great Sgt. Pepper mono mix; but for MANY of us, who are possibly buying these one, two, three etc at a time, and those who have hungered for the first four albums to be released in stereo for ALL these years (utter frustration for many extreme fanatics) --these are a GODSEND!<br /><br />And this CD sounds miles better to me than on the infamous \\"Beat Records\\" Original Master Recordings CD set that I've absolutely treasured. It was infamous for its GREAT sound quality. That is, it was great sound...UNTIL NOW.<br /><br />I cannot put into words the thrill of hearing this album this way, but I will try...first off, the sound is FANTASTIC! Especially amazing was the first listening to Things We Said Today; it sounds unbelieveable on here! And the opening drum wallop of Any Time At All, which gets MY vote as one of the finest Beatles songs ever, my absolute favorite; those writers of the book An Illustrated Record claim that it's not a love song, that is ABSURD! It's the great John Lennon at 100% sincere and heartfelt (which with John means a LOT), the lyrics are beautiful and the delivery is absolute perfection; if you want to know why Lennon was/is considered one of the very best singers in rock and roll history, look no further than this song. It's the greatest!; Lennon was the greatest.<br /><br />This -- along with With The Beatles -- is my favorite Beatles album. Their greatest period. This is simply the peak of the Beatles as pop song craftsmen. There is NOTHING more important to a song than a euphoric feeling it can bring to you just from hearing it, as opposed to whatever \\"statement\\" it makes. Joyously life-affirming is what this is! I was feeling down lately, and this music makes me -- can make one -- feel glad to be ALIVE! The greatness of the early Beatles!<br />This the most thrilling, Any Time At All, Tell Me Why, Things We Said Today, A Hard Day's Night, I Should Have Known Better, And I Love Her -- there is simply not a bad song on here! They are fantastic. I'm Happy Just To Dance With You -- dismissed by some snobs for being \\"lightweight\\" lyrically, even Lennon was not crazy of The Beatles' early songs; too bad! For the opening chords [whatever chords they are!] are positively THRLLING! One song that was my least favorite on here, When I Get Home, even THAT sounds wonderful!<br /><br />This whole album is utter pop perfection.<br /><br />I bought this and Revolver first, as I did not have the money to pre-order more. I have since went out today and, spurred on by these, the sound on both (Revolver is VASTLY improved from its previous CD release), I was SO excited, bought the other 5 I was missing of up through Revolver, and will hopefully get more (aka the rest) in a couple weeks.<br /><br />Don't let this gem of an album pass you by; it is positively beautiful.<br /><br />You NOT gonna think that And I Love Her, or Any Time At All, are anything less?<br /><br />Stop analyzing and open your heart. (I just realized, how some will never appreciate certain albums, the truth in the Lovin' Spoonful song: \\"It's like trying to tell a stranger about rock androll.\\")<br /><br />ENJOY! The songs are perfection and the sound quality is TREMENDOUS!!!!<br /><br />No true Beatles fan can NOT love this disc!TREMENDOUS!!!!    No true Beatles fan can NOT love this disc!

B0011UBDTK|5.0|I was very concerned over ordering this product after seeing all the problems had reported prior.  But have ordered from Amazon before and NEVER had a problem. Played all discs immediately and are all in good shape, no scratches, no skipping, excellent quality.  They do come in cardboard sleeves, so kept the packaging in seperate place and put discs in individule jewel cases for protection.  Highly recommend this product.  If they don't work you can always return them.  I didn't have to!  Love this series!
B001E2JNA6|5.0|Ever since I purchased my new TV and the Sony PS3, I've been replacing favorite DVDs with their Blu-ray counterparts. P & P is one of my all-time favorites so when the Blu-ray became available I didn't hesitate in purchasing it and I'm ecstatic that I did. The movie looks absolutely incredible. The colors are more vivid, the people look life-like, the settings and scenery are gorgeous -- in short, everything looks unbelievably beautiful. My words cannot do justice to the clarity, the sharpness, the sheer beauty of it all. I fell in love with Elizabeth and Darcy all over again.    If you have a Blu-ray player, and love P & P, I would definitely recommend purchasing this version of the mini-series.
B001W63DXC|5.0|If you have doubts about whether or not to buy this, I'd say just listen to the amazing drum line on 'Fear of the Dark'.  Best Maiden live album EVER.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Every song in this blu ray is good. One of the best picture and sound I've ever had. And nice friends.... especially yoyo ma, and Steven tyler... But some songs.... His friends plays mainly, he is just standing.<br />Anyway I love this nice concert. I will go to his concert when he visits this area.<br />If this is a must-buy for his fan.

0385340575|5.0|This is one of the best yet, and a welcome return to reality from his previous adventure.  Written in the first person, Reacher becomes involved in tracking and destroying a terrorist cell in NYC.  As a New Yorker who walks the streets and rides the subways, I can vouch for the descriptive accuracy of all the scenes described.  There is a good balance between creative detective work and tremendous violence.  You will not be disappointed.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|There's nothing that I can add that hasn't been said by reviewers far more literate than I am.  As a fan beginning with Clint's \\"spaghetti westerns\\" done on extremely low budgets, then moving on to the Dirty Harry series, his more modern westerns, the various law enforcement and military themes, and finally to the more esoteric \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" and \\"Mystic River\\", Mr. Eastwood seldom fails to entertain.  His commentaries on the strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity and on man's reliance on self are consistent threads in his firms.  Since his media of choice is film, his examples are a bit overblown, but hey -- these are the movies! His message may have become a bit more subtle over the years, but his basic movie making premise seems to be \\"if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing\\".  Now that's entertainment.

031606792X|5.0|Had already read the previous 3 books of the series and was anxiously awaiting this one.  When received, I could not put it down.  I read it in 2 days, which would have been less had I not had to stop for backroom breaks and feeding my family and sleeping times.  Was as good, if not better than the previous 3.  Each book brought more and different aspects of the main characters person and abilities into the story.  Continued to hold my attention and expectations as to what could come next.  Sorry to see that there will be no more
B001KEHAI0|5.0|It was great seeing this movie again.  This is probably Bill Murray's best movie.  The theme is timeless and I'd recommend it to entire family.  I especially enjoyed watching it a second time with the producer comments.  There were a lot of facts about the movie that I didn't know.  So get the Blue Ray version and enjoy.
B002436WFI|5.0|What happens when a tourist wants to tour DiscWorld ?  Well, those events are bound up in  this DVD called The Color Of Magic.  Fun to watch the tourist be led around by Discworld's  more inapt wizard.  The tourist travels with a multi-legged, alive, trunk which is an   unforgettable character.    I love this series of DisWorld books by Terry Pratchett. And this English made DVD is a hoot to watch  the character brought to life.  I bought one book just to see what they were about and I love the story   line so much I went out and bought all the DiscWorld series books and DVDs I could.  DiscWorld is a make believe  world of a giant sea turtle, with four elephants on it's back, with a large disc on the backs of the four  elephants that floats around space.  Most stories take place on the discworld but there have been occasion  when the inhabitants of discworld try to climb down the disc to see what gender the sea turtle is.  Humor abounds with an English accent with witches, drawfs, trolls, elfs, watchmen and other delightful  categories of folks with a dragon\creature thrown in......and now one tourist.
B000JQWH24|1.0|i orginally ordered the original thriller album new sealed.but once the price went up after the sale .i was sent the 25th anniversary album.they would not send me what was promised or what i ordered .even though i had saved all the paperwork showing i purchased the original thriller not a later copy.so finally after contacting amazon .and emailing back and forth to the seller they refunded my money after i sent the album back.i think they should of held up thier end of thier sale and sent me what they were advertising and selling on the website and if they had to just take a loss.i will NEVER purchasing anything from them again.
B000C3H4M2|5.0|I just finished listening to the 5.1 version of this cd. Absolutly STUNNING!!!! I was thinking about how great all the T.H. cds sound on 5.1 when Electric guitiar came on- OMG!! Ive been listen to this album since it came out- and I NEVER heard this before- FANTASTIC I cant even describe how much different it sounds then the normal cd but to say its like going from a 13 inch B&W to a 50 inch HDTV. This has been one of my faveorite T.H. cds because of the experimaental nature- but the 5.1 sound turns it into a fantastic aurial experiance- the songs fit together like they never did before everytime I play it I cant believe electric guitair is really the smae song- just the wall of voices that say \\"this is a crime against the state\\" which did not come through at all on any other version- this is one of the greatest aurial experiances of all time.  The whole cd I noticed things I nvever did before - like the multi-voices on memories- the way the music at the end of each sentance on cities seems to come down from the cieling- many things. The vocals are so much more clear and intense- but for my money just the way electric guitair sounds is worth the price- also Drugs sounds like a totally different song-its like your locked in a padded room with david and you caN HEAR HIS EVERY BREATH- and he seems to be kinda insaine. I have to say I dont have a fantastic setup - a DEnon that costs about $350 and a sony DVD-SACD player that costs about $80 (It does have some great surround options)All the duel disks are GREAT but the last 2 songs on this one blew my mind they sound so much better.
0743581601|5.0|This is a great story, but it's especially well done as an audio book.  After reading it and then listening to it (library copies) a couple years later I just bought a copy for myself.  The readers both do a splendid job.
0385341008|4.0|War. Death. Hunger. What's to enjoy! To my surprise, Mary Ann Shaffer tells an often funny story about the Isle of Guernsey, forgotten British enclave (otherwise mostly known for its cows), and its occupation by German forces during World War 2, Everyone depicted, whether German soldier or English inhabitant, is a human being here. Their clever evasions (the Potato Peel Pie society) and their humane understanding and acceptance of the woman who has a child by one of the occupiers, their caring for her and for each other, make the humor fully acceptable, and bring the reader into a time and place foreign to most of us.
0307454541|5.0|Normally I don't enjoy a novel translated to English, but this one flowed nicely. Larsson created great characters, especially the girl, and suspension of disbelief was no problem at all. Though the place names and people names were foreign to me and difficult to follow at times, it didn't detract from the suspense. The lifestyles and political persuasions of the characters are quite opposite to mine as well, but even that didn't detract.<br /><br />When I was done, I ordered the sequel immediately. I was happy to discover that there were two sequels, but sad to learn that the author, Stieg Larsson, was dead and there would be no more.<br /><br />This is the first book for which I was willing to write a review and I recommend it highly.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|This is a great way of getting all of the Saint-Saens piano concertos.  I have been happy with these CDs.  I have not liked the 1st piano concerto, but that is not the fault of the performance.  My only problem with the performance would be that the 2nd concerto's fast movements are played too slowly.  The sound (recorded 1985-1987) is quite good.      Piano Concerto No. 1 in D major Op. 17  1st mov. - 12:30  2nd mov. - 9:35  3rd mov. - 6:50    Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor Op. 22  1st mov. - 11:14  2nd mov. - 5:55  3rd mov. - 6:31    Piano Concerto No. 3 in E flat major Op. 29  1st mov. - 14:13  2nd mov. - 8:55  3rd mov. - 7:47    Piano Concerto No. 4 in C minor Op. 44  1st mov. - 12:53  2nd mov. - 13:36    Piano Concerto No. 5 in F major Op. 103  1st mov. - 11:41  2nd mov. - 11:14  3rd mov. - 6:03    \\"Wedding Cake\\" Caprice-Valse Op. 76 - 6:18    \\"Africa\\" Fantaisie Op. 89 - 10:48
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I have not read all the books, only the first four but I look at the tv series as an entirely different entity anyway. It's been a long time since there's been a fantasy series that adults can enjoy, that isn't strictly aimed at children. At first I wasn't sure I was going to like this series but it got better as it went along and I love the dvd set. I just wish they had had more commentaries. Craig Parker is quite funny in the commentary he does for Puppeteer. My only complaint is that it is a bit difficult to get the dvds out of the case. I'm always afraid I will break them since the buttons are not very flexible.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This was undoubtably the best box set I have ever bought! I was just taking a chance when I ordered it because at that time, I hadn't even spoken with anyone who had seen the show. Boy, was I in for a wonderful surprise! It is incomparably and handsdown my favorite. If you are a fan of vampires without the hokey capes and Dracula castles, this is for you. In the modern day setting of Louisiana with the sticky heat, crickets and frogs singing in the background and the storms of love, hate, revulsion, friendship, carnal love, action, drama--it's all there along with excellent writing, filming, acting, and character matches with the actors who portray them. As has been attributed to the history of the South, there is racism but with a twist-the vampires are the ones who are the targets and yes, victims. Two years before the time of the opening scenes, vampires had \\"come out of the closet.\\" With synthetic blood on the market, they no longer had to hunt among the population for sustenance. No longer was there a need to prey upon humans. The vampires here are the ones trying to integrate and have a voice in society and basic rights to be counted as a functioning part of modern society. Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer, Rutina Wesley and all the others make up a mottled family--all are flawed and seeking love in ways that are, let's say, unconventional. There's nothing that I don't like in this TV show except for the fact of when it ends I have to wait for the next season to be released.
B000SEGCRS|1.0|I bought this book because I recently purchased the Canon's Rebel T1.  After reading some of the reviews, I thought this would be a great beginners book. However, this book doesn't offer any information that I can not find online or in my owners manual for free. I thought he was going to provide insight and professional tricks and tools of the trade.  I feel like I've been ripped off and I'd like my money back, however, I guess this will make for good reading to pass the time away on the subway commute home.      Very Disappointed
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|It's a lot of mike for the price. The thin but long cable help making it useful. It's omnidirection; so try not to cough between singing or speaking. The battery is inexpensive too.  One can buy a few for a dollar.
1401307787|5.0|\\"Wherever You Go There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation In Everyday Life\\" by Jon Kabat-Zinn is not your ordinary \\"how to\\" meditate book.  Through short passages, the author helps you cultivate mindfulness, in essence, wakefulness, in one's own life.<br /><br />Regardless if you are new to mediation or a longtime practitioner, I feel the passages in \\"Wherever You Go There You Are\\" will resonate within and assist you in reclaiming the richness of all of your moments.<br /><br />Some of the concepts you may know, but have you really thought of them?  Do you apply them?  I liked that Kabat-Zinn points out that there really is no \\"right way\\" to practice, since mediation is a personal thing.  However, there are practices that can assist you with getting more from your mediation.  There are over 70 \\"Chapters\\" or passages in the book, and I'd recommend not reading too many at a time so that you can fully digest what the author is communicating.  I believe you will get much more from the book if you not only read it, but contemplate on what the author is trying to get across.  I know this helped me.<br /><br />This moment is all we really have to work with, and this book helps us realize that and regain touch with ourselves in the moment of now.  The suggestions and instructions in this book will help a person's meditation practice as well as help understand the purpose behind meditating in the first place.  Part one explores the rational and background for taking on or deepening a personal practice of meditation.  Part two explores some basic aspects of formal meditation practice.  And part three explores a range of applications and perspectives on mindfulness.  Many of the chapters end with explicit suggestions for incorporating aspects of both formal and informal mindfulness practice into one's life.<br /><br />If you meditate, or want to meditate, this book has many useful suggestions and I'd recommend adding it to your meditation library.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks.From the School of Hard Knocks.
B000EHSVOG|3.0|Summary   An architect (Paul Newman), a firefighter (Steve McQueen), a wealthy businessman (William Holden), a con artist (Fred Estaire), a security guard (O.J. Sympson before the scandal), and other guests are trapped at the top of a burning sky-scraper, the tallest in the world.  Will they survive?  Violence   As one would expect in a movie about fire, people get burned... many times.  We see people on fire screaming, blackened and sizzling heads are normal occurrences here, as are explosions, falls, and even drowning.  There is no sadism here, but it's still intense.  Sexual Content   Newman and Dunaway are engaged to be married, but it is made obvious that they have not been exactly... chaste.  We see them start kissing and undressing.  Later we see them lying on top of a bed together.  Newman is shirtless and Dunaway is showing off most of her legs, but other than that, they are fully clothed.  Later, Wagner conducts a similar affair with his secretary (we see her in a long shirt with underwear for one fairly brief scene).  Otherwise, party dresses are not always modest and oftentimes reveal fair amounts of cleavage.    Language   Strong for a PG film.  S-words and uses of Jesus' name are commonplace.  D-words and h-words are also frequently used.  Approximately sixty profanities.     The Towering Inferno (1974) was Irwin Allen's dream project.  After the major success of The Poseidon Adventure in 1972, Allen had studio exec's hunting him down for movie projects.  He hunted down major stars Steve McQueen (The Great Escape), Paul Newman (The Sting), William Holden (Network) and Faye Dunaway (Bonnie and Clyde).  Fred Estaire was nominated for an Oscar and Jennifer Jones returned to film for the first time in years.   The film was a huge success with three academy award wins and easily earned back the 14 million dollars that Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. put into it.  Viewed now in days, after the disaster genre fizzled in the late seventies, one wonderswhether the film is just nostalgic, not as good as people make it seem.   The answer is yes.  The plot is reminiscent of soap operas and the acting is wooden and uninspiring.  Still, the special effects are amazing, and there is always the knowledge that they do not make movies like this anymore, and perhaps for good reason.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I love Loreena McKennitt both in person and on CD. I come from an English, Irish heritage and her music moves me back centuries to my family roots. I have all her CDs and can listen to them for hours.
B00005JLEX|4.0|Love everything about this show. Only thing that I hate about new seasons is that a lot of time they have a lot less episodes then the following season. Such as season one of this show which is only 6 episodes. Gotta love George though! He is the best character on the show by FAR!!
0385341008|4.0|I belong to a small book group at the church where I work a few hours a week. We have a Fall and Spring set of meetings and this is the first time the book has not been a non-fiction book. Not only that, we didn't use the discussion questions at the back of the book, but brought our own to the discussion. Our members run from eighty-something down to the fifties - both make and female and everyone like this book. Having people in the group that really knew first hand about the Guernsey occupation added another dimension to our discussion. We all felt that we learned something new about history and about human nature. It is one of those books that you have trouble putting down when the duties of everyday life call. I for one, wanted this book to be really true....a testiment to what people can be and do for those around them. Some members of our group thought the ending seemed rushed and too \\"fairy-tale \\". I would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in history and/or World War II - or just a good quick read.
6305428352|5.0|I bought this video to use in a Career & Life Planning class. The students enjoyed it which surprised them because of the age of the movie. It is a very good story. It demonstrates the passion one can have for a profession in spite of the fact he hated the job at the beginning.

B00243FQFA|5.0|Again, thoroughly enjoyed watching the series.  Yes, a couple of episodes were a bit dumb but overall, loved it.
0312330537|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read.  Everyone I've given it to has loved it also.  You can actually taste and smell the essence of India through the written text.  Some pages I lingered on and read two or three times just to soak up the beauty of the words.  I've tried reading other books by Roberts, but none of them come anywhere close to this work (so don't waste your time).  If you've ever wanted to travel to India, save money and buy this book instead of an airline ticket.  You'll feel like you experienced it first hand after reading this delicious book!
0451450523|5.0|I was captivated by Beagle's Last Unicorn in university, and just decided that I needed a new copy.  I hadn't read it in years, and found it just as enthralling as it was over thirty years ago.    But I was surprised at how difficult it was to ignore the presence of the Red Bull...I mean, the energy drink, which kept diluting the serious and mysterious fear due to Haggard's bull.  I've come to terms with my last name, and the connotations recent acquaintances attach to me because of it, but I was sad that such a great piece of literature had been sullied by a cultural phenomenon.

B0021L8V5M|5.0|Everything about this BBC production is faultless - the casting, the screenplay, the filming, the locations. I've watched this about a dozen times and love it more each time. If ever a film deserved to be released on Bu-ray, this is it.
0545128285|3.0|Being an avid Harry Potter fan when I saw this book I was expecting some deep insight into the wizarding world through a kids' tales. What I got was, well, kids tales. It was a bunch of stories obviously meant to convey morals. The one story in it that was worth reading was featured in the seventh book. If you are looking for a good alternative to the conventional fairy tales, these stories will keep a kid fairly interested, omitting the commentary by Albus Dumbledore.    Positives:  -Refreshing style  -Insight into morals    Negatives  -Rarely offers insight into wizarding  -Does not add anything to tale of Three Brothers
B002DYKP8S|1.0|I was shocked when I discovered that Miramax was releasing this great movie on Blu-ray as a dubbed film. It's an insult to a great director and to all Chinese filmmakers. We don't see French films dubbed, so why did this stupid film company go out of its way to destroy a great Chinese film in this way? It's ignorance on a grand scale. Dumbos at Miramax need to realise that there is a great joy to watching subtitled foreign films and no-one wants to see great art films destroyed with these inappropriately dubbed soundtracks.    The greatness of Zhang Yimou classics such as Raise The Red Lantern, To Live, House of Flying Daggers, The Road Home, Ju Dou and Hero is partly because of their Chinese soundtracks, and to dub these films is to destroy the very fabric of their art. I own House of Flying Daggers on Blu-ray and that film has been largely destroyed by the horrible dubbed soundtrack, which makes the actors sound goofy and unreal. You cannot believe how bad House of Flying Daggers now is and I don't know if I can bear to watch it with those dreadfully corny dubbed voices. Miramax needs to understand that customers don't want dubbed cr*p ... leave the soundtracks as they are, with English subtitles.     My other complaint about Miramax is that it won't listen to its customers. There are a lot of great reviews on Amazon, and across the web, about the film Enchanted April, which has an almost cult following. But is Miramax thinking about releasing it on Blu-ray? Hardly. Not one word has been mentioned about the possibility of this title coming out on Blu-ray. We are seeing second-rate films released by Miramax on Blu-ray, but not something good like Enchanted April, which so many people want to see at its very best.     I'm so angry with this film company. I think it is very poorly run.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is one of my favorite old movies.  Alvin York was typical of his people and his generation.  He was hard headed, but had great integrity.  He turned his life around and became a peaceful man.  Then he was asked to kill for his country.  He was willing to face severe punishment to conscientiously object until he was persuaded (rightly I think) that a soldier for freedom is not violating the commandment against murder.  Once his mind was made up, he soldiered with a will, performed heroic deeds, and helped win the war against German aggression.  After it was all over, he downplayed the heroic aspect of his action, went back to the Tennessee hills and became a good husband, neighbor, and friend.  Gary Cooper was excellent in the strong, silent roles and plays York just as I would expect him to be.  He gives a fine performance in an interesting, complex role.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Season 3 takes on a whole new look. Rita is pregnant, Deb gave up drinking, swearing, and men. Dexter makes a friend. All this ties into a whole new way of thinking for Dexter. It was another great season, a must see for any true Dexter lover!
B001TW69J4|5.0|Tosin Abasi is a brilliant man. And for me, he came out of nowhere. I never listened to Reflux, though I did know about them. After discovering this album, I listened to a few of their songs... not bad, but nothing to rave about either. I can't help but wonder, why did Abasi not go off on his own to begin with? In Reflux, he wasn't given the room to shine with all his genius. I am happy that he FINALLY agreed to do an album on his own. He is now one of my favorite modern guitarists, a true master of his craft. I cannot wait to hear more from him, hopefully soon.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Now I have all the seasons - it's good because the show is off the air - but still has a large fan base.  I enjoyed \\"escaping through the gate.\\"  The characters became friends I'd watch every week.  The only \\"problem\\" I saw was that Jewel Strait came in to the series and she captured a lot of single episodes dedicated to her story line and her new character- much to the expense of the seasoned characters I cared a lot more about - so, while a little bothersome - it was all right.  I do keep thinking of her as a young mechanic however (Serenity). I like her work.
0312370849|5.0|This book is very well written.  It is based on fact. The author grabs you and holds you from the beginning.  I cried and cheered at different parts of the story.  Being the 60th anniversary of the Holocaust, it is a timely story that reminds us that this did happen and we should never forget.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|Like many here, I've been a near-obsessive Beatles aficionado for decades.  Having had the opportunity to listen to the stereo remasters, here's my two bits:     Are they an improvement? Yes.     Are they an audio revelation? No (Leaving aside the fact that the first 4 albums are now available on CD in stereo for the first time).     During close listening at high volumes on good equipment, you will be able to discern a difference, but I do not find them to be worlds different than the 1980s CD releases (which is unsurprising because they are just new, remastered transfers of the same half-inch tape master mixdowns used for those discs).     The most notable change is more robust bass presence (likely due to the mastering EQ) and an added edge of clarity on some vocals and higher timbre instruments (likely due to EQ as well as higher bitrate digital transfers). At its best, it enables you to hear much more clearly McCartney's amazing bass work (on some songs he is all over the place, laying down complex, nearly subliminal melody lines, rather than just thump-thump timekeeping).     But (and here some \\"purists\\" may disagree) I think the project really represents a missed opportunity. As is painfully apparent in headphones, these remasters are just a crisper presentation of the same clunky mixes from the early days of stereo when (due to the ping-ponging required by the limited multi-tracking available) there is a lot of hard panning (voices or instruments appearing exclusively in one channel or the other), which results in a very constrained, compartmentalized sound. I really wish that -- instead of just remastering -- they had actually gone back to digitally synchronize the original multitrack elements and had completely remixed the albums using the best studio equipment available today.     We got glimpses of how aurally awesome that could be from the amazing sound quality and enveloping true stereo of the [[ASIN:B000002TYZ Anthology]] and [[ASIN:B000JK8OYU Love]]releases of recent years. Completely aside from the mash-ups and inserted audio elements, \\"Love\\" was revelatory: The sparkling clarity and enveloping spaciousness of the new mixes of the basic song tracks was astounding when compared to the originals (it is apparent in the song \\"Help\\"; it is painfully apparent in \\"I Am the Walrus\\" -- listen to both and just try to tell me that the new \\"Love\\" mix isn't remarkably better).     So, if you don't yet own these albums and want to, or are a Beatles completist, or are a high-end audiophile who only listens to music in your acoustically neutral room on $1,200 studio reference speakers, by all means buy the remastered versions.     But if you're a more casual fan who's going to be listening on a compact stereo (or ripped to an iPod), you're not going to be missing out on whole new dimensions if you stick with the discs you shelled out $150 bucks for 20 years ago. In most cases, without an immediate track-to-track comparison of the original and remastered versions, you're not going to notice the difference.
B001993Y2C|4.0|I only saw bits and pieces of this series when it was on TV. Never a whole episode. Seems like there was something on I'd rather watch. But I was always interested in it. So when it came out in Blu-Ray I decided to get it. I was definetly not disappointed. And I'm glad I got the blu-ray version, too. I watched 4-5 episodes a day until I finished the whole series. And that's where the problem arises. This would have been the perfect box set if a booklet came with it to help you on the episodes. With being so large a series I got lost on where I was sometimes, from day to day. But none the less. I'm glad I bought it.
B001993Y2C|3.0|Awesome series. This is not a review or the video quality of the series or the series itself. Good video quality but the packaging is like from the 70s. No episode list, what's this, a guessing game? The box and the robot are nice additions but the boxes for the seasons are really crappy. Discs can get scratched really easy, they are only protected by a slim cardboard layer. They aren't even held in place by a plastic holder. All in all I would recommend buying each season separately.
0756405890|5.0|I have read books I love over and over but this one especially.  It is a boy coming of age story and you expect to think \\"not again...\\"  But this book has something special and is different enough to keep you from saying that.  I want to say it's like Harry Potter but without the friends and a little more rebellious, but it is anything but Harry Potter.  I hope you give it a try.  It is well worth it.

I am an artist and i use his music to create to and I have to say some of my artwork has been inspired just by this CD.<br /><br />I read his Bio and found he has an extensive musical background. I will buy his earlier work for sure. This CD was a great introduction into his music for me anyway.<br /><br />I find myself going off into meditation with near all of the songs, this is a magickal and inspiring CD, the artist truly has a gift for creating an atmosphere that surrounds you, and takes you to another world.<br /><br />Love love love this artist and will buy his music again.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This was a difficult work out for me, no lie... I was not really that much in shape. I haven't done much working out since my junior year of high school when I had a gym class. Anyway, just know you must keep up with it. You really start to see yourself progressing when you get to day 5. My suggestion is, if you can't do it all the way just keep doing the DVD everyday anyway until your maximum point of tolerance is reached and then just try again the next day  until you can do the whole DVD. For me I noticed I couldn't do it all the way the through the first time (for each level), but on the second go I could do it all the way through. So, just see what works for you. Don't give up though, I know she says you need to do it all the way through without stopping, but instead of giving up just go easy on yourself, do the \\"Anita\\" (beginner) version of the workout until you can work your way up to the more advanced version.    Okay my progress with the DVD:    Within the first month I lost around 5 lbs, my body fat percentage went from 30.2% to 27.3% in 19 days. After calculating how much weight I am losing, it is about 1.1 lbs a week. Also in 19 days I lost around .75 inches off my hips, an inch off my thighs, and I am not sure about my waist because I think I might be measuring wrong...but about .5'' have been lost off my waist. Remember to watch what you eat though! Or your efforts will be wasted.
B001EN71DQ|5.0|just what I wanted, plus all the extras from a limited edition dual disk format you usually don't get the extras in a boxed set, a great purchase,especially at that price.
B0025KVLTM|3.0|A friend of mine bought this cd today and brought it over to my house. We compared his new \\"remastered\\" copy with my original. The only difference is that his was louder. That's it. No clearer, no more noticeable bass or drums. Nothing. Don't waste your time buying this \\"remastered\\" version, since you're not missing out on anything but a few decibels. The reason I still give this a 3 star is because it is one of my favorite Beatles albums, and is well worth your time to listen to.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|[...]    Love makes us do astonishing, amazing things.    Things that surprise even us.    Things that push us past what we thought were our limits.    Things that are utterly, literally fantastic, i.e., things that exist only in the realm of fantasy.    Love ties us together; it makes us understand ourselves and how much we need each other.    With themes like that, Up qualifies as the most, er, uplifting story in many a year.    It's the story of an old man, his absent late wife, a young boy, a dog and a bird -- and what they're willing to do for love. It's hysterically funny, heartbreaking and heartwarming.    It's made by the folks at Pixar, which has put out so many great stories that it must be considered the contemporary corporate home of master storytellers. Another home run into the next county.    And I always try to remember the short at the beginning of the evening; the Pixar folks remember how much fun it was to have a cartoon with Road Runner, Bugs Bunny or even Pepe LePew before the main feature. \\"Partly Cloudy\\" is a sweetly creative turn on the old myth that storks deliver babies -- it probably started with the question, OK, if storks deliver babies, where do they get the babies from? As always, the short warms up the audience with a healthy dose of bellylaughs and sentiment, softening us up for the story of Carl, Ellie, Russell, Dug and Kevin.    -- B.W. Richardson

You can feel the lyrics of the songs come to life.  The is a must have cd for all music lovers.
B000U1ZV3U|4.0|I expected this to be something like Tombstone but it wasn't anything like it at all, I like both of these movies but if I where to choose it would be this one due to the fact that this one tells almost the whole story of Wyatt Earp and how he became famous. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of Wyatt Earp.

B00006AW2O|5.0|12 X 5 gives us some of the very best of The Stones' early work; the CD has some bluesy numbers and the instrumental \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue,\\" the address of Chess Records where a number of these songs were recorded, also shines. The Rolling Stones perform very well on this CD; but when didn't they do everything they could to please their fans? Their longevity proves that their fans still enjoy their music; and that's terrific. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like that they used the artwork from the original record album cover.<br /><br />\\"Around and Around\\" has a great bluesy/rockin' sound to it that makes it a strong number with which to open this album. Chuck Berry would be proud! The electric guitars are awesome and I like that percussion and the drums! \\"Confessin' The Blues\\" continues in the same vein and The Rolling Stones ace this seemingly effortlessly; but of course we know it really wasn't all that easy--their talent always carries them through. Mick Jagger's singing is faultless, too. Great! \\"Empty Heart\\" impresses me; that harmonica and percussion enhance the musical arrangement as they bat this right out of the ballpark! I love it.<br /><br />Jerry Ragovoy's \\"Time Is on My Side\\" is one of my favorite early Stones tunes even if some people prefer the guitar-intro version, what we get here is the organ-intro version. The blues flavor of this cover song is terrific; and it all holds its own very well. \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" is essentially acoustic; it has Mick singing squarely front and center as the stripped down music compliments his singing to perfection--and beyond! \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" is really great and it makes a fine ballad for this album.<br /><br />\\"It's All Over Now\\" is quite an energetic number that many Stones fans (and even non-Stones fans) will recognize; this was first released by The Valentinos with Bobby Womack and then covered by The Rolling Stones. The Stones do this flawlessly and it blows my mind! \\"It's All Over Now\\" has great vocals and the music with those guitars and more make this one of the best early numbers by The Stones. \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\" is a strong instrumental with a distinctly `60s flavor to it--but don't worry; it still sounds awesome in our times. \\"Under The Boardwalk\\" again showcases the band's ability to cover a song (this time by The Drifters) with panache; they sing and play this wonderfully and this music lacks nothing--this is all THAT good. \\"Congratulations\\" is another great, melancholy ballad that describes a man's ache when his woman leaves him; and there's \\"Grown up Wrong\\" with its percussion, vocals, and a mixture of major and minor keys to make this a fine tune indeed!<br /><br />\\"If You Need Me\\" has a R&B style popular then and even now; The Rolling Stones perform this wonderfully; it's got a fine rhythm and these artists never miss a beat! The album ends strong, too, with The Rolling Stones performing \\"Susie Q.\\" \\"Susie Q\\" rocks and I those guitars make it a real stand-out of this CD!<br /><br />The Rolling Stones scored a huge goal in my book with this album; this is fine music that is a necessity for any fan of The Rolling Stones. It also makes a fine starter CD for people just discovering The Stones; and anyone who likes R&B from the 1960s would do well to add this to their collections.vocals and the music with those guitars and more make this one of the best early numbers by The Stones. \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\" is a strong instrumental with a distinctly `60s flavor to it--but don't worry; it still sounds awesome in our times. \\"Under The Boardwalk\\" again showcases the band's ability to cover a song (this time by The Drifters) with panache; they sing and play this wonderfully and this music lacks nothing--this is all THAT good. \\"Congratulations\\" is another great, melancholy ballad that describes a man's ache when his woman leaves him; and there's \\"Grown up Wrong\\" with its percussion, vocals, and a mixture of major and minor keys to make this a fine tune indeed!     \\"If You Need Me\\" has a R&B style popular then and even now; The Rolling Stones perform this wonderfully; it's got a fine rhythm and these artists never miss a beat!

B001VZY4MS|5.0|This is a remaster that as soon as you put it on , you go oh my god this is done right. In Fact of the first four solo's this one gets my vote for best sound, You really have to hear it to see what I mean, good show Neil :)
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I liked most of the songs in this CD. I Love her voice and the way that the music is not overpowering of her voice. This CD may not be for everyone as it combines both the Blues and Jazz so if you are a rocker, it is not going to hit you with any intense drum or guitar drama. It has a hint of motown, some great jazz and it is mellow and new. I also like Duffy so it leans in that direction.
B0024FAG62|4.0|I'll second pretty much everything the Sept. 3 '09 reviewer said about the BD transfer in his excellent review - except for the audio.  Watching the BD version, I thought the TrueHD audio stood out even more than the upgrade in visual clarity. After reading his review, I went back and tried an A/B comparison - I played the BD version in my PS3 and the superbit DTS version in my upconverting DVD player, pausing one when playing the other through the same receiver. Both sounded fantastic, but to my subjective ears, the BD track was slightly better. The French horns sounded more like how French horns sound live.  For the DTS version, I had to dial my subwoofer down a bit; maybe the DTS accentuation of the bass is what led the other reviewer to think the TrueHD version had a flatter feel. For the BD version, if it feels a bit flat, crank the bass up some.<br /><br />My 4-star rating is for the movie itself.  Although one of my favorite movies, the plot holes keep it from being the movie I would like it to be.  Kasdan admits to the problem with Rosanna Arquette's storyline in the \\"making of\\" featurette, but there is also the unexplained motivation of the Jeff Goldblum character as well as some other minor issues.  It gives the appearance that the editing was rushed.  I was hoping for a Director's Cut with the BD version that would fill these gaps, but no luck; there is less in the BD package than there was in the superbit gift set.  I am disappointed Kasdan didn't care enough for this movie to make it whole.<br /><br />Best performances in the movie go to Brian Dennehy (perfect in his part), Linda Hunt (great facial expressions), and Kevin Costner (should have brought some of this character to later roles).  The other three main characters were also very good, as was John Cleese in his small part.
B000002KAT|5.0|The basic tunes are very good but his taste in orchestral embellishment and counterpoint is superb.
0060935464|5.0|I don't often read books more than once.  Two times is pushing it, and three is just impossible.  Yet I can safely say that I have read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" four times and have fell in love with each and every time.  People will ask me what it is about a book that makes it so good?  The answer lies within the connection the reader forms with the book.  \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" reminds me of everything I love about life.  I see myself in the story of Gem and Scout.  I see my heroes in Atticus Finch.  The book in a very odd way reminds me of home, even though I'm not from the south.  Lee's writing style has an immediacy and intimacy that the reader can easily warm into.  I don't hesitate when I make the claim that this is truly one of the best books I've ever read.  Everything from the characters to the plot have a richness and vibrancy that is at once southern and at the same time universal.  Gem and Scout's story is really a growing up tale.  A time in life where you begin to grow into yourself and leave your childhood behind.  At it's core it's unabashedly American and is a true representation of all the joys and sorrows that make up the American diaspora.  So no matter if it's your first or fourth time, cherish this classic novel.  You'll be glad you did.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|i am not so fanatic of the matrix but i like the good action, i won't dress as neo or believe in the underwold of morpheo but the effects and the sound really makes you get hipnotized..
B001R10BEG|4.0|the blu-ray itself (as in any remastered film) is much better than any current or previous version. but as for being a \\"director's cut\\" or extended version, there's essentially not a single scene included that adds anything at all to the storytelling. the theatrical version is far superior.
B000UR9T82|5.0|the spiderman almost jump out off the screen, get the box set not one by one..
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Finally, one of my all time favorites on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I was a little worried that the picture wouldn't be so great as I was never impressed with the original DVD release - it always seemed a little fuzzy.  Well, the Blu-Ray disk is very clear and of course the soundtrack is one of the best ever.<br /><br />\\"The Matrix\\" has been on my top 10 list since first released.  This disk is fantastic and definitely shows off my home theater system.  When you are in the mood for a loud over the top Sci-Fi flick - look no further.
B002NHBNWW|3.0|Although the characters are beautiful and the story line is full of intrigue, I felt that there was too much openly diplayed teen alchohol, drugs, and sexual content that seemed too commonplace. There was none of that with Twilight and it was a huge hit.  It is a big disappointment.
B002B2RY6I|5.0|This is Paulo's effort at self-producing his albums and he has done an admirable job!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|The best c.d. to be recorded easily in a decade if not longer. What a wonderfully simple idea!
B002BSHWUU|1.0|What a shame, and a waste of everyone's time and money.  The mastering engineers couldn't resist the temptation of fighting in the \\"loudness war.\\"  These masters are way too loud, which adds distortion.  Increasing the intrinsic loudness of audio adds distortion, whether its from limiting, normalization, or whatever.  You can't get something for nothing.  They also EQed these.  I can't understand why Sir Paul allowed this to happen.  I've heard bootlegs that sound better! (e.g. the Russian two-fers)  Save your money!  Demand that they redo these correctly!    From what I've heard, the mono remasters have not been so damaged by limiting, although they too appear louder.  My advice: try the mono set, which is how most of these albums were designed to sound anyway.  I wish they would sell mono CDs individually, but unfortunately they don't.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I'm not really into zombie movies. I'm not really into any horror movies, actually. I never seen the Saw movies, and I was under the blankets with all the lights on while watching The Ring. But when my boyfriend got into this zombie kick of his, I thought this would be a good movie to rent. We rented it, watched it, and LOVED IT! We both loved it so much I just had to buy it! While it does have the gross factor of a zombie movie, it wasn't as bad as I have seen in others. And the movie is so funny too! We both couldn't stop laughing throughout it! The ending is the best though.     Bottom line? If you like zombie movies, this movie is definitely for you! If you like comedies, this movie is for you!
0887081770|5.0|I just loved this book.  When you open it and see what happens next on each page it becomes the sweetest story ever. You know the saying, \\"I would give you the moon\\" is about trying to please someone.  This book is just that, a pleasure and a treasure.
0805082662|5.0|One of my all time favorite children's books ... you can't go wrong with a Bill Martin Jr. book!  Eric Carle's illustrations are so beautiful ... perfect gift for new parents and any child from birth through age 6.  The repetitive language is loved by all children.
B00005RHF8|3.0|This Jane Eyre has excellent actors, one of the best but unfortunately, George Scott did not look 38 and definitely, Susanna York was not 18 as in the original book. The St. John is the ugliest St. John too- he is supposed to be very handsome, tall and blond or at least brown haired. George Scott slant on the character is very good, of course it could be the Director's but the slight change in some scenes did not detract from the gist of the story.All in all, it was a very good movie version.  Technically, the DVD itself had vertical streaking and pauses that distracted the viewing. I have watched 5 versions, the earliest was one in 1943 with Orson Wells (I have not seen the 1934 version yet) that was horrible and so far, I think the best is the one with Timothy Dalton- the truest to the original and of course Timothy Dalton was perfect.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I would highly recommend this DVD set to everyone.  The scenery is breathtaking in HD especially if you have a large screen HD tv.  One of the best buys I've made.
B000P46QTA|5.0|I had purchased the standard-definition version earlier and was impressed by what is one of the best European films of the decade. The BluRay version is  icing on the cake.<br /><br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" is a modern classic that represents the pragmatic yet humane face of Germany today; a tribute the Germany's artistic and intellectual maturity as reflected in Donnersmarck's brilliant script and film.<br /><br />The work is a damning indictment of the insane Cold War ideology that infected not only East Germany, but the entire communist Bloc. It should be required viewing for all limosine, trust-funded Marxists and petty beaurocrats. The very same soulless cabal who, ominously, have now set their sights on America.
0307269981|2.0|Overrated: The Girl Who Played with Fire is no where near as good as Dragon Tattoo. Blomkvist, the male co-hero, is a paper thin character who was modestly developed in Tattoo but not at all in Dragon. He emerges as a cliche without affect. Lisbeth Salander is a somewhat better drawn character, but she too remains superficial. The really bad part about this book, however, is the plot, so full of impossible characters whose venality and evil reach commic book levels and no more. Fire far exceeds its quota of dei ex machina.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|When I think about what the Beatles did on 'Rubber Soul' it really ends up in that this is the beginning of the bands second phase and a huge part of why the band has endured to such an extent over the years.In terms of the newly remastered sound it's on this era of their recorded activity that it begins to become of big importance. Engineering wise this is the first Beatle album to make really have use of multi tracked backround vocal harmonies and sometimes even doubled up instrumental parts. One of the things that particularly benifits from the new remaster are the slower songs;on \\"Norwegian Wood\\",\\"In My Life\\",\\"Girl\\" and \\"Michelle\\" alone the clarity of the vocals and the music in the backround is more obviously defined-the reverebed effects and bass are particularly enhanced. In terms of the music of course for....those who have't read through the other 666 reviews of this album here already know what a challange it is for me to say anything new. Well one of the things that really distinguish this album is the huge sense of variety it offers up. Within the album you pretty much have five or six different subgenres of rock n roll and the beauty part is it all flows together with such grace and ease you sometimes forget it's even there. Although American listeners who've never heard the album on CD will find the inclusion of the original UK track lineup a little jarring,the progression of the music makes perfect sense in every possible way.\\"Drive My Car\\",along with \\"You Won't See Me\\" and the wonderful \\"The Word\\",a wonderful example of what I call \\"people music\\" in the rock world all have this great chugging rock n soul rhythm and with a groove in the mix that's actually pretty funky is matched with these ethereal Beach Boy type harmonies that bring out an appealing juxtaposition of two qualities you would'nt think would match.  The influence of the wall of sound makes itself felt on \\"Think For Yourself\\" with that same rocking soul groove mixed in as well. Not only are \\"Nowhere Man\\",\\"I'm Looking Through You\\",\\"Wait\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" in sync with the then burgeoning folk rock sound with the prominant 12 string guitar riffs but still there's a stride in the groove any way you cut it. Ringo has a number here, an awkward little country tune \\"What Goes On\\" and John caps it off with \\"Run For Your Life\\",which has to be the most menacing and vindictive Beatle track in history lyrically. Overall this is an album that binds two different stages of the Beatles musical development together and as with any album they did after 1964 it really doesn't replicate in any significant way the sound and style of the previous album.Progression was the key and the Beatles were on their own front line on that end.xed in as well.

B000JLTRIQ|5.0|Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center\\" grabs your attention from start to finish. The movie depicted the most horrendous day in this country's history. The heroes in this movie are the officers who courageously survived the rubble and how their families coped through it all. I will admit this movie is emotional and quite powerful. We will never forget 9/11. I know I won't forget it.
B001PA0FFO|3.0|Doubt is an extremely thoughtful, atmospheric and well made movie that really should have made more of an impression than it did.  While I enjoyed watching it, I couldn't help but feel that it was missing something. That \\"something\\" probably had a little to do with the adaptation, but quite a bit more to do with a flaw in the general conceptualization of the film.<br /><br />The themes of this film are wide-ranging: conflicts in the Church between old style Catholics and progressive Vatican II Catholics, faith versus doubt, de-segregation and the struggle of African Americans to have a future, innocence versus corruption, the persecution of those who are perceived as \\"different,\\" and mortal sin (pedophilia). While all of these rather weighty issues were essential to the the film, none were completely played out. Instead they simply competed with one another, each one jostling for attention.<br /><br />The characters were also under-developed. Father Flynn's progressive \\"threat\\" was never adequately demonstrated. (A single conflict over \\"Frosty the Snowman\\" did not suffice.) His sermons, which should have been the bully pulpit from which he rained progressive fire, were lackluster, mumbled affairs. Flynn's nemesis, Sister Aloysius, remained a two-dimensional character throughout the film, hardly showing a crack in her armor. The guileless Sister James had about as much substance as a jellyfish, and the person who should have occupied center stage, the young boy who Father Flynn had allegedly developed \\"feelings\\" for, was largely ignored. In short, none of the characters were adequately developed or entirely convincing (with one exception).<br /><br />To be fair, there were some fine dramatic moments. Viola Davis, who plays the boy's mother, gave a searing, if short, performance. (And one that put everyone else to shame.) The final confrontation between the tortured Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman's one opportunity to actually do some acting) and Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) was brilliant. But there were too many other moments that effectively drained the intensity from a movie that should have left the audience biting their nails. The final scene was not just thoroughly out of character for Sister Aloysius, it was a cop-out. Not only did the ending fail to resolve the main plot, it didn't resolve any of the multiple issues that were brought up in the context of the movie. It was a weak, left-field ending for a film that promised much but delivered little.liant.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|What a joy it is to watch this quintessential American classic, restored to all its cinematic glory in blu-ray!  The old DVD versions of The Godfather trilogy are rendered unwatchable compared to the blu-ray versions.  Always a dark movie series, both literally and figuratively, one can now see the details in the dimly lit scenes, such as within the office of Don Corleone during the wedding sequence of Godfather I.  I was unable to find scratch marks, dirt, etc. in these discs.  And the colors in the brightly illuminated outdoor shots of the wedding absolutely jump off the screen!  As always, Godfather I&II are the most compelling of the trio (I actually prefer, only slightly, Robert Deniro in II- only because of the delicious character developement of the Don; both Pacino and Deniro act magnificently as does Brando of course).  But even Godfather III, the weakest of the combo is a compelling movie to watch.  A must have for any serious afficianado of American film.

0061438294|5.0|This has to be the BEST book on body language available. The author gives you the groundwork for understanding the WHYs and HOWs behind gestures and behavior, which teaches the reader how to decipher body language for himself. He stresses the importance of individuality and the complexity of body language, rather than just giving black and white examples and assigning meaning. This book took the confusion out of reading body language for me. I really, really enjoyed it. I refer back to it often.    I highly recommend this book as a companion to Gavin De Becker's \\"The Gift of Fear\\", and anyone (especially women) who are interested in learning how to protect themselves from potentially dangerous people. I also highly recommend it for child abuse victims in recovery. This is the stuff we really didn't learn growing up, but need to know to protect ourselves in the future.    Over all GREAT book.

B001CDLATE|5.0|I bought this on the recommendation of the salesperson when I bought my Sony Blu-Ray DVD player. Photography is amazing but the film is not for everyone. It is simply to be experienced, rather than appreciated for its plot. But if you are thinking of buying it, you probably already know that. Still, it is captivating, and a cool experience.

Now the older ones are reading it to the younger ones!  The rhymes and pictures are just so cute and babies can begin to learn words and will start to point to the pictures as they learn the rhyme and know what is coming next.  A must have in any children's book collection, and buy an extra one to keep at the grandparents home for those spend the night parties!!
0316286850|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. As a cosmetologist Im always looking to see dramatic changes in make up as well as something subtle to be warn everyday or for a wedding. This book has it all (more of the everyday type stuff and not very many dramatic looks though). It gives you a ton of illistrations on how to apply as well as the finished photo and great step by step instructions on achieving the looks shown. Its great even if youre not a professional. I would HIGHLY recommend this book for beginners as well as professionals who've been in the industry for a long time!
B0008ENICU|5.0|A must-have for anyone who loves well-made movies. The dialogue is fast and funny, the acting is superb, and the story is as relevant and believable today as it was when the movie was made in 1939.     One notable part of the film is the tension between Mary (played by Norma Shearer) and Crystal (played by Joan Crawford) over Crystal's affair with Mary's husband. Off-screen Shearer and Crawford disliked each other so intensely that the movie's producer's had some difficulty keeping the film on track. I believe that conflict contributes to their believable onscreen performance.    Another fascinating aspect of the movie is the fact that while most of the conversations in the movie concern men, not a single man actually appears in the film. It's hard to imagine modern film makers, with their over-reliance on special effects, using such a clever twist.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Just listened to this on a very good system of separates and also on some new Senn HD800 expensive headphones.   The restoration job is excellent.  It is true that peak limiting has been used in some places to raise volume level but on the 4 albums I just listened to it is only moderately applied and never reaches the level of todays sonic recording abominations like Metallicas last CD or Bruce Springsteens horrible sounding Magic CD.    The remaster was done using the original analog tapes and a Pro Tools 24 bit/192 system and a very expensive A/D converter.    These tools were not around back in 1987 when the original box set was released and the sonic improvement is dramatic.   On some tracks I could have sweared I was listening to a high quality vinyl pressing.   The earlier CDs don't come across well in the stereo versions however because of the tendency to put the voices in one channel etc as others have said.  I am so glad the team spent 4 long years and for the most part got this right.  It is nice to see there are still people in the world that care about music and reproducing it as best as possible.  It's too bad that SACD has fallen out of favor and popularity because these could have been made to sound even better with an SACD layer on the discs.  But even for Redbook CD pressings these are almost as good as popular music gets today.

Soon Fuller is found dead. Naturally, his college is suspected. Douglas must find the message before he is incarcerated.<br /><br />So far, this seems standard formula. That is where the formula ends. Douglas must go into a computer simulation to retrieve the message, not so easily done.

How will she figure in the mystery?<br /><br />For people that grew up in L.A. you may recognize some of the locations such as the RMS Queen Mary.

0061544493|4.0|I know of Victoria Adams, fondly known as POSH, because I am a Spice Girls fan. She was my favorite because I found her to be so cool and stylish. When she had married David Beckham, she definitely became a household name worldwide to soccer fans. The paparazzi adored them and followed them everywhere! Late last year, the media chronicled their assimilation to the USA. I watched `Victoria Beckham Coming to America', which is a reality show of her family's move to the Los Angeles. She is hilarious and so self-deprecating that it was so easy to be enamored by her witty and engaging personality!<br />[[ASIN:0061544493 That Extra Half an Inch: Hair, Heels and Everything in Between]]<br />Her book, \\"That Extra Half An Inch\\" deserves the same praise. Victoria writes all the tips, tricks, and advice she knows and has received through the years in the area of fashion, accessories, make-up, parties, special events (i.e. Weddings), maternity attire, and pretty much every `beautification' process a girl goes through. Victoria first addresses her audience. IF they are not into these kinds of things, then the book is not for them. And rightly so, the book is made to be read by an audience who does not take fashion all too seriously.<br />Even without a fashion design background, Victoria knows fashion and the technical terms used.

I pretty much agree with all the advice that she has given on how to wear this type of clothing.<br />A few warning notices, though. Victoria wrote this book back in London (where it became a bestseller!), so a lot of the tips and sources are from that area. When Victoria talks about `High Street', I assumed it's a place in London where a lot of interesting fashion shops abound. I keep imagining that it looks sort of like San Francisco's Haight Street, where it has a combination of fast forward trendy boutiques, vintage shops, and loads of bargain markets. Some of the stores Victoria mentions, fortunately, can be found in the US, like H&M and Zara. She talks about loving the steals and deals in Topshop as well, so I am very anxious when this popular shopping haven will finally have a branch here!oads of bargain markets.

B0012GMW7A|4.0|I listened to Leonard Cohen in the old years and liked the poetry of his songs. Then i didn't listen to him for awhile. Recently, he came out with a reprise concert Live in London, which i loved. Call me sentimental, but Leonard singing Leonard at age 73 really touched me, as did the warm response of the audience. I decided to fill out my library of Leonard Cohen music. I just wasn't as thrilled with this album. Maybe it was the lack of a live audience or the specific lyrics here, but the LOVE just didn't come through for me. I'll try other Leonard Cohen CDs, though.

Beautiful!\\" And while I do not make a habit of purchasing books base on an author's recommendation, I made this one exception. And I am quite happy that I did. The Mortal Instruments is a story of love, action, adventure, drama, magic, and all elements that kept me turning the pages. Down to the final chapter it was almost unbearable to continue reading because I knew I would leave the world of Idris, the Shadowhunters, and the characters that I have grown to love.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1416972242 City of Ashes (Mortal Instruments)]]I distinctly remember reading the City of Ashes with intensity and concentration as if I was in a marathon. I was racing through pages during the action sequences and slowing down to catch my breath as Jace and Clary battle within themselves to refute a persistent love that emotionally tears their being. And while Simon is now the `boyfriend', the feeling of an unrequited love also brings him sadness.<br /><br />It is also refreshing to see how the Downworlders' take a more active role in the story as Vampires, Warlocks, and Faeries help battle evil, thereby proving that even if they have the Demon's blood, the humanity in them reigns. Thus, good wins in the end.

Down to the final chapter it was almost unbearable to continue reading because I knew I would leave the world of Idris, the Shadowhunters, and the characters that I have grown to love.<br /><br />Before you read my review, I advice a Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />The City of Bones, the first book, begins with  various explanations of what a Shadowhunter, Downworlders (Vampires, Werewolves, Warlocks, and Faeries), Demons, and Mundanes are. It explains the background of the protagonist, Clary Fray, as well as the other lead characters of the story. Pretty much half of the book is spent on setting the series' foundation. By the time this is established, the action scenes get as intense as the love triangle that occurs between the Clary, her best friend Simon, and Shadow Hunter Jace.<br /><br />It's quite interesting to note that the author shifts the narration between the characters. In the early chapters you will hear from Clary's perspective. Then she will switch to Jace's, and then Simon's. Though this may appear inconsistent, I did not see this as a problem in her writing style. I do appreciate that once in awhile I can see the story from another character's impression.<br /><br />Towards the end the author delivers the inevitable shocker that gave clues throughout the book - Clary and Jace are long-lost siblings. The reader will either be torn or hope that Simon has a chance at a love he's invested in for almost a decade. And things begin to be a lot more interesting that one cannot wait to read Book Two, City of Ashes.[[ASIN:1416955070 City of Bones (Mortal Instruments)]]SIN:1416955070 City of Bones (Mortal Instruments)]]

Add insult to injury, her uncle -- a billionaire who owns a worldwide caf&eacute; chain and who claims had started out with two coins and a dream -- refuses to help her out, claiming she could do it on her own.  And now she has to visit her great-aunt Sadie's funeral.  She hardly knew the woman, for crying out loud.  So imagine her surprise when Sadie's ghost begins to follow Lara around, wanting to know the whereabouts of a missing necklace.  Lara is shocked.  For one thing, she's seeing a ghost.  Another thing is that Sadie doesn't look like a century-old hag.  She looks like a beauty in her early twenties, and her clothes and makeup scream 1920s style.  Now Lara has to put her life on pause while she searches for Sadie's necklace.  To make things worse, Sadie also wants to live life precariously through Lara.  This wouldn't be so bad if Sadie wouldn't insist on making Lara dress up like a 1920s tramp.  But maybe having Sadie around isn't so bad, especially if she can fix up Lara's life for good...<br /><br />Word to the wise: do not drink while you read this.  You'll end up splashing everything and everyone around you.  This is one of the funniest novels I have recently read.  Sophie Kinsella has always been a comic wonder, just look at the successful Shopaholic series.  Twenties Girl combines chick-lit comedy with paranormal elements and a little bit of mystery with awesome results.

Lara and Sadie got on my nerves at times.  Sometimes I couldn't decide which one of the two was more annoying.  Lara's stalker ways made me cringe on more than one occasion.

044024238X|1.0|I like the title `The Undomestic Goddess'. It's pretty witty and charming. I also thought some of the antics and expressions of the heroine, Samantha Sweeting, is rather funny.<br /><br />But moving on to the story, the essence of the novel, the....okay, okay, I do believe I'm stalling. Fine. I'll go ahead and say it. I didn't like the book. It was horrible. I barely choked finishing it.<br /><br />Oh no! What is happening to one of my favorite Chick Lit authors? Should Ms. Kinsella really just stick to Shopaholic and her Becky Bloomwood? From my assessment of this novel, I should think so!<br />The problem with this novel is that the story was not well developed. We start of with a good character who is a young and successful workaholic lawyer. She makes the gravest mistake of her career and is fired from her job (this part of the novel was going good so far. The reader does wonder, \\"Okay, so what will happen to her now?\\"). But then she flees into the country and becomes a domestic. WHAT????!!! Yes, that's right. She becomes a maid to a very rich English couple who can't really tell that their new maid cannot really cook, clean, or do any house chores. Okay....so why should the reader continue reading this book? It's obviously going to be a waste of time.<br />Sadly, I testify that it does.<br /><br />The predictable ending: Samantha Sweeting finally learns how to enjoy and live life to the fullest.[[ASIN:044024238X The Undomestic Goddess]]

B0018SWA56|5.0|Wow! This follow-up novel to `Something Borrowed' really sealed the deal for author  Emily Giffin. She's not a `one novel wonder' at all! She can write...and write really good! In fact, I like this sequel to Something Borrowed even better!<br /><br />The story of Something Blue (by the way, the title is really clever! Just when you thought it was a use of the bridal expression 'something borrowed, something blue...', what it stands for is an introduction of Darcy's story as a soon-to-be single parent!) is narrated by Darcy, and therefore you get to see her perspective on what happened with the Rachel-Dex-Darcy-Marcus saga. Just when I had cast Darcy Rhone as the completely narcisstic and manipulating friend to have (a judgement I based on the first book), I find out that she, in fact, is a victim of her environment and her upbringing. She is born beautiful and she is treated 'special' all throughout her life. She has thus morphed into a completely jaded person, whose sole basis for happiness are all things material. Her statement summarizes this, \\"...I understoond that at a tender age of three that with beauty comes with perks and power.\\"<br /><br />But even if Darcy does relish the advantages that comes with her looks, she also can't help but feel insecure next to her bestfriend Rachel, the brainy girl with the average looks. This is dangerous because both friends would then nurture a  hidden competition with each other, which would eventually would culminate in the deterioration, and then eventual loss of the friendship.<br />The readers are then challenged...how can you forgive betrayal? Darcy couldn't have put it any better when she said, \\"It suddenly occurred to me that no matter when his affair with Rachel had begun, she hadn't been the cause of our breakup. Dex and I had split because we weren't right for each other, and because of that fact, he had been able to fall in love with her. Had we been on solid ground, Dex wouldn't have cheated on me. The realization was somehow freeing, and it enabled me to let go of another sliver of resentment toward both of them.\\"<br /><br />That ephiphany on Darcy's part says a lot. Darcy, by the end of the novel, becomes a heroine. She realized her mistakes, she owned up to them, and she courageously changed for the better. In other words, she took the readers in an engaging ride to maturity and ended up to be someone a person can truly admire.<br />[[ASIN:B0018SWA56 Something Blue]]ng, and it enabled me to let go of another sliver of resentment toward both of them.\\"    That ephiphany on Darcy's part says a lot.

I knew its 500+ pages would end the series I had grown to love. It is fascinating how Cassandra Clare would create subtle hints from the first book and then tie loose ends by explaining what they mean this final book. For example, in the City of Bones, Clary draws a mysterious dark-haired Prince riding a horse, and she is baffled why she does so when she has never met this person before. And clearly this Prince is neither Jace nor Simon. Then in the City of Glass, Clary immediately recognizes Sebastian as the subject of her previous artwork, thereby bringing the reader to recollect this particular detail from the first book.<br /><br />Clearly the City of Glass is the culmination of all the best qualities of the first two books as the author bring more action, adventure, sadness, and even terror. The protagonists are hurt immensely, and not just physically but emotionally as well. And in the end, you'll hold your breath to see what finally happens to Clary, Jace, Simon, and Sebastian, and hopefully smile that it went the way that you wanted it to be. It did for me, but it was a happy ever after that was not easy to acquire nor will it be forgotten with the pain, suffering, and loss that all the characters faced.[[ASIN:1416914307 City of Glass (Mortal Instruments)]]]

0440244870|5.0|I love it!<br /><br />I heard of this book years ago, but I was never that curious enough to read it, until now. I always wondered how the author would narrate a story that has all the qualities I like in a `chic lit' - witty, humorous, and very modern, and yet it will try to distinguish itself from the successful writing of another English author of the Bridget Jones' Diary series. Well, Sophie Kinsella delivered all that in a very funny narration of Becky Bloomwood's (aka Ms. Shopaholic) life as an un-interested financial journalist who takes the `art of shopping' to a whole new and dangerous level!<br /><br />Truth be told, I'm also a shopaholic (but not to the full extent of Becky's problem), and I can relate to to Becky not being able to resist the temptations of sales and to succumb with absolutely ridiculous reasons, such as \\"Buying more stuff equals Credit Card Points equals Free Gift!, make sense, right?\\" I must have shared the same Buying Conscience as Ms. Bloomwood, but thankfully, I haven't gone too far as to get into such a huge debt! So you see, there is a valuable lesson to be learned from this story!<br /><br />What I also enjoyed from the book, and that I find quite original, are the letters from the bank appearing in front of every other chapter. It's a creative way of keeping the reader in the `know' on the severity of Becky's financial standing with her creditors. Becky's response to this `harrassment', or, to use her own words, `stalking' of her creditors balloons to more trouble and more hilarious antics! But as the story progresses, we share in the triumph of Becky finding her strength and facing her problem with not only a dream job, but the dream guy! Lovely! Lovely! Lovely! I am now a fan of Ms. Kinsdale's writing. I guarantee to continue reading the Shopaholic series as I find Becky Bloomwood's character absolutely entertaining!<br />Favorite book phrase: \\"I think they should list shopping as a cardiovascular activity. My heart never beats as fast as it does when I see a `reduced by 50%' sign.\\"ee a `reduced by 50%' sign.\\"

0440241901|1.0|There were two things that attracted me to reading this novel. First, I had become a fan of Sophie Kinsella due her Shopaholic novels (although I wasn't particularly keen on the Shopaholic ties the Knot). And second, I was very curious to see how the author would deliver another novel without a Becky Bloomwood heroine. Would this new protagonist `Emma Corrigan' become just as endearing as Becky?<br /><br />Unfortunately, no, she does not. Emma turns ut to be very annoying and absolutely pathetic compared to Becky. She has no charisma, no wit, and I certainly was not laughing at her antics. Rather, I felt dismay at the character's lack of common sense and self-confidence! I did not care for her at all! How could I? Here's a girl who continually allows herself to be bullied by everyone - her boss, her older cousin, her cousin-in-law, and her parents! And by the end of the story, instead of finally standing up for herself, her boss `Jack' (the CEO who knows all her secrets) is the one who ends up defending her and making everyone feel sorry for what they have done to Emma! Uh, obviously he will command attention since he is portrayed to be a very wealthy and powerful man. His act of a `knight and shining armor' is not at all charming.<br /><br />Obviously, I do not like Jack's character[[ASIN:0440241901 Can You Keep a Secret?]]. I cannot possibly think of a girl that can be swooned by him. He is weak and uninteresting compared to Luke Brandon (the lead male in Shopaholics). It is very difficult to like, much less respect Jack when he ends up blabbing all of Emma's secrets on national television. WHAT???!!! A CEO that does that? A self-made multi-millionaire gossips away in a serious business program?!!!?? Just when I was hoping the author would give me a shocker or twist to make this story interesting, like answers to how Jack could possible excuse himself out of this one and win Emma back, Ms. Kinsella disappoints me with Jack telling Emma that the reason he blabbed all her secrets on the Telly was because she was always on his mind. WHAT?!!! Is that even a reason? What kind of hogwash is that? The most horrible thing is that Emma bought it! Stock and Barrel, she bought it and took him back!  OH MY GOSH! I wanted to stop reading right there! I really did, but there was a chapter left, so I had a flicker of hope that perhaps the final pages would turn this book around!<br />I was wrong. It was boring, predictable, and a total waste of time til the end. So far I'll limit my admiration of Ms. Kinsella's works to her Shopaholic novels and do her a huge favor by keeping this novel a secret from everyone!

1416562605|5.0|In the beginning of the book, the reader might feel as if he would like to put his book down.  The author uses the device of a letter to the visiting Chinese head of state.  I felt the device was unneccesary, since the story content would survive any structure the author wished.    The book is a fast and easy read and in it's content, the reader is educated on the way Indian society works and the interesting details of the outsourcing industry.

0307269981|4.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire was a wonderful extension and exploration of the characters from Stieg Larsson's first book.  It was different enough from the Dragon Tattoo to be believable, and yet held the integrity of characters close.  A true suspense and mystery.  I never had the feeling of knowing exactly what was going to happen next, which is all to common in many books.  I cannot wait for the third in the trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  The author's passing is a true tragedy, as I would love to read more books with as much depth, character, and believablity.<br /><br />I stumbled upon Stieg Larsson in my grocery store, which saddens me.  Most books that fall into the hands of your local grocery store or pharmacy chain contain a certain goofiness that require a very large suspension of disbelief.  I call this category of thriller/ mystery/ crime dramas Airport Fiction, because one tends to find these books to pass the time while traveling.  When I picked up Stieg's first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I expected it would be Airport Fiction, and just read it as a substitute for TV thrillers and dramas.  I was delightfully surprised to find this is more than just Airport Fiction.<br /><br />I rather enjoyed the translation of Stieg's first book, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, more than the seemingly  Americanized version of The Girl Who Played With Fire.  I'm wondering if I can get my hands on a different translation...

1439102813|4.0|If the mark of a good novel is that it takes you inside the head of another person, then this is one of the best I've read in a long time.  It's the story of Alice, a 50 year old Harvard professor who develops early onset Alzheimer's.  Over the next two years she goes from being a highly intelligent and respected professor to someone who doesn't recognize her own family, struggles to participate in conversations and is incapable of looking after herself.  The book is not narrated by Alice but is told from her point of view, so you really feel like you understand what she's going through and what her experience is like.  To be honest, when I started reading it I wasn't sure if it would be my cup of tea, but I found it utterly compelling and read it in less than a day.<br /><br />The subject matter means it's not always easy to read, but Genova has an understated writing style that avoids sentimentality and doesn't labor points.  There's one beautifully written section early on when Alice has to give a lecture at Harvard.  She has carefully written down where she has to go, what time she has to be there and what the subject of the lecture will be.  However she hasn't written down that she will be giving the lecture, so she takes her place in the lecture hall and patiently waits for the lecturer to arrive.  Although it's clear to the reader what's happening, Alice doesn't ever realize the mistake that she's made.<br /><br />The book is obviously very thoroughly researched, but in a way this became what I liked the least about it.  At times it felt like the research was dictating the storyline and that Genova was going out of her way to incorporate every example that she could.  For example, Alice has three children: so it will eventuate that one is tested and finds that they carry the Alzheimer's gene, one is tested and finds that they don't carry the gene and the third elects not to find out.  There were also references at least twice to the URL for a dementia advocacy and support network website.  Yes, this is valuable information, but it interrupted the flow of the novel (at least for me).<br /><br />I was so engrossed in the book that I felt like I had Alzheimer's as well when I was reading it.  It's a hideous disease and it's a heartbreaking story - but a very good novel.twork website.  Yes, this is valuable information, but it interrupted the flow of the novel (at least for me).

1400082773|3.0|This is not a conventional autobiography. Although it covers Barack Obama's early life, up until his marriage to Michelle, it skips large periods of his history and really focuses only how he came to terms with his dual African/American heritage and his identity as a black man.  It is broken into three parts.  \\"Origins\\" is about his early life growing up in Hawaii, Indonesia and later living in New York.  \\"Chicago\\" is about his time working as a community organizer in Chicago, before he went to Harvard.  \\"Kenya\\" covers his first visit to his father's homeland.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the first section of the book, which to me seemed the most personal.  I was moved by the way that he describes his gradual realization that he was different in appearance and that there was something shameful in being black.  I can honestly say that this section got me thinking about race in a way that I hadn't before.  I was also fascinated by his mother's choices and I wish that he had written more about her.  The rest of the book was a comparative let down for me.  While I found the Chicago section interesting, I felt it went on too long and for me that was the weakest section of the book.<br /><br />Obama has a lovely turn of phrase; his writing is very enjoyable to read.  He recounts conversations and small incidences that make the book at times read almost like a novel.  However his writing inexperience showed in the way that the book makes sudden jumps, which I found jarring.<br /><br />It is a strange experience to read this book now that Obama is President, given that he wrote it before he had even entered politics.  (He barely discusses politics at all in this book).  I kept thinking how proud his father would have been of him, and I would have loved an epilogue that talked about how his remaining family reacted to his eventual career successes.

0385340575|5.0|This book grabs you by the lapels and holds on. Lee Child is a master storyteller. Jack Reacher is minding his own business when his training takes over and propels him into a terrible event. This is one wild ride.
0452295548|5.0|This was by far the best book I have read in a long time.  It actually changed my outlook on life.  It was inspirational and a real eye-opener.  A must read for everyone, not just stroke victims or people with head traumas.  The book has great life lessons and practical approaches on how to become not only more at peace with oneself but more grateful and kind.  I had been searching for a long time to stop the continual brain chatter. It was exhausting and caused me many migraines. Since having read the book and actually applying the teachings in the book, I have been able to reduce the migraines greatly, feel more peaceful, get a good night's sleep and have someone tell me that I look radiant and full of life.  What is better than that!  I also wake up feeling grateful.  It's something one has to work at but it is achievable.
0307269981|4.0|I have not finished this book but am really enjoying it as well as the \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" It is so rewarding to be really into a great book and also I love that it is as long as it is. Some of the authors that I really enjoy are writing very short books and charging a lot of money for them. I am not happy with this. Larsson is not in that category with his two books \\"the Girl Who Played with Fire\\" and \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" I do highly recommend both of them but they need to be read in order with the \\"Tattoo\\" being read first.
B0000009RX|5.0|I think this is a great version of the album.  I digitally cleaned up my original 1967 vinyl and I think this is pretty true to the original.  A freind of mine and I used to drive around and sing the album from start to finish (there wasn't any way to listen to the album in the car '67).  And as far as the comment about Zapa \\"in the studio\\", I heard the Mothers do some of this at the Shrine Exposition Hall in LA in 1968 and they could do it just as well live!
B002BSHXJA|4.0|Having grown up with the 1987 CD mixes, I was surprised by the mono mix.  It definitely lacks the enveloping power of the stereo mixes.  Some songs just sound better with instruments coming at you from both ears.  Listening to the White Album in remastered stereo is a religious experience.  The benefit of hearing the mono and stereo versions is that they were created during two separate mixdowns, which means in addition to the panning, the levels of vox, guitars, effects are different between mixes.  Each mix of a song will showcase different details as a result.      If I were listening to the Beatles through my ipod (I know, not what they originally intended), I would get the Stereo Box set (and miss how wonderful the Beatles in Mono artwork is).      If I were cranking the Beatles through my car studio, I might lean towards mono, especially for their earlier work.      My reaction to hearing the stereo release was pure bliss.  It sounded like what I was used to, only more powerful.  It was amazing.  My reaction to mono generated more curiosity.  Mono doesn't envelop you, but there are countless moments on mono songs where I would rewind thinking \\"geez, I've never heard that part before. . . I've never heard it that way before. . . . They panned it different there. . . They completely flubbed that break on the stereo mix. . . \\"  Some moments in mono do rock your socks off.  With everything in the center, coming out of a car stereo, it jams.  Sgt Pepper's, having spun this record this most, reveals some astounding differences.      I get the collectors thing, but I feel a bit taken.  The Beatles owe everyone both experiences.  They are simply different--you will gain something from hearing both versions.  I figured I would buy the mono \\"collectors edition\\" CDs now, enjoy the experience of MONO, and then ask for the Stereo box for Christmas.  That covers me.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|I've only listened to this a little bit but it's great.  Too bad they didn't do more of these.
1592402690|5.0|Although redundant at times, this book provides fascinating insight to the actual processes that The Beatles went through to achieve their incredible body of work. If you want inside stories about the individual members of the band, this book may not be for you. What Emerick does provide, in my opinion, are honest recollections of HIS experience with The Beatles, as a group, and individually. He, rightfully so, never tries to offer speculation, just factual accounts. The technical aspects of this book act as a primer for anyone wanting to know about the relative recent history of the recording process, Emerick's and the The Beatles' achievements and innovations, and what it took to achieve. I found this book to be a great read.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|If it weren't for the message board I was visiting, Mayer Hawthorne's debut album, \\"A Strange Arrangement\\" would of went unnoticed by me(at least for awhile). Maybe if I had saw it in a year end recap of best albums of 2009, it would pique my curiosity. Luckily for me I didn't have to wait 'til such a time and discovered the album on my own(somewhat).<br /><br />Prior to the release of the album, I heard samples of the album and was very interested and impressed with the album. Finally once I got my hands on the actual album, I couldn't stop playing it and virtually have not but I have given it a slight rest so I won't wear it out as fast.<br /><br />The album is very good and in a very surprising way. I love the \\"Prelude\\" and the harmonies and how it goes right into the lush title track which is ever so dreamy and nostalgic. I actually like every song but some more than others such as \\"Shiny and New\\", \\"I Wish It Would Rain\\" and \\"Just Ain't Gonna Work Out\\". I strongly recommend this album and it would be a shame if this album gets ignored(which I'm sure it might but hopefully not).<br /><br />I will even go as far as to say that this is like the male version of Amy Winehouses' \\"Back To Black\\" but not quite as dark.

B0008FXST2|5.0|How many times did you watch a movie that reunites two giants of the screen?<br />Putting together Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in one movie was an inspired idea, and must have taken a lot of work in itself.<br />The results can be vividly seen in this Cops & Bandits genre movie.<br />Actually, this film goes far beyond the simple genre movie and can be compared to some of the best Film Noir movies with Humphrey Bogart.<br /><br />Except for the length, at over two hours, this movie moves fast, even in its dialogue scenes.<br />There is never a dull moment. Very competently directed and structured, the story flows like a river, smooth and fast.<br />There is tenseness, and many subplots that involve the entire cast, giving to each a full life and a motivation to do what they are meant to do.<br />There is no arbitrary judgment on who's bad and who's good.<br />All characters have good and evil sides, just like in real life people.<br /><br />The Special Edition also contains exclusive interviews with Pacino and De Niro, as well as a Making Of of this movie.<br /><br />The transfer is impeccable, with exceptionally good sound and music balance. Night scenes are clear and even the darkest scene offers stupendous<br />details.<br /><br />If you are looking for another Pacino, or De Niro classic, you better get this one.<br /><br />It is assuredly a good investment for your DVD collection.<br /><br />To me, it is a must have.
1416550534|1.0|Actually, I really liked this book, up to a certain point.  The prose was lyrical, the characters well developed, and the plot turns logically set up.  Even though the question of Grace's paternity was foreshadowed a little hamhandedly.  Most of all, the language was clean.  Until 80% into the book and there was \\"that word.\\" It was obviously crowbarred in by some editor or marketing agent who thinks a book won't sell unless it appeals to the lowest common denominator.  So much so that I knew I wouldn't encounter it again and I finished reading the book.  I then immediately canceled my order for The Forgotten Garden.  Once an author disrespects me like that I will not give her/him a second chance.

B0029NY9YO|2.0|I was not familiar with Watchmen prior to seeing the movie trailers so consider my review that of the casual fan.  I had seen the trailers for the movie back when it was in the theater, but it didn't crack the list of those that I shell out $8+ to go see.  However, it did make it into the category of movies watched at home on a rainy evening.<br /><br />What I wound up seeing was not exactly what I expected.  The Watchmen are \\"retired\\" if you will by presidential edict after generations of superheroes have played a part in shaping the history of the Twentieth Century.  The story picks up in 1985 when The Comedian is murdered by a mysterious intruder to his apartment.  What ensues is a fairly convoluted and slowly developing story of why he was killed and who did it.  Along the way we learn about Dr. Manhattan, a physicist who is no longer human after a laboratory accident.  He is working with Adrian Veidt; the only Watchmen to come forward with his secret identity who is know a multi-billionaire attempting to tap into infinite energy in the hopes of ending the need for all war - particularly the US/USSR Cold War.  Laurie Jupiter, aka Silk Spectre II, is in love with Dr. Manhattan, but he no longer seems capable of human emotion or connection.  Then there is Dab Dreiberg, aka Night Owl II, who is independently well off thanks to his inheritance.  All he seems to have going to regular visits with the original Night Owl where they discuss their past conquests over beer.<br /><br />However, the main - and easily the most interesting character - is Rorschach whose mask changes into various Rorschach images in a seemingly spontaneous fashion.  He is a sociopath who is down on the human race for the way that everyone was seemed to give in to vices and gluttony.  Watchmen is at its core the story of his investigation of The Comedian's murder with the rest as a backdrop.  His gruff attitude is somewhat reminiscent of Wolverine (of X-Men fame, of course), and he has the same lone wolf playing by his own rules approach as well.<br /><br />What I found odd about The Watchmen is that other than Dr. Manhattan, they mostly seem to have physical combat as their \\"superpower\\".  The fight scenes are of about the caliber of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The Watchmen also seem to lack any leader in contrast to other superhero groups such as The Fantastic Four, The X-Men, and Justice League.  It's just not what the typical comic book/superhero fan is going to be looking for.<br /><br />It is also earns its R rating with plenty of language and a few sex scenes so do not give into any pleading from your kids to see Watchmen.<br /><br />At just under three hours, it also falls into that category of movies that you think is never going to end.  There are very few movies that have enough steam to give the viewer engaged for that long, and this is not one of them.<br /><br />Overall Recommendation:  Rentg by his own rules approach as well.

B000WYCF6Q|4.0|I use two of these on my Bacchetta recumbent. They are quite small and fit on the bars without being obtrusive. I find that even though these are small they provide quite a bit if visibility, making it easy to keep tabs on what's going on behind you. I find them easy to adjust when I get going or to fine tune while I'm underway. All in all, these are great little mirrors.

0375413405|5.0|Who needs to go to Cordon Bleu when you have this book.  Most recipes only offer recipes and great pictures.  This book is like going for the $28,000 price tag of a cooking school with only the cost of this book and it is definitely worth it.  The techniques which are well explained are what is important in a recipe and understanding the chemistry and the whys and nots behind it.  My only regret is that I did not get this sooner.  A must have for a beginner and master cooks.  This is truly one of the greats of recipe books.  Julia, you made me a firm believer that one one who really follows your recipes can be a very good cook. There is hope for the rest of us.

144861919X|5.0|A book that defies time!  Yes, just a Dorian's body defied time, this book is equally as powerful a metaphor today as it was when it was first written.  And with our plastic narcissistic society, perhaps its more powerful today then ever!  Sadly, perhaps it will be even more so in 100 more years hense.<br /><br />These are powerful reasons to read and enjoy Wilds only full length novel.  Besides the wit and satire that can be enjoyed for the sake of humor, the book screams out to each of us, to live for pleasure or wisdom.<br /><br />This is one of the choices Wilde plays with in many of his works, and this is one of the best to understand and think about.<br /><br />I can't imagine someone who has not read this book, but if you have not, and you are hear today, then its time to do so.  You wont regret it!

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Based on what I have hear so far, I am quite happy with  the box set. The 80s vintage CDs sounded so bad as to be almost unlistenable.<br /><br />I have the stereo set, and will pick up the mono when it is available & cherry pick my own favorites.<br /><br />The sound quality is pretty damn good. We have to keep in mind that all of this music was recorded with the technology that was available at the time, and that The Beatles were always pushing the outside of the envelope, not playing it safe. They were busy inventing the future that allows an Alison Kruass album to sound so amazing today. Some tracks are just huge. Others sound off, and I am pretty certain those are the ones that will shine in mono. The White Album sounds very, very good.<br /><br />I am fortunate to have a fine sound system. NOS tubes make for a better listening experience. I forsee many late nights with the headphones. I suspect that some of the people who are expressing  disappointment do not have equipment that allows them to hear just how much of an improvement this is.<br /><br />It is interesting to note the emotional impact of songs I listened to a million times before I was 10. \\"Here, There & Everywhere\\" has a little different meaning when you heart has a lifetime's worth of mileage on it. Another thing that is striking to me is the sheer visceral thrill of hearing these amazing songs, one after another, after another. The Beatles have aged very well indeed.<br /><br />After a few weeks with this set I continue to be thrilled. I am going to get the mono set, the earlier records do suffer from the stereo treatment, they are best heard in mono. I do not get the people who have trashed this set, all of my audiophile and musician friends are raving about it just as much as I am. The only fault is that the mono versions should have been included, it should not set you back and extra $250.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|This is the 4th of the remastered cd's just released, I have purchased. Just like the others, the sound quality is amazing, it makes you forget this was recorded over 40 years ago. The clarity, detail, nuances in both the instruments and voices is nothing short of spectacular. I enjoy listening at night, quiet room with my headphones on and it's like I'm hearing these songs for the first time and they were just recorded in a state of the art studio. Warning: buying these cd's is habit forming, you'll want to keep buying more, so take my advise and buy the whole freaking set, it'll save you $.
B001IKKMCW|5.0|This has got be Jim Carrey's best classic film. I bought the very first DVD copy when initially released and it sucked! The DVD production that is! LOL!    It was two sided with so called wide screen that has the gray bars on top AND bottom, with the other side full screen. It was the studio's reluctance to put out quality video in the hands of the consumers I suppose that caused it to be such a big disappointment to me, but I did not buy any of the better subsequent releases as I was mad for being ripped off the first time.    Consumers have a way of getting even and getting the last laugh it seems, as there must have been at least one better subsequent release left unsold on the shelf! HA!     I could not however resist the blue-Ray release as I knew it would be great and I was not disappointed, especially in my new Panasonic DMP BD 80 blue-Ray player I bought from Amazon!    I highly recommended if you feel up for some awesome shock and awe fun laughs.

B0025KVLSI|4.0|I just purchased this at a local store, as I am too impatient to wait for the other 6 I ordered through Amazon.  Those people that say that they can hear no difference do not know what they are talking about.  All of the accoustic guitars are now bright and jangly as they should be.  The bass is more prominent and the drums are crisper, all without overpowering the vocals.    There is more seperation between the voices so you can tell who is singing which part.  It is not all muddled together, each individual instrument stands out on its own.  Anybody who expects a modern digital recording from a 1964 analog source is just being unrreasonable.  Remember, these were recorded on two- and four-track recorders, so with any bounce down to add instruments, you will have some loss of sonic ability, in spite of all they can do.  It's just the limit of the 1964 analog source tape.  For what it's worth, in my mind, it's a welcome addition - a veritable breath of fresh air.  I highly recommend this album.
1439148813|5.0|I just completed reading the book.  I began working in Aerospace in February 1954 when it was all Aero and retired on September 30, 2004 with many years focused on space. I worked on Mercury and Skylab.  Most of my working life was spent in production, development and testing but in 2001 I finally got to work \\"on console\\" in Mission Operations. If you have worked in development and in Flight/Mission Ops you know that the greatest impact on mission success or failure is those years of detailed methodical work long before launch but work in Mission Ops carries a very special pride and very little margin for error. This book by Gene Krantz is all about his experience in Mission Operations or Flight Ops and gives a personal accounting of every single U. S. manned space flight from Mercury through the final Apollo Moon mission, Apollo 17 - warts and all. It is written in first person and it names names and gives his personal observations without a lot of sugar coating. He is 3 years older than me and many of the events and places he mentions are very familiar to me - You do not need a BS filter when reading this book.    Bob Axsom

I got the 3D version, which also includes the DVD and a Blu-Ray 2D version and have watched both the 3D and 2D and both are simply amazing. While the 3D still has some limitations and it's not perfect in it's color, it was still worth it.     I had fun watching it and the story line, to me, was never boring. Although I'm an adult, I have no artistic ability whatsoever, so (stop motion) animation is really special and I can understand the work involved in something like this.   If you have little kids, though, you might want to view it before they do. At times it can get a little dark.   I was very pleased with this movie.

Although I am not too much on nudity in a movie-which I thought that part could be deleted because the story of this girl seem so real. It was difficult to remember it was a novel and not the real story of someone's life. I liked the way it was done too-when looking at the extras on the dvd-the director said he blew real buildings and etc instead of using video graphics like our american films. I did not realize what a difference that made in a movie.
0316010669|5.0|Hi, actually I am the wife of the Kindle reader who purchased Blink in June.  To the best of my knowledge he has not read it.  I, however, have not only read it, but I have been pushing the ideas in Blink on my Advanced Placement students for several years now.  The main principle is directed toward having students believe that they know the answers better than their neighbor on tests.  They have to believe that and then prove it to themselves.  Many have reported amazing progress in taking tests and knowing that they know answers.  I am grateful every day for Malcolm Gladwell.  I wish I could get him to come to my high school and listen to my AP Art History students rave about him.  P.S. every AP Psych student is required to read Blink.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|I have now listened to the whole stereo (primary) version of this box set.  I think I have made a mistake not going for the mono set.  I have a few Beatles CD's from the 1980's, but base this on my comparison with my complete LP collection.  Especially, but not only, on the early albums, it just doesn't sound right.  There's a hole in the middle of the sound between left and right channels.  As for the later albums, Abbey Road sounds slightly muddled though it was recorded in stereo from what I understand.  I'm about to shell out three hundred bucks for the mono versions instead.  (Though I will keep my copies of the later albums not included in that collection.)  I hate to be a downer here, but I'm just plain not thrilled with what I heard.

1416594892|5.0|John Le Carre is a very good observer of human behaviour. He has to. And his characters jump live from the pages and get into your life. That's how real they are.  This is a sad story of our times, in which he tells about suffering and gets inside the terrorist mind. He does not show gory details, ther is no blood spilling from the pages, he only hints of it.  He also hints of the very real confrontation between western civilization and the islamic world presently being fought in Europe, and that many of us apparently choose not to acknowledge.  I recomend this to John Le Carre's fans and all fans of secret services and terrorism stories.

Second read was as good as the first.
B001993Y2C|5.0|This series is by far the best TV scifi ever. I am a scifi freak and where Star Trek gives you the feeling of nerdiness Galactica does not.

The series is done with some fantastic acting and special effects that makes the entire series worth buying. I wish I could afford to buy this series for all of my friends.

055380684X|5.0|This is a fabulous book, particularly if you're into teaching, coaching, or developing skill in someone you care about. Among the concepts:    1. Making mistakes is perfectly OK, even NECESSARY, to improvement.  2. Enthusiasm really matters;, dedication and commitment also matter a great deal  3. A good teacher make a big, big difference.  4. We don't become \\"master\\" coaches/teachers overnight.  5. The \\"way\\" we learn something is very important.  6. There is a biological component to learning called myelin.    The author takes us to several different places in the world (\\"hotbeds\\") where great talent (skill) has been developed: Russia, Brazil, Great Britain, South Korea, USA, and the Dominican Republic. The activities are soccer, baseball, tennis, musical instruments, golf, writing, among other things. He talks about Ignition, Deep Practice, Motivation, Goal-setting, etc. If these types of concepts are interesting to you, then you should enjoy this book a great deal.

B000BTC5LW|4.0|Great concert. The video was great and the audio was above average. Its  been since the wall concert since I saw Floyd.  IT was great to sit back and remember.
B001TOD92C|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it had very real moments, I think Mickey Rourke did an excellent job and Marisa was lovely to look at.
0395389496|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  Both the story and the beautiful illistrated pictures.<br />My husband and I gave this book to our boys when they were 7 and 4 years old.<br />He would read it to them every Christmas Eve.<br />Now I am passing this on to my Grandson.<br />So my Son can continue the tradition.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|The tv series is intriguing and after reading the book series, I was pleased with the characters.  The first episode was, just, rough.  But once you get past that, it is great, and keeping you interested and laughing.  This is an HBO series, and true to HBO form, there is nudity and sex.  Take it for what it is worth, and enjoy after the kids go to bed.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. I had loaned it out to someone and obviously it was one of their favorites also, since they never returned it. As usual was able to find it on Amazon.
B00007LTIC|5.0|Rhino did a great job with this.  I have this album on vinyl. As a fan of YES I woul recommend this pick to anyone.
B001PMLKLK|5.0|I read that Imelda may was opening for Jeff beck in London.I thought,she would not be opening if she was not good.Never hearing of hear, I got the CD. AMAZING!!!!! She simply has the coolest voice. Great songs, great CD.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|I loved this movie when i was growing up and still love it now. long live centauri!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Don't be fooled by the title.  I thought this was going to be some fluffy summer read.  What a great surprise!  A style I didn't expect, a topic I didn't expect and as I started to read I never expected to be drawn in the way I was.  A great read.  Enjoy!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Love me some Uma! Will the will BeBe and Kia grow up and go at it? will Lillie come after Bea while she is blind?
B001CC7PPI|5.0|I have nothing but good things to say about my purchase.  It was easy and I received it in excellent condition.  Rear Window happens to be one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies.  The suspense is fantastic and James Stewart and Grace Kelly are great!
B0027WNRIG|5.0|The remastered studio disk was a great replacement for my vinyl, yes I still have plenty of vinyl. The live second disk in this set is a collection from Def Lep's first three releases, the production is a little inconsistent but the songs chosen to be on this one are the ultimate Def Lep jams.
B001GSV3EC|3.0|I bought this because I had seen the show several times on the Palladia channel.  I was looking forward to listening to it while I drove to and from work but it doesn't play in my car CD. I get an \\"error\\" readout. (2003 PT Cruiser/Factory player)  A little disappointing to be sure.
1400095204|5.0|My memories of the war in Biafra centered around horrific photos of starving children along with occasional sound bites from journalists.  Adichie skillfully crafted a novel based upon characters so believable and vibrant, who are all victims of the atrocities, and some perpetrators of them as well, that you feel as if you are living through a hell that knows no limits, where civilians are free game for soldiers, where young men are conscripted to fight when seen walking on the street, where girls are gang-raped at random, and where the red cross, and relief agencies are kept from delivering staples to refugee centers.<br />This was a painful book to read, for although it was fiction, the background in which it took place wasn't.  Adichie skillfully forces you to face the horrors her family endured.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|I grew up with Bond, just can't offered to have the past movies. I started collecting with Golden Eye.
B002G4FQI4|3.0|Mr Benson can't make a bad album if he tried. But this album stops at just being \\"good\\" and not great. In my humble opinion, making an album containing  covers is a tough act when the originals are already so great. Furthermore, I don't feel that he has added any creative twists or new perspectives to put the original songs in a whole new light. The other songs, newly penned by Mr Benson's favourite composers for the album, are nice... but do they stand out from the crowd? Are they slated to be evergreen hits to linger in our memory. Sadly, no.    After his long absence from the scene, I was hoping for some new direction in his efforts. His amazing, unique voice is still present, though lacking a bit in fire now compared to his legendary \\"Give Me The Night\\" or Rod Temperton masterworks like \\"In Your Eyes\\".    Finally, after repeated analysis of the session musicians' contribution to the laid-back album, I fail to sense any of the greatness usually demonstrated by greats like David Paich, Lee Ritenour, Patti Austin or Steve Lukather.     I tried really hard to love Songs and Stories, but despite the Emperor's trumpeted new clothes, my ears tell me he really isn't fully clothed.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I never recieved this product as the seller took my money and never shipped  it to me. So, as a result I cannot review this product for you.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Es excelente que mas puedo decir, estos gatillos se acoplan perfectamente a los botones L2-R2 del control de ps3 y no se salen para nada de los botones cuando uno esta jugando especialmente shooters como KILLZONE 2,incluso el color es id&egrave;ntico al color de f&agrave;brica y te da la impresi&ograve;n de que el control viene asi.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Reading some of these reviews is a bit enraging.  The movie has a plot.  It just doesn't happen to be a Michael Bay \\"Transformers\\" plot where the story moves at the speed of light, supplemented by explosions and special effects.  You have to appreciate character depth and real storytelling to love this movie.  It's the subtleties that make this movie brilliant (i.e. Bill Murray standing in an elevator in a hotel in Japan, towering over everyone else).  If you're looking for another popcorn flick, this is not it.  This is a beautiful movie about two people, thrust into worlds they don't fully understand (both Japan and their personal lives), who form an unlikely, yet special bond.  It's well worth giving a shot.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|great
B001VROVHO|4.0|Amon Amarth once again proves their worth with \\"The Avenger\\". AA is definitely among my favorite metal bands, and the melodic, catchy riffs and excellent, brutal, yet clear vocals that once made me interested in the band are still very much alive on \\"The Avenger\\". The sound is slightly different than on their last effort, but not much. The music is pretty much the same, but there is a change in the tonal quality. A bit, I don't know, lighter? Evil? It is neither better nor worse, mind. It may be a different production, is all.    It took me a couple of times listening to the album to really get to grips with the songs, but they are really, really good. You'll be humming the main riff from the title song before you know it. I didn't really care for the live versions though. They are probably a very good live band, but on a CD their live performance is far too close to the studio version to be of any interest. I would've rather had two or three more songs and no live bonus.     All in all, a really good album. Good riff based songs with properly good vocals. And it's all about vikings, what's there not to like?
6305558175|5.0|I had been looking for this movie on DVD for a long time.  I am thrilled to get it and love the movie.  {I even think it is better than the classic \\"Gone With The Wind\\".}
B0012GN47C|4.0|I saw Santana live twice and have just about every album released on Vinyl & now rebuying the same Albums on CD and enjoyed listening to Amigos again with a clearer sound and not a bad recording : Good Album .
B0002Y4T92|5.0|great
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter books, and I have been mildly (Order of the Pheonix) to severely (Prisoner of Azkaban) disarppointed in the movies since the casting of Micheal Gambon as Dumbledore. Gambon is a great actor, but until this installment, I did not think that he adequately portrayed the character that fans of the book hold so dear. He was alternately too gruff, too clueless, and too weak. I think that this must have been due to writing instead of his acting, however, because he was GREAT in Half Blood Prince. Even with the added scenes that were not in the book, I felt that this installment remained truest to the book. I went to see this movie three times- and this is coming from someone who never goes to the movies. I am truley surprised that other reviewers have not given HBP more stars. To me, it is obviously the best attempt to remain true to the books to date.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|I had seen these movies when they came out and was excited to find them in a collection.  The collection is the movies that Clint Eastwood stared in that all fit together and were almost a continuation of each other.  It is a real plus to add them to my DVD collection.  My 12 year old nephew is really into Clint Eastwood movies and he was thrilled to have me get them and has really enjoyed them.  [For me they are kind of violent, but they are definitely the movies he was in at that time.}  Dirty Harry is extra special to me as my childhood was spent in Marin County, where it was filmed, so it was exciting to see & know the old sites.
0790731452|5.0|great
0790733226|5.0|One of those rare instances where a film is thought provoking and entertaining at the same time.  The kind of movie you're still thinking about the next day.  Because Carl Sagan was a thoughtful and passionate scientist, he was able to write a more plausible first contact book than most professional fiction writers could produce.  The film turned out as good as it did because of his input.  It's a shame he never saw its completion.
0783225725|4.0|I love the Clint Eastwood westerns and this one did not disappoint me.  A good movie to watch; good Clint Eastwood and good western.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|I have started buying Errol Flynn movies. I was pleasantly suprised that this was a very good transfer with good sound and a great story. I would compare it to the Court Jester in quality.
1416511946|5.0|Thank you Nikki---I can't thank you enough for publishing your personal diaries.  As a mother of an addict (recovering for the second time)reading how you should have felt like being on the top of the world only to be living in your own private hell, helps me to somewhat \\"understand\\".<br /><br />At times it was a hard read, but something that I had to keep reading.  I wish you all of the best.  And thank you for giving me hope again.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This CD contains some of the best of Michael Jackson. I love the younger Michael's music. This CD contains both younger and older music from the King of Pop. Definitely recommend.
0375842209|5.0|A great book about one girls experience during WWII. It's heartful, suspenseful and full of good characters. I had a hard time putting it down!
B0012GMVXU|4.0|I've heard that this is Leonard Cohen's own favourite among his albums; this would seem to be proved by the fact that his self-selected 'Essential' compilation features all but two songs from here.      Maybe it's a case of gratitude? This was the album that brought him back out of the cold, giving him his highest charting album in many years and pushing his back catalogue onto the charts around the world.  Many of the songs have become a latterday classics....but many older fans will baulk at the gleaming, synethised arrangements, some of which now sound very dated indeed.     Not to worry, though: simply programme them out in your head. There's too much fine songwriting here to pass this one over just because you don't like the production.  The only possible mis-step on here is 'Jazz Police' - or maybe this is just a private joke, a bit like 'Diamonds In The Mine'?     Whatever you think, this is an essential acquisition if you're any kind of fan.
B001TODCII|5.0|There are many reviews on line regarding the plot, the premise, the acting etc. so I will not comment there. But with regard to the action sequences it was clear that an accomplished security or self defense expert provided much of the inspiration and direction (or the director studied these). I reviewed the fight sequences in slow motion and at speed and every move is something that would actually work. The style is not for Kung Fu enthusiasts, rather, it is based on the Applegate, Jim Grover, Fairbairn, styles of self defense that real bodyguards and experienced law enforcement use. There is even some grappling but practically applied (not MMA). The close quarters shooting is likewise realistic. I did not count rounds fired relative to each weapon but given that this is a work of fiction, unless you see fifty rounds come out of a semiautomatic without reloading, I can live with it. Other details that many may not care about such as the lead actor switching shooting hands in order to maximize cover are consistent and obviously were given thought. I suppose my point is that those with backgrounds in LE or other areas will appreciate the care taken in terms of realism.
B001IF252C|3.0|TAX!  i cant avoid to buy it because it was for work, hate to buy something because some corporation change the cables every time a new product came out.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|My new iMac no longer has Firewire 400 connections, so I was faced with throwing out a powered Firewire hub and a half-dozen cables, having to switch all my devices to USB...if I could.  This cool little device let me be selective and use my Firewire hub and cables through the new iMac's Firewire 800 connector.
B00079FUI6|4.0|The product came in good condition.  There were no scratches and the seller was honest about the product.
0451197879|5.0|I thought at first after reading other reviews of this book that it would be a slow moving book, but it wasn't at all slow, granted I had to concentrate on my working schedule but once I got home I read some more. Yes, there were slow spots in the book, but being a King fan, I just kept on reading.
0887431461|3.0|I think this book is a little too easy for the listed ages 5-6 or Kindergarten children.  I like the various activities and the pictures are inviting.  No stickers.
B0018YIW4S|5.0|I had this as an album over 20 years ago.Playing it again just reminds me how great this album is!!It's one of those rare collections where every single song is good and you do not have to skip over the lame ones!Rock On Metalheads!!
B001HN697M|3.0|Well the ending kind of sucked on this movie, never got to see the betrayal that took place, but the beginning of the war. Wasn't as good as I hoped for.
B00004YX39|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best produced albums ever. It is sonically perfect. And of course the music is about as good as it gets. If you have DVD Audio, get it. This version is two channel and sounds great, but in 5 channel surround sound of the dvd-audio version... it's probably the best produced album ever made in that medium.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I'm not going to elaborate on how much of a Beatles fan I am , and alot of these other reviews are a echo  of what I was going to say, But This is the first time I have ever on cd, had the complete catalog of the beatles. As a child my mom only had two albums from them on vinyl \\"Let it Be\\" and the \\"Hey Jude\\" album.So I didn't hear alot other than that except on the radio. Then came the 80's my teen years and \\"Breakfast with the Beatles\\" every Sunday morning.From them I collected on vinyl new and used (loved the Apple label). Then cd's came out and you can bet I jumped on them , but they never stayed in my collection , because they just didn't sound right (as with many artist from that time that had their analog released on cd). when cd's started getting remastered and with some I thought sounded better, and some just louder, I waited for the Beatles to be ,and wondered if they would sound any better . After hearing the differences with some of the old cd releases, I am more than pleased than I have been with any remastered release. I never heard the fab four sound so clean in my life. I love the packaging as well, with one minor exception, for my nostalgia I wish the Apple on the cd of \\"Let it be \\" would have been red like it was on the original U.S. release , and I wondered if they were going to release the rest of the U.S. catalog when they began to release the Capitol Volumes , and if they did if the \\"Hey Jude\\" album would have been included.  As well as \\"Yeterday and today\\" (the butcher cover of course). But to me Past Masters vol 2 is close enough to being the \\"Hey Jude \\" album for me just with extra tracks. And I  also wished they would put the U. S. version of I'm looking through you on \\"Rubber Soul\\". But this is a great set and it is more than worth it to own.  to me It's is definitely like listening to \\"The Beatles\\" for the first time like I did When I was 3.

B002AT4K9G|5.0|This was a very very good movie, it was awesome and i know there has to be a next part to it, because of the way it ended and if in fact there is a part 2 i hope it is as exciting as this one was.
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|I have not watched any of these with the director's commentaries, but if you just want the movies themselves without the fancy DVD features like extra featuretts, etc., this is the set for you.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I was looking for the movie \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" and found it on Amazon at an incredibly low price. Delivery was quick, also. No complaints about the product or service. Actually, I haven't had any complaints about any of my purchases from Amazon. I may have just jinxed myself, but I'll take my chances by ordering again.
B000002KXO|5.0|This is the first Mac album I bought. Lord knows why, but 'Rumours' somehow passed me by at the time (I have it now, of course.) and I was drawn to this album by the enchanting lead single, 'Hold On'.<br /><br />It was a wonderful surprise when I got it. I knew little of Fleetwood Mac or any of it's members and the fact that the album flows so well with so many diverse talents is a great achievement.<br /><br />I've read since that Stevie Nicks, who was enjoying a very successful solo career at the time, was reluctant to reform and didn't want to use her best songs for the project. I suppose that's understandable (if it's true) but it shows how on-form Nicks was if tracks as good as 'Gypsy', 'Straight Back' and That's Alright' weren't considered strong enough for her solo stuff.<br /><br />The collection is beautifully produced and whilst I agree with another reviewer that the album is more about craft than emotion, not a criticism, in any way, I have to say I still adore it 27 years on. It just sounds like summer to me, I don't know why.<br /><br />One slight whinge, though. 'Fleetwood Mac', 'Rumours' and 'Tusk' were given the deluxe treatment 5 years ago. A great job they did, too. So when will 'Mirage' and 1987's 'Tango In The Night' (something of a sister album to 'Mirage', I feel) get the same deal? 'Mirage' doesn't sound bad, it's too well recorded and produced for that. But it could use a remaster and with the added incentive of bonus material it could delight a whole new generation of potential fans. It's certainly worth reappraisal in 2009.

B00007K02F|2.0|I've watched different versions of Jane Eyre and this is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre ever. The screenwriters butchered the whole story and to make matters even worse, the actors were dull and lifeless. There was no passion at all between Rochester and Jane in this version and it seems like Rochester married Jane only because he has nothing better to do with his time. At least that's how it seems like in this adaptation. I don't think they were even interested or attracted to each other in this movie. Why bother making this movie at all I can never comprehend. But I'd recommend the stephens/wilson (Masterpiece 2006) version or even the hinds/morton (1997) version.

630469654X|5.0|Watched an old copy of this movie on VHS with my kids when they were young.  We all loved the movie.  Long ago the copy was no longer showing.  I was thrilled when I saw it on DVD.  Love the movie.

630469654X|3.0|Well several years ago I saw this film and didnt notice any \\"odd music\\"<br />. I loved the original film! It was  I believe a good romantic, save the princess type movie, only here you have a cunning man of the \\"cloth\\" gttg revenge by cursing the lovely \\"lady in waiting\\" and her dashing chief of the guards-Rutgar Hauer-by never being near each other from day to night, or night to day.....until a simple thief, farm boy gets involved and helps the lovers to end the eternal spell.! Love movie! Not sure about disc...no label......just markings by spindle hole...you have to look closely as its tiny laser? printing;outside case ok, pic of Michelle Pheiffer with her other self a hawk!would gve 4 stars but disc looks like a copy, and music not right as in another review!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|This pool is a lot of fun.  Our son who was 17-19 months in the summer enjoyed the little pool as well as the wading area. The slide didn't slide very well unless there was water running down it.  Our son walked rather slide down it with our help. The size of the pool allows for a lot of little people to be in it without a lot of fighting.  We didn't use it too much just because we ended up going to the beach or wading pools.  Also the size was a little too big for the amount water we used and the size of our yard.  I think we'll be Craiglisting this pool for a little smaller pool.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|(SPOILERS AHEAD - but only based on my interpretation.)<br /><br />Quentin Tarentino has constructed a terrific movie based on a well-known and often-used sci-fi device - an alternate reality. Anyone who's read Ray Bradbury or Stephen Baxter, or watched Star Trek (Spock with a beard, for god's sake) knows there are slight differences between \\"our\\" reality and an alternate reality, such as (wink, wink) misspelled words.<br /><br />When did our reality change lanes? When Landa impulsively decides NOT to kill Shoshanna! He was a brutal son-of-a-bitch, so why the millisecond of compassion? Don't know, but it shifts reality onto another path.<br /><br />In \\"our\\" reality, the BastArds plot to blow up a theater with Hitler and his top brass inside MAY have been successful, but some might have escaped. Now with Shoshanna's plan and the BastErd's plan coming together, and the theater doors locked, the plan is a success - everyone dies. And Shoshanna, who should not have been alive in the first place, also perishes in the theater.<br /><br />After seeing the movie, I thought to myself - leave it to Tarantino to simply re-write history. And then it hit me - it wasn't re-written, it was simply an alternate reality. If none of this makes sense read the sci-fi classic short story, \\"A Sound Of Thunder\\", by Ray Bradbury - short, simple, and mind-blowing.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Loved Coraline... good story and the Stop-Action Animation is some of the best I've seen.  Seems to me we've gone to another level with the animation over even such wonderful modern classics as the Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|I was actually surprised by this movie. I read the book many many years ago. The computer graghics were quite good. This is a good action/adventure/fantasy movie if that is the correct classification. It seemed like a mixture of a movie to me.
B001U0D786|4.0|Loved this movie years ago in the theater & saw it multiple times on the big screen.  I had the movie on VHS which was OK until I bought my Blu-ray player.  This is the perfect type of movie for Blu-ray. The cinematography is incredible & every detail comes thru.  The music is beautiful, intriguing & adds so much to capture the feel of the time & place of this movie.  I would give the DVD 5 stars except for the fact that it doesn't have English subtitles.  I enjoy having subtitles even though I'm not hard of hearing because I don't want to miss anything in the dialogue.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. So much did I enjoy this that since it's purchase I have watched it no less than 5 times and every time I pick up on things I missed the previous time. The story at first seemed a little dis-jointed but as you progress further into the film it gets quite enjoyable and has you wanting more, wanting it to come faster and faster, at nearly 3 hours long (directors cut) it flew by, most films I have watched in the past (unless you are at the pictures whereby you cannot always get up to go to the loo for being made to feel like a heel and missing part of the film) you can put on pause to make a cuppa etc. This film had me glued to my seat for the whole 3 hours, as a SCI-Fi (freak) lover I usually watch all films with an open mind deciding later whether I like them or not and make an opinion over a few days, if I cannot decide I watch the film again - this film however had me wanting to watch it again straight away (had I have got the time I maybe would have done so)Set in an alternative 1980's against the cold war between the superpowers, it is a very political film in all ways, from Nixon's 3rd term in office to the personal politics between the characters the film is named after in fact as 'watchmen' they do the exact opposite and get involved to catastophic consequences, 'do the means justify the ends' you will have to watch the film to make up your own mind, I did and loved every minute. Everyone who I know that has watched this film have a fave character and we all love the same one, who will be yours. The film uses all modern tech to put across an absolutely stunning piece of not only story telling but cinematography from stills to slow motion, most of the film is done in semi-darkness which you would think would detract from the overall experience, but like the latest batman film I think it not only enhanced but superceded the experience they were trying to get across. All in all terrific to see a graphic novel portrayed even better than the '300', although the director did a great job on that film, on this one it would seem he was the only choice. 10/10 all round. Be there another one? I cannot wait.
B001IMFHTS|5.0|This is a splendid set, sonically, interpretively, visually.  Abbado has lived with and thought about these symphonies a long time; this reading of the symphonies represents a judicious, mature, balanced interpretation.  What I like is the lack of an attempt to impose a dramatic, moody, stormy, gut-wrenching performance on these amazing works of symphonic thinking.  Beethoven was born in 1770.  He's an 18th-century man setting new parameters in harmony, rhythm, and structure, but he's an 18th-century musician seeking ways to expand 18th-century forms.  He is not throwing out the window the tonal world he grew up in.    The performances here are clean, articulate, and extremely well-performed.  For me this is the basic reading of the symphonies; other performances by conductors with different views can be interesting, entertaining, appalling, intriguing, virtuosic, even extremely moving, but as for the basic standard, this DVD fills the bill.
0143038583|5.0|Omnivore's Dilemma was probably one of the best and most intriguing books I have read in awhile. The author, Micheal Pollan, does an awesome job at neatly laying out the current issues with food in America and contrasting industrial food with possible alternatives in America. The beginning of the book may have went into more detail about corn then a typical reader would like to know, but it is a necessary set up for the rest of the book.     Bottom line: If you have ever wondered how a meal gets to our plates you should read this book.
B002OPYUSM|5.0|One of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time!  I can't wait for more episodes!
B001EN71DG|5.0|BEST WAY TO WATCH STAR WARS BACK TO BACK ADVENTURE, HAVING ALL THREE MOVIES IN ONE CASE IS A GREAT IDEA.
B00288KNJU|3.0|The flat version of the film is very nice. A wonderful, very unique story, well told. A valid example of the animation 'revolution' that is truly effective. A clever story that isn't just an excuse for a gang of actors to get together and do voice-overs, stuck in some crazy premise; this was based on a children's book and had a reason for being rather than just silly fart joke laughs. The characters are believable, quirky souls, who seem exotic and interesting rather than the rubber-stamped kiddie flick creations we've seen so often.    The colors are realistic, and duplicate the overall feel of the original version. I'm not so sure that the Blu-Ray process is really needed as there is no need for the super contrast and dazzling color pallet that those discs provide. I haven't compared the digital copy with the Blu-Ray, so I don't know how specifically, they differ, but I image the difference is minimal.    The film itself is a charming little story with a lot inventive twists and turns and a spectacular visual style that survives on the flat version much better than the stereo one. I see that, apparently, UP won't have the 3-D option when it makes it's debut, later in the year. That is no loss, believe me.    The 3-D effects, which were so dazzling in the theatre, are lost on this disc. Although the process has been improved enormously since the fifties, the attempts used to duplicate it on video are the same very lame red lens/green lens process used on comic books of that era, and mid '70s tv broadcasts. It is ugly and more annoying than effective.    It is recommended that one allow one's eyes to adjust to the process, but no amount of waiting will help this look less than ugly. Just skip the 3-Disc and wallow in the loveliness and wit of the normal Blu-Ray version.

B000U7169M|4.0|I THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD AND TURNS OUT TO BE A LITTLE SCARY.
B0000062FJ|5.0|I'm 51 years old and I grew up on Santana. I've listened to this band on 8 tracks, cassettes, reel to reel, and vinyl. I can't imagine what rock and roll or any part of popular music would be without Santana as a part of our musical spectrum. I agree, Abraxas is incredible, and \\"Everybody's Everything\\" from III is fantastic. But this disc is where is started. These rhythms lay the foundation for what Santana became and what Santana still is. You can trace the roots of \\"Supernatural\\" right back to this disc. It's a keeper. I'll probably have a copy stashed in my bedside stand when they put me in the old folks home.
B000002U9L|5.0|If you loved the songs in the movie (who doesn't and what do you have against Bowie?), you'll love the soundtrack. All the songs are there, including instrumental pieces that are, if you like soundtrack scores like Pirates of the Caribbean or Star Wars, a great addition to the collection. Everything on the soundtrack is of course a little 80s but that's why we love 80s movies right? Or that could be me.    Really, all you need to know is that it's David Bowie. Singing love songs (And \\"Dance (Baby) Dance\\" which is a typically strange Bowie song anyway. \\"You mind me of the babe,\\" \\"What babe?\\" \\"the babe with the power\\" \\"ect.\\" will be stuck in your head weeks at a time). His voice is amazing, he's not too tripy and come on, you loved the movie why NOT get the soundtrack? There's nothing wrong with wanting to support the filmmakers we all love, even (or especially) if they haven't made one in a while.    Yep. So buy it if you like the movie or just David Bowie. Because everyone should already know that a little Bowie makes everything better (and Trevor Jones is an awesome composer).
B001GQSY64|4.0|I bought this and I like it, but i am confused how they are putting it out. I just saw \\"The Complete first season\\" for $40. Does that mean that my copy is incomplete. If I pay another $40, will I pay for something that I already have just to get the second half of the season? I don't get it.

B000AOEMXM|5.0|I have watched every episode. The best thing is the small film clips at the end containing conversations with writers, production staff & actors. The out-takes are interesting also. If you're considering buying this set; I encourage you to BUY IT!
B000006045|5.0|This is simply the best Massive Attack album. If you only get one of their albums, make it this one. It's hard to explain the vibe of this album but it's very cool indeed, more so than their other albums. I guess I would say it's a real smart album.
B000002UWL|3.0|\\"Being Boring\\" is an amazing song but the rest is pretty average. I just got \\"Release\\" and it is average also. If you want to experience good PSB, stick to their last two releases. \\"Yes\\" and \\"Fundamental.\\" They took a huge leap forward in song writing and production with those two CD's.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Iliked the movie very much and had seen it before, wanted to own it so purchased it. when I recieved it , in just a few days, I went to play it and the dvd was ruined and would not play. the special features disc was okay. I contacted the sellers and they were very understanding and had not realized this, since it was a used dvd they had recieved. they quickly refunded my whole amount I had spent including postage and handling to my credit card. I would do business with them again since they were so cooperative and it was a mistake.
B000VE439Y|5.0|C'mon!  It's Python!<br /><br />Added bonus: this is the one that REALLY irked the zealots.
0671027573|4.0|To tell you the truth, it wasn't the romance that really drew me in. Which was surprising to me, being an avid reader of romance novels, that for a \\"romantic suspense\\" read the romance didn't do much for me. It was enjoyable in a way, but I've read of better romances with leads who can carry on entertaining bouts of banter, as well. Like there was this gratifying balance between the two.<br /><br />In this book, the comedy completely outweighed the romance. So much so that it didn't really bother me that romance was somewhat lacking. Don't get me wrong, you KNOW that Jaine Bright and Sam Donovan have this heated attraction for one another; It pleased me to see just how well Sam was written. This really cocky, highly intelligent, never shy, irritating man who is match to match with Jaine's notorious humor, quick wit, and love for cars. I have yet to come across such a couple :) Man, the dialogue between the two was SO funny, clever and I loved every bit of it. You'll find yourself eager for another verbal brawl just as much as they are anticipating it.  They were paired together wonderfully =)<br /><br />The four best friends have such a sisterly bond with one another and each is written with her own set of distinct details; Marci's laid-back having-seen-it-all, Luna's loveliness, T.J.'s sensibility, and of course Jaine's fast humor. The quartet are quite funny and endearing together that it's really quite sad when one's lost. And the villain is quite appalling. You actually get to see inside this person's head and see the twisted thoughts that take place. Really, it's the perfect example of messed-up parenting gone severely wrong. The WAY this person murders is quite unsettling, but Howard writes it boldly and gives the story a nice very serious edge to counter-play the humor.<br /><br />And boy, the humor :D Sam is hilarious, as well and you'll just love how has not a single shy bone in his body. Jaine's comedic relief is pretty constant and you'll reel with it; there's this grocery scene that was just too funny!! On a serious note, there's this twist on the villain that I didn't even see coming. Howard delivered disturbing suspense, sparkling humor, yet a bit of a forgettable romance with this book.<br /><br />Happy Reading.ene that was just too funny!!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I was hooked from first episode to last. Dexter is a mean killer and yet so lovely !
B0013ND30M|5.0|This movie came out the year I was born.  I don't recall seeing it that first year.  When I was nine, I saw a comic book retelling of the Walt Disney movie, but I finally saw this movie the first time.  (Actually, I thought the comic made a couple of improvements, including the ending.)<br /><br />One can argue if this is really one of Walt Disney's classics:  I would not put it in that category.  I did have some problems with the drinking scene where the minstrel got drunk -- I think that is trivializing alcohol for a young audience.  There are logical problems to the story such as how three fairies who cannot cook or sew without using magic can care for a girl for sixteen years without using magic.  But this is still quality entertainment for the children.  The climax is very suspenseful.<br /><br />While I may not consider this movie a classic, I definitely consider Malificent to be one of the best villainesses to grace the screen.
B00000269M|4.0|To tell you the truth, I only recently rebought this CD because of the untimely death of Michael Jackson.. I have a large CD collection and I figured this CD should be a part of it.<br />  I had purchased it when it first came out...the follow up to the monster smash, \\"Thriller\\".  It got lost during one of my moves.<br />  I received it and I listened to it again and I was still impressed by \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", and \\"Smooth Criminal.\\"  The title cut never did that much for me when I discovered that originally it was to include Prince. He later turned down the offer.  Prince apparently didn't think the tune was \\"bad\\" enough. (ahem).<br />  It still rates 4 stars, however.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Beautifully executed film about forgiveness and redemption.  Wry Eastwood wryly wins my heart in this, fabulous story, acting, casting.  Keep going, Mr. Eastwood, your vintage is at its best!
0307269981|5.0|After reading this crime novel I had to pick up the next one in the series. Addictive!
B000JIHP88|4.0|I purchased this mobile because of the reviews and because it looked bright and colorful online. I was hesitant at first because my daughters bedding is pink/brown and not a rainforest theme, however, she absolutely loves it. The moving leaves and colorful animals really draw her eyes to the unit and she will sit there and study it for seemingly forever. The music is pretty standard - classical, and it features a rainforest-like sound of crickets and frogs, birds, etc. The only feature I was disappointed in was the light. I was under the impression that the light on the main unit that attaches to the crib was more dramatic. It is just a bulb that shines light through the base. Not much to look at so my daughter really only cares about it during the day when she can actually see it. Otherwise at night, it's good for the music and rainforest sound.    Anyhow, I still think this is a great mobile and would recommend it to all. Oh, and it comes with a remote activator so you can turn it on while in bed or at the nursery door! It is a nice feature.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|A prequel that was well cast, well filmed, well done all around!  I was grew up with Star Trek and all of the subsequent spin-offs and was skeptical after being dissapointed in \\"Enterprise\\" (which they did NOT get right).  From the sweeping and uplifting musical score that gives honor to the theme song we all know, to the accurate characterizations of the younger versions of the classic heroes, you leave the movie ready for the next one.  While no movie is perfect, this was one that came very close to it - not only did the actors have their characters on target, but the Gene Roddenberry concept of a future for mankind that was not dark and bleak with polluted air and acid rain; but one where mankind's future was positive and good; where the possibilities out-weighed the problems.  This movie was also FUN - something that a lot of movies have lost.  Most are trying to send a message or make a statement but it was good watch a fun movie...to escape to a place where \\"ones had gone before\\" and it was still good.   I am glad they \\"made it so\\".
0739384171|5.0|The first in the series ( The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo)was compelling . This book grabbed me by the throat and held me to the finish ! I have purchased at least 15 copies for friends. Can't hardly wait for the next one .....................

Every album is talked about by the band,and there take of recording each record,the good and bad side.  I could watch this DVD everyday.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Why oh why only seven episodes?   This is a great and addictive series that leaves you hungry for more. Ah, but maybe that's the idea.  Bryan Cranston is absolutely fearless as the cancer stricken high school chem teacher who has a lovely wife, a bright disabled son, and a daughter on the way.  He's also got a brother in law who is in law enforcement, and a talent for cooking meth that makes him a legend in Albuquerque.  Meth means money, and money means the best in chemo and other treatments.  Of course, it also means dangerous company, accidents and other physical dangers, and lots of pressure to produce more meth.      minor spoiler below.....            Cranston is also heartbreakingly good in the intervention scene, in which he at first lays out his case for not wanting to be sickened by the treatments...before he changes his mind.   Very strong episodes.
0679731377|5.0|No really, all I have to say is \\"Wow, good.\\"  If that has any real meaning to you you have to look at my previous essays  and reviews.  Sorry. This is fantastic, and I'm without words.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I won't rehash all of the technical specs on the Turtle Beach X41 Headset for the Xbox 360.  Rather, I will let you know the impact for me on my gaming experience.  I pre-ordered this headset base upon some media reviews and a visit to Turtle Beach's website where they had video of it in action.  My goal was to find a headset that would improve my performance in Xbox Live multiplayer competition with first person shooters (FPS).  All I can say is - WOW, what a difference!  I'm currently playing Call of Duty - World at War and I can hear things that couldn't with my old audio set up.  With the 7.1 DD Surround Sound, I'm able to pin point the enemy quicker and increase my kill ratio.  I've recently had 20:1 kill ratios that I've never been able to achieve before.  So if you want a headset that has awesome sound & will improve your gameplay, then I wholeheartedly recommend the X41's from Turtle Beach.  The price isn't for everyone...but in this case, you definitely get what you pay for!  I look at it as a long term investment since you won't need another headset during this console's generation.

B00129H7VS|5.0|EASY ORDER, ARRIVED IN TIMELY MANNER, VERY SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE!  AMAZON IS THE WAY TO BUY!!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I spent $400+ on both Stereo and MOno boxes and I can tell you two things: (1) When my wife finds out what I spent the rent money on, I'm a dead man and (2) I'd do it all over again. I've owned various incarnations of Beatles LPs and CDs. I also spent some serious money on Japanese pressings of the White Album and Sgt Pepper's among others. This remastering blows them all away! Some of you are still whining about the \\"superior\\" and \\"warm\\" quality of your old beaten-a$$ LPs from 20 years ago. Others complain that EMI is milking the fans yet again, while others scream their heads off about the \\"remixing\\" of the Yellow Submarine Soundtrack and \\"Love\\". Still others babble on and on about the superiority of the Mono versions over the stereo, alternate mixes, etc... You people are worse than those nerdy nimrods who post all kinds of crap about the overall superiority of the original Harvest pressing of \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", droning on and on about how CDs are stupid, flat, they want their 5:1 remix, etc.. . So (finally) my point is: Just get over it dammit! EMI finally released an excellent product when they had remastered the entire catalog by competent people using the best technology available today. Millions of old fans and new fans alike will gretly enjoy and love these albums now and 50 years from now, after the original tapes disintegrate. And those who claim they don;t care about the difference between the really $hitty and carelessly done 1987 masters, I say: get your hearing examined! The 1987 masters were and are an insult to the band as well as an abusive practice to sell an inferior product at premium prices. They should all end up in landfills, as few of us could afford luxuries such as the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab or Japanese pressings. This box is the Holy Grail of all collectors and should send Mono and original CD and LP pressings prices plunging to the bottom almost overnight. In a way it's a pity as.. how do I get rid of my Japanese White Album CDsnow?
B001Q797ZU|3.0|Cold Steel Pocket Shark Self Defense marker is just that....meant for defense. I definitely would not want to be hit by this thing, but as a marker it falls short. The fine tipped marker leaves much to be desired in this way over sized marker body. I understand the point is to make a self defense weapon, but I would rather carry around my Smith & Wesson Tactical Pen, mostly because it is a functioning pen.
B00243FQFA|5.0|As a long time stargate fan I thought season 5 of atlantis ended with a great twist, atlantis I thought was a good spin off from the orginal but I always thought that Richard Dean Anderson was perfect for the pare in sg1, having seen them all several times and owning all of them including the movies I think it's a great series to get into, I give all of them two thumbs up.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Good natured, entertaining, Errol Flynn, action, humor, what more could you want from a swashbuckler?
140003180X|5.0|Wonderful series for any age.  The books don't contain language or sexual material that would make a parent hesitate so even teens might enjoy this series.  Gems like a character describing herself as \\"traditionally built\\" when she has several extra pounds she carries around  are precious.  Also, the two lead characters are written to show how they maintain a relationship through understanding and forgiveness, even with personality flaws.  Tolerance is a subtle but constant background to the stories.  You begin to relate to and care for the characters because of their imperfections.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Adjusted to the controller movements quickly and now I don't even notice. Still in good working condition after 3 months of daily play. Not much else to say - all works smoothly - the buttons, the sticks, and the vibrating. It's taken a hard knock or two falling to the floor and hasn't been affected - a definite plus.
0307266303|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. At times, the tone seems a bit inconsistent: One chapter reads like a gripping race narrative, the next like an invective against the running shoe industry. The lack of any pictures at all is a bit frustrating; I would love to be able to visualize some of these remote vistas and eccentric characters. And the coverage of the final race was a bit disappointing; I found it almost anti-climactic and not particularly detailed (especially compared to some of the race narratives from earlier in the book).<br /><br />But these are just nagging complaints. Overall, this is a great book, very difficult to put down. A must read for any runner, and I would imagine a great read even for non-runners. Highly recommended.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|Wish I had been there! Winwood & Clapton picked each others' songs & only played the best! Great backup musicians. Highly recommend!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I have been listening to the Beatles since I was just a baby. My mom introduced me to them as they were her favorite. I remember the 8 tracks we used to listen to. And she had a few on vinyl as well. Today I feel like I am really hearing the Beatles for the first time. I did some research when I was trying to decide which box set to get. It turns out that the Beatles spent weeks and weeks on the mono mixes. Because stereo was a novelty at that time, they left mixing the stereo versions to someone else. The stereo version were more expensive, so most people purchased the mono. The Beatles were only personally concerned about the mono mixes. I am by no means an obsessed audiophile type of person. But I hear things in these recordings that I have never heard before, or things I only heard faintly before. I closed my eyes while I was listening. It was like they were playing 8 feet in front of me, despite having the speakers on complete opposite sides of the room. Gone was that annoying left/right seperation where you felt like John was way over on one side of the room, and George way on the other side playing his guitar. I would suggest that before you buy the stereo remasters, consider this as a better option. I promise you, you won't be disappointed.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Just love this ear headphone; using it with my ipod instead of the earphones which came with it and with which I was not happy at all. But,so far I have not been happy with any of the headphones I have accumulated of the years, until I found this one. The headphone fits well  and is not bothersome at all. I can finally hear the music clear without any constant adjustments. I can't really talk abt the noice reduction as I use it mostly outside walking.  Wish I had found it earlier particular taking the great price into consideration.
0439023491|5.0|What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said about this book or it's predecessor?<br /><br />I started this book knowing full well that rest or sleep would be completely elusive with this book unfinished, and it was. And despite the numerous warnings of how engrossing the sequel would be yet again I was truly amazed, astounded, astonished, at Ms. Collins' work once again. And those are only the words beginning with \\"A\\".<br /><br />I would, and have, recommend this book to anyone how has even a passing interest in literature. I long since bought a second copy of \\"The Hunger Games\\" which spends all of its lifetime being passed around to friends, barely resting in my possession for a day before being thrust upon another with the warning that they will fall completely in love with this series and be salivating for the next book. They did and were. I bought two copies of the book, and one copy is making the rounds like it's predecessor, though not to nearly as many, because most of the people to whom I lent the first book, fell so in love with the series they bought themselves their own copies of both books.
B001VPJZGI|5.0|One of the best of the Denzel Washington Films ever..........  I do think that Clive Owen almost steals the movie away from the great Denzel. Wonderful Plot and great acting!
0156027321|4.0|I liked the book and loved the writer's style.  Yann Martel has an amazing style of writing - almost poetic.  Very descriptive and as odd as the situation of being alone on a boat with a tiger seems, is actually believable.  I recommend this book.
B00129H7VS|5.0|My Father fought in WWII under Patton.  Needless to say he saw some of the worst fighting the world has ever seen.    Listening to him has made my Brother and me very particular concerning movies like these.  Saving Private Ryan and this movie actually gives you the real flavor of what that time was like.  You see the toll it took on a man's mental state as well as the physical state.  You see what they had to live through and what that generation actually accomplished.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|A lot of musical obelisks from the early years of recording are being remastered with amazing results. This CD is one of those. If you like Neil Yong and don't have this disc, buy it. If you love Neil Yong and have the original CD-recording, this is the opportunity to hear the music hove it was meant to sound.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Jimmy Smits was amazing. I hope they bring back Jason Manuel Olazabal in the future, his character has a lot of potential.  The story line is a good one, but the suspense was not there this season and I missed it. Dexter is maturing and that is interesting to see.  I really wish his sister would grow up a bit, her immaturity is getting pretty annoying.

0743270754|5.0|Kearns has undone herself. This brilliant historian gives us a thoughtful, insightful look into the complex relationships of extraordinary men like Seward and Chase. She adds another important layer to the loving, flawed humanity of Abraham Lincoln. This is the most interesting book of history I've read in five years.
B00009L7N1|3.0|Had some very good songs on it but some were a little tiresome and similar to his other work.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|This is a truly beautiful movie. The actors did such a good job that you even forget who the actors are and they become the characters. For some strange reason, movie makers seem to think that a movie is better if it includes a sexual intercourse scene. Not so, it detracts from the theme and limits the audience. We already know the characters relationship. We don't need to see it graphicly.
B001UW58WW|3.0|I was fun to listen to once....but the \\"talent\\" enjoyment was in the novelty of the fist listen.  Garrett did not do enough to show off any more than fiddle playing capability.  I've heard better on country music performances.  Will not buy any more of his stuff.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I Look to You isn't Whitney's best album, her first album was. I Look to You has a few good songs, I think this album could have been better than it is. I'll be waiting for her to release another album in the future. I don't give up on Whitney, because I know she has strength to pull out another album that is beautiful. I waited so long for her to release another album that isn't as great as I thought it was going to be.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Wow, this cd collection is great. The mono versions sound a lot better. I was never born in that era (was born in 76) the only one I got to listen to was Sgt Pepper on vinyl. To hear it again in mono brought me back to being a kid, especially listening to Lucy in the Sky. They did a great job making the replica vinyls as cd's. People that bicker and complain about the price, its not that bad at all. These will last longer then your like 100 cups of starbuck's. Thanks to apple for making a collection that's worth to get. :)
B00003CX9Q|5.0|ALL OUT GOOD MOVIE! HAVE NOT SEEN ANOTHER LIKE IT! EVEN NEW MOVIES DON'T OFFER WHAT THIS MOVIE DOES,A FAMILY FAVORITE KEEP'S YOU ENTERTAINED TILL THE END, A GOOD BUY.

From 8 to 80 in just a few bars the Black Eyed Peas covers the age barrier with their dedication to pure funk - their beats feel like a funky extension of your heart and you can't HELP but pulse!

B000VWE5OY|5.0|British Television where acting ability is more important than looks. Excellent quality on a budget.
B000065LZQ|5.0|So you buy this, thinking you'll be getting an EP which kinda builds up the bridge between two full-length albums by including some sort of remixes, 12\\", B-sides, and then what you get back is something that maybe could work even better than any of those two, filled up with (perhaps) some of the best-ever tunes by Mr. TR.<br /><br />BTW - for newcomers, \\"Wish\\" is not just another song; it's a NIN anthem. A very few tracks gave me chicken skin as this one live.<br /><br />AMAZING.
6305736650|2.0|Amazon, you did NOT send the version that I ordered of this movie..!! I wanted the COLORISED version, you let me believe you had it available, when I specified same, and I clicked on the colorised version. Then you sent the same old Black & White !! Do you have it available or not?? I'm still interested in the the color one...I can give this one away. [...]    Annie Silva
B002436WJE|5.0|My thoughts on \\"Taken\\" are if you love a quick pace action movie look no further. Liam Neeson in a role as retired agent, who is trying to mend his relationship with his daughter. The story is direct and so is the action. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year.
0307472590|5.0|Me pareció un libro muy bien escrito, la trama, el suspenso, los personajes, el ambiente oscuro de Barcelona. Es el primer libro de Ruíz Zafón que leo y me encantó.   I liked how is it written, the story, suspense, the characters, the dark context in Barcelona. Is the first book from Ruiz Zafon that I have read and I enjoyed very much.
B00243FQFA|3.0|I have all seasons of Atlantis and SG1. When Atlantis first aired it was way better than SG-1, the pace was faster than SG-1. Most of the early episodes were very good. However towards the end of the series, it was basically just the same. McKay saves the day when things are impossible. I kind of got sick of the same pattern. Even though many people liked \\"Vegas\\", I think it was the worst episode of the series. The extended episodes and not that extended. The show ended abruptly. (There was no reason to land Atlantis in SF bay or so). I think this was one of the more disappointing seasons. Alliance with Todd and fighting again with Michael. Just too boring. Having liked Atlantis way better than SG-1, I realized that I play dvds of SG-1 almost all the time. Seen the SG-1 more times than Atlantis. I realized that I like SG-1 more on DVD or re-runs. Anyway that is my opinion. The new SG Universe sounds too much like a scifi-ed version of LOST. Still this Atlantis box set is entertaining, and if you have the other seasons, you are probably not going to stop yourself from buying this one.<br /><br />2/7/2013<br />If you are a SG-1 or Atlantis fan, you collection is not really complete without this season.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The best show in a decade.  I haven't watched a regular TV show since early 2000, but this show has me hooked.  If you like a mix of genre,[[ASIN:0441017770 Sookie Stackhouse, Books 1-7]] this one to see. Part horror, part whodunit, part romance, it's got it all. Additionally, it picks up the ideas and themes in the books by Charlene Harris, which it is based upon, but goes off in a new direction adding new storylines. It's lots of fun and I highly recommend it!    cyn
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I love this CD.  I love all the songs and to hear them live and hear Leonard's wit is such fun.
0486283577|5.0|I was looking for period clothes to study for doll costumes.  A great source for ideas.
B001G5RST4|5.0|This is a great kid's movie - I love the fact the both my kids can always agree on watching it (they are 6 1/2 and 3).
0385341008|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It pulled me in and I felt as if I was there in the story, experiencing everything that happened for myself.  It's one of those books that you are sad to finish - it leaves you wanting more!
B002NHBNWW|4.0|I am a fan of the Twilight series, and before watching this I thought it sounded like a complete rip off. In most ways it is very similar to Twilight but after watching it I think it could hold it's own. The story is not bad at all. I do think the main vamp character (Stephan?) looks way too old to be a high school student, but he did say he was, what, over a century old? So maybe they were trying to make him look a bit older because of that. Some of the other students looked more like they should be in college or older. The show could do without the cheesy fog and crow, but I do like the special effects around Stephan's eyes when he starts to vamp out. Overall, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.
B000002VMH|4.0|There are some older hits that I love and some that I hadn't heard before..I have been enjoying different artists/songs on movies this past summer and in finding out the name of the artist/singer/songwriters, am happy to say that I enjoyed the entire CD..
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I have the original album but needed the CD.  I hate I waited this long to relisten to the undisputed King of Pop.  Every song is classic Michael, and it's unfortunate that now his voice has been silenced.  But with this, his most popular music ever, it is refreshing to relive his golden voice.  It is a must have for ever music library. Rest on Michael....you are gone to soon.
B001AUI4PW|4.0|I loved this read. I wasn't happy with the rape scenes but accepted them as part of the narrative. I was very pleased with how Follett acquainted us with all of the characters and thought that he drew us intimately into their lives as well. Though I am not a technically nor mathematically inclined person, I enjoyed the scenes of planning and building the cathedral as well as the personal stories. It was very much a characterization within the framework of the novel. I think it was powerfully and masterfully written. I loved most of the storylines so I was happy overall with the content as well as the writing, which I found to be superb. I wish that all my reads were this all-consuming of my mind.  Highly recommended.
B001NY42KQ|4.0|IN my opinion the third production of High School Musical is the best of all three.  It is energetic,crisp with excellent performances from all of the members of the cast.  It makes you want to sing and dance along with them.  Bravo and well done to all involved.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Like many SI-FI geeks I have been a fan of Blade Runner for many years. When I saw this five disc set on Blu-ray I had to have it. It did not disappoint! This is a quality movie made even better with Blu-ray.  As always purchasing it from Amazon was easy and enjoyable.  I would highly recommend this five disc collector's edition. It is a great add to your movie collection.
B00176X7X8|1.0|It's a classic . . . and I wish we could have enjoyed watching it. But, the quality of the disk was the worst we've ever had to deal with. Bad color, grainy, major variance in focus. It was so bad we returned the DVD for a refund.
0894803123|5.0|This book has fabulous recipes. It has been a great addition to my cookbook collection!
0446581348|5.0|The great thing about this book is ,that everything it recommends and /or use is aviable at the Bobbi Brown stores/salons........
0375413405|5.0|I cook from recipes 95% of the time - this is unlike any other cookbook around.  Even after all these years!  It's half cookbook, half text book.  I recommend you read this like a regular book - if not in it's entirety - at least at the beginning of every chapter....you'll get a lot more out of it with her use of master recipes.    I bought this book because I saw Julie & Julia.  I keep this book out all the time because the recipes are amazing!  My husband constantly asks for the butter poached chicken.  It takes 30 minutes to make and tastes like you spent all day in the kitchen!    Buy this book.  Every kitchen should have it!
B0000062GE|5.0|It's been years since I've listened to this album. I had the blessing and the curse of this CD dropping right as me and my first serious love were parting ways. Ten years later the darkness of the music still echoes in that hollow part that was ripped from my heart. And I know that sounds like a bad thing, but it's really not. You know when you see, hear, or smell something that offends you but you can't help but go back for a little bit more, it's kinda like that. Sometimes we all need to feel that pain every once and a while, and I can't imagine any other band that could take your there like Stabbing Westward. There are a couple low points in the album, I would have given it 4 and a half stars, but since it was either 4 or 5 I think the power of the better songs propel it closer to 5 than 4.<br /><br />However as a footnote I must mention their 4th album did suck quite hard. The lead singer found some new love and was in a happy relationship when he recorded it. You can hear in his voice that hurt and loneliness are gone. Which I guess is good for him, just bad for his music ;)
B0025KVLU6|5.0|...I've been listening to you since 1966 (okay, I was 3 1/2 then, but Yellow Submarine kind of sticks with you). Dear Ringo and Paul, and George and John THANK YOU! Oh, did I say I was your biggest fan!    (As an aside let me say that 1968 was a horrible, awful, terrible, beautiful year that produced some of the greatest \\"pop\\" music ever. If you like the White Album then to be culturally literate you should at least give these classics from the same year a listen to: [[ASIN:B000002KAT Astral Weeks]], [[ASIN:B000002AHB Sweetheart of the Rodeo]], [[ASIN:B00006AW2J Beggars Banquet]], [[ASIN:B000002P5U Electric Ladyland]], and [[ASIN:B00026WU5U John Wesley Harding]].)
B000WS4QJG|5.0|The best of michael jackson, it is well worth the cost. Wonderful music by the King of Pop.
B00005JO20|2.0|(Widescreen DVD format.)  This version of King Kong starts out very well with believable characters, subplots, and scripting.  The story sets up several hints at interesting characters with intriguing personal stories.  The one indication that the script may turn into Hollywood nonsense is Mr. Driscoll being stuck in an animal cage.    Everything else seems to be going great until the big tree trunk over the ravine.  At that point, the script drops everything on the floor - characterizations, relationships, and depth - to focus on ridiculous scenes of grotesque deaths and stampeding bouncing dinosaurs (which are, in a way, hilarious in their absurdity).  Resolutions of all the interesting stories set up in the beginning become moot as characters are knocked off left and right.    The sole relationship of any depth is the strange Stockholm Syndrome pseudo-romance between Ann Darrow and King Kong.  Ann Darrow's on-again, off-again fascination with Kong is especially incoherent at the end of the movie.  Finally, with Kong splat on the concrete, all other relationships and many loose ends are left completely dangling.    We agree with another reviewer - this is another case of focus on superficial appearance with CGI effects at the expense of completely abandoning all story depth.
0307269981|5.0|A very good book that started slow but picked up steam, snowballed and the left a thousand unanswered questions. Now you have to wait for the next book. I believe the author has passed which is unfortunate. The first two book were great. I hope the third answers the questions and if there is a forth I am sure I can't wait for it either.
B000PC0U1W|4.0|Good movie with an incredible story.  Suprisingly good action as well.  Sounds great with surround sound.  Wanted more from the extra content...they were a little bare.
0385341008|5.0|My daughter recommended this bk to me while I was visiting her - I didn't get finish while there so I ordered one when I returned home .  I enjoyed learning about what happened during the war.  The letters were very human & amusing at times.  They made the story more alive.  I have since loaned the book to friends & they too liked it enough to want to share.  I love books that tell the story with letters.

B00004YYDI|4.0|I was interested in this film with a review by a show on all time best gunfights.  This movie \\"delivered\\"!  Not real crazy about most of the plot, but was a \\"good\\" movie to watch.
B00005JPSM|3.0|No Reservations brings to the screen the story of a woman, head chef of a prestigious New York restaurant, whose fear of commitment has led her to devote her life to her kitchen. Things will change though, when a new assistant chef shows up while at the same time she takes up the task raising her niece.    The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both. Well written and well presented, the movie will provide for a few laughs and a few tears, nevertheless, it does not seem to possess that something that will put it over the top.  Catherine Zeta-Jones, Abigail Breslin, Aaron Eckhart, and the rest of the cast, carry out their respective roles well.  The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all good.  In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece it will provide for an evening's entertainment. 3.3 Stars
B001CTDH4Y|3.0|The movie is only mildly funny.  Humor is to far between the laughs. Expected something much more creative and humorous than this.
B0020MMB9E|5.0|We really enjoyed watching Jamie Oliver on TV especially his series where he goes out to his garden, picks whatever's in season and then does a whole show about that crop like Potatoes or Squash etc.  This book is the paper version of that show.  He talks about his garden, how he plants and grows the particular plant so you can grow your own then takes you through how to cook and prepare and and many dishes you can make with this fruit or veg.  We have a few of Jamie's books and this one is by far our favorite.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|I liked most of the movie, but my wife will not even watch it. Storyline not appropriate for young viewers.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Off the wall is exactly what this album is. One of MJ's greatest albums. A must for Michael Jackson fans.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|It's obvious after her disasterous live performance on GMA that Whitney destroyed that magnificent voice.  If only she had the pipes to sing I Look To You...sad sad sad
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FIRST CLASS MOVIE, BUT THEN I AM PREJUDIST !!!!  BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN   LOVE WITH NICOLE KIDMAN !!  BUT THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE, GOOD ACTING, GOOD STORY, GREAT SCENERY AND JUST ALL AROUND GOOD, WHICH IS RARE THESE DAYS !!
B001KBZ6CU|5.0|I got this journal for my 8 year old son who is a big Indiana Jones fan.  He and his 12 year old brother think it is very cool and can spend hours going through it.  A good purchase for us.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I don't know, where do you start to talk about any record by Michael Jackson?<br /><br />I guess, I'll write the truth.  This is the record that for me spelt out Michael's contribution to the early 90's.  It was the first solo album he produced without the input of the legendary Quincy Jones.  And, he wrote just about all the songs on it.  While he perpetuated his distinctive musical style as cemented with Thriller and Off the Wall, he also updated it and expanded it to encompass other elements of popular interest in 1991.  And of course, the \\"novelization\\" in his art carries over from his previous records unmistakably.<br /><br />I can't recall which was the first single I heard on the radio from this album, but I'm pretty sure it was \\"Black Or White.\\"  When I first heard that one, I remember thinking, \\"Yes!  Another Michael Jackson record!!\\"  And, that was the first of seven songs I heard on the air before I got my first copy of the record.  Seven songs!  How many others can do that in the US, I ask you?<br /><br />When I heard the album from beginning to end, I was blown away not only by how many hits it generated.  I was also dumbfounded by how the original album cuts sounded.  The long intros to \\"In the Closet,\\" \\"Who Is It,\\" \\"Heal the World,\\" \\"Will You Be There\\" and \\"Black Or White\\" were fantastic.  Especially knowing they were Michael's inventions.  He was as creative and ingenious as any singer/songwriter/performer could get, without having to also be a killer instrumentalist like Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, Steve Clark, Stevie Wonder or Eddie Van Halen (the legend of \\"Beat It\\").<br /><br />Just a drag that you can't also dance on vinyl, cassette or CD.  Michael's music makes you want to dance, and of course, nobody could do it like MJ himself.
B000001EUR|4.0|The first Scorpions album to please the overall radio world. \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" is the biggest hit of their career at this point. [Although \\"Blackout\\" (the album and the song) were hits with metal fans before this.]
0385341008|5.0|I loved this book.  I have passed it on to at least three others who also loved it.  A beautiful story.  Interesting perspective on how it is told.  Lovely.
B000000OMB|3.0|A good thought. Not bad, but not memorable either. Yes fans are disappointed, but a good listening album.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|Great product as usual from Apple. Only complaint is the cost - way too much for an adapter.
B00000J7J4|4.0|A great mix of talents. It's Carlos Santana! You can't go wrong with Santana, new or old.
B001EP8EL2|5.0|very very good product, because i purchased this dvd years ago, but this dvd had a much better lighting and clearer vision, it was so clear i ordered the blue ray version.  thank you
B0027WNRIG|5.0|A must have for Def Leppard fans. Their first big hit album. \\"On Through the Night\\", their first album, has a different(but good)sound; \\"High and Dry\\", their second, had a lot of dubbing, but is still another good one.
0887081770|2.0|I bought this for my 3 yr old grand daughter. It was very small and not what I expected in quality fron an Eric Carle book. The story itself was a nice story but I'm sure the book did not last long. Would I have purchased it if I had actually seen it. NO
B000056VJ7|5.0|Not a bad song on this album! No other album of theirs even comes close. If you want Meatloaf, this is the one to have. Another addition to the Classics list.
B00005221M|5.0|This movie should have won more at the awards than just for sound...absolutely wonderful movie...wonderful cinematography..breathtaking views of North Carolina...outstanding soundtrack...a little violent but those were violent times. Michael Mann is tops in my book as a moviemaker and the cast was outstanding.  I will watch this movie again and again...if for nothing else but the beautiful scenery and soundtrack.
B000286S8S|4.0|If you are a Van Halen purist, you don't like it. If you're not, it's a great album. Sammy adds a new dimension to the band: group effort (not a collection of solo efforts). Sammy fans will be pleased as well.
B00288KNJU|4.0|liked this movie but not in 3 d....you don't get the colors that really are worth seeing in this dvd
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Heard so much about it. Then I read the Charlaine Harris books and had to see it. So I ordered it. True Blood was soooo good I ordered HBO for the 2nd season. I'm HOOKED!!!:)
B0001B55PS|5.0|Nice to hear a comtemporary singer who actually tries to sing a song, and not scream at you as they do it. Good enough to get me to buy her other albums.
0060254920|5.0|Brings back fond memories of my childhood. This book taught me that there is no place like home.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|If you need a way to teach kids about colonial American history, you could do much worse than having them watch \\"John Adams.\\"  In fact, I was so impressed with the mini-series that I donated a copy to my local middle school, where it has been used in the curriculum.    There is nothing bad to say about this production.  Excellent acting all around, totally invisible CGI work that brings early America to life, and a no-holds-barred attitude about the hardships of life in the 1700's.
0375714839|5.0|I teach this graphic novel in a university course in young adult literature.  It is one of the students' favorites, and it provides valuable insights into a culture and a history that most of us Americans don't really understand, despite our heavy involvement in the Middle East.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|My whole family loves this movie, we've watched it a ton and can still watch it again and again.
B001DWNUCO|1.0|The only saving grace for this film is its cinematic history.  Despite cameo appearances by various well-known actors, it is poorly edited, poorly acted, and isn't much more than over-advertised pornography. It is so bad that I watched about half of it, then took the DVD and threw it in the trash where it deservedly belongs. Don't waste your money on this one.
B0025KVLRO|4.0|The 2009 stereo remaster is leaves me with mixed feelings. Some of the mixes are good, \\"Ask Me Why\\" comes to mind as does \\"Twist And Shout\\", but the new stereo mix of \\"Please Please Me\\" is not very good. It sounds tinny and a bit distorted. I wish they would have included the mono version instead. I'm lukewarm on \\"I Saw Her Standing There.\\" It sounds a bit tinny to me as well.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|The 3rd season of Dexter was even better than the first two seasons.  I can't wait for the fourth to come out.  This product shipped quickly and cheaply.  I love amazon for it's service and selection.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I initially wrote this review on the 11 September a couple of days after purchasing purchased several Beatles Remastered items on release day (09 September 2009 - see end of review for a full list)... This is one of them. Initially I listened to this album on one of my secondary set-ups (i.e. a NAD C51BEE CDP, Straightwire Encore-II interconnect, & a Yamaha HTR-5730 amp driving a pair of non-audiophile headphones). I was immediately struck by how Abbey Road (Remastered) sounded - whether it was that trace of vinyl style 'warmth' within the recording, or some extra depth, the quality of the bass (which has always been lacking on the CD editions of most Beatles albums), or that 'really hearing it for the first time feel'. It was certainly a fine sounding record in its own right! I really did get that feeling of hearing it for the first time despite having the original 1987 release CD version in my library... I was actually smiling to myself much of the time as I listened to the details of Ringo's drumming, or was able to clearly pick out the distinct guitars in the more 'rock' orientated tracks... I even noticed Paul's little chuckle in the middle of verse 2 of Maxwell's Silver Hammer - believe it or not I've never really noticed it before (even though you can hear it on the '87 release) - it sounds so alive and you can actually hear him holding back the giggle at the end (like he's got that little niggle to burst into laughter over something...)    I immediately listened to the album a couple of times end to end and then played around with some of the settings and if the sound I was hearing is indicative of the reproduction on all the albums then it's a fantastic effort. The bass was just wonderful IMO - to me the Beatles often have sounded thin or lacking depth on many discs, the bass is just missing from the soundstage, and here on the new version there is no sign of that - its great to have really full deep bass, while still having strong forward guitars and cleardistinct vocals as well - I can tell you I was smiling the whole way through the album the second & third times I listened as well.    I dragged out my 1987 copy - and its a genuine original eighties copy - and although it sounded okay it just didn't quite sound the same - I skipped through a few key tracks and it still just had that lack of depth - not that it's 2-Dimensional, but just that the sound stage is shallower, and it's a bit lifeless on the '87 CD. Sound level too is distinctly lower than the new remaster, as noted in the Pitch Fork Music review, and they have increased the level on the remastered version but without any obvious clipping or other destruction common on modern rock albums, and have not attempted to scrub out the tape hiss and other natural background noise found on the original studio master tapes (as this would degrade the sound quality of the music as well)... The original CD release just sounds a little less chirpy or alive compared to the new 2009 remaster.    Update (26 September 2009): Having now listened to the album several times over a couple of weeks on my main system (Musical Fidelity A3.2 CDP, Kimber Silverstreak Interconnects, Plinius 9200 Amp, Slinkylinks Speaker Cables, & Chario Constellation Speakers) I've come to the conclusion that the differences between the original CD and the new remasters are mostly pretty subtle - the higher range stuff is clearer and more distinct (you can hear what almost sounds like the individual bristles of a snare drum stick/brush in Maxwell's Silver Hammer striking a cymbal or high-hat or something where as it's a bit nondescript or blurred on the original CD and lacks that fineness of detail). The remaster involves you more and holds your attention - listening to the original '87 one your mind tends to wander and lose attention - and it seems a more forward presentation - I like the sense of almost sitting in the studio with the Beatles that the remaster gives... (Note: as always when doing AB Comparisons on my main set up I used a Sound Meter to help adjust volume levels to equalise the recording levels - I found the new remaster's sound level around 20db higher than the original).    This new remaster is clearly an evolutionary step not a revolutionary one - the changes and/or improvements are mostly subtle or something only an audiophile may perhaps notice or be able to quantify - but it's the overall impact where this has an effect and in my opinion it's a positive (i.e. the effect is more than the sum of the parts). If you are dedicated Beatles fan you obviously will feel you have to have these. But what if you aren't, well if you like the Beatles and are an audiophile then I believe it's pretty much required, if you do but aren't then it's gonna be a question of how important the Beatles are to you... If you like them a lot you'll probably appreciate the new discs, if like me you are a Beatles fan and/or an Audiophile, and you don't have an existing comprehensive collection of Beatles albums then again they are probably a must buy. However if you are a casual listener, or not a particular Beatles fan, or have a full collection of the 1987 CD's (or even earlier Vinyl) you may find the difference is not dramatic enough to warrant the investment, or at least may want to buy 1 album you already have to compare the difference before investing in more - but I'd certainly recommend the remasters and suspect most people who listen will appreciate the difference.    This album is an essential purchase if you are a Beatles fan - There is an obvious list of the essential items to get a set if you are a true fan to get the basic 14 albums:   - [[ASIN:B002BSHXJA The Beatles Mono Box Set]] (First 10 Albums & the 2CD Mono Masters)  - [[ASIN:B0025KVLUG Yellow Submarine (Remastered)]] (Stereo)  - Abbey Road (Remastered) (Stereo)  - [[ASIN:B0025KVLV0 Let It Be (Remastered)]] (Stereo)    However some of the Stereo Albums are looking like being superior to the Mono (and Stereo) versions in the White Mono Box Set, and you may end up wanting to get one, some, or all of these Stereo Versions as well (or instead of the Mono Box Set) - there will be plenty of debate over the following months as to which of these are better in Stereo and which aren't - in some cases it may even be a tie, with one reviewer suggesting purists may want a mix of mono & stereo tracks to form a composite `album':  - [[ASIN:B0025KVLSS Help! (Remastered)]] (Stereo)*  - [[ASIN:B0025KVLT2 Rubber Soul (Remastered)]] (Stereo)*  - [[ASIN:B0025KVLTC Revolver (Remastered)]] (Stereo)  - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Remastered) (Stereo)+  - Magical Mystery Tour (Remastered) (Stereo)+  - [[ASIN:B0025KVLU6 The White Album (Remastered)]] (Stereo)+  - [[ASIN:B0025KVLS8 A Hard Day's Night (Remastered)]] (Stereo)  - [[ASIN:B0025KVLVA Past Masters (Remastered)]] (Stereo)#      * These are my initial picks as essential Stereo versions to have alongside the Mono Box - although there is a lot of debate over these 2 earlier albums Help! & Rubber Soul as they have the original 1960's Stereo versions included on the Mono Discs (so that's 3 different versions total) and the Stereo CD versions are actually George Martin's Stereo remix from 1987 remastered! I suspect I may eventually add titles such as \\"Revolver\\"; \\"A Hard Day's Night\\"; and perhaps \\"The White Album\\" later to my 'Stereo' selection.    + There is some division over whether the Mono or Stereo versions are better for these 3 Albums - at present I like the Mono. Regardless it's unlikely you'll want the Stereo versions of \\"Please Please Me\\"; \\"With The Beatles\\"; and \\"Beatles For Sale\\" - unless you opt for the Stereo Box Set of course.    # The Mono Masters in the box set has a differing set of recordings for many tracks, so having the Remastered \\"Past Masters\\", and the included \\"Mono Masters\\".    As a final note, if you don't have the modified [[ASIN:B00000K4ES Yellow Submarine (1999)]] album you might want to getit - it's suggested it features better remastered mixes than any of the new 2009 Remasters of both Eleanor Rigby and Yellow Submarine (the engineering of this album was overseen by the surviving Beatles at the time) and it also has several other tracks with almost as good alternate remasters to these new releases.
B00092ZL80|5.0|I bought this DVD in anticipation of seeing the Chicago/Earth Wind and Fire concert live in August. Neither disappointed. I will watch this DVD many times as a memory of one of the best shows I've seen in a long time.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|WOW!!! I just recieved my first order of the remastered cds today. As I said, it's like hearing these albums for the very first time. And what a sound it is !!! The voices pop out at you, and the instrumentation is clear, crisp and complex in its' simplicity. It becomes evident  just how much of a range John and Paul's voice have.  For the first time I heard Paul's technique and mastery of the bass; I finally hear how integral and necessary Ringo's drums are. I can't wait to hear the other cd's I recieved and order the remaining ones I need to replace my older editions.
031606792X|5.0|I could read about nobody except the characters Stephenie Meyer has created in this series and be happy for the rest of my life!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I had this as an album and had to have it on cd.  I loved the DVD that comes with it with several of MJ's videos.  I also really enjoyed the updated versions of some of the songs that he did with the younger artists.
B000VXCS2Y|5.0|I Have been looking for this one since the 80's. the cassette is fine,but the true sound of this album is from vinyl.....THANX
0385341008|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much! I had a difficult time putting it down. I found only one fault and that was that it didn't continue...
B002436WFI|5.0|Whenever you pick up a Terry Prachett novel, you're sure of a rollicking good time.  The same can be said of this movie adaptation. Tim Curry is excellent as the scheming,  pompous protagonist, and the walking \\"Luggage\\" and \\"Death\\" are major contributors to  the hilarity.  If you're looking for a fantasy movie to watch with your teen/preteen but are sick of  the usual \\"wizard cliches\\"; Terry Prachett either avoids them, or skewers them and roasts   them over the campfire.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|Tess Mercer and Davis Bloome are why this season was one of the more original and effective seasons.   No Rosenbaum, as good as he is, allowed the show to be refreshed.    BTW Justin Hartley is awesome as the Green Arrow. He needs his own show.
B00005NUZN|5.0|Certain albums are essential, Abbey Road, Songs From The Key Of Life, Thriller.....and many too numerous to mention.
B001QTXM5Y|2.0|As much as this was hyped, I should have known it would have been a disapointment. The main feature was way too dark for the small screen while the so called specail features were anything but. Don't recomend this one.
0553381695|5.0|Some of my friends have been urging me to read this series for a while, and I'm so glad I have! It's so good!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Have seen them in concert 3 times.  They sing (almost) a capella, with only two taiko drummers and a couple of reed/string instruments.  However, M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Nesbitt, the fiddler is astonding the way she spritely hops around the stage, on high heels no less.  Therre is a variety of music traditional and new.
B0002JP4L4|3.0|Not up to HD standards but still loved and enjoyed the film.. if your a fan go and get it just dont expect the graphics and sound to blow you away..
1406310948|3.0|I was looking for the song, \\"Going on a Bear Hunt.\\"  This book has a CD that is the book read by a woman.  It is a cute book, and the CD is very pleasant.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|Nobody puts baby in the corner... Swayze and a great cast make this a legendary movie.. great blue ray graphics , detail and music.. need I say more.. go out and get this..
B002NHBNWW|4.0|being a twilight fan, and an ardent lover of vampires,werewolves,and anything that goes bump in the night. i appreciate a good movie in that genre.  this is a light version of Twilight, and certainly not Carpenters vampires. i enjoyed it, it did catch and keep my interest. i find the little twists that will lead up and onward fun.   the cemetary and diary is good and different. although the fog is a little hokey.  who knows it may get better as it goes along.   i like the fact that it is nt filled with screaming and yelling.   i will tune in again.
B001BJ6918|5.0|Both great but this one is a killer.. lol.. you will love it and on blue ray.. the cast is awesome and TARTENTINO at his best... DAVID CARRADINE will be missed but passed away just as odd as some of the characters he has played.. buy it and enjoy.
0060935464|5.0|I hadn't read this great American classic since my junior-high days, but I recently purchased & read Kathryn Stockton's The Help, which sparked the thought that it would be a good time to revisit To Kill a Mockingbird. To Kill a Mockingbird has become, in 21st century America, one of those books that kids all read when they're in their early teens; it gets discussed either as literature or as social commentary or as a coming-of-age story (and without a doubt it stands brilliantly as all three!), and then everybody just moves on. After all, a lot has happened since this book was first published in the first half of the 20th century, and our problems with race in this country have moved on.     Haven't they? Well, reading Stockton's excellent first novel, set in Jackson, Missippi in the early 1960's (the time of my own childhood), caused me to think yet again about the perpetual and on-going issues of race, class, education, poverty, life expectations, and all the other tightly interwoven issues that we continue to grapple with even now, with The United States' first African-American president in the White House. The public struggles, as well as whatever issues we find in our most private examination of our own preconceptions of each other, are very much still with us, even as we have worked to correct so many of the most blatant wrongs. The issues may present themselves wearing different guises, but they are far from being resolved; these questions are at the very core of the American psyche.     Read both To Kill a Mockingbird and The Help, and give yourself a little time to think when you do so. I think that these two books are a natural combination - maybe Amazon should sell them as one of their \\"Better Together\\" deals!
B001BJ690Y|5.0|Two of my favs in KILL BILL 1 AND 2 made great on blue ray with better music and graphics.. Tarentino at his best.. with all the cast being spot on..
1878424602|1.0|The book and DVD on the same subject or too vague.  I really wanted my money back. He may have other books  I'm sorry at least for this reading I was bored.  The book was in riddles, and the DVD was boring, I   kept looking for this earth shattering discovery which  never came.  At the end, it was like...\\"that was it?\\"  The book was written in riddles.  I know people like Deepak  very much, but at least for me...he offered me absolutely  nothing new.  The seven spiritual laws for me were absolutely plain  common sense nothing new.  Perhaps my expectations were too high for his book  and DVD.    Hope this helps.
B000CNESU8|5.0|A bit dated only because its message has become more obvious, and recognized by more people - and yet, the media (especially the news) continues degeneration. Hence, it remains totally relevant today. The 2-disc edition is definitely preferred, and the feature-length commentary is excellent. Lumet's directing of the characters was incredible, making them fully credible. Some characters seem a bit over the top - Ned Beatty's Jensen in particular, but given some of the top CEO's antics I've seen over the past couple of years, even his motivational speech to Finch doesn't seem unlikely.  Definitely to be highly recommended
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Several years ago I watched \\"Everwood\\" and thought it was a delightful series.  It is about a widower who moves with his two children from New York City to a small rural community in Colorado.  He had been a renounded brain surgeon, but now is running a free clinic.  The episodes deal openly and honestly with a number of current \\"problems\\" that the children face as they try to adjust to an entirely different life style and culture.  It's hard not to fall in love with this family and I am enjoying the series even more now when I don't have to wait a week between episodes.  The series comes in an attractive case and brings hours of great viewing.  Although some people may not agree with all the stands that are taken on some of the issues (because these issues are definitely a part of the episodes), you will still find each episode interesting.  Personally although it has been a long time since I have had children at home, I still find it interesting to see how the \\"modern\\" generation thinks.  To me the series has been worth the money invested.  There is also a second series season that is available.
B000H5U832|5.0|This is one of the few movies that will entertain parents and kids. One of the best movies of all times with a great story, great music and awsome animation. Can't wait for Cars II to come out next year!!
0060930349|5.0|Having read five versions of the history of the US I would rate this to the right of Zinn and the left of many stock texts. It is, as other reviewers note, not great for the period after Eisenhower. In general, it is worthy of consideration if you want a solid history of the US that attempts to honestly appraise our past beginnings to 1960. It is fairly detailed in the period before the founding fathers - settlement of the region.
B00008DDRX|5.0|THis movie was never a commercial success. IT is actually a story woven around the 1970 24 hours Le Mans race with original footage being the base of the movie. Many racing legends participated and are in the credits. Get this and the Grand Prix movie with James Garner if you are interested in 60s and 70 period racing. Awsome !!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This is the entire Jeeves and Wooster series.  Every episode is a gem. If you like british comedy, this is a must have.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Wow, this series is so amazing!  It's generally difficult to capture the grandeur of the natural world (wide open spaces) in a picture or video, but somehow they have managed it...  although it helps to sit close to a big TV ;-)  It would be extremely entertaining if it were just set to music, but the narration is excellent - and adds a real understanding about what you're seeing.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This album has some really good music, and Elvis sings from his heart! The band, as usual, is wonderful.
1594830835|5.0|This is a facinating and suspensful story.  When I thought I knew where it was going, it took another turn.  I listen to audio books when driving long distances.   The story was so fascinating I hated to turn off the car.
B0000DD79B|5.0|great
B000W91RUG|5.0|Funny, fresh and great character in that maniatic Sheldon. Another great buy, dont' regret it for an second.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|This show gets better and better!  It's intense, frightening, funny, imaginative, brilliant storytelling!  Horror, psychological thriller, drama, comedy, action/adventure, intrigue...this show has everyting!  And really strong family/friend relationships!  Friday the 13th The Series was my favorite show in the 80's...Buffy the Vampire Slayer my favorite in the 90's...and now Supernatural!  And the acting is great too! :-)  Fantastic production and the special effects are great technically as well as in their psychological impact...Alfred HItchcock would be impressed.  Every episode (from all the Seasons) has feature film quality.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar's computer-animated feature film \\"WALL-E\\" is three things at once: a thrilling adventure tale, sweet romance and imaginative science fiction. The studio once again shows that what animation can really do with creative artists and cutting-edge techniques.    The time is 29th century. Earth is now covered with trash and pollution. The film follows the story of one robot named WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class), designed to clean up Earth for humans. However, humankind had left Earth about 700 years ago and the only companion for lonely WALL-E is, not surprisingly, a cockroach.     That's when WALL-E meets \\"EVE,\\" a new type of robot that has come with a huge spaceship. WALL-E doesn't know why EVE is here, whose mission on Earth is not disclosed until the end of the film. But WALL-E doesn't care. WALL-E is happy to watch his favorite film with new friend, a VHS tape of \\"Hello Dolly.\\"    But something happens to EVE, who is then taken away into outer space again. WALL-E decides to save EVE no matter what it takes and that's when WALL-E's exciting adventure begins. The storyline is unpredictable and the rest of the film (that may remind you of a Douglas Trumbull film \\"Silent Running\\", as some reviewers point out) is full of actions that will never bore you until the really touching ending.    \\"WALL-E\\" is a romance and adventure story, but taken as science fiction, the film's story and its undertone are slightly dark. WALL-E keeps working briskly as if nothing bothers him (supposing he is a male), but the bleak landscape of the deserted city shows it is almost a miracle that WALL-E survived in the harsh environment and is still operating. You can infer what happened to other WALL-Es by looking at the picture carefully.     But what happened to the humankind? It is revealed in the second half of \\"WALL-E.\\" Well, you may not like it, though it is told in a witty and humorous way. It's the world of old Zager and Evans song. Actually the story of \\"WALL-E\\" could have been turned into a depressing nightmare quite easily, but director Andrew Stanton (\\"Finding Nemo\\") keeps the narrative afloat, tactfully mixing actions and jokes throughout.    With its stunningly beautiful visuals and lovely and likable characters that you can identify with, \\"WALL-E\\" is a masterpiece that well deserves its Oscar award, another proof that Pixar can never do wrong.
B001IF9WJ6|4.0|Is a perfect tribute for the Master and the quality of all interpeters is fine.  Spetial mention to Sting, and Laura Pausini with Giovanotti ,and Zuchero .    Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras very emotive as always they are.  The Music Quality is impresive.  The video quality is a litle dissaapointed for my taste.    Is fine for a collectors    Fernando GR
1604590483|5.0|This classic work explains the miracle of the power of mind in a clear and concise way. All the tools for continual self-improvement are provided here in an accessible way. Explaining the fact that each individual has two aspects of mind, the conscious (objective) and the subconscious (subjective), Murphy proceeds to explain the purpose and functioning of each and how powerful the subconscious is.<br /><br />This great subconscious power must however be directed by the conscious mind, and that is the individual's responsibility. An impressive array of techniques for directing the subconscious, like affirmation, visualization and [[ASIN:094069901X suggestion]] are clearly explained. Many helpful [[ASIN:087612144X affirmations]] are provided to kick-start the process of healing and many examples are provided on how people solved their problems by correcting their thinking.<br /><br />This inspired writing is immensely therapeutic in cleaning cobwebs, dogma and brainwashing from the mind. I recommend the book as one the very best entry points in the entire field of self-improvement. I also recommend [[ASIN:1567183395 Mind Magic]] by Marta Hiatt. Other authors whose work is of great benefit in this regard include [[ASIN:1585092894 Thomas Troward]], Catherine Ponder, Louise Hay, [[ASIN:0062508970 Emmet Fox]] and Frederick Bailes. Joseph Murphy's books on cultivating a consciousness of prosperity are very helpful too.
B000002LGA|5.0|This is one of Lou's best albums to date.  I was just thrilled to get it on CD.  He has a lot to say and does it very well lyrically and also melodically.  This isn't your \\"typical\\" Lou Reed album at all.  If you're looking for something that rocks, yet takes a stand on many subjects, this album is for you.  Enjoy!
0156027321|5.0|Nothing else needs to be said about the tome (another one coming?), except from a personal viewpoint.  It was an excellent book, well-written with a great adventure and plenty of action and a wonderful plot.  Buy it and enjoy.  I did, as a dozen of my friends did also, and I won't disclose what happens to the tiger.
B000WC3AKI|4.0|This was my favorite movie when I was in Middle School.  It still is a great movie I was glad to wait for the special edition dvd.  When I was younger I was interested in becoming a storm chaser so this was quite a film.  Now that I am older I think there are still some flaws with the movie, but that is ok.  The movie was made for fun not for great writing.  Some of the words storm chasers use people would not be familiar with, but I suggest people who want to learn more about weather go to the library.  Anyway if you are looking for a film with great special effects this is the one.
0767853636|5.0|My strongest recommendation: IGNORE critiques which pan this adorable production. Perhaps because this movie manages to be vastly entertaining without resorting to the talentless substitute for creativity we so often see in movies today, and uses humor, drama, a little pathos, capitalizes on the massively personable talents of its fabulous cast, includes many great musical performances, and finds no need to resort in desperation to filth or disgusting images, and even (woohoo!) respects normal standards of decency (rather than \\"pushing the limits,\\" as panderers of the vile and disgusting like to call it); perhaps because it is simply wonderful, uplifting, warm, and satisfying entertainment, it doesn't meet the ugliness standards of the more \\"enlightened.\\" Forget them. Buy this wonderful movie and enjoy it over and over again.
0802130208|5.0|this book is so original, hilarious, at times a little heartbreaking just because you can feel the character's raw emotions. so well done, a must read
0684857219|5.0|This book is excellent for aspiring bodybuilders who wish to get a foundation started.  Some of the techniques and methods are outdated or no longer used, but it's mainly only the abs being everyday.

3836503050|5.0|For whatever reasons, I can't help but turn my head to get a gander of a pinup gal. When I saw this book in the bargain section at Barnes and Noble I was kind of skeptical, but upon gazing at this beautifully crafted ladies, I was hooked.     Gil Elvgren has an amazing eye for creating this very sensual and incredibly tasteful, including the nudes, pinup ladies that if I had a plane I'd proudly display on the nose. Very inspiring work to boot, for a while I was giving thought to creating my own pinups, I wonder why I stopped... lol.    Anyway, any fan of pinup girls definitely needs this book.:)

B0025KVLUQ|4.0|Being a Beatles fan since I can remember buying my first 45 RPM record of \\"She Loves You\\" ( for yes .75!). I feel that with the some 1000 reviews on this this subject of the \\"Digital\\"  series Masterpieces, yes I was also the first to stand in line to purchase these Cd's. To be quite honest also having read too many reviews so far of this Mono vs Digital conflict,being as \\"True Beatles\\" fan to accept the mono in true fashion form or accepting the digital mix. I think Apple Corp. said \\"hey wait a minute, we are going to launch this new video game out on 09-09-09,  why not make the whole catalog into digital?\\" And so they did.The magazine articles of the new Beatles Cd's were astounding and some what two sided. Like I said you were either on the line of that True Beatle (mono) or that \\"PC society\\" that always strives for every crisp noise being evaluated into \\"the new sound\\". Sounds like it really was not this great music of The Beatles at all, just maybe another scheme ,another money maker. I don't know. I do know that I am a 30 years plus musician and took this digital CD of Abbey Road to my studio that I do my own recordings and sometimes do TV commercials. I actually compared the two versions on a Music level. Of course you  think that I dissected the two. But I found out a lot about taking a mono recording and how they make this into a digital sound. So after spending some 5 hours with the sound engineer of the studio, we came to this conclusion. The original sound(mono) was the better sounding. The digital recording Cd had ,yes more things that you could hear ,that you could not hear on the mono. But when you hear these perfect harmonies that they produced on mono it read on the \\"meters\\" as a very rich sounding texture. On the digital CD playing the some songs \\"back to back\\". The digital harmonies were actually stressed to the point of \\"being in the red\\" on a 64 digital track board. It was as if the sound was being pulled  or stretched out on the high point or most beautiful point . It was distorted on  a sound meter ( the engineers $3,000 studio digital monitors) We were quite shocked that it really ruined the beauty of the song........ Time and time again each piece was compared( i could not stop at this). The perfect example was \\"Because\\". On mono there were perfect harmonies with a smooth rich tone. The Digital version of the same exact song \\"peaked out\\" causing distortion in these digital monitors. I could not believe my ears. After every harmony of the four Beatles singing together we experienced this distorted sound. You may say that I reviewed this too hard,but it was something that I stumbled on listening through my Klipsch speakers,then wanting to hear it again through my very expensive headphones. So you be the judge of what you want in these Beatle series. I have read the articles from many magazines and now I went to the studios. The video game is just wonderful,by the way. I went to Barnes and Noble,they had everything from the official Beatles T-shirt to the new Beatles Trivia Game. Amazing.we have now completed that circle of going to the 60's and back again in 2009.
1401216676|4.0|I got this book after hearing all about it. Every Joker fan I've encountered has told me that this was the greatest Joker story ever told. I'm a huge fan of the Joker and his character, but I will say I was quite dissapointed.<br /><br />The story itself, it does have quite a shocking beginning, and it also gives you a look at what the Joker remembers to be his \\"creation\\", not only from the physical aspect but from the mental of the evil sadistic genius. Besides that the story is dull...it flat out did not have me entertained.<br /><br />The artwork is amazing from front to back and is definitly the highlight of this book.<br /><br />Anyone who's a Joker fan should try and pick one up if they have a collection...as for the casual fan, I suggest trying to find a copy to just read (very short read obviously) and leave it at that.
B0001GL3K4|1.0|What I saw of the movie, I liked - however, the DVD had a flaw in it, so wasn't able to watch the whole movie.

B00164GDD2|5.0|if you are looking at this movie on blu-ray you have probably seen it and know how great the movie is and if not where have u been in the last 20 years.  the upscale to blu-ray is great! the colors are so much more vibrant and clean.  everything just looks better! as far as the sound goes, i don't own a huge system so i cant tell you about the sound upscale, but the picture is wonderful.  A must own if you enjoy this move! worth the money!
B001CGJ3QS|5.0|This is a collection of absolutely outstanding performances of beautiful piano sonatas!  The compositions are played with superb skill by pianist Kempff.  If you like Beethoven Sonatas you definitely will love listening over and over to these renditions.
1401309666|4.0|More than a little repetitive, probably only needed two/three chapters to make the main points and then other chapters to round out the points with so many examples. Worthwhile.

B001TH16DS|5.0|Haven't owned any Star Trek episodes since I bought a few favorites on VHS 15 years ago.  Love watching these in High Defintion and with the enhanced effects.  Can't wait until Season 2.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Pure \\"Who\\" - the only problem with this set is that there aren't twice as many episodes. Tennant is the best Doctor since Tom Baker. And the world would have been a poorer place without Donna, the everywoman with a heart of gold and an attitude that'd take paint off a building at 50 yards. This set is a \\"must have\\" for any fan.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I had heard over the years the story of the phantom of the opera, and I was aware of the older version of the film starring, I believe, Lon Chaney, but I had never taken much interest in it.  Not that I don't enjoy some musicals, I have never thought of musicals as the kind of serious film that interests me.  I was introduced to this musical version of The Phantom of the Opera by my daughter, who rented it at a video store and invited me to watch it.  The opening scene of the film creates such a wonderful nostalgia, Emily Rossum is as lovely in her part as she is superb in her singing, and the story itself goes deep into the human psyche.  I don't own very many films, but this one so impressed me that I bought it to own it and share it with friends.  I have seen so many films I have forgotten many of them, but this one to me was unforgettable.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Great Movie.  The directors commentary is a great addition to the movie.  The ability to re-create the era, period, is exceptional.  The premise of the movie is an interesting one.  I rarely watch a movie more than once....after I watch them they get a home in my Mother's collection of movies.  This movie, however, I have watched several times and will remain in my collection....a collection of one, so far.
0307394549|2.0|This book was disappointing because there did not seem to be new recipes. I have seen most of these recipes before and you can get them online. Not worth the money.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I've watched the 3 seasons that are on syfy.  I purchased the DVD's for my Mother's collection.  She enjoys the series as well.  The premise of the series is fun and interesting.  Is it possible that a town like this really does exist...?  Lighthearted and sort of dramatic, at times.  Typical of syfy.  Why did Sci Fi change to syfy, anyway...??

0061440795|5.0|Sagan presents a kind of deep awareness of the female psyche, in youth and in age. Truly a pleasure to read and engage with.
B000VSBX34|4.0|I waited for a long time to get this DVD, not wanting to get a bootleg copy or pay a ridiculous mark-up on a copy someone wanted to flip. I saw this movie in a theatre in Biloxi, Mississippi in 1965 and thought it was hilarious at the time. The remastering is first rate and it was a joy to see it again. It's the kind of movie you have to listen to in order to catch all the dry humor. Of course, the album songs are true Beatles, and have a sound all their own. I know I'll watch it many times and I'm glad it's now in my video library.

031606792X|1.0|I now understand why Robert Pattinson (Edward) doesn't want to star in the 4th movie...it can only be described as a train wreck.    If you loved the first three Twilight books, fight the urge to read Book 4.  I am only half way through it and each page is painful to read.  I'm not sure what Meyers was thinking when she wrote this, but she completely ruined my favorite character, Jacob, and turned him into a pathetic babysitter.  The whole 'Renesme' storyline is sickening and once I realized Bella was pregnant with 'a monster' it pretty much ruined the rest of the series for me.  Bella is the most narcissistic character I think I've ever seen.  There is no character development in this book and small revelations like 'Oh, btw, Bella didn't really need Jacob - it was the baby creating those feelings of wanting' are lame.  I'm still not sure if I will finish the book or not, but reading the other reviews I think most fans were as disappointed as me.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|i enjoyed the movie for the story it told... if u bought the movie, i assume you've read the book or at least Atlas Shrugged and you know the author's feelings on Objectivism... considering when the film was produced, i must say that i think the director did a fantastic job illustrating Ayn Rand's work... i did enjoy it... I cant wait till Atlas Shrugged is made into a movie
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I have SB 600 that I find very easy to use.  This is not a replacement to my old flash but an addition to my lighting system.  I am still learning to use this flash but so far no complains with the unit.  Love it.
0375413405|5.0|This is by and far the best cookbook I have ever owned.  If you only own one cookbook, this should be it!
B0000047BA|5.0|The Hook is as rural as dirt roads and bare feet, Miles as city as charred brick and a rusty fire escape. Who'd think that Hook's blues and boogie-woogie combined with Miles' caressing jazz could be anything other than oil & water? Surprise, this was the result. It's been on my heavy rotation at home for weeks.
0061537969|5.0|Of the reviews I skimmed before writing this, I noticed many people seemed to feel the need to say whether they were a \\"dog lover\\" or not.  I think that misses the point of this beautifully drawn little book.<br /><br />The lead character IS a dog, and he is the narrator.  But this is not a \\"cute\\" or \\"touching\\" dog story.  It is the story  of a family in which the dog, Enzo, happens to live.  He narrates their story which is intertwined with his life story.  The story--the plot--has been criticized, but this book is much more than the plot.<br /><br />Enzo, the dog, is real and believable lead character.  His musings on the world; his dream of being recincarnated as a man; his memories of puppyhood and his mother \\"I don't think she liked us much\\" are right on target.  Funny, dry, insightful.<br /><br />Many of Enzo's repeated sayings: \\"the car goes where the eyes go\\" and others are zen-like in their simplicity and at the same time their depth.  They express the obvious and the superficial but also point out truths about Enzo's life, and life in general.<br /><br />I don't mean to make this book sound like \\"the Last Lecture\\" (nothing against that book!) or, as someone said, \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\"...its a really good book, it keeps your interest.  Its not preachy, not trying to convince you of anthing of sell you anything.  Its about a dog and the family he loves.<br /><br />By far the best fiction book I've read in a couple of years.  Highly recommended whether you like dogs or not.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Finally, Beatles CD's I can appreciate!    Finding a way to approximate the warmth and feel of the original records has been a struggle for over 20 years.  With the advances in technology over the years, Capitol-EMI have finally succeeded.  Although a few tracks here and there aren't quite right, as a whole this is the best set of digital Beatles albums that has ever been on the market.  Sharper vocals, superior bass, and warm-sounding (not-tinny) treble make this collection the Beatles album set for the 21st century.    Original stereo mixes that have been unavailable since about 1990 show up again here.  Nothing has been monkeyed with or distorted.  Play these CD's through speakers or headphones; they'll sound as great as the Beatles intended them to.  The packaging is top-notch, too.  The true enthusiast will want to grab the mono set, too.

B000FS9MV0|5.0|Forget her age, it's not an issue.  Renee knows how to entertain.  She is at her best in an up-tempo style and this CD suits her to a  tee.  I keep it in my CD player in the car and listen to it very  often.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|CALIGULA SPEAKS FOR IT'S SELF.  WHEN I BOUGHT THIS MOVIE, I HAD KNOW IDEA OF THE SURPISES THAT AWAITED ME.  I SEEN THE EDIT VERSION OF CALIGULA.  BUT WHEN I SEEN THE UNRATED VERSION, FOR THE 70'S I WAS SHOCKED AT ALL THE REAL SEX THAT WENT INTO MAKING THIS MOVIE.  \\"I MEAN REAL\\".  I LIKED THE MOVIE A LOT.  NOT SURE IF ALL THEY TOLD WAS TRUE OR NOT.  IF IT WAS TRUE THEN, THOSE WERE SOME REALLY SICK DEMENTED TWISTED CREATURES BACK THEN.  FROM THE BEGINNING, THE LOOK ON MALCOLM MCDOWELL'S FACE/CALIGULA, WAS A LOOK WHERE HE COULDN'T WAIT TO BE EMPERIOR. HE WAS CRAZY.  THE MOVIE'S LIKE A ROLLER COASTER RIDE.  I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE ENDING THOUGH.  IT JUST HAPPENED SO QUICK. I MEAN AFTER ALL YOU WENT THROUGH IN THE MOVIE.  THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER BUILD UP TO CALIGULA'S DEATH!  HMMM...
B00006J3WH|5.0|It was a long shot but it worked. Throwing a musical episode in the middle of a drama/comedy series was a huge risk! But anyone who's seen the episode would be glad the vocals are on cd! Spike / Buffy combo is awesome.
0823015033|4.0|I bought this book because it looked like it would be perfect to use as a guide for creating polymer clay fairy figures. As a novice sculptor, it seemed to be the perfect choice, and the directions looked like they would be easy to follow, but actually turned out to be more complex in practice, particularly in how to construct the basic armature. This is probably a better book for the more advanced sculptor.
B000K7VHH8|5.0|Had seen the movie previously and really liked it but couldn't remember the name.  Any movie with Sir Mr. Connery in it is great.
B000005HFH|5.0|I first saw/heard Chet Baker many years ago and became an instant fan.  His soft voice, his skill with the horn, and his good looks -- mesmerized everyone.  He began to get noticed more and more and he was one of the greats of jazz a while back.  He died an early tragic death.  Buy this album or any of his albums as well as those he joined in on and you will be taken back to the years of jazz at its finest.
B0000041XX|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this cd.  Truly a classic and one everyone who enjoys opera should have.
B00005QGAX|5.0|We originally ordered this CD, BAD, from another company.  After two weeks, the item still hadn't shipped even though they had charged me for it.  I cancelled the order and reordered BAD from this vendor.  I received the CD in less than a week and my wife and I are extremely pleased with the CD.  We got excellent service, a wonderful CD, and at a good price.  Thanks AMAZON.
B00284BMBM|3.0|Really not that great. Bought it with high expectations after all the hits on the first album, and maybe it'll grow on me, but I haven't been listening to Leave This Town as much as I thought I would.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Bear McCreary did a wonderful job on this music.  It is a true compliment to the brilliant writing of the show as well as to the superb acting.
078322737X|5.0|Our favorite movie depicting the time that we were teenagers. Cruising, the drive-in, all of it.  Love it.
0316017922|5.0|This is the perfect book to read when you're feeling like everyone around you is able to make things happen in your life and you can't. I appreciate the research Mr. Gladwell did to show how success doesn't happen by accident. As much as we may want things to come easy, extraordinary things come from practice, discipline and unwavering belief. This book was truly inspirational.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|The Blu0ray version is beautiful and I had forgotten how good this movie was. Hope \\"lazy\\" Hollywood doesn't EVER do a remake of this one
B000SQJ2JG|4.0|I love this album but the original LP always sounded compressed and remastering has done little to help except boost the frequency extremes. No real dynamics, Coverdale sounding like he's singing from another room but I guess we're stuck with this. Tommy Bolin in good form here, the band were always top class musicians but you can tell lots of these songs were written quickly and never really developed fully. The funkier side of DP is fine by me, these guys could really mix it up (Gettin' Tighter remains a real gem) and it captures a time in rock music that's now gone forever but the recording really does not do the band justice -- it is hard to know why given the producer, the money involved and the studio. Let's hope someday the regular DP remastering process involving the band catches up with this release -- there's got to be better tapes out there somewhere.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|i enjoyed this season of dexter. gave many twists and brought new light to dexter's life.  However i do believe that out of the 3 seasons that are out on dvd this is my least favorite.  all in all this was a good season but deff. not as good as its predacessors.
B000002ADT|4.0|It is hard to fault something so obviously influential and well put together, but than again it's also hard not to hear what this blueprint established in thousands of recordings to follow, becoming lightly numb to it structurally, despite much warmth in the chemistry. KOB rightfully stands as a sort of ideal sound in lightly swinging, classic Jazz, but must be used sporadically for the most resonant effect.
6304884419|5.0|Adapted from Chazz Palmentieri's ground-breaking one-man Broadway show (which thankfully went back on tour this year), the film version of \\"A Bronx Tale\\" brings the 17 characters Palmentieri portrayed onstage to vivid and compassionate life. In his debut as a director, Robert DeNiro shows an actor's sense of creating by using a very light director's touch, and allowing his cast and the script (also by Palmentieri) to take center stage.    The film takes one breif incident from the author's childhood and shows how his environment, sensibilities, parental guidence and the experiences of his contemporaries frame that incident and shape his future. A must-see for all.
B00004TH6O|3.0|3 1/2    May not be their most polished, hardest-hitting effort, but the sophomore release druggy rock still holds up well as a whole, with plenty of diverse inspiration falling through the hazily distorted cracks of stoner garage anthems.
B000N6U0EC|5.0|It didn't get great reviews because of the plausibility of the story and the acting, but this is just a movie that you can enjoy with the family to unwind. Great feel-good story, don't worry about the acting and story plausibility. It's just a movie.
B000BCE918|5.0|its cheap its good and it has the three of the jurassic park movies. they are good movies what can i say?
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A very cleverly written story from the eyes of a canine companion.  Starts off as a whimsical tale of a dog's take on the daily happenings of his master and family as they face what most average young families face when trying to decide between living their dreams and accepting reality. The story quickly turns into a tale of dealing with tragedy, including a spouse's and parent's worst nightmare, and how our decisions can change our fate.  Throughout the tale, Enzo the dog provides his unique commentary on the world, as shaped through his incessant love of television, and proves to be the stable influence that reminds his master to never give up.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|Is it possible to be entertained by a movie and dislike it at the same time? This is the paradox I face immediately after watching the re-telling of \\"Star Trek\\". I know I will be accused of being a curmudgeonly Trekkie who is afraid of change, but I would dispute that. There are definitely some things to like about this movie. The casting, which is the key to doing an origin movie of a long-loved franchise series, was excellent. Pine and Quinto were wonderful choices; Zoe Saldana shines as Uhura. The main characters for the most part were interesting, compelling and well written. Kirk was believable as the brash young rebel, Spock intriguing as the young man caught between two diametrically opposed cultures, fighting to find his own identity.  The only character from the original crew I didn't completely buy into was Scotty, and perhaps I would have had he been introduced earlier in the film and had more of a part rather than being thrown in towards the end. The fact that Chekov was a 17 year-old lieutenant piloting the Federation's premier flagship was a little more than unbelievable, but I didn't mind his youthful, somewhat misdirected eagerness as much as a few did. Sulu didn't have much of a part, perhaps his character will be explored more in coming films. Bones has none of his down-home charm or Southern accent, which added to his character in the series, and you really don't get a good feel for why he and Jim are friends, you just go with it. But you enjoy watching these people, you find you eagerly await the next tidbit in their character development (although Spock's love story leaves a lot of questions.) You love seeing the characters you've grown up with, known and loved over the years meet and interact for the first times.    The fact that the movie got these important elements right gives those at the helm of this production no excuse for getting the rest so wrong. The plot is an absolute Swiss cheese sliced mess, weak and full of holes. The way the crew was thrown together was too much of a contrivance. The villain, a crucial element in any drama, is vastly underwritten and hardly seems a worthy adversary to the Federation or our heroes. While you are told why he is undertaking his vendetta against the Federation, you get absolutely no insight into his personality that would provide even the smallest of clues as to what would drive him to such extremes or how he could maintain such a cult of personality over his crew that they would follow him without question on his murderous crusade. Eric Bana is completely wasted in this role. Apparently he was so thrilled to get the part of the villain in the new mega-Trek film that he forgot to read the script. Either that or he just wanted to cash a check; the part wasn't worth his time. Nero, a Romulan, isn't even a military leader, he's an industrial miner on a rogue mission of revenge not endorsed or even known by the Romulan government. Perhaps the writers thought some of the magic of Khan's one-man revenge plot in Wrath of Khan would rub off on their effort; the allusion to Khan is made blatantly obvious when Nero puts the same brain-burrowing bug in Captain Pike's head as Khan did to Chekov to gain information on Genesis Project in \\"Wrath\\". The storyline that worked so well in the second Star Trek movie, however, did not pan out in this one.    While moviegoers often have to check their credulity at the door, the film too often crosses the line of believability. How Nero's planet-killing weapon is ultimately defeated is so simplistic it makes you wonder why Captain Pike ordered Kirk and Sulu's hair-raising (failed) attempt at it in the first place. A few well-placed tracer rounds from a one-man craft were all that were needed. When Nero's ship threatens Earth, most of the fleet is conveniently off in some other part of the galaxy so the cadets of Star Fleet Academy are rushed to confront it. Just lucky for us Star Fleet had another fully-armed and ready fleet of ships, sitting around doing nothing, including its top-of-the-line ship Enterprise. How a Romulan miner obtained the ability to destroy planets must have just gone over my head; considering how dull and vapid the Nero character was, perhaps I dozed for a second and missed it. And neither Vulcan nor Earth had any secondary line of defense to repel Nero; once the fleet was destroyed, Earth was just a sitting duck.     When Spock accuses Kirk of mutiny he shoots him off the ship in an escape pod near a Federation outpost on a planet near Vulcan. When attacked by a large native-dwelling creature (that looked suspiciously a lot like one of the creatures from the execution/Jedi showdown scene in Attack of the Clones) he just happens to find refuge in a cave inhabited by a character familiar to all Trek fans who rescues him, explains who Nero is and why he's on the rampage, and tells him what to do next. On the whole planet, Kirk stumbles into that one cave. Just lucky, huh? At the end of the film, Kirk, due to his heroics, is vaulted from a disgraced cadet on suspension to Captain of the best ship in the fleet. Besides the fact that no military organization worth its salt would place an unseasoned albeit valorous tyro in such an important position, passing over vets who've proven themselves through years of service, if you thought the Shatner Kirk was brash and impulsive, consider how spoiled and reckless this Kirk will be without the seasoning and experience gained through climbing up the ladder from the bottom. It takes more than heroics to command, it takes experience and temperament, which the new Kirk has as yet shown none of. Such examples are littered throughout the movie and just push believability too far.    Another problem with the movie is that it doesn't just reinvent the origins of Star Trek as we know from the get-go and go with it, it actually reinvents the origins while the movie is playing. It accomplishes this through the time-tested (or is that time-worn) device of time travel. While many of the best Trek stories have involved time travel, they've gone to the well with this so many times they may have just made one trip too many. The changes are so drastic, such as to the status of the Vulcans in the Federation that I thought during the movie that they would have to make another movie just to go back in time and fix everything. Upon reflection, I don't think they will, as that will alienate the brand new fans and make the old-timers accuse them of a cop-out. It makes one wonder whether the producers and writers had any idea of where to take things in future movies; if they did have an idea, it makes one shudder to think where they will actually go with it.    My advice is, go see this movie and enjoy it for all of its good qualities and fun. If you are new to Trekdom, you'll enjoy the humor, the characters and the fast-paced action. If you are a Trek veteran, you'll be giddy seeing the old crew come together and establish relationships for the first time. But don't be surprised if after you leave the theater or hit the stop button on your remote you scratch your head and wonder why you actually liked it. It's a `cotton-candy' movie-tastes good, but not very filling. To me, it's nothing more than a summer romance. It feels great while it lasts, but there's just not enough there for a meaningful relationship.
B000AQBAUI|5.0|Peso setentista. Primeiras aparições do vocalista Pete French, depois Atomic Rooster e Cactus.<br />Paulada ponta a ponta. Altamente recomendado.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Nicole Kidman is awesome. I learned a little bit about Australia,  Aborigines and \\"the lost generation\\". Very interesting.
B000YOWEBK|5.0|This miniseries is a superb retelling, on film, of the magnificent novel by D.H. Lawrence, which was banned from his homeland, Britain, and the United States, for thirty years.  A few changes were made in the plot, as the ending of the book is a long letter by the \\"lover,\\" which was not deemed dramatic enough for a film. Also, the place Connie vacationed was changed from Venice to some unidentified European beach, filled with sunshine, unlike the drab Midlands which was the main setting.    Almost every actor personifies to perfection the characters in the book, but the one most exactly like the novel is the actress who plays Mrs. Bolton, the nurse. Clifford Chatterley (James Wilby),his wife Connie (Joely Richardson), and the Gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors (Sean Bean) are excellent as the main characters. I didn't think all the changes were necessary, but they were minor compared with the over-dramatized ending.    It is impossible for any movie to capture the essence of Lawrence's philosophy, his hatred of modern life and the industrialism that casts a blight on almost all of nature and humanity. In contrast, the \\"natural man,\\" portrayed by the sensual, iconoclastic Mellors, is one of the last, best hopes for spiritual survival. For Lawrence,sex was a sacred thing, so it is doubly ironic that this marvelous work has been banned for so long due to a few Anglo-Saxon words and unequalled descriptions of female sexuality.  My advice is to see this beautiful film and then read or re-read an unexpurgated copy of \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover.\\"  (Some parts of the film were taken from earlier versions of this infamous novel, which I have also read, \\"The First Lady Chatterley\\" and \\"John Thomas and Lady Jane.\\")
0517543052|4.0|At first when I started reading this book, I was disappointed.  In the middle are many pages illustrated opposite each other like fold outs, with strange pictures and some big or little scrawling words; they reminded me of psychedelic posters from the '60's hippie era. The book just seemed a little strange.  Then one night I was leafing through it and some of the poster messages really helped me get through some challenging moments.  Sometimes I find myself reading the illustrated messages when I need a pick me up to remind me that This too Shall Pass, or that we must Come as Little Children, or maybe a Buddhist version of those kinds of thoughts.  I really love this book now that I have stuck with it or it has stuck with me on my bedside table. I have realized that it is a book full of wisdom--all three parts, the narrative part at the beginning, the poster part in the middle and the ingredients part at the end.  Remember, Be Here Now is a very helpful tool to remind me to live in the present moment and not worry about necessarily finding something in life because whatever I need will be led to me once I'm ready.  I haven't finished it yet, but that's the kind of book it is.  I may never finish it.  Instead,  I feel very free to leaf around as I wish. Each time I read some of it I come up with a tidbit that is very tasty to my soul.
B0027CSNBM|5.0|Loved the book. The shipping took no more than two days which was great. Thanks again for such an easy transaction.
B002BSHXJA|4.0|it's a matter of budget.  if u have the $240 to $300+ to spend on this, it's a nice set to have & play with.  The sound is great & the lp replicas are beautiful.  but if money is tight, i'd get the 2 Capitol boxes for the mono versions of the early lps, PPM thru Rubber Soul.  You can get the Capitol boxes for $100 or less for both.  I think the Capitol mono versions sound identical to this new set, even though some say theyre fake mono or just fold downs of the stereo.    i think only PPM, With the Bs, & Rubber Soul are the only necessary mono lps to have to replace the stereo cds because of the awful ping pong, voice in only one channel in the stereo mixes of those 3.  (of course, PPM & With the BS are replaced with Early Bs, Meet the Bs & Bs 2nd Album.)  I think the subtle differences of the mono versions of the rest of the lps are mildly interesting but not essential.  Overall, i prefer the spaciousness of stereo.
0316044938|2.0|The first half was interesting so even when it started to drag in the middle I kept with it thinking it was going to pick up again.  It never did.    **spoiler alert**  ****************  Not only was the second half of the book tough, but how she \\"takes care\\" of the bad guy made me feel cheated.  Part of sticking with the book was about finding out what happened to him.  I couldn't believe I read the entire book. It was so frustrating to drag myself through whole thing, that the author had just barely strung me along and wasted my time.  I promised myself to not read another release by Alice Sebold (unless she does some major growth as a writer).  This may sound like a contradiction, but it could be a good movie, because the overall story line is good.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|this was the first time i've ever watched a movie the day i got it in the mail.<br /><br />it is as it was described. I got it about two weeks ago possibly three and it's a wonderful movie and I always exp[ect great service from [...] as i plan to order from them again in the future.<br /><br />I ordered this move because my mother recommended it and I agree it;s a wonderful movie and anyone who loves ALan Alda's work on ER, MASH and 30 Rock will love this movie because it shows how great an actor Alan Alda is.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I enjoyed it as I enjoy any chick flick. I find them entertaining, but don't take them very seriously as great movie-making. The second time I saw it, I was stunned by the perfection of it. As a big fan of old romantic comedies, I then saw the similarity of movie-making in the old days. The acting is splendid from this perspective and the story delightful. It is a great movie in the tradition of the old Cary Grant type genre. Tonight it is on and I am enjoying it for a third time. It is rare that a modern movie can capture the old movie-making days as well.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Como fanático de los Beatles, la remasterización completa del catálogo, era algo que esperaba desde que me desilusioné al comprar los CD con la digitalización del 87. Ésta remasterización ha sido el digno trato que necesitaba la música del mejor grupo de la historia. El único \\"negrito en el arroz\\" es el empaque. Desde que se anució la caja con todos los CD's y que la compré en pre-venta, me esperaba algo extra para aquellos que decidimos comprar todos los discos de golpe. La gran desilusión vino cuando vi que lo mejor de esta caja, son los listones para sacar los CD's. No le hubiera pasado nada a Apple si agregara una playera, un poster o algo para los que decididos gastar tanto. Como sea, la muscia está sobre toda queja y en verdad el sonido es cálido, prístino y justo. Fan o no, cómpralo, vale la pena el gasto.
0743571975|5.0|This audio book is great.  I listen to it over and over and learn something new every time.  I bought it after listening to \\"The Secret\\" and wanted to take my business and my life to the next level.  It really helps get the negative self talk out of your head and focus on having a successful future.  I highly recommend it.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Coraline is outstanding!  The story, by award-winning writer Neil Gaiman is charming where it needs to be, and ominous and creepy where it needs that. This film is the pinnacle of the almost-lost art of stop-motion animation. Not only are the animators able to explore fantastical effects, but they also manage to make the characters truly expressive.  The voice acting complements the onscreen action exceedingly well. Lastly, the picture quality on Blu-Ray is literally flawless; I watched it in 1080p, and there is not a single frame that isn't perfect.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is my favorite form of therapy-a heaping dose of the Gilmore Girls!  Awesome acting, perfect timing, beautiful scenery, playful banter, can't get too much Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel!  Oh, yes, the best part?  Scott Patterson, the hidden secret to the whole show! Yummy!
1433503808|4.0|Great helps in this bible.  Very thorough.  But it's a 'formal equivalence\\" translation and so might be difficult for those whose English is not as good.  NLT is about 6th grade level; NIV is about 7th grade level; ESV would be about 10th grade level English.  Great for Bible study focusing on word meanings.

B000ZNRBK4|4.0|Pretty much what I would expect from Nikon. The hood fits great and does cut down on some glare. The hood fits on both ways, but when in \\"travel mode\\", the hood slides around instead of grabbing onto the focus ring so it makes manual focusing difficult sometimes.
B000YABYLA|1.0|I'll keep it short.    Juno is really a 30 yr. old midget.  Her parents are clueless and dumber than dirt, but in a \\"nice way\\".  Boyfriend is gay, but doesn't know it yet.  Husband is a eunuch.  Wife is dominatrix.    At least this is my impression of the characters. I could be wrong.

B0028K3192|1.0|Got this last week and ... still cant believe this is the same bloke from Embrya! I'm sorry but this album sounds like something produced by some 2nd rate R&B newbie, desperately lacking soul... an academic jazz effort at best. Where's Maxwell's sureal falsetto, the complex layers of horns, synth and riffs, the liquid emotion & butter smooth lyrics? Defo not here. Someone needs to slap that boy back to his roots!!!

Donna Reed as a young girl........ what a dream !!)       (Much like the woman I married :) )  2) Gone With the Wind - Scarlette my love !  .  Life is very hard and painful for a lot of people in the US today  and because the US middle class has been gutted they have no money  to buy the things developing countries make and the crisis   is worse in those countries as a result.  .  However, there is always having faith in God as a choice (yes or no).  It's always a choice......... essentially \\"to be\\"  or.....   \\"not to be\\".  These are the same choice.  When we have nothing else but faith which enables the possibility of hope  then we have nothing else and nothing else.  .  It's that simple.  .
B0000CGV00|5.0|While born in France, pianist Helene Grimaud is compleley at home in the Germanic culture and repertoire of Bach and Beethoven having lived there for years (now residing in USA).  Her Bach disc of 2008 is a compelling display of her wide pallete but with a gravitas required of any good Bach playing.      Here on her earlier \\"Credo,\\" Ms. Grimaud brings to life Beethoven's famous \\"Tempest\\" with an ear-catching artistry.  One thing you will hear immediately is a fabulous clarity of textures that jumps out of the speakers and a fluidity of tempo that seems just right.  While I love Brendel's version of the Tempest, Grimaud's reading always stirs me.      The other piece written by Beethoven here is a rather unique creation (piano concerto/choral fantasy) while the other fantasy piece by American composure Corigliano is as vivacious as it is mysterious.  Grimaud brings it to life with a freedom that allows its fantasy aspects to permeate.  As far as Arvo Part, I cannot offer much opinion as its just not my thing at this time.    This is a fine disc by an impressive pianist recorded in beatutiful, powerful sound that displays really crisp and clear piano textures that add to the experiece.  Also be sure to check out Grimaud's 2008 Bach recording as it may well be her best to date.

B00278U1W0|5.0|I wanted so badly to go see Clapton and Winwood when they came to Los Angeles but the good tickets were about $500 and none of my friends wanted to pay that much so I bought the DVD instead.  I must tell you that both of them are the consummate musicians.  Two of my all time favorites and they didn't disappoint. I loved the concert and it was the next best thing to being there.  I can play it over and over and it never gets old. My only criticism is that when Clapton was doing his amazing guitar riffs the camera wasn't always on him or it was at an angle where you couldn't see his amazing finger work.  Other than that I give it a 10.
B000AWYOG4|5.0|I'd been looking for this movie for awhile.  Wal-mart, Target, etc.  No one had it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, used, for only $2.99!<br /><br />The DVD arrived quickly and nicely packaged.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|The movie inspires hope where society as a whole is stuck in the box controled by goverment and or the church. If you have had any spiritual awakening what is in this movie is very possiable. Very inspiring.
032147404X|5.0|This is the best book on Digital Photography I have ever read.  Usually most books of this type are so full of technical stuff I don't understand that it bogs me down and I quit reading the book.  Scott Kelby writes this as though he is standing next to you explaining in laymans terms how to do things with your digital camera. I only have his first book and I have learned so much from him.  It's easy to read and interspersed with humor. He is easy to understand and I can't wait to purchase his other 2 books.  Check out Scott's books, you won't be disappointed.
1596680296|5.0|I am an intermediate/advanced knitter who has been knitting socks for many years.  So why did I buy Ann Budd's new sock book?  Because even an \\"old dog\\" can learn new tricks!  And I did!      The book is well organized and full of info that any sock knitter can benefit from.  Ann writes in a friendly, clear way which is helpful for new knitters and experienced knitters, alike.  The variety of yarn gauges lets you choose the yarn that best meets YOUR need. And there are many pattern stitches to inspire every knitter into casting on another pair!      The hard-bound copy is colorful and should last a very long time in my library.  It is a bit heavy to put in my knitting bag, but will make working copies of needed pages as I work on the newest pair.  I have a long list of SOCKS TO KNIT from this book!
B000A2W8RG|5.0|This is a great adaption of the book.  It still holds up today.  Costumes, sets and acting all great.  Especially the performance by Sting.  Wish he would do more acting.  I really liked the remake of the story the made for TV one with William Hurt, but this film still is the top for me.  Well worth the price, and something you can see over and over again.
B001LMAK88|5.0|I love this movie. It is packed with great stars. Just enough action and the story line is good. I would definitely purchase it again. To me I would'nt mind watching this movie more than once. I'll probably watch it again in a few months. It is a keeper.
0061767581|2.0|I am an adult who enjoys reading YA and I have found that the offerings out there today are absolutely wonderful.  However, unfortunately, L.A. Candy is not one of them.<br /><br />I actually have no idea (or had) who Lauren Conrad was so I pretty well started reading this one with no pre conceived ideas.  However, it quickly became apparent to me that the writing in this book is extremely immature (I cringed everytime the two main characters mentioned going out to pick up *boys*) made me feel as though I was in high school and we were giggling behind a locker at some of the *boys* going by.  Come on, at some point, they stop being boys and become men.<br /><br />Although I liked the friendship between the two main characters, I just could not get pass the immature and generic writing of this one.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|\\"Hear that?  That's Jane Austen spinning in her grave!\\", is my favorite line in this movie.  I am the first person to say that I love Jane Austen and her stories. My favorite would be Pride and Prejudice.  Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are wonderful.  I thought this movie was great.  I would be so lucky and to be trapped in Mr. Darcy's world.  This movie does a funny take of the famous story of Pride and Prejudice.  I like the part that everyone was happy in the end.  And for once Mr. Wickham was not the bad guy.  I would tell anyone that is an Austen fan to watch this movie.
0525950079|4.0|I have a prohibition against reading fat books. \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" was an exception. Now \\"World Without End\\" is on my hearth. I'm halfway through and have been able to put it down. I couldn't stop reading \\"Pillars\\" but \\"World\\" is a good read, too.
B000G8NXZK|5.0|The first time I watched this video was during a tour in Afghanistan and I saw the cover and my intrest was peaked. I enjoy watching a wide range of movies. After watching for the first time Brazil instantly jumped to one of my top 10 all time favorites. If you are the type of person who only watches blockbusters then don't watch this movie and comlain about it. This movie is for someone that knows a great movie when they see it. But for everyone else watch this movie and enjoy it. watch the Love Conquers All edition first so you can see how bad movie studios butcher films when you sit down and watch the Directer's cut.

B001AVCFK6|3.0|It was a day in 1973. Richard Nixon was in office and things were so bad outside, just on the other side of the window's glass, the stink of a filthy city, the stink of a rotting Capitol, and the stench wafting from the corpse of the American Dream like it was in the dumpster just down the fire escape around the corner in the back alley. We were naive enough to think that it couldn't possibly get any worse than that. No, we hadn't envisioned the horror of the Bush years, or the second set of Bush years for that matter, and had no idea that our coughing, hacking rusty Chevrolets and Fords that were choking up the blue skies into gray ones would in a matter of decades bring global doom down upon our children long before they would die. Who knew that our wretched, beautiful empire could so quickly snuff out an entire planet?<br /><br />No, it was a time both cynical and naive. I remember turning the television dial on only to hear a horrible screeching sound, the kind of noise a baboon might might emit in an act of auto-erotic asphyxiation. I slapped the side of that faux wooden electric box and screamed something in French as I had been forced into a month long deep-immersion language program in service of the government. I was to be shipped off sometime in the next three to four weeks to be the interim United States Ambassador to French Polynesia. It was to be a short term posting, all due to the fall out of that miserable bastard Spiro Agnew. The attorney general at that time was a good friend of mine and a sworn enemy of Agnew and all his cronies. Ah, my good friend Ray Kroc. He made one hell of an A.G. and screwed that dirty bastard and his friends right good, right into prison or exile. Say what you will about his hamburgers, and his bizarrely prescient but crippling fear of disease that he swore up and down would one day be spread across the globe by swine and fowl. (Why do you think McDonald's waited until after his death in 1984 to introduce the McRib sandwich?) But Ray Kroc was one grand old devil of an attorney general when he marched through this nation's legislative halls. You can almost hear his footsteps echoing now... But that's a story for another time.<br /><br />The heart of the matter is that I hadn't spoken a word of English in nearly two weeks, only French, and that I had only learned a total of about sixty words, all of them related to my love of cheap women, and even cheaper booze, as well as half a dozen swears, none of which I can repeat here. (I'm not missing the pun, just choosing to ignore it.) I couldn't get the television to work no matter what words I screamed at it while waving my arms wildly. In the 70's we all believed that shouting at the TV would help make it work better, sort of encourage the bizarre device to do well, much like how people today shout at the TV thinking that it will suddenly make politicians and pundits drop their ridiculous, phony right-wing/left-wing act and just admit that they're all suckling from the same corporate teats. I called the repair-man, but this being Los Angeles, he couldn't understand any of the French-Polynesian slang that I was limited to use by federal mandate in order to get my ambassadorial post on those balmy coasts approved. I had to assume that my phone was tapped, and couldn't take the risk of violating my federal employment terms. I needed the money, the power, the prestige, that comes with being a U.S. Ambassador to a small island in the Pacific Ocean. Fortunately, though, he knew Spanish, and you would be surprised how similar Tijuana slang is to French-Polynesian. Unfortunately, though, the only questions I knew how to say involved \\"scoring\\" and inviting him up to my hotel room. I don't know much Spanish, but homophobic rage is an international language. I slammed down the receiver and checked the dead bolt on my door for fear that this angry and violent man might find out where I live.<br /><br />The fear began to set in, which is bad, very bad.I had just taken two hits of some 12 hour medicine to calm my nerves, but this kind of confrontation could send me down a terrible and disturbing road. That's when the TV came back on, as if my earlier shouting and flailing had finally convinced it, had willed it, to behave like a normal television should. I nodded my head and thought: That's proper. I lit an herbal cigarette, sat down, and stared at the screen.<br /><br />It was amazing. Life-changing. Life-affirming. Could this television show possibly wash away all the grime left by the '72 race? Would it keep me calm and set me down the right road for the next twelve hours? And who is that in my kitchen? Is there someone behind my refrigerator? Not possible... There could only be an inch, an inch and a half at most, between the ice box and the wall. But how was that shadow moving? Not my concern. Just look away and ignore it. Just look away. It's just me and this television show in here: \\"The Twilight Zone.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Twilight Zone?\\" Had \\"Star Trek\\" really ended that quickly? I checked the window; it was night, and there was definitely someone in my kitchen now. Someone was sitting beside me on the couch offering me something that I really didn't want. I could smell bacon and completely understood my good pal Ray Kroc's fear of swine and birds, why just the sound of a pigeon flapping its wings outside his thirtieth floor office building window could make this lion of man cower under his desk all night long clutching a flash light between his legs to keep the diseases at bay. That was how he met his seventh wife. She was a night maid who coaxed him out from under there with the business end of a broom. Sweet woman. Had the most fantastic mustache. Came up with the fish-o-filet sandwich and later was a key witness at the Watergate hearings. You should have seen them together in the court room. You should have seen them together in the bathroom. Why were they in my bathroom?<br /><br />That best sums up my feelings about this unreleased product. I saw that there were 58 other reviews of this three-disc Blu-Ray product, and I know that I have just as much experience watching this Hi-Def Blu-Ray release which won't be released for another two months as every other reviewer here. Sure I saw this movie in the theater, but that has no REAL meaning when related to this product because I have no idea how good the audio and video transfers are. I have no idea whether or not the extras make this a five star product or one star product. I have no idea if it's over-priced and undervalued.<br /><br />And no one else does either. They have no idea what they're talking about because these discs haven't even been pressed yet. They haven't even finished editing the menu titles so that they can burn the discs. They don't know what they're talking about, but me? I won't pretend to know something I haven't yet had my hands on, haven't yet experienced. That's a fool's game.<br /><br />But in 1973, on that insane afternoon, I was there. I did experience that. So did Agnew, and so did Kroc. He was dragging Agnew out of the Capitol Building by the crotch of his pants, the evil schlub bawling the whole time, blubbering on and on with one lame excuse after another about mixing up his tax checks with his bribe checks and his aspirin with his Ibogaine.

0786856297|5.0|As an English Teacher who love Greek Mythology this is a great book to introduce elementary (tweens) to the classics. My son read the first two chapters the same week he received the book. The fact that the main character is a typical kid with the same struggles in school many tweens face makes the character one kids can relate to. We are looking forward to reading the whole series.
0440237688|5.0|Lowry scores my highest mark for THE GIVER: a capital A for AWESOME.<br /><br />THE GIVER appeals to my deepest being, going into emotional depths where I'm most aware, where I experience anger, sadness, and fear but also enjoyment, surprise, and love. Not only that but it stimulates and informs my intellect. It is such a gut-wrenching but ultimately happy story. It makes me --- at sixty-one --- feel like a boy again, a boy who thinks he can make the impossible possible, who might be able to help a dulled humanity feel more fully again. I believe all of existence waxes and wanes, ebbs and flows, evolves and devolves with a slow but ever-present upward spiral. This story addresses one community's wane, its ebb, its devolution. Jonas, as a member of that community, is selected to spend his time learning about his community's state of affairs. Then, as the story climaxes, he makes his choice and acts.<br /><br />Overall, Jonas is a \\"chosen\\" hero --- not unlike one chosen in natural selection --- who's unafraid to explore every facet of being, to admit not just the sensory input, but to experience emotionally as well as intellectually. He's brave enough, in the end, to try to escape the constraints of knowledge and experience that have crept into his community of origin. Such perversions are no less ugly than those of Nazism or those characterized in the great literature of the past--the stories of Bradbury, Huxley, and Orwell and others. This story informs those. Here we have a boy who wants to progress on to a new and better life, not just for himself but for the sake of his entire community. He wants them to have it too. He is willing to risk his life for it. For me, this is the purpose of literature, of life. It is man's highest virtue. To do good; to help others. As the boy in Carmac McCarthy's THE ROAD asks, \\"Are we still the good guys?\\"<br /><br />The story makes it clear --- as do all great stories --- that morality comes by experiencing choices tending toward either good or evil and in having the courage to choose that which trends toward good or otherwise suffering tragedy. Jonas isn't ever over-inflated with pride. He retains humility in learning, eventually hoping for a culture beyond his limiting one.<br /><br />Critics suggest the book's climax presents \\"a symbolic faux-death event\\", as if that would somehow be a bad thing. But I don't read it that way at all. Its literal language doesn't so read. Two children literally coast into a more abundant realm, still alive, still aware. Ready to receive and to give.<br /><br />Further, critics complain that Lowery fails with THE GIVER because Jonas's community isn't based upon a real world of its author, as if a symbolic or hyperbolic one of the imagination is flawed, or somehow a weakness. To the contrary, in the progress of mankind, imagination becomes truth. Or, as in the fanciful words of Ursula LeGuin's character, Genley Ai, truth is a matter of the imagination. What is ultimately in the realm of mankind is what was first imagined well and then subjected to free agents who acted upon it for good.<br /><br />THE GIVER presents a degenerated human power structure. How or why it has degenerated is not important in its overall scheme. It kills people, the ultimate evil. \\" . . . twins are being born tomorrow, and the test results show that there are identical.\\" \\"One for here, one for Elsewhere . . .\\" This is not ambiguous. It's not an issue of unborn or near dead. It is out and out, clear-cut, calculated murder. It's Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, and Auschwitz, but on a more massive scale.<br /><br />At the same time, the human power structure that has chosen wickedness ironically chooses Jonas as the Receiver. There are two things Jonas has that are vital. The first is his ability to choose freely. Everyone has that. All his contemporizes have it and utilize it. The other is knowledge and experience. It is this later that the others are lacking in great measure.<br /><br />There is no magic in THE GIVER, no smoke and mirrors as some have suggested, but only the issues of knowledge and choice. Every child is born with the ability to choose. Not every child lives with the ability to get  the necessary knowledge and experience required to choose well. It seems that to do so, to some degree, we have to be \\"chosen,\\" and then, even then, we have to choose to Receive it. But ultimately, what is most important, after all is said and done, is to choose to be a giver.<br /><br />THE GIVER.suggested, but only the issues of knowledge and choice.

B001J53X9U|5.0|This is i believed the best choice i have made by far Dark Knight is an Amazing film and truly shows what the batman world is. This  collectors edition is a must have for all fans of the Series i for one purchased it as soon as i opened my amazon account and for those starting your blue ray collection you cant a matter fact you wont go wrong by making this selection
B000005J56|5.0|The music is nostalgic.  The artistry is magnificent. The style is wonderful to the ear and the emotion. This CD is excellent in every way.  I find myself listening to it  everyday.
B002BFBAWO|1.0|Were Adventureland not filmed at Kennywood, our local amusement park, my wife and I would have tuned out after the first half-hour.  Imagine a movie set at an amusement park that is neither amusing nor funny. The sort of movie that 3/4 of the way through it you're wondering when the plot will begin. And the climax, such as it is, occurs only because the end credits were ready to roll. The simple story: several teens or twenty-somethings (they seemed to have no problem getting served at bars) still live with their distant / dysfunctional / alcoholic parents while they pass the time between furtive trysts by smoking marijuana. This is the kind of movie where two characters have one or two chaste encounters, and we're supposed to assign some deep bond between them (something the movie is too lazy to provide).  Skip this lame ride of a movie and visit Pittsburgh to enjoy Kennywood instead.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Now why, I ask you, are people complaining about Whitney's voice showing her \\"age?\\"  Do they say this about Streisand?  Or is it because Whitney has gotten tons of paparazzi press (mostly really bad) in the last decade or so?    So she doesn't have a huge range like a 20-something.  What's age gotta do with it?    She still has wonderful musicality and the album is very well produced.  There's a nice mix of songs here as well.    Why am I NOT giving it 5 stars?  In some songs, she truly seems to be trying too hard to impress rather than letting her natural talents just flow.  Some songs are way over-produced as seems to be the modern wont. She seems guarded in her singing and I can't say as I blame her. But it's worth a good listen and as an addition to your collection.    You are fine, Miss Whitney.  Just fine.  Like a great wine.  Keep coming back!

0330511661|4.0|This book is a fictional account of the life of George Leigh Mallory, an English mountain climber who attempted to be the first man to reach the top of Mount Everest.    We follow George through his childhood learning about his love of climbing and his desire to reach new heights.  Almost everything takes a backseat to this ambition, including his studies.    I found the story of George's determination when it came to getting into a certain schools, procuring a job and winning the hand of his wife showed the strong moral fiber that George carried throughout his life.    Working with all the committees, climbing partners and the general public required George to learn the hard way how to be a politician.    Near the end of book, my heart soared with the writer's speculation of the events of the final day.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves the outdoors and respects the determination it takes to succeed in a difficult task against all odds.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|Showtime definitely lags behind HBO in terms of cranking out Important TV - but if Showtime can crank up a few more programs like \\"Dexter,\\" it's going to give HBO a run for its money.    In the first two seasons, Dexter Morgan had to figure out many things about himself.  Sure, he was well-ensconced with the Miami PD as a blood spatter analyst/forensic expert.  Sure, he was dating the darling Rita (Julie Benz, confirming that her hilarious bit part in \\"As Good As It Gets\\" was no fluke) and had moved her ex out of the picture.  His sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter, a real find) was as profanely adorable as ever (or is it adorably profane?).  And he had eliminated many of his nasty problems . . . life seemed good for our sadistic hero.    *** Semi-spoiler alert:  Thanks to some stellar writing, Season 3 of \\"Dexter\\" picks up without a hitch.  Through a botched job and a semi-tragic accident, Dexter comes into close contact with Assistant DA Miguel Prado.  At first, it seems that Dexter may have found his true friend, just in time to discover that Rita is pregnant.  If there's ever a time for Dexter to get the insight of a stable family man like Miguel, it would be now.  But as the series drags on, Dexter learns that he and Miguel may be too similar for Dexter to consider him a true friend . . . perhaps anyone Dexter is too akin to is not the kind of person he should be friends with.  Miguel's demons help take this season into some extremely dark territory.    That's not to say that the show's trademark gallows humor is gone.  Detective Angel Batista (David Zayas) and forensics nut Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) get some choice subplots, and Debra's romance with a confidential informant offers a lot of smiles.      Sure, this may not be Important TV like \\"The Wire\\" or \\"The Sopranos.\\"  But if you're looking to spend some evenings with a depraved genius and you've already watched \\"Deadwood,\\" \\"Dexter\\" is the perfect choice and a welcome addition to the pantheon of Great TV.

B00026WU82|5.0|Bought for my 14 year old son at his request, its as good a summary of mid 60s state of the union as you're bound to find for the nano second attention generation. It still retains that sense of kick butt,tension-release exuberance. Demonstrates the value of alternate renditions of songs found on later bootlegs and live releases - nuances abound from version to version, all to our musical enjoyment. Assigned listening for this decade's students.
0307269981|3.0|The story behind the story (Stieg Larsson's personal story) certainly influences how this trilogy will be judged.<br />My main point, in case you stop reading right here, read the books in order.<br />This second book is well written but not as crisp as the first book.<br />I do not read Patterson because I can predict the ending by the third chapter, I prefer E. Leonard and C. Hiassan for mystery and fun. Larsson is closer to Leonard but without the well honed style. Again, his personal story allows the reader to let that go.<br />Read Larsson and enjoy. I am looking forward to the last book.
B000EGF0NW|5.0|The memoir, \\"Lucky,\\" by Alice Sebold is extrememly readable -- a real page-turner. She takes us through the horrible experience of being raped by a stranger when she was a freshman at Syracuse University. She goes back and forth between the rape and her life before and after the fact. I really felt like she and I were sitting at the table with a cup of tea, while she told me the story.
0547258305|5.0|Have you ever played the game where everyone had to name the \\"super-power\\" they would ask for if given the opportunity?  What was yours?  probably not the ability to literally kill anyone or anything and be fairly invulnerable to pain...<br /><br />In [[ASIN:0547258305 Graceling]] author Kristin Cashore creates a world where a chosen few are born with \\"Graces\\" - these can be something as simple as the ability to catch fish with your bare hands, the ability to run swiftly, the ability to shoot an arrow quickly and true --- and then there is the Lady Katsa's Grace - the ability to kill.<br /><br />This is full of really juicy adventure, hand to hand combat, archers, sword play, good kings and bad kings...but what sets this book apart from other offerings in this genre is it's look at the consequences of the use of these graces on those who wield them.<br /><br />Katsa is a strong headed young woman who has always held a position of power - not many people argue with her so she is sure that what she knows are truths...until she meets another Graceling who shows her otherwise.<br /><br />The really nice thing about the way Cashore has written the relationship between Po and Katsa is that there is enough romance for the girls and it doesn't get mushy so the boys think it's in the way.<br /><br />I picked this book up to \\"look\\" at it at my Mom's and sat down and read it all the way through by the next morning - this story is destined to become a blockbuster movie!
B0000VD04M|4.0|Ed Wood is notorious everywhere for being the worst directer ever to grace Hollywood.  I dont' exactly believe that myself like some others, he actually doesn't seem so, as there are other directors that are worse (such as Uwe Boll, who is not the answer to Ed Wood in the 21st century, by the way).  Unlike the aforementioned jerk director, Ed Wood, for all his crappy shortcomings and low budget production values that become strangely hilarious, he becomes are very likeable director, one who loves the movies and loves  And while Glen or Glenda is probably a bad movie, the whole aspect of how it's like to hold a secret actually has some weight and seems like Ed Wood, maybe, just maybe, actually had something to say (of course, that movie's message is slathered in a creepy premise, which is why I probably would never watch it even if it was made alright, but that's another story).  Ed Wood is a portrayl of all of the above, which makes this biopic very appealing.<br /><br />Ed Wood's life could easily by split in many parts.  Ed Wood spans his life from Glen or Glenda to the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space.  His homelife, his relationship with Bela, the colorful people he encountered during this time period,and the making of his movies are all portrayed on screen. Ed Wood isn't all the way historically accurate; for example, Ed Wood never met Orson Welles, and Bela was actually married.  However, Ed Wood would keep anybody who liked Ed Wood in a way because of the way he's portrayed, and what he was doing that made him likeable is present in the movie.  Unless your part of the Golden Rasberry Awards, you'll probably end up liking Ed Wood in the movie.<br /><br />Ed Wood's life wasn't all fun and games, as many of the grimmer times of his life, such as his later life with ended in death, is not here.  And I am not quite sure if the premiere  However, Tim Burton and the screenwriters specifically wanted his life to be somewhat sympathetic here, and they do very well.  It's also very funny, with outlandish situations to go along with his so bad it's good aura.  What also makes the movie is the way he interacts with many of the people, which often ends in hilarity, with some wit to go with it.  Bela is also hilarious, especially when he gets ticked off after hearing someone compare him to Boris Karloff.<br /><br />The cast and director really shine.  The cast, with the offbeat Johnny Depp, very hot Patrica Arquette (though she was hotter in True Romance), Bill Murray as a tranny, Sarah Jessica Parker (she's.....she's, okay, she's not as impressive as the others), and Martin Landau. Martin Landau actually beat out Jules Winfield... errr Samuel L Jackson from Pulp Fiction (QUENTIN TARANTINO RULES! Oh sorry) in the oscars.  Actually really well deserved, unlike the best picture of 1994 (REPRESENT! Oh Sorry).  These characters are really well portrayed, letting you get involved in the life of Ed Wood and the many people who were around with him. Tim Burton's style of directing (shot in black and white) is suberb, and many artistic flourishes abound.  The cheap sets of a low budget movie, the many cheap special effects are on display, and the regular sets and shots are great.  The other academy award winner, for best makeup, was well deserved, particulary because it made Landau a great recreation of an old Bela Lugosi.  And the opening credits are a prime example of Ed Wood's fine artistic quality, with the very campy and infectious theme (which shows up as a music video in the extras) with a Theremin in use.<br /><br />I really dont' quite understand however, why the film drags.  It adds some kind of an insight to the filmmaking process, or something, or at least some humor in it.  Eh, I really don't understand that claim.  Sure, Ed Wood isn't exactly a knockout (hence why it doesn't get five stars), but Ed Wood is easily my favorite biopic, with a topic that you just can't get enough of, and entertaining with some great laughs.  TimBurton style really cements the movie and makes it a full on fine movie.  Highly recommended view of one of Hollywood's most lovable directors (in the Chicago Cubs way), further cemeted by the portrayol of this movie.<br /><br />B+e movie and makes it a full on fine movie.

0385474547|2.0|I read 3/4 of the book then stopped. The main character is driven by the need to succeed and in their primitive culture it is somewhat interesting to see how things unfold for him. The main point I took away is that in a stone-age culture there is a lot of randomness; maybe one day some one comes and says you must take in a 10 year old boy, then years later they come by and say he must die, or maybe a witchdoctor comes and takes your daughter for a night. The author has some skill and some of the folk stories were interesting, but I found I just did not care about the characters. So I stopped reading. I rarely stop a book 3/4 of the way through.
B001KQKC0Q|5.0|This album continues the high standard of Nickelback's music!  I think everyone should get to enjoy this groups music.    As for the quality of the download, I have found no glitchs in any of the songs.  The sound is clean, clear and crisp.  Considering the price it more than exceeded my expectations.  The only down side of this purchase was not getting any of the information that goes with the jacket.  I think I'll survive.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This CD set is great!  Of course, it's Michael Jackson so it couldn't be anything but great!  This one takes you from the four Jackson 5 hit singles though You Rock My World, one of the many great songs from Invincible.  My only disappointment is that Jam is not a part of this compilation. If you're planning to buy only one Michael Jackson CD, this is the one to get.
1401309666|5.0|It is the brilliant analysis of the market of digital good.  It shows online store like Amazon, Ebay, Netflix will be the threat to BestBuy, Barns & Noble, Blockbuster, Walmart.  That why the brick and mortar stores have to create the website in the hybrid of in-store and online to compete.  Even Walmart right now has to create its own website and copy the model of Amazon to compete with Amazon.  Because Ebay and Amazon is the threat of the survival of Walmart in the future.  It is interesting to see how the giant retail uses its warehouse, chain of suppliers, and allow other small sellers put their products in its website to sell online.  The book shows that Ebay and Amazon and other online stores sell more than 50% of good in used items and niche items while Walmart sells 90% of its merchandise in new items.  We will wait and see how the giant retailers like Walmart, BestBuy, Blockbuster, Barns & Noble to compete with the pure online player like Amazon, Ebay, Netflix.
B001BJ690Y|5.0|Uma Thurman is out for revenge!  She plays \\"The Bride\\" who receives a bullet in her head at her wedding and spends the next several years in a coma.  Uma is lucky; the rest of her wedding party are all dead.  She regains her consciousness in the hospital (in a decidedly compromised position) then makes up a list of all those she is determined to eliminate.<br /><br />Like a good satire of all those Japanese samurai films, \\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\\" is very bloody, but unlike those, is also very funny.  I did not know whether to laugh or to cringe, so I did both.  The sword fight scenes are magnificently staged and choreographed.  The cinematography is beautiful (magnified stunningly in Blu-ray) and the incredibly stirring musical score is akin to something out of a Sergio Leone spaghetti western.<br /><br />See this amazingly entertaining flick!  I am already preparing myself for Volume 2.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|In order to get big rewards in life you have to take big risks. If there is one thing that the Star Trek universe hasn't done in 20-25 years its take risks. The franchise has suffered greatly for it, continuing to follow a formulaic approach that has made the franchise stale, predictable, and for quite a while... DEAD. Not sick, not on life support, but D-E-A-D.<br /><br />Those days are over.<br /><br />The 11th feature presentation is quite simply the first GREAT Star Trek movie ever made. While others in the series have been enjoyable, there was no definitive movie that stood out, nothing that could be pointed to as something unique, something special, something that takes RISKS.<br /><br />What you get here is the biggest risk that has ever been taken in the Star Trek universe in its 40+ years of existence.<br /><br />I will not ruin this risk but if you are a fan of the movies at all you will know it when you see it. Being a long time fan of Star Trek (I am a Next Generation first and foremost) and having seen the trailer numerous times I figured out what was going to happen about 20 minutes before it did but that didn't stop the shock when I witnessed this awesome writing decision played out on the big screen. The strongest of Star Trek lovers (especially TOS people) will no doubt have a lot of outrage at this risk but it was the right move to make. The Star Trek franchise needed to be shaken up, it needed something fresh and it needed a movie to shock and awe the audience.<br /><br />Man did it ever deliver.<br /><br />This movie is an absolute JOY to experience. Spock was always my favorite TOS personality as he probably was for most fans, but I never felt the connection to this cast that I did to Picard, Data, Worf and the Next Gen cast so I really didn't care what changes they made (and there is another major change that involves 2 characters that you never have experienced before in TOS history) if they were for the better. In all cases these were for the better and executed with near-perfection by JJ Abrams (who might later be revered on the same level as Gene Rodenberry if this re-visioning [this is much more than a simple reboot] succeeds like I think it will).<br /><br />Since I don't like getting too deep into spoilers with reviews instead of focusing on the story (try your best to stay ignorant as possible of the story so its fresher when you see the film) I will instead focus on the characters we know so well (and some we don't).<br /><br />True To The Character We Know<br /><br />Spock (played by Zachary Quinto) - Even though Kirk (ahhem William Shatner) was advertised as the lead of TOS, the real centerpiece was Spock. The work here by Quinto is beyond exceptional and complements the amazing work done by Leonard Nimoy the past 40 years. Quinto plays the character as well as you could imagine and the real special thing in this movie is that finally (FINALLY) the half human side of Spock is heavily examined. It is a major part of the movie and no doubt will continue to be focused on in future films. Spock is no more or less important to the crew and story as he always has been. Other actors could do lesser work (they didn't) but the movie franchise will only succeed as well as Quinto acts. The character is in the best of hands.<br /><br />Bones (played by Karl Urban) - The gem of the entire movie without question. Karl Urban takes the difficult role of playing not only Bones but Bones played by DeForest Kelley and is he ever amazing. It's a complete joy to watch his character on the screen. Urban doesn't need to do anything different in future films. You can tell how hard he worked to keep the Bones character as he has always been and he hits a home run out of the park. Wonderful wonderful wonderful<br /><br />Scotty (played by Simon Pegg) - We don't meet Scotty until far into the movie but Pegg does a great job doing James Doohan. Since Scotty was always kind of the \\"middle\\" character on the show where he wasn't wasted but wasn't the tops (Spock, Kirk, Bones) all Pegg had to do was do a good Scotty and hopefully the script-writers would give him more to do. This is the case here.<br /><br />Revisions And Improvements Made<br /><br />Kirk (played by Chris Pine) - No longer do we get the ultra womanizing, overacting of Kirk/William Shatner but we get instead a focus on the risk-taking side of Kirk and this is the Kirk that I could truly learn to love. Over and over again we see why Kirk in Star Trek canon is revered so much and his take no prisoners approach is put on the front burner all throughout this film. Pine is confident and does a fantastic job. I don't care how revered Shatner is, the writers got it right with this re-visioning of Kirk and it's thumbs up all the way.<br /><br />Sulu (played by John Cho) - Not much to say here. Cho was fine but nothing amazing in his performance. Sulu fights a little bit but hopefully more focus can be made on him in the future, no problems here but nothing jumps out.<br /><br />Uhura (played by Zoe Saldana) - As a communications officer her role is MUCH better in this re-visioning. She is given more intelligent input by the script-writers but the one major canon change of Uhura (which I can't go into detail in this review) I am still trying to determine how I feel about. Her mod is the 2nd biggest risk/mod taken in the movie.<br /><br />Complete Rewrite<br /><br />Chekov (played by Anton Yeltin) - Except for being Russian and making fun of his thick accent this is a completely new character and man was this a serious improvement. Instead of the bumbling doofus that really doesn't do anything now Chekov is a ultra-young uber-intelligent officer that plays pivotal parts in the movie. Yes this was a serious canon change but I can't imagine how any fan wouldn't approve because now you have a real character you can be emotionally attached to.<br /><br />New Characters<br /><br />Nero (played by Eric Bana) - Bana instantly becomes one of the main villains in Star Trek lore and in my opinion because of events in the movie he now becomes THE single villain in Star Trek history. I wish Nero could have been on the screen more but with only 2 hours and so many people to get on the screen I think the right balance was struck.<br /><br />Old Friends<br /><br />XXX - You will know who this is when you see them. I have no complaints other than one voice-over part where the narration seems a bit droll and uninspired but I also think this is because of the circumstance how they are speaking. This old friend was a +++ to the movie and not just a ploy to get people in the seats. A welcome addition to the movie and plot.<br /><br />Intangibles<br /><br />Bridge - The new bridge is the most gorgeous bridge you will ever see. Some say it looks 'too sexy' or 'too bright' but THIS is how the bridge should have always looked. Please please please don't change it for the future films. You have already achieved the perfect look.<br /><br />Score - The one downside of the movie. The 3rd trailer featured some of the most gorgeous background score ever and my hopes were very high. The score that is featured in the movie is serviceable but doesn't inspire. I was disappointed with the end result. It's alright but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />IMO 'Star Trek' achieves what only 1 Star Trek movie (IV - The Voyage Home) came close to doing and that is being a successful film to the general public, not just Star Trek fans in general. This is the quickest 2 hours you will spend this summer and an absolute joy. I can see several movies being made with this cast and I hope several are made. The events of this film make for a realistic approach to the original cast working anew in these new revisions. As the movie ended I wished I could move ahead 2-3 years in time to see the next chapter and the next and the next.<br /><br />Everyone likes to rank the movies in order and I knew 1 hour in this was EASILY (note I don't even flinch when I say EASILY EASILY EASILY) the greatest Star Trek movie ever made. You know a movie succeeds when a character or a movie itself feels like candy for the brain (last year Heath Ledgers Joker was the ultimate 'candy') and this is some yummy candy.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan go see it and try to have an open mind for what you will see. Many will be fine with the changes made. For the ones that aren't would you rather have changes and new Star Trek movies or the same old same old that had ruined the franchise for so long (kudos to Rick Berman as the official murderer of ST)??? If you are just a person that loves movies you (yes YOU) can even enjoy Star Trek as this movie has been produced not just for the Trekkie but the every day Joe and Jane.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATIONStar Trek history.

B000GQR9HK|5.0|This particular item is good. It's not missing sleeve art and it's not a disc burned in someone's basement. Now on to the movie. Don't expect the movie to exactly reflect the book(what movie really does?), but do expect it to not take too much license. It's got it all, the plot, the action, the drama, the comedy-everything one could want in a movie. Special effects are very very good and so is the acting. I would recommend both the book and this movie.

If you are just a person that loves movies you (yes YOU) can even enjoy Star Trek as this movie has been produced not just for the Trekkie but the every day Joe and Jane.     ***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B00001NTXN|5.0|Quoridor is one of those games that comes under the title, \\"Classic\\". Simple rules, endless strategy and made well. Can really be played by anyone 5 and up. 2-4 players and enough game strategy to keep you entertained for a long time.
B002OPYUSM|5.0|This was so funny, I found myself LOL randomly throughout the episode. It's part Breakfast Club (even without the direct references),part The Office, with a Splash of Seinfeld-like humor. \\"Annie Adderol\\" is my favorite, but all of the characters are likable and possess a complexity that I can't wait to watch unravel. I found myself thinking that each of them is similar to specific people in my life.     It's refreshing to watch a show about real people, with real writing, as opposed to some of the crap that's on TV right now. I haven't wached NBC regularly since Friends ended, but I think I can make an exception for Community. It's about time!
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I first saw Fleet Foxes on SNL and immediately decided to buy their CD. Their vocal harmony reminds  me a bit of CSN&Y.  I enjoy every song on the album.  I am 60 and this is the first CD by a new group I have purchased in a long time. I eagerly await Fleet Foxes next album.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|In an age of a-la-carte digital downloads, this entire album is good. I'll turn off \\"shuffle\\" on my iPod and actually listen to the whole thing. And the louder the better. Seriously, every time I listen to this album, I end up turning the volume up at least two or three times. I bought this CD on a whim, but I'm definitely picking up whatever else they've got.

B002BSHWUU|3.0|I've just received from Amazon and spent today by listening intently to the whole stereo CD package. I have had the original Capitol albums and still have the Parlophone stereo LP either British or German pressings that I obtained while stationed in Germany in the mid 80's. When they came out in CD format in 1987-8 I sure did invest in the new medium. I will not evaluate the Beatles as it is impossible: they will remain my #1 band of all time. Period. Let's talk about the 2009 remastered edition.    My conclusion is: as many as you did, I was not pleasantly surprised or utterly impressed. Sure, there ARE improvements which I would categorize as subtle to my ears. The issue is that the engineers worked on the original mixes dating from 63-70 plus the Help and Rubber Soul \\"87: cleaned them up and gave it some sonic power. I agree that for whatever reason it is regrettable EMI and everyone responsible bypassed an opportunity/deciding not to do a DEFINITIVE remix and remaster and bring it up to state-of-the-art standards of a new century. There is NO WAY I can compare this remastered version against for example a Nowhere Man from the 1999 Yellow Submarine (brilliant piece of work), an Eleanor Rigby, Revolution or a Hey Jude from \\"Love\\" (outstanding!)or the gorgeous 5:1 mix done for the Help DVD reissue. These were done I still believe respecting the historical archive that the masters represent. These, by the way are highly recommended plus Let It Be-Naked. Just listen to them.     The issue of mono vs. stereo is strictly one of personal taste. I do for one, favor a good stereo version if available and well done. Examples of definitive versions brought back to a new life include the surround SACD of The Who Tommy, Yellow Brick Road of Elton John, or the surround DVD-A of Elvis 1, which has dated tapes from late 50s-60s-early 70s: an absolute TREAT to the ears in a living room or in the car.     To conclude, this is a mixed bag: it would have been IDEAL and DEFINITIVE ifthe project would have surfaced as to the Yellow Submarine Songbook CD of '99: which will remain my STANDARD as to what can be achieved in stereo, without getting into the surround issue(even better). The packaging and liner notes are very nice. I would hang on to your 87-8 CDs, and decide for yourself- after reading other reviewers: then perhaps go after PERSONAL individual remasters you just feel you need to have (eg. Hard Day's Night, Abbey Road).
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I enthusiastically verify that the gist of all the positive reviews (about 57 of 'em prior to mine) is true, and then some. The music is crystal clear, and has a wonderful depth, warmth, and striking presence: allowing the listener to distinctly hear or \\"pick out\\" the different parts: both instruments and vocals. This is especially true (as we would expect) of the stereo versions, with their inherent separation, but also almost as much of the mono mixes (I've been listening to both mono and stereo yesterday and today: no pun intended). The music is filled with energy. It's exciting, alive, shiny, and shimmering: the aural equivalent of a bright rainbow. I'm absolutely thrilled, since The Beatles have always been my favorite band.    Another common theme in previous reviews and many professional critical reviews I have read is that one hears things they never heard before. Very true: almost in every song if one listens closely enough (and especially with headphones). That is a special thing because it provides a feeling that these 40+ years-old records still are \\"new.\\"    I always liked Ringo's drumming a lot, but I've come to appreciate him quite a bit more, now that I've properly heard what he has done in these marvelous songs. He's renowned (especially among fellow drummers) for his \\"fills\\": the little drum runs at the end of a section of the song, usually just before it repeats a verse or goes into a chorus or bridge. One hears these with perfect clarity now. I find myself following his drums in particular in each song, more so than the guitars, because they could always be heard in earlier recording mixes, and immersing myself in the animated wonder of his playing.     The drumming is so great in some songs, that I have started liking them much more than I ever did (Drive My Car -- never one of my favorites -- is one example: the funkiness of the drums and bass together are really something).    I've always been a big Stereo Guy, but I must say that my thinkinghas undergone a considerable transformation in listening again to the older mono Beatles songs that I had prior to this release, and doing A/B song comparisons. The mono songs -- the rockers above all -- hit you right between the eyes. They have an impact and (as lots of people say) \\"punch\\" to them that the stereo can't quite match. This is proportionately more true the earlier the recordings are. But there are exceptions. The stereo versions have such good sound that many of the rockers don't lose much (examples: I Saw Her Standing There, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, which are powerful in both stereo and mono).     The albums A Hard Day's Night and Beatles for Sale also sound surprisingly good in stereo, for 1964. For some reason the 1965 stereo mixes don't seem as good as the ones the year before (with lots of antiquated \\"ping pong\\" mixes). Something changed, and it was for the worse, I think.    The mono has the drums (like everything else) in the center, which makes them more prominent; more in balance, in my opinion: sometimes seeming even twice as loud, as should be the case with a rocker. Paperback Writer is far better in mono: no contest. If we compare the gut-busting flat-out rockers of The White Album (Birthday, Helter Skelter, Green Onion, Back in the USSR, etc.), the difference isn't as great as in the earlier, pre-1967 music, but mono still retains the edge. Revolution (the single) is awesome in mono: a terrific powerhouse. It sounds \\"gutted\\" in stereo (as even John Lennon stated after hearing the 1973 Blue Album), but packs a \\"two-fisted\\" punch in the powerful stereo version on \\"Love\\" that can give the mono version a run for its money.     Mono also sounds much better through speakers than in headphones (I have Sennheiser HD280 pro). It's the difference between \\"very good\\" and \\"perfect.\\" The music doesn't sound like it is in the middle of your head when it comes through separated speakers. The element of physical separation of two channels (even if they areplaying the same thing) adds quite a bit.     In the earlier songs, for my taste, the drums in the stereo mixes are too often lost in the overall soundscape, in one channel only, and flat-sounding (the very last thing drums should ever be). The Beatles \\"kick [...]\\" in the mono rockers. There is a power and forward drive there that matches any rock band, bar none. John Lennon once said in an interview that the Rolling Stones were \\"never\\" a match for The Beatles, even in the power department. He was right. The Fab Four could rock with the best of them, and it sounds best in mono. I never thought I'd say that, but I'm a new believer. The stereo sounds excellent overall, though, and is significantly superior for the softer, more melodic songs, and songs with harmony singing. A lot of the reason the mono mixes sound better is because of the inadequate mixing of many of the earlier stereo versions, in my opinion. The engineer(s) who did the Yellow Submarine Soundtrack understood this (particularly evident with Nowhere Man and Eleanor Rigby, which are much better than any of the box set versions).    I also agree with the general consensus that the later albums in the catalogue (meaning, from 1967 to 1969) sound comparatively better. This is, no doubt, due to the higher quality of the original recordings: better equipment as they went along, and more tracks. My own greatest discoveries came in listening to Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and The White Album (in both stereo and mono). The same is largely true of Revolver, too. And Your Bird Can Sing and Doctor Robert in stereo were thoroughly enjoyable, with lots of new sounds heretofore unnoticed.    Thus far, having listened to most of my favorite songs, I have been most struck by I am the Walrus and Strawberry Fields. The \\"psychedelic,\\" almost avante garde sound effects and musical sounds of this period are spectacular in the new sets. Walrus (in stereo) was astounding. It has a sparkling energy and excitement and rocks more. It's amazing. Strawberry Fields had almost as striking of an impact, as did Tomorrow Never Knows, with all its bizarre tape loops and hypnotic rhythms and weird vocals. It rocks harder and is more captivating than ever. Come Together has even more of the semi-spooky, funky, \\"swampy\\" vibes that have always made it the unique song that it is.    The guitars sound uniformly excellent, not over-recorded and tinny, as was too often the case in the old recordings. They're wonderful in, for example, Day Tripper and Ticket to Ride and Taxman and Dear Prudence, and the twangy, Byrds-like If I Needed Someone, and in my favorite Harrison solo and one of my top five Beatles songs, Let it Be (the vastly superior album version). They sparkle on The White Album, which has been notorious in the past for being too trebly and thin. Great, innovative music ought to challenge and stretch the listener, and these sets, in an almost magical fashion, bring back the joy of discovery that we had when we first heard all these songs.    Every person can discover the wonders here in their own fashion, according to their own tastes and preferences. But I know one thing for sure: a \\"splendid time is gua-d-anteed for all.\\"
B001TIQTFC|5.0|it's not an album I will listen to that often, as i've heard it hundreds of ties already, but they did a really great job with the sound; the dvd is a nice touch as well, with the album and documentary on it; they have also done this with the other three of the 'first four'; i have all but 'the first born is dead',and will get that one eventually. Great job by MUTE!! Now if they would do this with the original Birthday Party albums...?
B00009Y3L4|5.0|This movie is a one of a kind experience in that it is interesting, educational, entertaining, and exciting,something most movies try to accomplish and normally do not achieve. The quality of acting, singing, and directing, choreography, everything is top notch. Yes it is a departure from the equally entertaining stage version it is something that trancends film and gives you that theatrical feeling without being taken direct from broadway. The quick pacing that makes modern movie musicals great is evident and maybe orgiginated with Cabaret, one of the greatest musicals, and movies of all time.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This is trilogy of stories that slowly evolve into a common theme and connections.  Languages, cultures, classes, and countries weave into a fabric of common connections.<br /><br />A rifle is the center of the film.  It becomes part of a local goat herdsman's property in Morocco.  He has two young sons (Said Tarchani and Boubker Ait El Caid) who take care of the goats but also play with the rifle.  During target practice with rocks one son inadvertently takes a shot at a tour bus.  Both sons see the bus stop and realize something is wrong.  They run back to their home and hide the gun as they realize what trouble they started.<br /><br />Traveling in the tour bus in the back roads of Morocco are Richard and Susan (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett).  They are a wealthy young couple who have just lost a child.  Their other two children are at home in San Diego with their illegal Mexican housekeeper and nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza).  Susan has been irritable and upset most of the trip. After a meal she does not enjoy they get on the tour bus and start down the winding back roads of Morocco.  Susan leans against the window and the gunshot comes through hitting her in the shoulder near the neck.  Richard and the Tour Bus passengers panic and try to find hospital or help near by as Susan is bleeding and in much pain.  Finally they find a small town nearby, but still need competent medical care.<br /><br />Richard calls home to tell Amelia she needs to stay with the children longer than expected.  Amelia is upset as she was planning on attending her son's wedding in Mexico.  She makes a decision to go anyway and take Richard and Susan's children with her.  They have great fun at the wedding and Amelia's son does not want her to leave Mexico.  She says she has to return with the children - and her nephew drives them back.  Immigration officials cause a problem and near disaster in the desert when trying to come back to the United States.<br /><br />Then the film zips to Tokyo and a rich widower (Koji Yakusho) who is tied to the rifle that shot Susan. He worries and is torn about his deaf daughter (Kinko Kikuchi). She is angry she has no hearing and no mother.  Her anger at a sports game upsets him.  He seems to talk to her about her attitude (There are no subtitles). She is upset when boys back away from her when they realize she cannot hear.  She wants to be loved and have a life of fun and boyfriends like other young girls.  She is bold, promiscuous, determined and angry.  Her actions are both shocking and sad.<br /><br />This is a very intimate peek into each life.  It is deeply, darkly emotional and yet very thoughtful on the love of families as well as cultural misunderstandings.  We see humanities connectedness and how we all make mistakes whether rich or poor.  Life is complicated as is this movie.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Bing brings you health info from trusted sources.

B001N26GFM|5.0|A story of innocence against a diabolical truth. It is set in WW11, but really it could happen anytime, anywhere. For in reality, it is a story of mankind's struggle within Himself.    Seeing the cover of DVD with two innocent children, one in pajamas, next to a barbed wire fence; I knew in my gut that this was Tombstone Territory Hardcore. Experience weathers the face of innocence, laugh lines troubled by worry lines next door to evil. Some live in evil's mist never knowing; many Germans have claimed suprise over the Holocaust, some even denying it. In 2000 there were a suspected 5,000 to 7,000 camps. Today we know there were over 20,000 such camps. Six known extermination camps, 12,000 ghettos of starvation, 10+ million slave laborers, 10+ million POWs, and thats not counting other types of camps. Each camp was an island unto itself with many independent bureaucracies, giving free reign to their many independent commandants, to have absolute power over thier prisoners. Even today the truth is still slowly coming to light.   In this fabled/allegorical movie the fence represents a fact. The fence is seperating the two innocent children and they both wonder at its purpose. On one side, hunger & abuse. The other, an abundance of food/toys. Both wonder what the truth is. The irony, of course, is that both are being protected from it (sound familiar?). This brings to my mind an observation by the screenwriter Robert McKee, \\"What happens is fact. Truth is what we think about what happens.\\".   Shumel, the boy inside the fence, is close to death's door and not aware of it. Bruno, son of the SS officier running the camp, is just as unaware of the fact that this where the ovens of hell on earth are burning. A holocaust of inhumanity so diabolically evil that it cloaks itself in plain sight/shadowed by its very own unbelievable reality.    By keeping the truth from the boys, they know not what they do. When they dig a hole. Are they digging their way out/in/ or their own graves? The truth is killing them, not protecting them. The only ones protected by the truth are those that keep it from us, keepers of the darkness that fears the light of day.    The Founding Fathers knew that a secret government is a bad government. That power corrupted. The Germany of the 1930's had passed from the light into the darkness quickly/quietly, as quick the rest of the world followed...into hell.    The two inocent children here should have been told the FACTS. This week was the week of 9/11. More than one third of Americans do not believe the government's official findings. There are secrets. There are truths. What we must demand are the FACTS. History may not repeat itself but it Damn sure rhymes.   So this movie is very prescience in its meaning and message. Fences are still being built. Don't depend on the Goebbels of today. You just have to dig out the Damn truth yourself.     But remember, when you find the truth, it just may be.... unbelievable.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!

Joe folds up the letter and puts it in his pants pocket to deal with later.  His letter noted a realization that strong relationships were developing between Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other oil producing countries and thought it was worth the CIA's effort to look into it.<br /><br />We meet all of Joe's co-workers - 6 of them besides Joe.  He starts his work and feeds pertinent information into the computer.  Around 11:30 he is the designated person to do the lunch run to the Deli a block away.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|Revolver is a treat to listen to.  I have this album on tape and in record form, so it is very neat to have it in on a remastered CD form.  It sounds clear and crisp not like my scratchy old record and crummy old tape.  Revolver contains many hits songs.  Every band member shines at least one song with their lead vocals.  My favorite is \\"Yellow Submarine\\".  Ringo's lead vocals on this song are great.  This song is a three minute party.  It brings people together.  This is such a fun song.  I also like George's vocals on the song \\"Taxman\\".  This is a very groovy song.  Paul shines on \\"Eleanor Rigby\\".  I love the violins playing on this song very much.  John provides lead vocals on the track \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".  I love the beat of this song very much.  I love the horns playing on \\"Got To Get You In My Life\\".  It is such a happy upbeat song.  This is a classic album.

B0014I4KIK|4.0|When it has came down to it, there are honestly much fewer artists that simply have spoke the noblest notes from the heart. When Duffy came out over a year ago, I was deeply impressed at how she could really sing, and not to make herself sound like one of the manufactured artists like Rihanna or Beyonce'. Her voice really has brought back the essence and innocence of that classic 60's Soul era. There honestly has been no doubt about that, but with all the simplicity, the question I wondered about her debut, when I recently bought the album, is that if it could honestly deliver with the appeal? The answer is like syrup & honey, sticky and sweet but needs honestly a little bit more to the taste.<br /><br />Duffy's, debut album Rockferry brings out a down to Earth intimate voice and deeply sounding songs that don't feel like they are manufactured or cheaply delivered. Here, you just have a down to Earth mellowness that matches nicely in the heart and soul of her first record. There are a lot of good songs here including the intimate Warwick Avenue, Stepping Stone, and the breakout single Mercy. The songs really sound very deeply delightful, and bring out a honest making of a intimately young Dusty Springfield. While the mood on the album is very strong, the one big disadvantage I honestly feel about the album is that it is really a very short album, nearly less than 40 minutes. I like the album, but I wish sincerely that Duffy could've added a few extra songs to match the mood well. The sound here is great from the strings and the style, but there honestly could've been more.<br /><br />All in all, Rockferry is a simple straight-forward debut from Duffy that I enjoyed listening too. But, when she honestly does come out with her sophmore album, she needs to either have longer songs, or more songs with the short time on each track. I liked the record, but I hope Duffy can do that for more shelf life into her soul. In the meantime, there are very few albums that are worthwhile, and I absolutely recommend Rockferry.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-olutely recommend Rockferry.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|`Up' is another Pixar gem.  Able to transport the minds of young and old and enhance its story with sympathy and charm, the movie is understandably touted as one of the year's best.      Since the beginning of their marriage, Carl Frederickson (Edward Asner) and his wife Ellie (Elie Docter) have yearned to move to Paradise Falls in South America.  Smitten by his childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), Carl and Ellie scrimp and save, but contingencies force them to open their savings jar until one day Ellie passes away, and Carl is forced to live alone with his dream broken and nothing but his memories intact.    Around his house construction workers are building new city buildings, and a job foreman coaxes Carl to sell his house.  One day Carl confronts a worker who damages his mailbox, and the ordeal sets Carl up to be placed in a nursing home.  Carl then meets a young boy scout who wishes to earn his final merit badge, assisting an elderly person.  The boy gets more than he bargained for as Carl desperately tries to regain his footing and elude those who would change his life forever.    Colorful and cute, Carl's journey and the characters he encounters are enough to enthrall, but the story is even more transporting.  The peril is enough to keep even teenagers interested, yet keep their sympathies for the elderly intact.  The way the animated scenes unfold is the most engrossing aspect of yet another successful Pixar project.

It is great to see how Edward and Bella's lives finally become one. While the ending was \\"ok\\", the rest of it was fantastic!
B0010KGZD0|5.0|How do you get anywhere in a negotiation?<br />The answer is to structure the process methodically.<br />The authors describe the method in four parts; namely,<br />separating the people from the problem, focus on<br />common interests, invent options for mutual gain<br />and utilize objective criteria- always.<br /><br />The contents of the book would be useful in<br />conducting any negotiation whether complex or simple.<br />The presentation is easy to read. This book should<br />be in every personal library.
B0018BB20W|5.0|\\"Days of Future Passed\\" by the Moody Blues is as full of passion an mystic appreciation of the various moods of the day as it was innovative as a collboration of pop-rock band and orchestra as well as, as I've read, the first outing of the mellotron.  For many this album is the starting point of progressive rock.<br /><br />The Day Begins - The album opens with a long cymbal or gong roll that resolves into a variously passionate description of the themes found throughout the album, an overture.  Then there is poetry on the night and the coming of dawn.  The orchestra responds obligingly.<br /><br />Dawn: Dawn is a Feeling - The Moody Blues proper chimes in.  Eternity is invoked in this song of the dawn.  One is still caught perhaps in a dream state or a state of undisturbed blissful hope for the possibilities of life.  The chorus, a gentle, soul guide:<br /><br />You're here today<br />No future fears<br />This day will last<br />a thousand years<br />If you want it to.<br /><br />The Morning: Another Morning - Okay, we're up now and a busy day is ahead of us full of childhood fun.  The lyrics recall the timelessness of childhood the morning of our lives.  An orchestral transition nudges you forward into the day.<br /><br />Lunch Break: Peak Hour - We are definitely moving now in 60s-toned orchestral effects; the orchestra invokes images of downtown in the city and everyday human industry.  The Moody Blues play an upbeat song.  The topic is akin to \\"Good Morning Good Morning\\" by The Beatles and \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" by Chicago...to what end are we all so crazily running around?<br /><br />The Afternoon: Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)/Time to Get Away - \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" is a dreamy song about the afternoon, presently mystical rather than wistful.  Tuesday is, perhaps, not a day thought of as worthy of song but The Moody Blues find plenty to sing about creating a unique song and perspective on a day as a result.  This track also includes another song \\"Time to Get Away\\" which moves from lightly ominous to a more joyful mood.<br /><br />Evening: The Sun Set/Twilight Time - With, perhaps, the last burst of the daytime's intense activity the orchestra gives way to an exotic song (sound maybe gamelan-like/Asian).  This changes the tone a bit making the familar, seem unfamiliar and full of a strange and unearthly power.  Then an orchestra interlude resolves the exotic into something more sensual.  The second song in this track is a piano rocker with spiritual chorus soaring in the background; the world of dream seems to take hold again.  Perhaps both songs mean to bring us round to this other-world.  Plenty of song time is given to the night in this album of day and night.  The song ends with an orchestral transition into the deeper night.<br /><br />The Night: Nights in White Satin - Perhaps this song is meant to dissolve the passions of the whole album into two lover's sharing their passion.  The chorus is lke some haunting ache of love in the darkness.  If you have a heart this song will bring you tears of joy.  The orchestra brings in the climax of this song.  Further orchestration and poetry and finally the deep splash of the gong bring this song and album to a close.<br /><br />(5 stars) Days of Future Passed is an early concept album which elevates pop-rock to an art.  Music can take us on an emotional journey through imaginative landscapes and this album does so with creative passion.  The band and orchestra work nearly seemlessly together here making this a great example of this kind of collaboration.  This album compares well to The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" as a much clearer concept album with more compassion and the mellotrons seem to amplify the sense of the mystical as well.  This makes \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" seem darker and sarcastic in comparison.<br /><br />I recommend the album as a whole to progressive rock fans and the following songs specifically:  \\"Dawn: Dawn is a Feeling\\",\\"The Afternoon: Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)\\" (not so much \\"Time to Get Away\\"), \\"The Evening: The Sun Set/Twilight Time\\",  and \\"The Night: Nights in White Satin\\".e Evening: The Sun Set/Twilight Time\\",  and \\"The Night: Nights in White Satin\\".
B0000DJZAH|1.0|I have received two albums; returned the first album because CD#2 would not be recognized by any of the four CD players I put it in.  I am sending back #2 for the same problem. I would think others have had this issue and it is not corrected.  I will send #2 back for a refund.
B00288KNL8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, the characters in the alternate reality were quite endearing. The animation, similar to \\"A Nightmare Before Christmas\\" was done well. The story line reminded me a little of \\"Pans Labyrinth\\" (The old secret door in the wall thing)but I would not recommend to children under 10. My 7 and 5 year olds' were scared to the point of leaving the room and they loved \\"A Nightmare Before Christmas\\". Overall a neat movie, definitely a re-watch.

B001FB55H6|4.0|The story is interesting but could have used a bit more character development, a fairly intelligent plot line, it did keep me interested throughout. I will watch it again. The special effects and computer animation was as good as I have seen it so far. Very hard to distinguish between CGI an real life (and I was looking for it). Overall I recommend this movie and especially in Bluray.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This box set is the most awesome dvd that has ever been through my system and I am speaking of a very high end audio system and a new hd tv with 240 hz and companion blue ray dvd player. As for as I am concerned this box set is way under-priced by Amazon. You will more than get your money's worth from this set. I had other people watching and they just went ballistic when they saw and heard this.
B0001WTWCO|4.0|I love this movie and all the extras.  However the quality of the DVD wasn't so great.  It's like a copy of a copy, there are lines and dots that show up throughout the movie that are a little distracting.  I'm disappointed with that.
630521610X|4.0|You will like Scream. In my late teens and twenties, I stopped going to see the slasher movies of that era<br />because they were plotless, had gratuitous violence and gave me nightmares. So I was reluctant to see Scream. I waited until it came out on video tape (Yeah, its been that long) however I enjoyed it and didn't feel scared because of the tongue in cheek nature of the film and the funny moments that lessen the shock of the violence But , the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat and the twists and turns keep you guessing who is the killer and why are they trying to kill Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). The revelation of the killers was surprising, since it seemed that someone older was doing the killings.<br /><br />Since I enjoyed Scream I made it a point to see Scream 2 in the theater, followed by Scream 3. I recently read the filming of Scream 4 began this Summer. I wonder if Sidney, Gale and Dewey will finally be killed off?<br /><br />I am going to order the trilogy on DVD since I don't own any of the series in this format.

B0025KVLTM|5.0|\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" may not have been the first \\"concept album\\" -- the Beach Boys' unreleased \\"Smile\\" and the Pretty Things' \\"S.F. Sorrow\\" arguably got there first. (And Franz Schubert predated all of them 140 years earlier with his album-length song cycles \\"Die schone Mullerin\\" and \\"Winterreise\\"). But characteristically, the Beatles' magnum opus went farther and further than the others, expanding the boundaries of what constituted popular music. Forty-two years after its original release and what seems like a century's worth of deification, SPLHCB still sounds fresh, ground-breaking and amazingly unpretentious -- and tightly constructed in comparison to some of the excesses that would come along in the 1970s.    Aside from the SPLHCB tracks that were recycled for the 1968 \\"Yellow Submarine\\" movie and thus appear on the 1999 \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\" release, I've never heard this album in digital format before now. I never thought to pick this up in its 1987 CD incarnation, because having known this record since childhood, for many years I had fallen out of love with it, buying into the idea that this was a wildly overpraised relic of the \\"Summer of Love.\\" It's just as well that I didn't acquire that earlier CD version, because the sound of the '87 releases was thin and harsh, and SPLHCB has always deserved first-class sonic treatment. Which it gets here, allowing the formerly skeptical listener to re-hear it with new ears. It's idle to pretend that this record \\"sounds like it was recorded yesterday,\\" as some reviewers breathlessly proclaim; dozens of circa-1967 tracks crammed onto a 4-track tape ain't gonna be confused with a modern production. But it does shine like the proverbial old painting that has been scrubbed clean of grime. And one of the macro-details that comes through in this remastering is the handmade quality of those dense, complex arrangements: all the more dazzling for being just a tad more fallible and \\"human\\" than a clinically perfect studio job of today.    On first listen to this CD, I followed the \\"original\\" order, as mentioned in the liner notes, of the seven songs that constituted Side 1 of the LP (i.e., \\"SPLHCB\\"/\\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" followed by \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,\\" \\"Fixing a Hole,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,\\" \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"She's Leaving Home\\"). Much as I wanted to believe that the original sequencing would be more effective, I can't say it did much for me, although \\"She's Leaving Home\\" as a side-closer works well. This record, after all, is the end product of many, many revisions and \\"let's try this instead\\" second thoughts; the re-ordering of the Side 1 tracks is just one of them. And kudos to George Martin or whoever came up with the revised order of the first seven tracks as finally released; it flows better musically.

B000002UAR|5.0|A lifelong Beatles fan (I was 2 when \\"Love Me Do\\" was issued, and just shy of 10 when the band broke up), I count \\"Revolver\\" as the Fab Four's best record. Not their most ambitious (that would be either \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or the White Album, each for different reasons) but their zenith as a song-making phenomenon and as a cohesive band. Put another way, \\"Revolver\\" took them as far as they could go along the path they were on and meant that for their follow-up, the Beatles would have to re-invent themselves, as they did. But the basis for that reinvention is all here in 35 minutes of concentrated creativity.    Growing up, I was a strictly American-oriented Beatles fan, which means that three tracks on the British release of \\"Revolver\\" were known to me only from \\"Yesterday and Today,\\" one of assorted \\"compilations\\" that Capitol Records used to carve out about 11 U.S. LPs from the seven that the band released overseas between 1963 and 1966. Therefore I never caught up to \\"Revolver\\" in its entirety until the wretched-sounding 1987 CD reissue. This 2009 remaster brings out not only a ton of detail and definition but also a forward impetus and underlying energy that the flat-sounding '87 disc is largely missing. (I suspect the varying opinions of the sound quality on these 2009 remasters have more to do with the performance of individual listeners' audio gear, and the way those listeners listen, than anything else. That said, the sound of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is \\"bigger\\" if also more generalized on the \\"1\\" compilation from 2000.) One quibble: Since the 2009 disc plays for only 35 minutes, there was room not only for the mono version of the LP but also the single \\"Paperback Writer\\" and its flip-side, \\"Rain,\\" both of which complement the overall style and feel of \\"Revolver.\\"
B001MEJY8W|5.0|\\"Martyrs\\" is one of the most shocking films I've ever seen (I'd rank it in the top 5 most shocking - - along with \\"A Serbian Film\\", \\"Irreversible\\", \\"Salo: 120 Days Of Sodom\\", and \\"The Human Centipede\\").  You know you are in for a shocking film when the director records a personalized DVD intro where he apologizes for making the film. If you enjoy the torture horror genre, or if you just love the feeling of impending dread, you will enjoy \\"Martyrs\\".  Otherwise, steer clear if you are faint-hearted or inhibited at all, because this movie is brutal and disgusting all the way through.  In fact, the plot really revolves around torture as opposed to anything else (and that's not me just being lazy in my review; the ENTIRE FILM is torture, beginning to end).  I actually felt really uncomfortable throughout the movie (in a good way). There is no protocol that this film follows, so don't expect cool party scenes, dumb teenage behavior, excessive and/or gratuitous nudity, or happy endings. You have to be tough to even get through this film. If you've got the moxie, I recommend this movie for horror fans and gore hounds alike, but brace yourself, because \\"Martyrs\\" is vicious, nasty, and harrowing. If you're a gore hound like me, this film definitely delivers the goods, but that's not all you get here. There's a great movie underneath all the nastiness... a movie with a deeply nihilistic rhythm that will stay with you through the next day after you watch it. Highly recommended!! 5 stars!!<br /><br />***UPDATE*** - There is currently a remake of \\"Martyrs\\" in the works. It will be an American remake. I don't like to judge films before they are released, but seriously, this \\"Americanized\\" remake sounds like a bad idea. The director, Daniel Stamm (the filmmaker behind \\"The Last Exorcism\\"), says of his upcoming remake:  \\"Martyrs is very nihilistic. The American approach [that I'm looking at] would go through all that darkness but then give a glimmer of hope. You don't have to shoot yourself when it's over.\\"  I'm just saying, if that's the way they approach the remake, they will be betraying the original film too much. To purposefully tone down the grittiness of this film sounds like the definition of selling out to me. I say don't remake it. It's good the way it is.when it's over.\\"   I'm just saying, if that's the way they approach the remake, they will be betraying the original film too much.

B0025KVLTW|4.0|Compared to the Beatles' other 1967 LP, \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" this collection is less cohesive--and well it might be, since the original LP was a side of songs from a Beatles TV movie that is by turns self-indulgent and endearingly odd and a side of hit singles and B sides. Some of the band's choicest cuts from that era reside here, though, notably \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Fool on the Hill.\\" And I'm glad, mostly, to have them and the rest of the collection in this 2009 remastering, which both clarifies the Fab Four's \\"psychedelic\\" textures and allows you to hear just how much was going on there. I never heard the 1987 remastering, which is just as well.     Where this loses a few points is the unsettling segue from stereo to mono to pseudo-stereo in \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" which could've been managed with a little more finesse. Also, as a fan with a fairly long memory, I would've liked the original mix of \\"All You Need is Love,\\" which has a bit more punch and also runs a little longer at the fadeout (\\"Greensleeves\\" makes another appearance) -- but the mix done later for the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" movie seems to be the standard these days. For that matter, \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\" also ran a little longer before it, too, was remixed for the 1968 animated flick.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Having appeared in practically every male oriented movie genre in his long career, Clint Eastwood has matured into one of the finest directors and actors the industry - and the public - have seen.<br /><br />  Nearing 80, Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a character of roughly the same age. His wife has just died and Walt is living alone in his home of many years, the last Caucasian in a neighborhood that is suffering severely from \\"diversity\\". Kowalski retains the characteristics of the America he grew up in. He is an unrepentant racist, cursing his Hmong neighbors, the Latinos and blacks who, in his eyes, have destroyed his neighborhood. His is a rough camaraderie where \\"real men\\" zestfully hurl ethnic insults at each other.<br /><br />  We quickly learn that Kowalski barely speaks with his two grown sons and their families. They have never, it seems, lived up to his expectations. A far too young and callow priest visits Kowalski, urging him to take confession because his late wife wanted him to. Kowalski reacts as you might expect.<br /><br />  The next door neighbors are Hmongs. While Walt smokes his cigarettes and drinks his beer on the front porch, the Hmong grandmother glares at him, muttering insults in Hmong. Eastwood does the same in English.<br /><br />  Kowalski spent three years fighting in Korea and we learn early through the explorations of his obnoxious grandchildren that he has some sort of medal from his service. He returned to work on the Ford assembly line for 50 years.<br /><br />  Now he is alone. Old and alone. He has only his smokes, his beer and Jim Beam, his dog Daisy and his 1972 Ford Grand Torino.<br /><br />  Next door live the Hmong family with two Americanized children, Sue, a girl in her later teens and Thao, who is something of a momma's boy. A Hmong gang wants Thao to join and isn't very gentle in its persuasion.<br /><br />  Kowalski, belying his years, rescues Thao once and then his sister Sue, establishing himself as a hero in a neighborhood held hostage to the gangs.<br /><br />  A reluctant friendship grows between Kowalski and the Hmong, particularly with the young Thao, to whom he becomes a mentor.<br /><br />  Dramatic events pile up quickly and Kowalksi is clearly on a path with his destiny in his dreary Detroit suburb.<br /><br />  Eastwood directed this magnificent film and his acting is superb. He has Kowalski's character down pat. Others may see the resonance between \\"Gran Torino\\" and John Wayne's last two films. Eastwood is aware of his aging and he plays the part as if it were real - perhaps because it is.<br /><br />  I was uncomfortable with some parts, perhaps because it seemed to give up too much to \\"diversity\\" and \\"multi-culturalism\\" without asking some obvious questions. But I certainly can't fault the movie for that.<br /><br />  In its own way, this film is as great as \\"The Unforgiven\\", not so much for the story (which is good) but because of Eastwood's direction and acting.

B002BSHXJA|2.0|I have both the stereo and mono boxsets and will say, without a doubt, that I prefer the stereo set, hands down.  There is nothing wrong with the remastering job on the mono box, and as for the effort of preserving the true original versions of The Beatles' albums, it is a five star effort.  However, I personally cannot stand the sound of mono.  Although the monos are the originals and there may be some mistakes or inaccuracies in the stereo mixes, I still think the stereo sounds a million times better.  Just because something is the original doesn't always mean it is better.  I don't think that anyone would argue that a movie that was originally released on vhs, before the advent of DVD is better on vhs than on a remastered transfer to DVD, simply because the vhs was the original.  The stereo remasters sound vibrant, colorful, and immersive.  The mono remasters, by contrast, sound flat, dull, boring, and lifeless.  They sound muddy, as if John Lennon had come back to life and was singing the songs from inside his casket buried in the ground and you were listening to him sing from above ground.  Ok, maybe not quite, but to someone who has grown up listening to nothing but stereo his whole life, that's about what it sounds like.  The bottom line is this: if you have grown up listening to all stereo your whole life, like myself, I would not recommend the mono boxset at all.  I would highly doubt you would enjoy it.  If you grew up when these albums were originally released, and bought them in mono, you will love the nostalgia of the mono box and its faithfully restored and remastered sound.  I do not think there is anything wrong with the mono box set and think that it is just as well done as the stereo box, if mono is what you enjoy; but to someone who doesn't like mono or is not used to mono, it will sound more like a demaster than a remaster.  I have had to force myself to even get through a whole album from the mono set.  To my ears, it sounds so ugly that I have to fight turning it off and popping in the stereo version of the same album.  I am sure the people who prefer mono feel the same way when they hear the stereo version.  That is why I will not say that either box is better than the other, only that I prefer the stereo.  Whichever you prefer is the one that is best for you.to fight turning it off and popping in the stereo version of the same album.

B000U1ZV8K|3.0|I've loved these films since I was very young.  I was very excited to see a collection of all four films together.  It was interesting to have 2 discs that you flipped over to see the next film as I've never owned discs like this.  The disappointment is that there are no real extra features.  No interviews, no blooper reels, no featurettes (except for one that was footage from Lethal 2 that was a few minutes).  Lethal 4 has a director's commentary but the other 3 films had none, which is such a shame for a much loved film series.  Otherwise, I'm still glad I made the purchase.
B00117S4GS|3.0|I have to say I really love Supernatural.  Horror, hot women, rock n roll and great suspense makes for a fun series.  I also love the family theme they carry throughout the series.  The family spats you eventually get into make for good comical moments and conflict.  The makeup, sound, special effects and suspense in these hour shows sometimes make you want to turn on the lights late at night more than many horror movies do.  I'm just now starting to catch up having watched Season 3 and 4 when I had nothing else to watch and decided to give the show a try.  I've yet to be disappointed by any episode.    The reason for the 3 stars is directed at Amazon because some episodes are not available for Watch Now.  I can't understand the licensing restrictions and how they are per episode instead of per season.  Whether some exec or some Digital Rights Management group chose to demonstrate they have power over their content or some discussion between them and Amazon fell apart, I can't fathom why they punish the consumer.    Please Amazon, fix this stupid mistake.  I will be less likely to buy seasons in the future if you cannot make content delivery consistent.

0307454541|4.0|Despite the rather long and sometimes boring denouement that lasts for almost 100 pages after the actual crime is solved, the late Steig Larsson's novel and the first in his Millennium trilogy, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is quite a tantalizing read.<br /><br />Perhaps it is the setting that intrigues from the get-go.  Moving back and forth from Stockholm to the Norrland (about four hours north of the capital in what is described as a very frozen hinterland), Larsson captivates his reading audience with scenes that alternate from scintillating city sophistication to a wealthy family's small town compound that practically snarls with an inbred undercurrent so sinister it chills the blood.  The cruel winter cold and sunless days add an existential ambiance that is reminiscent of Danish author Peter Hoeg's stark reality in his novel, `[[ASIN:0385315147 Smilla's Sense of Snow]]' but, far more readable.<br /><br />Immersed in both backdrops are the two main characters--that although as different as night and day are Larsson's tribute to Scandinavian children's author Astrid Lindgren.  As a modern day red and green striped knee sock wearing [[ASIN:0142402494 Pippi Longstocking (Puffin Modern Classics)]], the tattooed and pierced, nonconformist Lisbeth Salander is the waif-like yet powerfully independent girl described in the title.  In her early twenties, she obviously and unfortunately has lived through some catastrophically defining events that have left her sullen and psychologically bereft.  Nonetheless, endowed with a quick mind and photographic memory, she can hack her way into the most complicated computer systems unearthing private and confidential material on whomever she chooses.  As an employee of Milton Security, she can do a background check on anyone with details pulled from the past that even the subject doesn't remember.<br /><br />Her counterpart is Mikael Blomkvist, a financial journalist that runs Millennium magazine with a strict and sound morality based on his own Eagle Scout ethics.  Like the boy detective he derives his nickname from--Lindgren's  `Kalle Blomkvist'[[ASIN:B000GRHTJM Bill Bergson, Master Detective]]--he crusades for what is right and good yet swings on a sexual level with all the legendary nonchalance and promiscuity of a stereotypical seventies Swedish stewardess. Middle-aged, divorced and undeniably attractive to a multitude of women of all ages, Blomkvist practically emits high principles, self-assuredness and confidence like gamma rays.  But all is not well in this protagonist's domain.  Accused and convicted of fifteen counts of libel, Blomkvist remains steadfast albeit stymied as his well-respected reputation is put on the line protecting a source that would otherwise substantiate his innocence. While on an anxious hiatus awaiting a short prison sentence, he is hired by Vanger, a retired billionaire industrialist to solve the mystery of the 40-year-old disappearance of Vanger's niece under the public cover of chronicling the family's business history.<br /><br />As Blomkvist and his good intentions muddle through his investigation in the cold North Country of the Vanger clan's domain, in a format similar to an alternating chapter account, Larsson familiarizes his reader to the odd background of his punk Pippi Longstocking who operates under a whole other moral accountability.  Eventually, the two main characters meet and combine efforts in a more than satisfactory chain of events that buzz along with the sturdy pragmatism of a Volvo and the hair-raising momentum of a finely tuned Italian Bugatti.<br /><br />While Larsson's mystery intrigues the reader with its own merit, what sets this semi-police procedural apart are the side stories that define the two main characters.  Please note that the novel is translated from the Swedish and this may account for the at times perceived two-dimensional-ness of the Larsson's Kalle/Pippi duo. These characters endure a lot but seem to handle it allextraordinarily well with an almost Rambo-like resilience that has the potential to make their careening vigilante behavior predictable rather than realistic with pauses in the action that take into consideration psychological impact and implications. On the other hand, Larsson plays his hand close to the vest--nothing superfluous is revealed which enables him to utilize the unknown later under completely different circumstances that substantiate further installments that star and further flesh out the individual entities of the Blomkvist/Salander alliance.  Unfortunately, Larsson died in 2004 completing only three novels in this potentially savory series--the second \\"[[ASIN:0307269981 The Girl Who Played with Fire]]\\" achieves that page-turning effect that all writers wish to emulate while maintaining his credibility without once losing the respect of his audience.  Perhaps someone of note and imagination will pick up the torch and continue to bring the journalist and hacker to life.<br /><br />On a more serious note, Larsson definitely makes some damning statements regarding his opinion on the ineptness of society and the government-run agencies that do little to insure that justice be de rigueur for all its constituents.  Main character Mikael Blomkvist fights against the corruptness of the corporation from the novel's first page to its last.

On the other hand, Larsson plays his hand close to the vest--nothing superfluous is revealed which enables him to utilize the unknown later under completely different circumstances that substantiate further installments that star and further flesh out the individual entities of the Blomkvist/Salander alliance.  Unfortunately, Larsson died in 2004 completing only three novels in this potentially savory series--the second \\"[[ASIN:0307269981 The Girl Who Played with Fire]]\\" achieves that page-turning effect that all writers wish to emulate while maintaining his credibility without once losing the respect of his audience.  Perhaps someone of note and imagination will pick up the torch and continue to bring the journalist and hacker to life.    On a more serious note, Larsson definitely makes some damning statements regarding his opinion on the ineptness of society and the government-run agencies that do little to insure that justice be de rigueur for all its constituents.

B000ILZ66Y|5.0|If you were like me, you picked up a copy of this book thinking you would be slightly entertained, reading about wild stories of this sexually charged performer and his drug-induced anarchy. Reading through these pages, I was not disappointed, in fact, I was moved.<br /><br />I knew Anthony Kiedis was a talent. What I didn't realize was that he was a romantic poet, with a gift for making others feel. I was pleasantly moved learning of his relationship with his mother, a type of bond not all men share. Reading about each of Kiedis's loves, and how integral a part of his journey they were made me eager to keep reading.<br /><br />It's rare that I find a book that makes me pause, whether it is at the end of a sentence or page, to taste and savor the words. After completing this masterpiece, I turned to page one again for second's....then thirds.<br /><br />A must have for your collection. This book will surprise you, take you to bed, shake your soul a little and maybe even help you realize your own journey to self-discovery.

B001QTXM5Y|4.0|Formost, I read the Watchmen as they appeared in comic book form.  When I heard there was going to be a movie, I immediately said it should be done like Lord of the Rings; that is a long movie released in 3 parts.  I was actually pleased the movie was done as well as it was in a shortened format.  Spoiler alert! The only deviation, and part I didn't like was making Dr.Manhattan the fall guy for a sinister plot instead of creating the alien form that was transported to New York to fool the world into thinking they needed to unite to defeat an alien attack.  Other than that, I feel the script/novel was followed close enough, the actors were perfectly chosen for their parts, and the overall movie was excellent.  I did miss Captain Metroplis who actually chaired the first, and only, meeting of the Crimebusters.

B00000ING2|4.0|The Hudsucker Proxy, released in 1994, is the Coen Brothers' homage to screwball comedies of the 1940s, particularly the works of directors like Preston Sturges. This film (co-written with Sam Raimi) was the Coens first film given a substantial budget and it went on to become a box-office failure. Many consider it one of the Coen's worst efforts. But is The Hudsucker Proxy a bad film? Hardly.    The year is 1958 and Waring Hardsucker (Charles Durning), president of Hudsucker Industries, suddenly leaps from the window of his company with no rhyme or reason. Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) is worried about the future of the company and hatches a scheme to get the stock down only to snatch it all up before it rises. For this to work, the company needs a new president, preferably a \\"proxy.\\"    The proxy is naive country-boy Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), who works in the mailroom. He seems to be the perfect candidate, but Norville has a trick up his sleeve, in the shape of a circle.    The other major player is Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a fast-talking, Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter who sees something wrong with the simple-minded Norville's sudden promotion.    As I said earlier in this review, the film is meant to be in the spirit of the screwball comedies of so many years ago. I can almost guarantee I haven't seen a single specific film that inspired this one, but I'm familiar enough with the genre to appreciate what the Coens did here. For what it lacks in story and character, it more than makes up for in style and dialogue.    The dialogue is fast-paced, mile-a-minute, no-nonsense (sort of a contradiction being a \\"screwball comedy\\")dialogue that is not only hard to imitate but certainly hard to come up with. Not only is the dialogue pitch-perfect but the actors know exactly how to deliver it. Furthermore, the cinematography is miraculous and the set design is impeccable. It's hard to ignore how perfectly the Coen's captured the style and humor of thesefilms.    With that said, many have pointed out that The Hudsucker Proxy values style over substance. I can't disagree with that. I think all the actor's played their roles to the best of their ability, but much of it does walk a fine line with parody. Paul Newman, however, is delightful as Mussburger and adds some much-needed austerity to the production.    While considered a rare failure by the Coen Brothers, I would not call this film a failure. It's a screwball comedy unlike any other since the genre was in its prime and it's made even better by having the distinct touch of the Coen Brothers on it. Despite it's imperfections, I find it hard to dislike or dismiss this film.    GRADE: B
B00002E233|4.0|While this movie had the same old storyline as every other creature feature, it had quite a bit going for it. First of all, the animatronic sharks looked so real it was incredible (I wish I could say the same for the CGI sharks...). Secondly, it was very well-acted. I especially liked L.L. Cool J in this film. Third, the main theme score was just down right creepy! There were a lot of creepy scenes that were enhanced by the music, one of which being the shaft scene. This movie was good, but it did have some drawbacks: Samuel L. Jackson and the ending. I won't give away the latter, but trust me, it sucked. As for Mr. Jackson, I never liked him much, and I think he's a horrible actor altogether. Overall, the film was an entertaining, and thrilling adventure film - you can't go wrong with \\"Deep Blue Sea\\".

B001FB55H6|4.0|I was captivated by this movie in the theatre and it does lose something on the small screen.  Since the look and overall tone of this movie is quite dark, even on my plasma I had a hard time seeing the beauty and detail I remembered from my first impression.  It could be that I was dazzled by a new story or just the fact that movies are best enjoyed in a huge cineplex, but I did feel myself squinting a lot.  The additional content was enjoyable and added more to the story from my perspective.  Plus I like the fact that I got a digital copy.  I don't think I'll buy any more movie unless they come with the digital version.  Maybe the studios will get the hint if we all do that.
0307341569|5.0|With \\"Dark Places,\\" Gillian Flynn barges into the very front ranks of American crime fiction writers. And note I didn't say female crime fiction writers. I'm talking across the board. Some will say the ending is a bit too twisty. I say it is earned.    About the \\"dark\\" factor. Child murder is involved here. This book is probably not for most fans of Janet Evanovich and Carl Hiasson (actually I am a fan of Carl, but Janet's not my cup of tea) if they like cuteness with their crime.    Flynn's prose style deserves special attention as being marvelously effective. She is a master at showing the detail that brings the whole scene into focus. I found myself lingering on incredibly evocative sentences. I did not find a single cliche in this book. I cannot recall an American crime fiction writer this dexterous with words and images. I can only compare her with Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine, who's a Brit.    When I said above that the ending is earned, I mean that Flynn shows the mean, really mean, poverty that afflicted Kansas farmers in the 1980s. A desperate farm mother reduced to feeding her four kids soup and mustard sandwiches. Plus, her kids are semi-brats. Plus her ex-husband is a good-for-nothing redneck alcoholic (the depiction of Runner Day is really disturbing). It's one thing being somewhat poor. Quite another facing the abyss of total destitution if you are the mother of four. Your heart really goes out to Patty Day.    The central question is who committed the slaughter in the Day family farmhouse 24 years earlier, leaving only 7-year-old Libby Day, who fled out of the house into a subfreezing night,as a witness (maybe) to the deaths of her two sisters and mother. Her brother, who was 15 at the time,  is serving a life sentence for the crime. A club of crime junkies pays Libby $500 just to show up at their meeting. Now broke, she discovers that she can collect hundreds of dollars from crime aficinados if she uncovers new aspects of the crime, especially since many think her brother is innocent. She sets out on that mission.    Libby is a difficult protagonist. Obviously traumatized at an early age, she is cranky, lazy, kleptomaniacal, cynical and rude. Until galvanized into action, she spends her days glaring at her unfriendly neighbors. She is a hard protagonist to get behind.    I read Flynn's debut novel \\"Sharp Objects\\" and was impressed. The protagonist Camille Preaker was as off-the-map strange but as compelling as Lisbeth Salander in the Millenium trilogy. I thought we might see the return of Camille, but apparently Flynn is not interested in an ongoing character. \\"Dark Places\\" is a significant step up from \\"Sharp Objects.\\" This is a writer to watch.    With Libby Day, the author creates someone  who is as hard to cozy up to as Camile Preaker, but no less compelling. I cannot wait to see what Flynn comes up with next. She has talent to burn.

B000WYCF6Q|3.0|Likes: The device is small and lightweight and fits in many possible positions on the bike. Because it is so small, the mirror easily retains its set position (the tightness of the mount is adjustable) and doesn't show much road vibration in the image.    Dislikes: In the device I received, the mirror surface is a bit warped so that image has noticeable distortion. It is not so bad that I cannot use it. However, the quality of the device is therefore poorer than my Cyclestar mirror, which has a 3\\" diameter circular shape, has insignificant surface distortion, seems as stable in image vibration as the Zefal, has great adjustability, and originally cost about the same as the Zefal.    If I ever buy a Zefal Spy bike mirror again, it won't be done online -- I will have to see the device in a brick-and-mortar store.

B000FAGGWQ|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy Bonus Material DVD is really good.  Plain and simple.  It is an excellent set of documentaries that discusses the making of the three movies (episodes IV, V and VI).  I especially enjoyed the features on A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.  George Lucas and many of the actors from these movies discuss what went on behind the scenes and tell lots of neat little stories.  It's interesting to hear how A New Hope almost never came to be, and how the crew had to hurry up and finish the movie in a short period of time with many obstacles standing in the way of progress.  Other features talk about the evolution of the light sabre, the characters of Star Wars, the special effects, interviews, and behind the scenes footage.  If you like the whole Star Wars saga, then you'll love this DVD.  Definitely worth the money.  It is 236 minutes long (3 hours and 56 minutes).<br /><br />I have the 4-DVD Star Wars Trilogy that features episodes IV, V, and VI and this disc called Bonus Material.  This set was released in 2004.  These are the movies that were not the exact theatrical releases from 1977, 1980, and 1983.  Modern computer technology was used to slightly alter and make these movies closer to what Lucas had originally envisioned them to be back in the late '70s and early '80s when he couldn't do some of the things he wanted because of smaller budgets and the non-existence of computer generated images.  At the same time, there no doubt was an effort made to have these movies be more in line with Episodes I, II, and III as far as the look and technology goes.  Unfortunately, I think this was the wrong approach to take.  Lucas should have made episodes I, II, and III using episodes IV, V and VI as a reference point or an example.  In other words, the technology/spaceships in episodes I, II, and III should have been less advanced than in episodes IV, V, and VI.  Instead, everything is MORE advanced for the most part.<br /><br />Personally, I like the original theatrical releases of these movies, but there are some good changes made to these movies that I accept, particularly the Emperor's hologram and Cloud City in Episode V.  If you're curious about these 2004 updated movies, then I would recommend them.  If not, then you can still buy the Bonus Material DVD separately.al releases of these movies, but there are some good changes made to these movies that I accept, particularly the Emperor's hologram and Cloud City in Episode V.

0385507755|1.0|My 17 year old read this book first and was so shocked and sickened by this story.  Well, when I read it I was shocked and sickened by the tremendous amount of fictitious bravado and crap this guy was pedaling.  If you are thinking of buying this book please google \\"James Frey\\" first.  I agree with other reviewers, I just can't believe Oprah,in all her infinite glory, didn't have someone do some fact checking.  I am not an addict, however, I can't imagine this does anything to make an addict want to get better or help to inspire anyone.  Shame on you James Frey.
0061537969|5.0|Every ten to twenty years you encounter a book that is so extraordinary it has the potential to change your life.  \\"The Art Of Racing In The Rain\\" is such a book.  I would give this book ten stars or an infinity of stars if I could.  This is NOT just a story about a man and his dog.  It is a story about life, death, the failures of conventional medicine, the will to die, the power to transcend.  This book is a keeper.  So many books (most) that I read I just pass along.  This one is a keeper that I will reread every now and then....and refer to specific parts or even single sentences when I am in need of inspiration.  I don't have the words to convey the sense of wonder that I found in this book.    I LOVE this book!!!!  And Enzo is now one of my heros and definitely a soul mate. I'll keep MY eyes wide open too!!!....because death is definitely NOT the end.
0312944926|4.0|Looking at this as as fictional work, which it is, it makes for a very entertaining read.  There were enough plot twists and intrigue to keep me reading to the end.  This is not as good as his other novels, Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons and Deception Point, but still fun reading.  A somewhat recognizable plot but no regrets, much better than some other trash I could have read!
B00004XQP4|5.0|So, this was one of the lesser known, or cared for, Green Day albums. But, I think it is a very great album. I find it as one of their better albums, next to Dookie and 21st Century Breakdown. So, allow me to go in depth with you to review this album.    1. Warning (9/10) Not one of my favorite songs, but a good one, nevertheless. A good way to kick start an album. People don't seem to think that Green Day could have topped this song on this album, but there are better to come.  2. Blood, Sex and Booze (9/10) Such a kinky and catchy tune! It's like one catch to another hook. You wont see it coming the first time around.  3. Church On Sunday (10/10) I'm not promoting anything, but this song is so good, I did a cover of it. It is another catchy song, but has a different message than the others. Fun song!  4. Fashion Victim (8/10) I never really got into this song until the 4th or 5th listen. Now, I find it funny that I didn't like it sooner.  5. Castaway (8/10) Sadly, I never gotten into this song... I haven't listened to it in a while, so maybe I will think differently next time around.  6. Misery (10/10) Oh yes... That is all I have to say is that. The song is completely different than the rest of the album, making it so odd. Then the kick of the song comes along that you never see coming. It reminds me of \\"Peacemaker\\" from 21st Century Breakdown.  7. Deadbeat Holiday (9/10) A fun jam to listen to. Sadly, I never liked it until my... 11th listen. But hey. Not everything is good the first 10 times around.  8. Hold On (7/10) An okay song, but even if this song is about death, it doesn't feel like so... The only disappointing song on the album.  9. Jackass (10/10) Another song I covered. So hooky and catchy, you wouldn't think Green Day, or even Billie Joe wrote this song. Sends a nice message basically saying that being a fool isn't always a good thing.  10. Waiting (10/10) Another song that you wouldn't expect for this album. A song that simply says \\"Do not give up on that dream that you have had for so long, because that opportunity might hit you someday.\\" will usually get a 10 in my book.  11. Minority (10/10) I knew this song was on the album, but near the end? Oh well. I like the way it is written. It is a song against authority, like what Green Day is. Against all major authority. They don't care about the rules, they just want to play.  12. Macy's Day Parade (10/10) A very touchy song... All that you want you might not get is what this song feels like it is based around. A nice way to end the album. I wish that there was more...    Oh wait. Did I forget that I accidentally got the UK version? So there IS one more song.    13. 86 (Live in Prague) (8/10) Originally from Insomniac, this exclusive live version isn't as good as the original. But it is still as energetic as the original...    Okay, so maybe I didn't get the UK version... But I felt it should have been included...    So that wraps up another review on another album. Please pick this up wherever it is sold, since I almost didn't get it.

0316044938|5.0|I was given a copy of The Lovely Bones to take on a cross-country flight and ended up reading it straight through on the plane. Not only is it beautifully written, but Sebold expertly captures and conveys the raw emotion of a family in post-tragedy turmoil. Early in the story, the Salmon family is ripped apart by the murder of their daughter, Susie. The Lovely Bones is told from Susie's point of view as she watches her loved ones (and her murderer) from Sebold's unique interpretation of heaven. It is a heartrending story, as any about the rape and murder of a child would be, but it manages to end with a note of hopeful redemption. After many difficult years, Susie's family is finally able to emerge from the depressive wake of her murder, and the entire Salmon family - Susie included - learns how to let go and move on.
B00012QLQ4|1.0|Kaneda / 013023153899<br /><br />It's always strange to come away from a movie disliking it and then see a plethora of reviews hailing it as the best thing ever. Inevitably doubt sets in, and I find myself wondering what it is that all those other people saw in this movie that I did not, but I just didn't like \\"Akira\\" at all.<br /><br />Where do I start? I guess my biggest problem with this film is the overwhelming sense that important details (such as character motivation) have been blithely omitted on the grounds that \\"deep\\" or \\"meaningful\\" movies don't need such petty concerns. Tetsuo in particular seems driven by no motivation other than malevolent evil and madness and feels like a terrible rendition of a DBZ villain - he only seems interested in fighting for the fight itself, in order to be the most powerful one left standing. That kind of motivation is fine enough in a Bond shoot-em-up, but I expect more from a movie that's supposed to make me think. Kaneda, too, seems motivated not from character development or environment constraints, but merely because the movie *requires* him to behave in certain ways. It seems unreasonable that Kaneda would practically throw away his life trying to kill Tetsuo - or rather, it seems not at all unreasonable for a *movie character* to do such a thing, but a \\"realistic\\" character would seemingly take the first chance to make himself scarce... or at least consider it. Kaneda seems not even to acknowledge the possibility.<br /><br />Other questions abound. Why do the strange children look so old and green, and why do they attack Tetsuo, and why do they attack him with teddy bears bleeding milk from their eye sockets? Why are all the biker kids almost completely interchangeable, dialogue and all? Why is the government willing to pour money into a super-secret super-kid project, and then only hire a handful of guards and one scientist to guard these expensively godly goblins? Why, for the love of all that is sane, are all heroines required by law to fall for the hero who is rude, largely foolish and ineffectual, and has a bad tendency to flash the words \\"author insert character\\" above his head in green neon letters?<br /><br />As for the touted depth and complexity behind this movie, I was blown away with the \\"explanation\\" (courtesy of the heroine) that ants are born with less power than humans, but what if an ant was accidentally born with the power of a human? What a huge mix-up that would be! Only, I wasn't aware that it was \\"power\\" that made us humans so special - I thought it was things like arms and legs and thumbs and a brain that is somewhat larger and more complicated than that of an ant. I'm told the whole thing is supposed to be a Buddhist analogy for something, but as a method to drive the story and explain the character motivation, it doesn't do the job, in my personal opinion.<br /><br />I can't help but also note that for a \\"deep\\" and \\"meaningful\\" movie, this film seems to enjoy itself far too much with the rampant gore and female frontal nudity. One female character - a sweet biker groupie whose boyfriend treats her with complete contempt - seems to exist *solely* for the purpose of sexual violence being played out upon her (twice), while the heroes helplessly watch - there's a tangible feeling of voyeurism and sadism overlaying her character that made me uncomfortable, to say the least.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews, I suspect that \\"Akira\\" might be one of those movies that you have to be part of the 'in-group' in order to properly understand and appreciate it. And that's fine - it's not my place to start demanding explanations, character motivation, development, or basic plot elements over special effects and in-group backstory. But if you're not already a part of the Akira fan base, and are an outsider like me, then be aware that you may end up as frustrated and irritated by this movie as I was. Then again, Roger Ebert apparently liked this film well enough,so it's entirely possible that I'm just in the minority.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollso it's entirely possible that I'm just in the minority.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
B0002DB50E|3.0|No matter how you take this movie (I like to think that it's a camp take-off on a Vincent Price movie) it seems a shame to waste the acting talents of Blondie and James Wood on so prosaic a story.  Cronenberg is able to do such a good job at making the most salacious sado-masochistic scenes look positively mundane.  He also makes a naked Deborah Harry about as sexy as a dishrag.      OK, how can you take anyone named Dr. O'Blivien seriously, no matter how engrossed he is in his subject (not to mention where did he get such a 'hot' daughter).  The idea that at some point, whether with the help of drugs or a type of brainwashing, we will have the ability to control people through the images sent through their TV sets.  It's currently being tried in North Korea where the TVs are two way and every one can be watched.    Does this film make a statement, well yes, but the real question is: Is it worth listening to the message?    Zeb Kantrowitz
B00168HARG|5.0|I can't say enough good things about Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (TSCC). It's not a \\"Terminator of the Week\\" show. It's a drama with excellent writing, acting, character development and stories that happens to have some action.  It's an intelligent show - I've seen the entire first season multiple times and each time, I pick up on something new.  It makes me think.  The writers often leave things open to interpretation, which has fueled my imagination and left me wanting more. Bear McCreary's soundtrack is fantastic and adds another layer of brilliance to the series.  This is a series you'll want to watch over and over again.    TSCC is a story about a mother struggling with her son growing up, while literally having the survival of humanity on both their shoulders. It is a story about a boy becoming a man learning how to become the future leader of the human resistance.  It's a story about how to deal with knowing what the future holds.  It's a story about hope.  It's a story about technological progress. It's a story about war and the human effects of being a soldier. It's a story about perseverence.    You won't find a simple story with clear lines between good an evil.  Characters do what they think is best given their missions and the information they have and that may or may not be the right thing or ultimately best thing.  They make mistakes.  They do the wrong thing.    TSCC has trumped HBO's Rome (also an excellent series) as my favorite series ever and that is saying a lot.  I've enjoyed some other sci-fi movies and shows mostly on a casual level, but TSCC has completely tipped the scales and turned me into a full-fledged geek. No series has even remotely come close to engaging me like TSCC has.    If you enjoy this series, be sure to also purchase the second season, which is released on Sept. 22, 2009.  The second season adds firey Scottish singer Shirley Manson (Garbage) and Battlestar Galactica's Stephanie Jacobsen to the amazing cast.  I absolutely cannot wait to crack open my copy.

1416562605|5.0|Not the most uplifting book you'll ever read, but a true masterwork nonetheless. Wrapped in a witty, irreverent narrative, this is both a journalist's and a satirist's take on modern India; the terrible truth about their society and what it takes to succeed in it. Call it the anti-Slumdog Millionaire.
B00006HAZG|5.0|This was an excellent production. The casting of characters were extraordinary.  I enjoyed it very much and watch it over and over again.
0307454541|3.0|If you read primarily for the plot, and if you want your mysteries to have real-world themes, you'll enjoy the hours you spend with Larson's two \\"detectives,\\" a discredited journalist and a maladjusted and abused young woman. All mystery stories move backwards in time even as the investigation moves forward, and this novel takes us back into past acts of industrial wrong doing and sexual violence, both with roots in facism.<br /><br />But if you demand crisp dialogue, economy of style, and a vivid and moving handling of language, you will probably be disappointed. It could have to do with the old problem of translation, but the English in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is flat and nearly toneless. Every character sounds about the same. When the author conveys background information to the reader by way of dialogue, we listen to long, fact-filled paragraphs that never manage to sound like real speech. Moreover, the novel depends on far too many minor characters who never emerge with much individuality; they're just names to remember.<br /><br />Larsson's tale runs to 590 pages. To my mind, it would have been a much better read at about 400--better paced, better focused, and more crisp in its language. It's a shame that such stylistic considerations often go out the window in genre writing. This story needed to lose some weight before going on tour.
B002E01LL6|1.0|I've seen better \\"fight scene editing\\" in the old 1950's cowboy flicks.  I had high expectations.  This movie is just plain horrible.  Don't waste your time with this movie.  It will be on TBS in endless \\"Saturday Morning\\" reruns soon enough.
B000W799NU|5.0|A fantasy that will draw you in to the story.  It's fun with just enough mystery and intrigue to keep you interested.  It's a great movie to share with the whole family.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|The first time I watched this movie I didn't really \\"get\\" it.  But, I was so intrigued by how different it was from other movies I had seen that I watched it a 2nd time and that time I laughed my butt off!!    It's really a must-see film for anyone who grew up in the 80s because of all the \\"flash back\\" items that make an appearance.  For instance, Trapper Keepers (remember those), moon boots!
B000VNMMQG|4.0|By the trailer for this movie I thought that it was the story of how Amazing Grace came about. All and all it was a good movie and I would recommend it to others. A 4 out of 5 rating
B000000XBE|5.0|I love this version of CCR. I bought this CD just to replace my existing cassette tape which was so worn out form extensive use. This is one of their best in my opinion.     Amazon needed to be included in this review because they do such a terrific job in delivery. Never had a problem with Amazon so far.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|This was quite an ambitious undertaking, but ultimately a well made movie. I am biased having read the comic, but understand the hype and recommend watching it.
1401322425|5.0|I am in love with this book -- the recipes are outstanding! Jamie has such a gift for creating unexpected, delicious combinations of ingredients -- I will never make another bbq sauce again without orange zest and orange juice.<br /><br />Not only are there fabulous recipes organized by season, there are some great gardening tips and resources, not to mention gorgeous photography and printmaking art.<br /><br />If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I would!
B000FIMG68|5.0|The first time I started watching season 1 of Lost, I couldn't get interested so I only watched part of the first episode.  Later, after seeing some of the staff of Lost on Top Chef, I decided to try again.  I only had season one, but halfway through, I was hooked!  I quickly ordered seasons 2, 3 and 4 and now I'm just waiting for season five to come out in December.  What a great show to lose yourself in, but don't start watching if you don't have time to spare because it is addictive!
1416594884|4.0|In \\"A Most Wanted Man,\\" Le Carr&eacute; does well, as usual, in depicting characters that are neither all black nor all white.  The more ambiguous the character the more realistic the depictions feels.  But in this novel of post-9/11 Germany and Bush-era American anti-terrorism policies the predictably bad guys are \\"our\\" bad guys and they're a little too predictable.  The result is that the classic sense of impending doom that you get from Le Carr&eacute;'s works come a bit early in the game.  But he still managed to keep a small glimmer of hope in my mind, enough to keep me engaged in the plot right up to the end.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that one of his characters, a lawyer who helps political refugees, is drawn so perfectly that it's worth reading the book just to get acquainted with her.<br /><br />The author's afterword is compelling and disturbing, because he suggests that the story isn't entirely the product of a fiction writer's mind.  If you're a Le Carr&eacute; (or Joseph Kanon) fan you'll feel at home in this book.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|First of all let me start by saying I own every Beatles CD release currently available, and have owned pretty much every vinyl release that has been available in the U. S. and Japan, and have been listening since they were introducing themselves on Ed Sullivan. So how do these new versions stack up to the available domestic versions currently available? If you are expecting these remasters to absolutely blow away anything out there, you may be in for a disappointment. I have spent considerable time comparing, and while I do feel that these versions now stand as the definitive versions, and are the zenith of what's been released-the 1987 releases do give these a run for the money, and I would say in most cases are 80-90% the quality of the remasters, There has been some talk and question about how these stack up with the Capital releases-Again I have done much compariing, and have come to the conclusion that the Capital releases are in many cases competitive with these new remasters,and mostly interchangable- except where there was intentional reverb, such as the I feel Fine massacre. There is a slight improvement here, and there especially in the vocals, and reduction in noise in general, and the new remasters again clean up the mix, especially in the older pre Help! material to a new high point! I think the bottom line here, is that finally we have pulled together in one place, the definitive release, and if that doesn't get you realizing, perhaps again. like it did me, that these guys are before everything, and everyone else in pop music,  than I don't what will do it.<br /><br />That said, I am slightly disappointed, and surprised that a dual disc affair with SACD or even a second disc of DVD audio wasn't  included. One listen to the DVD docs that are included proves what could have been done. Maybe that is being saved for the next big round of releases. All in all though, I am satisfied with this new release, and appreciate having in one place the best of what is currently available in one place, the booklets, and art work is second to none, and if nothing else replace your originals to get the artwork, and treatment the Beatles deserved in the first place. The reviews that are treating this negative, are simply looking for something different than what is offered here, and possibly Apple, and Capitol can  be blamed for releasing too much over the years, there just simply isn't any awful Beatles material still being offered, and as a result making the job difficult for this set. I look forward to hearing and owning the Mono Set as well!ntly available in one place, the booklets, and art work is second to none, and if nothing else replace your originals to get the artwork, and treatment the Beatles deserved in the first place.

1428122672|1.0|I don't think I am giving away any plotline to say this is one of the most irritating of the hundred plus books I have listened to. You know those annoying couples who have cute little inside words for things? This is an entire book of that. Smucking, Gunkie, SOWIESA, Boule, Bouja Moon, African (for a afghan)... they keep bringing them up incessantly as if to remind you how tight a couple they are. I think it made more irritating by the reader trying to lend a new voice to every character. I'd probably give the book two stars if I read it but it get another star knocked off for the grating audio presentation.
B000M341RI|5.0|I especially loved this film as it was so engaging, human, not salacious at all.  Robert Carlyle was especially fantastic.  It was a group of guys who had been laid off work, in desperate need of both a job and funds due to child support which was leading to loss of custody; foreclosure due to a wife unaware of the loss of husband's job and subsequent wild spending; a man's waning loss of self identity due to loss of job and inability to cope with it and his resultant deteriorating love life, etc.  All the men are good guys.  One tried suicide and was thwarted by several others.  None of them would have considered the strip act but for their situations.  So their attempts at learning to dance, pick out the right music, and have the nerve to step out on stage were hilarious.  Also funny was the young son of Robert Carlyle's character reaction to seeing his dad practice in \\"You Sexy Thing\\".  It was really a good film.  I was really surprised when I watched the film how funny and even sweet it was.  I loved the relationships.
0679746048|4.0|First, be warned: this is nothing like the movie. Some of the characters are the same, but this book does not follow the same linear, safe direction as the film. Most of the events of the movie don't even take place in the book. This is a memoir of the truest sense, in that the author explores simply her own understandings of her experience, her illness, and her surroundings. Kaysen's diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder, although not discussed until the final chapters, is the overall theme of this book. Kaysen, like many of her fellow patients, is straddling the line between sanity and insanity, between the world outside the hospital and the world inside. She identifies with both the other patients and the nurses, who each represent the world they inhabit. Even though she feels a kinship with her fellow \\"insane\\" patients, she also longs for the sense of normalcy that the nurses bring in from the outside.<br /><br />Although she is declared \\"recovered\\" upon her discharge in 1969, Kaysen freely admits that once you're insane, that other world never really disappears. It hovers around the edges, and even affects people who have never been inside a hospital, as if she carries a \\"crazy cloud\\" around with her. Kaysen explores the difference between insanity of the brain and insanity of the mind, arguing that each need to be treated differently. She also includes actual documents from her medical records from her time at the hospital, which provide an interesting backdrop for the narrative of the so-called \\"insane\\" person. This isn't The Bell Jar. There is no real mental breakdown, no literary examination of one's own insanity. Although Kaysen does explore her own illness to a degree, this is mostly an exploration of the dual worlds that mentally ill people must inhabit: the world of the sane, and the world of the insane.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I have always loved watching Batman Begins.  I never get tired of it.  Viewing the movie in Blu-ray makes the experience even more worthwhile.    I highly recommend Batman Begins be viewed by all moviegoers in Blu-ray provided they have access to the technology.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|I can't fathom what reviewer \\"Ready Steady Freddie\\" is talking about below.  I loaded my 1987 vintage \\"Revolver\\" CD and the new remastered one in my Bang and Olafsen CD changer, and toggled back and forth.  The difference in sound quality is like night and day!  Not only is the overall recording significantly louder, it's brighter and and more nuanced, and the bass is much more audible.  As I read in another review somewhere, it's like scraping a layer of grime off the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.  It's a vast improvement.  The remastered \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"The White Album\\" sound fantastic too.  If you love the Beatles' music, you'll hear it like you never heard it before.  Don't let Freddie deter you!

B002DKGWSE|3.0|THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT    I remember watching the original film and thinking this is a pretty good movie, in fact Wes Craven's 70's classic is still a good film to this day. So when I heard that once again not only was Hollywood remaking an old classic but it would be another Wes film I was a little upset. Of course the remake of his other classic \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" was actually good so I finally found myself giving this a chance. The result is kinda mixed for me because this is not horrible in any way but it does not leave me feeling like I watched something classic either.    The Collingwood's are a typical family with a slightly over protective mother who is constantly worried any time the daughter wants to go do something, a typical teen who would rather hang out with her friends and not her parents, and of course the easy going father who is wrapped around the finger of his daughter. It is your average family who are going to their house out in the woods for a vacation I guess, just another day. Mari [daughter] once there immediately wants to use the car to leave and go see her friend who works in town. Emma [mother] wants her to stay and have the family moments but John [father] just throws his little girl the keys and tells her to have fun after giving her some cash.     The day is fine until Mari and best friend Paige go off with a young man named Justin to smoke a little of that sticky. The attraction is there between the teens [as usual, oh those hormones] so of course the girls want to make him over and play dress up with him. Only thing is his family who just walked in are crazy and have no problem killing any one at all. So the film goes into crazy mode and we witness the beating, rape and death of these girls, actually one dies and one is raped. As stated earlier in the film a storm is coming and after doing what they do the killers seek refuge at the closest place possible, at the \\"Last House on The Left\\" [da da daaa]. It just so happens that this is Mari's house were her parents offer to help these people, until Mari returns home.    This remake is actually good and while not as memorable as the original still manages to pull off some good moments. The film looks good as most remakes do these days but that takes away the gritty feel of the classics. The writing is decent for this type of film and other than the last scene you could see these things happening and they feel real enough. Adam Alleca and Carl Ellsworth did an ok job as far as the script is concerned and director Dennis Iliadis did a good job making the film flow, and the rape scene was very well done. He made it real enough and uneasy enough and at the same time did not over do it taking it into a porn realm. Writer/director of the original Wes Craven returns as a producer and Sean S. Cunningham of \\"Friday The 13th\\" fame also comes aboard as a producer.    I think the best thing this film has going for it is actually the acting, the leads of this do a great job especially compared to acting in films like this one. Tony Goldwyn who plays John Collingwood does a good job in this film but it is his wife played by Monica Potter who does one of the best jobs on the film. Sara Paxton who played Mari is surprisingly good in this film, I say that because usually whoever plays the young pretty teen in these flicks is usually only cast because of looks. Also Spencer Treat Clark is really good in this film as the only sympathetic character from the group of killers Justin. It is easy to see that he wants nothing to with his family or what they do but he is scared of his father and uncle so much that he can't stand up to them. Aaron Paul who plays his uncle Francis as well is good in this but it is Francis's brother/Justin's father Krug who steals the show. Krug played by Garret Dillahunt is an evil guy who is basically heartless and Garret does an excellent job portraying him in this film.    This film is not a classic at least in my mind but it is good enough for a rental for the most part, maybe even purchase if found at a cheaper price. Other than a few miss steps like the microwave thing which seemed out of place here and   Riki Lindhome's topless over acting [I guess only one of those is bad] as Sadie this is a good remake. For those who have not seen this yet I recommend it, if you like these types of films this is a good choice at the movie store.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Great season!  Shipped fast!  I heard how it ended and it was better than I thought!
B000F48D4Q|5.0|Exciting Western.  Gene Hackman plays a great bad-guy.  Russell Crowe and Gary Sinese are good on the eyes as is Sharon Stone.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Loved every second of this show, thought I wasn't gonna get anything better than Dexter until this came along and I reckon it's just as good.     If you don't like this you're dead.
B00007J36G|5.0|For anyone that is on the fence about buying this album, you are in for a tremendous treat. Everything that I've read about it in other positive reviews rings true. It is PTs finest hour (Even though i liked their follow-up album \\"Deadwing\\" better personally, this album is the better one) This concept album exists in a world of its own once you delve in it and open yourself up to its concepts, music, lyrics and ideas in general. It is a conceptual piece that is mostly about mental illness and serial killers with the exeption of maybe 2 tracks. Stephen Wilson outdid himself on this one. Pink Floyd has a modern contender to take their torch as the premier concept-album prog-space-psychedelic rock band of all time. Wilson might not have quite the virtuosity of David Gilmour in expressive soloing and singing voice, but he comes close. If you like art rock in any form then this is essential listening. I don't give albums 5 stars lightly and this album grows on me more over time as I unravel its subtleties. I'm a fan of all styles of pop music as long as it's creative and intellegently done, and this certainly fits that description. I may have oversold it now, so buy it before you ruin it with unrealistic expectations...
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Wow, this movie rocks.  Yes, the effects with the shooting aren't realistic, but then, this isn't a documentary.  My favorite scene(s) begin in the pharmacy and end with Wesley (main character) passed out in a fast moving vehicle.  Great music too (best of all The Little Things).  All-in-all, a nice violent rompfest.  One of my top 20 choice movies...currently).
0061733199|5.0|I bought the original years ago and know how good it was so when I saw that \\"Lofty\\" wrote a revised version I had to have one. He didn't let me down. Now alot of the book deals with the \\"Shot down behind enemy lines\\" type of survival. The basics are here and we all need to know them.
B002GY9F9K|3.0|The Legend of the Seeker can be enjoyable, don't get me wrong.<br />But it's the inconsistencies in the show that bother me.<br /><br />Kahlan, a female character, is supposed to be able to sense the truth at all times.<br />She warns people not to lie to her repeatedly, and yet in one episode, she's lied to constantly, and is none the wiser.  Um, what?  Way to ruin the series.<br /><br />That's only one example.  This happens many times.<br />If there's one thing I can't take in a story, it's shifting rules and inconsistencies.<br /><br />The acting can be somewhat bad sometimes, as well, but overall, everything else is fine.<br /><br />If you like fantasy, I'm sure you'll at least watch this series once.<br /><br />Rating:  Average
B0027HOBM2|1.0|Just a note of caution:  I purchased a copy which proved unplayable on my Samsung BD-P 1400.  Amazon exchanged it without question.  This copy was also unplayable.  Amazon refunded the full price.  Is this a reason for the low BD versus DVD version?
B0021L8US0|3.0|We had not done our research on this movie and merely bought a ticket and went in. We expected a SCIFI (which I like but my wife does not) and from this perspective she was positively surprised and I a bit less. It is really a movie with a story disguised behind SCIFI and action... and as there is quite a bit of this disguise the movie at times seems a bit chaotic and losing its audience.<br /><br />The underlying story behind clearly is our (mankinds) inability to deal with extreme poverty, refugee's and opposing cultures and values and for highlighting this the team behind the movie should be applauded but it seems at times they got a bit carried away in their 'cover theme' being SCIFI Action scenes. So it ends up being a quite decent action movie (for those who like this) while still being a movie with a message..... It would probably come up a notch if it somehow attempted to raise suggestions for a solution.<br /><br />Rating somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 stars!
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Quality of audio and video is flawless, and the set is presented well.  I like the slim cases, but the cover designs could have been styled a little more consistently to make it feel more like a set.  The extra features are not really inspired.  Most are content you could get from other sources, e.g. the web.  Two commentaries per disc, one a critical reviewer's comment and the other a philosophy analysis (which is by far the more interesting of the two).  Contains all the Animatrix shorts on BD and a 2-disc DVD of extras.    Pity the really good extras are DVD quality only, but since these are mainly documentary-style content, this is not a huge disappointment.  Many of these extras are right from the original DVD special features, so if you own the originals, this will not be a reason to buy.  Since I do not (had the VHS only), it was good to watch.    I would have liked a cast or director's commentary, and a more imaginative, carefully themed presentation to give 5 stars, but I was nonetheless, very happy with my purchase.
B001PR0YBM|5.0|Fantastic movie from Miyazaki. I liked it much better than Spirited Away and about the same as Tonari no Totoro. Ordianarly, dubbed movies bother me. I prefer to watch Anime films in Japanese with English subtitles. I have to admit that Disney did a great job of hiring real actors to do the voice work and that makes a difference. It wasn't like watching a lot of badly dubbed anime from the early 80's.<br />I thought the story was good, the characters likeable, and the message about the environment was there but not too overbearing.<br />I saw it on Saturday afternoon where it was showing on a limited run.<br />I would like to see more anime movies come over if the quality is good. Most of the time I miss the theatrical run and just wait for the DVD so I can turn on the subtitles.<br />If you get the chance to see it, then go out and make the trip. It definitely appeals to the kid in me and I think that it would awaken the kid in even the most harded cynical adult.
0131103628|4.0|One of the rare one which gets to the points with clarity and conciseness.   The only issue is it does not provide corrections to any of the exercises.   No doubt about it, I will recommend it.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Beautiful scenes throughout the earth with world music as a soundtrack makes this really great in bluray.
0380713802|4.0|Bryson is a very funny writer, and this book will not disappoint. If you've ever travelled through Europe, or want to, this book is an unflinching look at many cities and countries, which will leave you laughing your tail off in many spots. Often cynical, insulting but accurate, this is a worthwhile companion to your average tour guide, and ranks up there with the best in travel books.
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|I had read the reviews, seen the pictures, saw that he was on Stones Throw and all I could think was, great...another ironic artist copping a classic musical genre so he can be funny. I was wrong. Mayer, regardless of his initial motivations, has made a picture perfect piece of undeniable pop music that shines as a reminder of how sorely we need real music back on the radio. I would personally send my \\"hit\\" local radio station a dozen roses if they replaced the repetition of things like \\"Do the Stanky Leg\\" or the new Lady GaGa single with \\"Your easy lovin' aint pleasin' nothin\\" or \\"Make Her Mine\\". Also, this album is a great example of proper song constraint. I'd much rather have a 40 minute long album that I listen to on repeat without skipping a song rather than having to cut out half the album to listen to the 3 good songs. Kudos to Mayer Hawthorne and PBW for noticing the possibilities in Mayer's early singles and ponying up the cash for a full album.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Stargate Atlantis is one of the top three TV series of all time for me. Since I had all previous years on DVD there was never a doubt that I would not get Season 5. This is SciFi at its best.
0451209338|5.0|Normally I don't read but I thought I would try reading again.  A friend of mine said her husband reads all the time and can't put the book down.  It is a good book and I am enjoying it.  I have already ordered the next one so I will have it when I finish this one.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|I saw this last summer when came out in theaters.  I enjoyed so much I bought it on Blu-ray.  Just read the title for this review.
0440237688|5.0|Having just read The Giver by Lois Lowry, I can see why she won the prestigious Newbery Medal for this excellent tale about a futuristic, utopian(?) society, one which produces conditions of conformity, sameness and, as a result of strict adherence to the Community's Set of Rules, a society where turmoil does not exist........except for the few who are enlightened. As many have written, I had just as many questions as answers as I plowed thought this quick read in record time. I only wish that I had read this as a teenager, as my children did, where perhaps I could not accurately anticipate what would come next, as adults with more experience can oftentimes do. With that said, there were still suspenseful moments. What prompted me to pick this up from my youngest's bookshelves was the fact that I now work with a new band called Jonas Sees in Color. Read about the band and in particular see why they chose this name above others. [[ASIN:B002LBGB5E Jonas Sees in Color]]
B000W4D94I|4.0|I enjoyed this movie even more on Blu-ray than I ever did on standard DVD.  The picture quality was at least 10 times better than standard DVD.  If you own a Blu-ray player and loved or at least really liked this movie, like I did, then I recommend buying it on Blu-ray.
B001VPJZOK|5.0|This was the movie that made me realize that I was a fan of Scarlet Johansson. Though, I suppose one could and should dedicate the greatness of this film to Woody Allen and he has indeed written and starred in yet another good film.    I happened upon this by chance, not sure why it hasn't received more press but it is an excellent mystery, romance, comedy film that is really interesting.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Great comedy by Laurie and Fry.  They do a tremendous job of portraying the characters true to Wodehouse's books, thus bringing the viewer back to a very different time and place in history, when life was very lighthearted and fun for many.
B000BNX3B4|2.0|Some girlfriends and I rented this movie for a girls night. Can you say disappointed ten times fast? This movie was boring, drab, boring, drab and repeat ten times. There was one funny part and that was when Diane Lane went on a blind date with her father (and really how funny is that?).    If you love dogs, go down to the Humane society and play with them there and avoid this awful boring, not even worthy of a chick flick title, movie.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Let's face it. Her voice isn't what it used to be. But she still sounds MUCH better than a lot of what is passing for music these days. And the songs she's picked are actually really good. I was ready to write this one off, but I gotta give her props. Million Dollar Bill and Nothin' But Love are excellent ways to start this album off. I Look To You borders on the musical equivalent of Ambien, but she sells it. Hoarse voice and all. I Didn't Know My Own Strength is a good Diane Warren ballad and alludes to the trials and tribulations (most of which brought on herself) Whitney's been through. Akon turns in two hot ones, and the closing , Salute, is a good way to end the album. I'm not sold on a few of the songs (Worth It and A Song For You especially) but the ones that are good are REAL good.
B001N26GFC|1.0|My friend and I were excited to watch this move. I don't know who fell asleep first, but we paused it about 30 minutes in and never went back to watching it. I don't even know where to start with this boring film about a unrealistically happy lady who takes driving lessons from a miserable man.
0307386171|5.0|I've long been intrigued by those decision-making points in life that irretrievably change its course.  And I've long been a fan of Ian McEwan.  \\"On Chesil Beach\\" combines the best of this author--his flawless prose with his ability to dilate a day, or in this case an evening, with rich detail and seamless flashbacks into a race-through-the-book reading experience.  Edward and Florence fumble badly through one of those life-defining crossroads as they take 'in love' and fantasies (or nightmares) into reality on their wedding night.<br /><br />Most of us have been in love and dashed with the cold water reality of day-to-day life with our lover now spouse. In an intriguing way reminiscent of the 'choose your own ending' books that my children used to love, McEwan takes us through one couple's choices and consequences, giving us a glimpse of \\"the road not taken\\" and making us realize that, for us as well as Edward and Flo, \\"that has made all the difference.\\"

I haven't read the book but I took the movie as entertainment and a work of fiction and if judged by those standards you will love this beautiful, cunning tale.

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, this quirky film is a breath of fresh air among the usual predictable films that characterize the movies.  It plays like a comic strip on steroids - outrageous and charismatic with unpredictable twists and turns.  Basically, it re-writes the history of World War II.  There is violence throughout, in full bloody living color, the kind that is targeted to make an audience squirm.  And there are holes in the story so large that it makes the plot unbelievable.  But who cares about all its faults when one is encased in watching cinema magic.  That's how I felt throughout and why this film which clocked in at 2 hours and 32 minutes actually felt short to me.<br /><br />So leave everything you ever knew about World War II outside the theater.  And let yourself be transformed by the story, the characters, and the outrageousness of it all.  Brad Pitt is the star in the film, playing the leader of a small group of Jewish American soldiers who wreck havoc on the Nazis.  His is in the film merely for his name though because that particular role could have been played by any number of well-known American actors.  The best performance is by the Austrian actor Christopher Waltz, fluent in English, German, French and Italian.  He is evil, pure evil in a sardonic and polished sophisticated way.  He's the villain we all love to hate and his performance is over the top.  Then there is Melanie Laurant cast as a French Jewish woman whose family has been massacred.  She owns a movie theater in France and plots her revenge.  There's also a German actress, played by Diane Kruger, who is an undercover spy and a Nazi war hero who is having a film made about his glory.<br /><br />The plot is about how all of this comes together.  But the plot is only one element of this film because the genius of it lies in its creation.  It's violent, it's bloody and it's weird.  It couldn't have happened this way at all.  But I loved every frame of it and give it one of my highest recommendations although it is certainly not for everybody.st recommendations although it is certainly not for everybody.
B0021L8US0|4.0|DISTRICT 9 (produced by Peter Jackson & directed by Neill Blomkamp) is an incredible film. If THE DARK KNIGHT brought superhero movies into the real world, DISTRICT 9 brought sci-fi films into the real world. To describe it...it's ALIEN NATION meets BLACK HAWK DOWN (with a little \\"V\\", ALIEN, INDEPENDENCE DAY, TRANSFORMERS, ENEMY MINE, and WAR OF THE WORLDS thrown into the mix). The film is an allegorcial tale concerning refugees (from another planet) shot partly documentary-style. It is gut-wrenching and not for the squeamish. By far, one of the most interesting and original sci-fi films to come out in a long time.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|One of Michael Keaton's early and best performances. The scene at the dinner table with Harry Belafonte's classic soundtrack is great. I'm not a fan of ultra lib' Alec baldwin but this is really Michael Keaton's movie.
B001R60ESE|5.0|It's my first contact with Chris Botti and his work. I watched this Bluray DVD at a friend's home and instantly developed the desire to purchase it.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more satisfied, the guests he brings on stage are incredible, begining with Sting. To me, the interpretation by Yo Yo Ma is the highlight of the DVD, and worth by itself, the price of this musical.<br /><br />I used to live one block away from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and just wish they had added a short video of Boston and its sights.

'Smooth Criminal' - there is no mistake who wrote that! and 'Zorba's Dance' you can just see Anthony Quinn doing his dance in the sand!  I loved the movie and I LOVE this CD!!  David Garrett is awesome!! He makes you want to listen longer!!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|In November of 1968, The Beatles released their self-titled album which was their only double album they released when they were together.<br />The album was nicknamed The White Album because of its stark white cover as an antithesis to the extravagance of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band and Magical Mystery Tour from a year before. Like every Beatles album before this, The White Album was once again produced by George Martin and recorded at Abbey Road Studios and had engineering help from Geoff Emerick, extra production by a young Chris Thomas (who would become famous for his producing and mixing work with Roxy Music, The Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd, The Pretenders, Pete Townshend of The Who, INXS and Beatle Paul McCartney among others) and extra engineering by Ken Scott (who would later work with Elton John, David Bowie, Supertramp and Kansas). The Beatles' White Album is a great album and is one of the best albums ever made and a benchmark for all future double rock albums.<br />This album has every music genre conceivable from rock to country to ragtime to avant garde (thank God no rap as rap/hip hop wasn't around nor disco). Turns out that the eclectic styles of music and tunes was also the signs that The Beatles were starting to splinter apart following the death of manager Brian Epstein.<br />We start the album with jet noises that lead into bass player Paul McCartney's opening rocker \\"Back in the USSR\\" which is a classic Beach Boys-ish sounding romp. We then segue into guitarist John Lennon's atmospheric rocker \\"Dear Prudence\\" written for actress Mia Farrow's sister whom they met whilst in India for the Maharishi. We follow with another Lennon gold nugget \\"Glass Onion\\". Next is Paul's classic pop number \\"Ob-li-di Ob-la-da\\" which some says is called Life Goes On probably because of the show from the 1990s. We follow with the first bizarre track \\"Wild Honey Pie\\". Next is a classical guitar interlude which goes into Lennon's silly but classic \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\" which segues into guitarist George Harrison's classic \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" which features Eric Clapton on lead guitar (this remaster finally gives Clapton credit for his solos). The first quarter ended with Lennon's anti-violent rocker \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\".<br />The second half kicks off with McCartney's ode to his sheep-dog \\"Martha My Dear\\" which is a great number. Next is Lennon's bluesy ode to exhaustion \\"I'm So Tired\\" which is a great song. We follow with McCartney's classic acoustic number \\"Blackbird\\". We then have a funny song from George Harrison called \\"Piggies\\" which is a great song (complete with pig grunts at the end). Next is Paul's silly but classic country come Bob Dylan acoustic number \\"Rocky Raccoon\\". Next is drummer Ringo Starr's first solo penned Beatles song, the country-ish \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" which is a classic Ringo number (not bad for a first song written by The Beatles' drummer). We follow with Paul's rocker \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road\\" which just featured Ringo on drums and Paul on everything else. Then another Macca number \\"I Will\\" is next. We close the first disc with Lennon's \\"Julia\\", a beautiful acoustic song written for his mother who passed away when he was a kid.<br />The second disc opens with the Lennon/McCartney rocker \\"Birthday\\" which is a great song. We follow with a great Lennon rocker \\"Yer Blues\\" (this tune just rocks). \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" follows and is a nice McCartney acoustic piece. Lennon follows with two more great rockers \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide\\" and \\"Sexy Sadie\\". Then Macca rocks out with the superb \\"Helter Skelter\\". George ends the third quarter of The White Album with the atmospheric \\"Long Long Long\\".<br />We start the final quarter with Lennon's bluesy re-working of \\"Hey Jude\\"'s B-side \\"Revolution\\" called \\"Revolution #1\\" which was the first version of \\"Revolution\\" recorded but last to be released (unless you count \\"Revolution 9\\"). The jazzy \\"Honey Pie\\" is next anda nice McCartney number. Next is George's rocker \\"Savoy Truffle\\" which is an ode to Eric Clapton's sweet tooth. John Lennon then goes acoustic with \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" which is a great song. Next is the almost nine minute sound collage known as \\"Revolution #9\\", many hate this track but I think is a great piece. We let Ringo have the final word on \\"Good Night\\" which is a beautiful lullaby penned by Lennon.<br />Surprisingly, The Beatles' lone double album worked very well and flowed excellent and gave the band YET ANOTHER US #1 ALBUM (where it reigned for eight weeks) and still holds up today over 40 years after its release.<br />To date, The White Album is the group's best selling album ever in the US with some 18 million copies sold according to the RIAA although Abbey Road is the best selling single disc. If you need another Beatles disc aside Abbey Road and Sgt Pepper, scoop up The White Album.<br />In 2009, the whole Beatles catalog was remastered and re-released. This new version of The White Album trumps the original somewhat sterile CD versions of the album. The remastering and packaging is almost like buying the original Apple LP from 1968 all over again.<br />RECOMMENDED!umber.

1416562605|2.0|I was expecting more.  The language is so bad in places and the story line so sketchy and jumpy that I had to force myself to finish this book.<br /><br />The tone of the whole book is negative and gloomy with everyone sad and dishonest. India has a lot more to offer than this.<br /><br />This book gives a picture of India but, if you read it, look for another book to give the other side.  India isn't all bad, just as it isn't all good - no country is.
B0012GMVLM|4.0|For some reason I am not 100% sure of 1978 was a somewhat difficult year for full lengh albums. Prog rock was dying off,disco was controversial,punk was pushed as a singles medium and funk was just beginning to get mixed up with disco haters. It was all pretty confusing. At the time there only seemed like a few fully safe places to go. Even though Alan Parson's Project always had more of a \\"prog pop\\" leaning as opposed to being heavier this album tries at a certain kind of concept and to some extent it worked. As it stands it also serves as the beginning of \\"prog\\" albums moving steadily away from the bomastic pyrotechnics that it started with and focusing more on seeing how progression could work in terms of shorter pop structures rather than extended runs. \\"Voyager\\" isn't a bad beginning. It's imaginative enough for it's function but works as pop too. Honestly \\"What Goes Up\\",the dynamic closer \\"Shadow Of A Lonely Man\\" and the...well the more fusion jazzy-styled \\"One More River\\" are all pretty much standard pop/rock underneath some of the more lavish production. \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again\\",\\"In The Lap Of The Gods\\" and \\"Pyramania\\" extended more strongly on the loosely Egyptian concept. My personel favorite song on the album is the instrumental \\"Hyper-Gamma-Spaces\\",this really funky electronic synth,prog/fusion tune that is the kind of thing you'd expect to hear on a Passport album such as [[ASIN:B00005Y2E7 Sky Blue]]. Not having too much familarity with APP's music aside from the hits,[[ASIN:B0012GMXNI Ammonia Avenue]] and [[ASIN:B000002VCZ Vulture Culture]]....if this is one of their weaker albums. Primarily I am a funk and fusion fan and you'll notice how I am often finding referrences to those styles in pretty much everything I listen to. It really is there,especially if your looking for it. Those genres did gradually lead me into listening to both acoustic jazz and some progressive rock for example. Also of importance is where I live music in those genres are much easier to locate. Besides if progressive rock had some heavy improvisational or even (heaven forbid lol) FUNKY elements to it I figure it all goes with the title itself.se genres are much easier to locate.

B00001ZWTT|5.0|I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that if you think special government agent James West is fast with a six-shooter, wait'll he lays a quip on you! Megahit star Will Smith plays West, reuniting with Men in Black director Barry Sonnenfeld in an effects-loaded, shoot-from-the-lip spectacular. Kevin Kline plays fellow agent and crackerjack inventor Artemus Gordon, teamed with West on a daring assignment: stop legless Dr. Arliss Loveless and his diabolical plot for a Disunited States of America. Salma Hayek is mysterious adventuress Rita Escobar. And all manner of geared-up 1860s gadgets from belt-buckle derringers to surprise-packed billiard balls to a walking, eight-story, steam-and-steel tarantula help make Wild Wild West a Wow Wow West! What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.

Bruce Lipton makes this complex subject a joy to read,his intelligence and passion created an energy that translated to creating a passion in me to read on and on. This is the only book I have ever read that inspired me to read it again after the first reading! A fascinating, beautifully written journey that will change your life!

0441017177|5.0|House Of Suns is original, large scale mind bogling hard core sci-fi saga that I dare to say equals Dostojevski in the way it'll make your brain cells turn and twist and force you to read until you black out out of tiredness.<br />The sheer scale of House of Suns is amazing and Alistair takes you for a ride you wish that will never end. The story has characters of maturity yet with their faults which you follow through a thrilling aventure between the stars and across millions of years with an ending that will bring joyful tears to your eyes.
0783232039|5.0|The product was really good, it arrived much earlier than i was told. The disk was working and the case was not broken or anything. The only bad point was that it was a reigion 1 dvd, my player was reigian 4. But that was easily solved by playing on a different player.   Excellent value.  Thanks.
B000059T00|5.0|They didn't change the songs, which I really appreciated.  When I want to hear the \\"old\\" songs, I don't like them to be added to, or redone in another studio setting.  I like to hear them just as I remember them from the original recordings.  These were perfect!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|FOOD INC is a wonderful way to introduce one to our food industry and the corruption that takes place there. The documentary includes commentary from Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation) and Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma, In Defense of Food) both of whom are big names in exposing the industry's dirt through their journalistic endeavors and best selling books. This film tackles the ethical, economical, and ecological workings of the food corporations and also illustrates what damage it has done by aiding in the decline of our health as a nation. I viewed this film within the first week of its debut, and I am anxiously awaiting its release to DVD.
031606792X|5.0|This was a great conclusion to this series, and even though the subject matter wasn't \\"deep\\" I thoroughly enjoyed the books.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I just find it amazing that Hollywood actually was willing and able to produce such a masterpiece, with most movies there made for minimum amount of brain activity and preferably devoid of any depth.<br />The Movie capture the essence of the book really well, this is sci-fi at its best and yet a compelling love story. What is real and what is not and how do we define reality, where's the limit between your imagination and the physical universe, this encompasses these endless questions and yet at the same time is an amazing love story about feelings and the human spirit.<br />I salute the producers for their bravery and all those who had a hand in this masterpiece of love and mistery. I am sure that Stanislav Lem would have approved.<br />Thank you..
B002AT4K9G|5.0|The fast and the Furious 1, opened an all new gender in Sport Cars movies, hitting right where it's supposed to..     The fourth \\"official\\" sequel (It's really the 2.5 Fast And Furious Film, with in the time frame) is really exhilarating and regardless of the \\"SUPER FANTASTIC ACTION\\" performed as Dom and Letty escape from a rolling, flaming gas tank heading towards them and the video game sequence inside the maze of tunnels between the border of US and Mexico.     The movie really got back to the roots and stuck to the formula that gave them the success on the first movie.    Being Latin I deeply respect the different scenes from Latin America that are showed in this movie and they truly give the Latin tunning the place of respect they deserve for spooling the super tunning to another level with the different types of modifications made to the cars.    The trama of the 4th version of the saga is really intense and gives you the tunning world perspective and the real logical and well thought concept that makes the movie very interesting to car fans and movie fans and non fans as well.    My personal rating for the 4thlogy is:    FAST AND FURIOUS     ***** (Original and innovative)   2FAST 2FURIOUS       **    ( Play the video Game instead)  TOKYO DRIFT          ****  ( The actors swap, didn't help)   FAST AND FURIOUS (4) ***** ( New Model..Old Parts..) Really Version 2.5    Hope the review helped you make up your mind. (I always read reviews before buying at Amazon)

B000YABIQ6|5.0|I didnt start watching Mad Men until this summer. I started with the second season and found that it was pretty easy to put together some of the storylines. The first season is a must watch though and really has some of the best acting on television. Visually the show surpasses anything else. It's really a show HBO or Showtime worthy. Why both those big networks passed up on it is insane. AMC really hit a homerun getting this show. Creater and Executive Producer Matthew Weiner has taking some of the best directors and writers from when he was working on The Sopranos and if anybody has seen all seven seasons then you can see the similarities of Mad Men to The Sopranos. Don Draper IS the Tony Soprano of the 1960's just in advertising not organized crime. Season 3 has started up and has revealed some but this show seems to have so many layers its like an onion. The dvd box sets are worth watching over and over and thats why i bought both.
B000RPCK1U|4.0|Tomorrow Never Dies is one of the best Bond movies.  Though I've enjoyed the later Bond movies starring Daniel Craig, I still think Pierce Brosnan was the better Bond, James Bond.  Craig never seems like he's having any fun.  Brosnan has the ability to show Bond enjoying himself, while still bringing a more realistic performance to a very non-realistic film genre.  When Bond crashes down onto the Millennium Dome, Brosnan makes you feel Bond's pain (even if it is much less pain than a normal person would feel.) Bond teams up with Michelle Yeoh, as a Chinese secret agent, and provides an equal match for our hero.  I would have loved to have seen more with that team.  Jonathan Pryce is also entertaining as the main villain.  His secret power is the ability to type with one hand.  That's one ability I'd like to have!
B00243FQFA|5.0|They really pulled out all of the stops during the making of this last and final season of Stargate Atlantis.    Dollar for dollar you wont get great action and story for a better price.    Worth every penny!

On a side note I was happy to see the 1080p problem fixed.  There is nothing like watching a Terminator movie in blu ray.  Awesome movie and can't wait until Salvation is released with the R rated version.
