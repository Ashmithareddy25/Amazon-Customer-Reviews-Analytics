B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game, super cute! Some of the levels are super easy and some are a little too challenging but most are perfect :) i recommend it for everyone. Also great time killer since its so addictive.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is just like Fifty Shades of Grey, but I looved that book so I see no problem with that at all. I am happy to read another book similar to fifty because it is hot and something to lust over. I am anxiously waiting for book 2 to come out in October. By then, I will definitely be needing my hot and lusty book fix for sure. If you havent read fifty, you should and read this book too. If you have read fifty and never wanted it to end, then start over again with this book. I do have to say, the writing is better in this book, and I like the main character Eva better. The way she thinks and acts seems more realistic to me.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Well made, amazing story, great cast, so worth the purchase. I watch this series at least once or twice a year. Great gift item for history lovers.
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|This was the finest presentation of Peter Pan that I have seen. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />I paid seven dollars for it and figured that it might not be worth even that; as I recall it wasn't around long after it was released in theaters. This was one of those films that for whatever reason was a miss, pick it up it's a hit!
B007PS0X0W|1.0|I did not get a chance to watch this movie because it was not in my library when I went back to watch it later that day. I lost money on this one.
0307949486|2.0|There's enough descriptions of the plot in other reviews so I won't go into details about that.<br /><br />I saw the films before reading the book - but I have done that many times and usually there's more depth to the book.  It wasn't - this was a disappointment.<br /><br />It could have done with some serious editing.  There was way too much details about irrelevant things which didn't add whatsoever to the story.  I found Mikeal annoying and dull.  Even worse was all the SwEnglish which was far beyond what's day to day life in Sweden.<br /><br />Finally I positively hated the ending.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD.<br /><br />The idea that they wouldn't call the police, even worse, hide evidence of a serial sex killer - it's despicable.<br /><br />The rapes being met with absolute indifference beyond wanting revenge was unnecessary and unrealistic.<br /><br />Oh then the worst thing of all, though little cookie Lisbeth falls in love with Mikael too, just like every other woman he meet/want.  *yawn*
1416955070|4.0|Opening City of Bones is like a fantasy: first you're engulfed by this strange new world of Shadowhunters and mundanes, angels and demons, vampires and werewolves, and fey and warlocks. Then as you get wrapped up in this unique world, you also get wrapped up in this equally unique story Cassandra Clare has intricately woven, with secrets and truths, romance and war ...<br /><br />Of course my favorite part of this book was the plot. I'm never one to turn down a good plot, and this one was no exception. Though this book was clearly only the beginning of Clary's long journey into the world of Shadowhunters, I was nonetheless lured in by the mystery and the romance. A Shadowhunter -- also known as Nephilim, the offspring of an angel and a human who hunts down demons --  named Valentine had sought to destroy all Downworlders (the term used for vampires, werewolves, faeries, and warlocks collectively), and in the first installment of this series, he has supposedly risen from the dead again. And Clary? I know this is totally a spoiler, but she's not a mundane.  But she may just end up to be essential to destroying Valentine once and for all ...<br /><br />I love Clary. She's honest and clever and artistic, and plus, she's a natural redhead. Having her as the protagonist makes the world of Shadowhunters, well, less crazy. She's a normal person -- she could be my best friend or one of my classmates. But she's a bit of a Mary Sue. As normal as she is, sometimes I find that she's TOO pretty or that she's made out to be TOO smart. She doesn't have any bad qualities, and that puts a frown on my face, because as likable as she is, she's not so realistic.<br /><br />Jace ... oh my. Jace is THE epitome of a \\"bad boy\\" in the YA universe. Hot, golden looks with a snarky attitude but an inner sweet-ness ... He's the kind of boy that will melt your insides. And though he seems so perfect, he certainly has his bad qualities, which actually DO make him more realistic. His romance with Clary? Fast and furious. A little too fast-paced for me, but I love them together. They're a beautiful couple -- one that seems to love each other so beautifully and purely that they put shame to other couples in the same room. Oh, but that ending!<br /><br />To put my review into a nutshell, I adored this book. I really, really did, but it was lacking in a few areas -- mainly how unrealistic it was. But would I read the sequel? Of course.<br /><br />Source: copy borrowed from library
B007N85ZXY|4.0|Neil Young and Crazy Horse have a history few bands can match. Their collaborations are nothing if not interesting and Americana is no exception. They take some well-known music and put their own spin on it. The sounds aren't punched from a cookie-cutter. And I still crack up every time I see the video for Oh, Suzanna. The dancing kid really gets to me!
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I enjoyed reading \\"The Forgotten Garden,\\" however, I did have difficulty keeping the characters straight because of switching back-and-forth between generations.  I also think it could have been shorter.  I don't regret reading it though; it was almost like reading an adult fairy tale.
B004TMPJP6|3.0|Wunderlist is a very simple program and good looking program. However, I highly recommend that it impliments more features for tasks as reminders and scheduled items in future versions, not as a simple list app. Otherwise I could just use a note pad app.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This movie is fantastic. Even better than the first and that's quite a feat.<br /><br />Giving poor ratings of THE FILM (that's what we're reviewing after all) tbecause you're angry about ultraviolet is like writing the farmer because you overcooked the eggs. The two aren't related.
0765316994|5.0|Great fun. Despite three codas, I wish this book were longer - I took it on a cross-country flight and finished it with two hours of flight time remaining. It's not terribly deep or as rich as some of his other books, but it is fast paced, thoughtful, and inventive.
B005GG0MIS|1.0|I downloaded the sample and noticed the same highlighting problem that another reviewer raised an alert about. I don't understand how Amazon could let that happen. I probably would have bought the book if it weren't for the highlighting.
B006ZCWU5K|2.0|Springsteen's best records in the past fifteen years were: Tracks (1998), Essential (2003) and Promise (2010). What the three CD's have in common is all of the material is at least twenty years old.<br /><br />This CD suffers from the lack of the E Street Band. Without the backbone of the band, the record has a forced and/or lackluster sound. This is the ninth album since 1982 without the E Street Band (seven with the band 1975-present). The seven records with the band are his most successful while the nine without the band are the least successful. There is one example that illustrates the difference: Nebraska. It is the most famous of his solo records that was recorded in his bedroom with Springsteen's using his guitar and harmonica. Since it was intended to be a band record, the songs were recorded with the band. Springsteen and Landau rejected the band recordings and used the solo tracks. However, some of the \\"Nebraska\\" songs are on \\"Live 75-85\\" with the band and the band versions are clearly better than the studio record.<br /><br />The best songs are the typical Springsteen rocker \\"We Take Care Of Our Own\\" and \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\", which is fourteen years old. The rest of the CD is tired filler.<br /><br />This review is from a long-time Bruce Springsteen fan, who realized early in this century that the best of Springsteen music lies in the past. However, there is nothing wrong with that since most musicians create their best work, at the beginning of their career. In Springsteen's case, he was able to produce top rate music for almost twenty years (1975-1993).<br /><br />If Springsteen culled the best songs from the last four studio records, excluding the Seeger Sessions, he would have one good CD. All of them, including Wrecking Ball, have 2-3 good songs while the rest is filler.
159448385X|4.0|The first half of the book was good and easy to read.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a very well done movie about men who put their lives on the line to protect us from those who would take all that is worthwhile from us for their own selfish desires.  It also promotes each man's involvement with his children.
B0034G4P94|5.0|This movie had me on my feet more than once.  I cried almost every time Nick Nolte was on the screen.  He is one phenomenal actor.  The caliber of acting from the cast as a whole, was superior to anything that I have seen in quite some time.  I was going to pass this one by until someone told me to \\"Absolutely go see this movie!\\"  I did, and it stayed with me for days.  I think it is now in the top 5 of my all time favorite movies.  It is certainly the best of 2011, I don't care what anyone says.  Tom Hardy is beautiful.  Joel Edgarton is gorgeous.  Nick Nolte, baby you still have it all going on. What these people look like is only a side bar, SEE THIS MOVIE; it will knock your socks off.  :)

B00514HDNW|2.0|I am Legend by Richard Matheson is a story about a man named Robert Neville and his struggle in facing the end times. He is possibly the last uninfected human alive. There are several internal and external struggles. His internal struggle is for companionship and questioning why things have happened the way that they have. His external struggle is to stay alive. The story is told in third person with an all knowing narrator.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />The story is relatively short and only needs to be endured for so long. One thing the author does really well is not speak about gore in an offhanded way, in our society, it has become acceptable in movies and books to glorify violence; Matheson does not do this. The author did use some narrative techniques that aren't common. The way that we are brought into Neville's consciousness was interesting. It was telling and showing in the same moment.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The author spends a great amount of time in the present and it isn't until later in the book that we find out anything of importance about Robert Neville. Too much time is spent describing the world that Neville is living in. Matheson uses repetition well to point things out to the astute reader but scenes don't flow well. Time jumps around constantly and almost a third of the book seems to be flash backs. This interrupts the story and while is interesting for character, it doesn't add anything to the story, it doesn't add to my understanding of the conflict. While I understand carnal urges Matheson focused on (for the first half of the book) Neville's sex drive. A major theme of the book was companionship and he could have been trying to compare the both of them but it was distracting at times.<br /><br />The Ugly<br /><br />Overall the book did not tug any heart strings except in flashbacks. Neville hardly seemed real. The struggle between Neville giving himself up or not seems a hopeless one and at the end of the book that is what I am left with: hopelessness. But it isn't even that hopeless, it just is bland. When I enjoy a book, sometimes it is because the good guy wins but more often it is because I can relate and root for someone. Matheson's writing style didn't bring me into the struggle the way that I want to be when reading a novel. Neville is constantly going to alcohol to drown his lack of companionship and even is glorified for it. Matheson seems to be saying that people who are alcoholics just need to have something to be doing in order to be rid of their alcoholism.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book to others. It wasn't terrible but I'm not left with anything after it ends.with: hopelessness. But it isn't even that hopeless, it just is bland.

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. I wish there were more difficult levels; only a couple of them took me a while to get a perfect score.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|First off: If the idea of light BDSM (spanking, biting, binding, etc.) disturbs you, do not read this book.<br />I liked this story. But it has some nagging flaws.<br />Know that I am a young professional who likes detail and precision. I am bothered by poor/incorrect details, inconsistency, and excessive repetition. That's why this book got 3 stars instead of 4.<br /><br />The Story:<br />Christian, a billionaire entrepreneur, meets Ana Steele, an English major just graduating and moving to Seattle, when she conducts an interview with him on behalf of her sick roommate. He is also the guest speaker at her graduation ceremony. He pops up in various places and they flirt. He wants her to be his Submissive for some weekly BDSM scenes. She's not sure as she's all super-innocent, non-drinking, virgin-girl, but she decides to give it a whirl. The super-innocent and non-drinking bits fortunately subside rather quickly. She finds herself enjoying some of the light, teasing aspects of this life-style, but finds herself afraid of being hurt both physically and emotionally.<br />This story is a modification of a Twilight fan fic, but this really wasn't apparent to me. There are no vampires, no werewolves, and, best of all, none of Kristin Stewart's horrendous acting.<br /><br />The Flaws:<br /><br />The first few chapters are terribly written. I mean it. Terrible. I thought that I was back in high school, proof-reading Creative Writing pieces for friends. I recommended this to the one friend I knew would like it and got a call from her the next day, asking if she wrote down the correct name, as the book she bought was really bad... Yes, it was the right book.<br /><br />Bad Author:<br />The author is British. It doesn't show terribly, but she uses terms like supper, \\"smart rucksack\\" (from her step-dad, the quiet fisherman/carpenter - yea right), and shall (I could understand this for 1 character and occasionally, but it is constant for every character).<br />The main character is obsessed with British literature and has England at the very top of her to-visit wish list.<br />She also describes an Audi Q5 as a \\"beast of a car\\"... something an American would never say, as it is not a large SUV by our standards. It is very apparent that the author has always wanted to own an Audi, but has never ridden in, much less, driven one (hopefully she has enough money to buy one now and realizes what a complete blinking idiot she made herself out to be). She describes the \\"hatchback... two-door\\" Audi... then says it's an A3. Audi's hatchback coupe is called a TT. An A3 is a 4 door station wagon. She should've at least gone to their website to research. Also, she describes the benefits of going from a 1960s Beetle to a 2011 Audi as \\"It has power steering,\\" when it should be \\"Double crap, this thing can accelerate! Oh my, listen to that sound system! My inner goddess is shaking pom-poms and rubbing her skin against the beautiful suede/Alcantra seats.\\"<br />Another thing that the author has dreamed about and never done is visit the club lounge at an airport. Yes, you get free alcohol and snacks, but one does not receive free massages from Jean Paul and a manicure.<br />I also don't think she's ever been on birth control, as the pill is not taken during the actual period (Duh! Being a Female 101). Also, it takes over a month of consistent pill-popping before it takes effect, which every gyno will tell you.<br />She also has the characters orgasm together or him immediately after her (this gets old very fast), which makes me wonder if she's had sex before.<br /><br />Ana:<br />In the beginning, I really felt the narrator was 17 and in high school. It literally did not hit me that she was in college until I read \\"WSU\\" several times and she went out to the bar with her friends. Then she started to get fun and her character improved from there.<br />The 22 year-old college graduate has never been drunk before. She is a virgin and has never touched herself.It sounds like the author has never been to college, as somebody pretty much has to go into college deciding they are religiously against these things for none of them to happen. She also lived in Vegas for a while... Yes, she lived in Vegas and knows nothing about sex or drinking. I find that amusing.<br />She also doesn't have a laptop. Who makes it through college (especially as an English major writing a bunch of papers) without a laptop?<br />She has a subconscious and an inner goddess... figures who basically reside in a living room in her head and scold her, do gymnastics, hide, or dance when she does/thinks various things. Her subconscious is a harpy and her inner goddess is a cheerleader. I hated them both and wanted to fill the little living room fish bowl scenario with water so they would drown and I wouldn't have to hear from them again.<br />She cries a lot. I could understand 2-3 of the times, but the others were just ridiculous.<br /><br />Christian:<br />The main male character is a 27 year old self-made billionaire CEO, pilot, perfect pianist, amazing dancer, book-quoter, and so handsome that women stare and are incapable of speaking in his presence, etc. A bit excessive, I say. How about we just make him a successful entrepreneur that's made a few million? Also ditch the pilot thing as he wouldn't have time to become a night-time helicopter rated pilot while starting a massive successful business.<br /><br />Overused words and phrases: Shall, crap, double crap, triple crap, holy crap, oh my, flush, blush, down there, grin, murmur, mutter, run hands through hair, gape, chin drop, gasp, \\"shades of...,\\" and behind.<br />What person of confidence murmurs or mutters everything they say? Nobody! This really grated at me.<br />The author is constantly saying f@&#, but cannot use any term except \\"behind\\" for Ana's butt... like-wise for \\"down there.\\"<br /><br />I would love to put this whole book into a Word doc and fix it (I'm not kidding - it's quite tempting). It has potential, but was ruined by a bad author. HIRE AN EDITOR!!<br />Things that would improve this book: Ana would not be a virgin, she would have been drunk before, she would not orgasm at the drop of a hat, and she would cry less. Christian would not be a pilot and would only have a few million dollars. I would also recommend investing in a thesaurus rather than using the same words a hundred times.It sounds like the author has never been to college, as somebody pretty much has to go into college deciding they are religiously against these things for none of them to happen.

B0000024TT|5.0|The title of this review refers to a lyrical couplet from \\"Master Song\\" one of the many masterpieces on this excellent album, \\"The Songs Of Leonard Cohen\\". My love affair with this began years ago at a secondhand \\"Goodwill\\" store. Cohen's music was fresh in my mind as it is used on the soundtrack of the then-newly-released Natural Born Killers movie. So here is this dog-eared copy of Songs sitting nestled among stacks and stacks of vinyl records, collecting dust at the local Goodwill. I took the plunge and spent my hard earned dollar bill on this mysterious album with a cool-azz back cover by some crazy cat called Machine (no last name...just Machine...so mysterious. I'm intrigued already.)This album introduced me to classics like : So Long Marianne, Suzanne, Stories of The Street, Hey That Is No Way To Say Goodbye, One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong, Sisters Of Mercy, Teachers and the aforementioned Master Song. One of those rare instances where every song (excepting Midnight Lady, which I don't really care for and feel that it's filler)is a stone cold classic. I rank this up with Bob Dylan's best work and possibly even better. Oh, and by the way, the songs on here don't sound the same as eighties and nineties Leonard Cohen. Yes, lyric style is consistent but Leonard had a better voice early in his career. So don't expect that \\"chewing on gravel\\" singing voice he uses on \\"The Future\\"(1993) and \\"I'm Your Man\\"(1988)
0307951529|5.0|While the $100 startup is written primarily for people who are considering starting a small business, I found it an entertaining and inspirational read - and I've been self-employed for a decade. Once you get busy with the day-to-day realities of starting and running a business, it's easy to lose sight of why you started. This book got me to pause and look back at my own journey. The examples Chris presents are short on business details, but you don't have to read the balance sheet to know that having the roof of your business collapse presents a major obstacle to success. Yet these entrepreneurs do succeed - on their own terms, and they take a moment in the pages of this book to remind us, and themselves that the rocky, uncertain journey was worth it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Alright, so I bought this book because I was wondering why my newsfeed on Facebook was blowing up about this stupid little book. Well, I reget the money I spent on this.<br /><br />I wasn't even 20% on my Kindle and oh triple crap I hated this book. I actually give people a warning about this trash. I'm pretty sure a penguin with one flipper could write better drivel than this.<br /><br />*There's no plot. I have never actually experienced a book with no plot.<br />*It's just ridiculous. I mean, she's Bella from Twilight--clumsy, apparently oh so plain but every man wants her, and idiotic. Yet this billionaire wants her? I don't think so, sugar britches. That isn't how the world works.<br />*It feels all like a fantasy of a 13-year-old girl after pining for a boy at school. Sorry, it's not called 'down there' but refer to it as something else. That area is your vagina, respectively. Learn a few terms for it.<br />*I wanted to bite Ana's lip off, but not because that would be sexy. No, I want to bite it off out of rage<br />*This whole franchise is going to put me in an institution.<br /><br />However, the good that comes from it? At least I know I can write complete mindless stuff that isn't good and still get published. This book is like Ke$ha of literature.

B0059XTV7Q|3.0|Let's get the title out of the way.  Wallis (The \\"W.\\") Simpson (an excellent Andrea Riseborough, \\"Never Let Me Go\\") was the married American who King Edward (The \\"E.\\") gave up the British throne for.  This film deals with their trials and tribulations but primarily from the perspective of Simpson.  We see this played out in numerous time jumps between the 1930's and the late 1990's as another Wally (Abbie Cornish, \\"Limitless\\") envisions the pair 6 decades earlier.<br /><br />Wally has just married a successful clinical psychiatrist, but the marriage isn't going well.  She wants a child; her husband appears to want to just fool around on the side.  An auction at Sotheby's provides additional interest for Wally (named after Ms. Simpson) as many of the royal couple's personal belongings are being auctioned off.  There she meets one of the firm's security personnel played by Oscar Isaac (\\"Drive\\").  This meeting will have consequences down the line.<br /><br />I believe this is Madonna's first time as a director of a feature film and I do think she has promise.  She also co-wrote this film which is the biggest problem.  At times the movie plays like a Zalman King soft porn film but without the soft porn.  The soundtrack, while pretty, puts the scenes to sleep on occasion not to mention the audience.  But there are also some nice bits, mostly with Ms. Riseborough.  In one scene, she dances with a black woman at a party in France.  While not risqu&eacute;, it was attention getting.

This isn't a great movie, but isn't terrible either.  It would have likely gotten better press if not for Madonna's name being attached.<br /><br />There is certainly nothing to complain about with the 1080p Blu ray transfer.

B002VUFKG6|4.0|Liz Gilbert has the ability to weave personal details within a larger scale of human experience.  She provides an insightful view on shifting perceptions on marriage, family and love.  This is not, however, the easy, emotional read of 'Eat, Pray, Love'; instead it reads a little closer to some of her previous writings - still upbeat, but one step away from biography and one step toward anthropology on an accessible level.  Enjoy!<br /><br />I found the Kindle edition to be well done, no problems with page and chapter numbers, no strange text issues, only good reading.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|What a nice surprise.  Somehow this traditional indi film escaped to the multiplexes and I had occasion to check it out.  For my taste Wes Anderson is a mixed bag when it comes to his projects.  I'm about 50/50 on the likability meter.  This is his best yet.  Co-written by Anderson and Roman Coppola, the cast contains some of the usual suspects including Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and Jason Schwartzman.<br /><br />The story, which takes place in 1965, revolves around a couple 12 year olds, both of which are seen as odd by their classmates and the adults around them.  Sam (Jared Gilman) is an orphan, seen as a troublemaker by his foster parents as well as his Scoutmaster (Edward Norton).  The girl, Suzy (Kara Hayward), likewise is a bit off-putting, has no friends and hates her parents (Murray and McDormand).  While watching a church play, Sam becomes smitten with Suzy dressed as a blackbird.  Suzy appreciates the attention and together they plot to leave their homes and go off together on a great adventure through the Rhode Island coastal wilderness.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is the local island cop who is also having an affair with Suzy's mom (McDormand).  I can't say enough about the cast.  Harvey Keitel plays a tight-assed Scout troop leader and Scoutmaster Ward's boss.  Tilda Swinton plays \\"Social Services\\" which is how she refers to herself.  Bob Balaban pops up here and there as The Narrator, keeping us informed as to time, location and an approaching storm.  Schwartzman is another Scout leader at another camp who agrees to help the young lovers for a bag of nickels.  Every character is wonderful and every actor delivers exacting performances.<br /><br />Having said that, much of the credit must go to first time film actors Gilman and Hayward.  Played with a straight face, their budding love feels right for their age.  Some of the best scenes are when Scout Sam (he says he has now resigned and is an ex-Scout) leads Suzy through the rocky hills and woods.  Suzy travels in a short \\"go go\\" style dress with high socks, a yellow suitcase and a battery operated record player.  You can't help but laugh.  And wait `til you see the Scout's attempt at a tree house.  I'm still laughing.  A must see.uzy travels in a short \\"go go\\" style dress with high socks, a yellow suitcase and a battery operated record player.  You can't help but laugh.

B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Cheryl Strayed falls. She gets lost. She gets confused. Her boots cause her immense pain. She gets blisters, she loses toenails. She carries more than she needs. She runs out of water. She heads into town for supplies and encounters various situations, some good and some bad. She runs low on money. She is showered, occasionally, with kindness and occasionally takes a shower. She finds some beauty, gets into a rhythm, and ponders her past.<br /><br />The cover sold me--a beat-up, worn-down hiking shoe. That is a great cover. I thought I'd spend the entire book on the edge, eating nuts and berries and learning how a non-hiker and non-wilderness person survived a long trek up the Pacific Coast Trail.  But Strayed spends about half of \\"Wild\\" either getting ready for the trip, fixing problems in town along the way, or reminiscing about her personal history. So, be forewarned.<br /><br />\\"Wild\\" is as much interior journey as it is footsteps on the trail.  Strayed has a colorful past with lots of problems and issues and this makes for the many layers to the book.  There are memories of her father and her mother and her brother shooting a horse (probably the toughest scene to read in the whole book).<br /><br />Strayed has a good writing style. There is energy on the page. I read it easily. She pulled me along.  Other than cringing at all the mistakes made by a novice travelling alone in the woods, I really don't understand why she waited 17 years to put it together. That gap in time gives my journalism-trained brain some pause. She says she used extensive journals to write the book but, again, I wonder: why did she wait?<br /><br />The end was the biggest problem, at least for me.  Certainly, I hoped for some payoff--some nugget of from the navel gazing. Perhaps the 17 years was needed to process what happened, to look back and recognize the changes.<br /><br />It just didn't happen. The end of \\"Wild\\" comes quickly. She reaches Ashland, Oregon and then it feels like a flash to the finish.<br /><br />\\"Wild,\\" it turns out, isn't necessarily about where Strayed heads. It's as much about her as it is her environment. So, be prepared.h to the finish.<br /><br />\\"Wild,\\" it turns out, isn't necessarily about where Strayed heads.

1936608898|5.0|I was one of the fortunate ones to receive an early copy of this book and I absolutely couldn't put it down.  'It Starts With Food' is a perfect, fun to read, comprehensive guide to proper nutrition for both newcomers and gurus alike.<br /><br />I've been following Dallas and Melissa's work for a while now and the guidelines defined here have been absolutely life changing for me.  Growing up with an autoimmune disease, I was very sick for a good portion of my life.  I am now healthier and happier than I have ever been and owe it to people like the two of them for the amazing work that they have done and are now sharing with the world.<br /><br />Bottom line: Look in the mirror and assess the quality of your life.  If you don't like what you see or how you feel, pick up this book and change it.  Or don't.  The decision is yours.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|What can I say, but that I'm so proud of these three guys! I've been a fan from way back in the olden double-neck guitar days. I've taken my lumps as a Rush fan (mainly because so many disrespected them: the ones who always went for style over substance), but I stuck with them because I knew they were the coolest and smartest band around. Decades later, these three guys from Canada are still rocking and they don't sound tired at all. Clockwork Angels is an energetic effort that sees Rush continuing to stretch their musical boundaries. There are elements to the songs on this album that show that Rush has taken it to any even higher level. I think that Clockwork Angels has some similarities to their 2002 release, Vapor Trails, but structurally the songs are superior and the production is much better. My favorite song on this album right now is \\"The Anarchist\\" due to Alex Lifeson's dazzling guitar effects and signature soloing.  \\"Halo Effect\\" is a short but effective ballad in the Rush style and \\"The Wreckers\\" is a rocking, but refreshingly different tune. Overall, this Rush album is one that you pretty much get after the first or second listen, but there are further treasures to be discovered upon subsequent listens, whether its the nuances of Geddy Lee's vocals, Neil Pearts complex drum parts or Alex Lifeson's song structures. These guys called Rush are amazing and I'm proud to be a long time fan. I was brought up to believe in Rush!!<br /><br />THIS IS MY 100TH AMAZON REVIEW.

B002RI97O8|4.0|I bought this book as a \\"chapter book\\" to read with my 4.5yo Son. I remembered it from somewhere in my childhood as a great story.<br /><br />I think its probably better for an older audience as once reading it I realised that the entire premise of the story is angry farmers trying to shoot and kill what the little kids will relate to as cute fluffy animals..<br /><br />Its still a good read but I would say a book to read to/with 6-7yo.

0984334904|4.0|I paid 24 dollars in total for this. Is that a bargain? Compared to the regular price, maybe. Compared to printing out the kanji myself and studying that way? No.<br /><br />Let me explain.<br /><br />First off, studying Japanese Kanji is going to be a time consuming task, no matter what. With these cards, or a self-study print out one at a time with definition method like I said above, it is going to take months. At least 3-4 months I reckon. So anyway, back to the quality.<br /><br />The definitions are great. The fact that it doesn't contain any romanji (that is cheating) and only Katakana and Hiragana for you to read is a bonus. My only beef with this card set is that 1) It's actually really small. The box is maybe 12 inches long by 4-5 inches wide. The cards are not index card size like I imagined, but playing card size. What's more is that the product is made in China (go figure) and the cards are actually very flimsy. They can break if someone (like a nosey todler) gets ahold of them. They are not even sturdy as some playing deck cards I have encountered. I would say they are on par with the softness and flexibility of uno cards. This is bad because uno cards cost maybe 7 dollars a pop (or less) while these cost 3 times as much altogether.<br /><br />So bottom line is? The definitions are there. The kanji are there. It gets an A or a B- on education level, but the actual quality of the material is pretty poor for the price, and there are no replacement cards, so think about that. And consider printing out the kanji one by one with definitions yourself over a period of months if you're dirt poor like me. haha. Okay, so...Maybe that was a lousy way of wrapping this up, but seriously. I wish the quality/material were better, as even the words printed on here are very small...About size 10 in text. If you were to print out size 8-10 text you know what I mean. You would need glasses if you have bad vision, or are older. These should have been a little bigger (like I had imagined) but are not.<br /><br />Anyways. 4 stars. Good education, not so good material/size.I had imagined) but are not.<br /><br />Anyways. 4 stars. Good education, not so good material/size.

B005CRQ4XI|1.0|One of the worst books I have read in a long time.  I had hoped the book would be more about the experience of hiking the trail, but found it a pity party.  I found out too late that it was an Oprah pick, or I wouldn't have purchased it. Don't waste your time and money.
0143121006|5.0|Since this true crime book covers a number of topics of interest to me, I had high hopes.  Happily, the sad, excellently written (story telling, pacing and length) work exceeded my expectations. What a wonderful film this could make, a virtually unknown true story, set in an exotic locale during a pivotal time! Surprising how little known the story is, hopefully Mr French's work with publicize an overlooked loss.

B005LAIHY0|4.0|4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Coming from a guy who went to see the first Alien film in the theater, to seeing it to many times to count afterwards. Wanting to try to figure out all the ambiguities of that film, & it was very ambiguous, with no clues about the xenomorph & the alien spaceship, & where they came from. So, all I have to say about \\"Prometheus\\" is, without giving it all away:<br /><br />Genius, pure, genius! It answered all my questions about the first film, then some! It also created more ambiguities, but that's the charm of many great films, leaving the viewer wanting more. Just like life, there is never no complete answers on where you'll be tomorrow, what will happen to you after you die, or who is responsible for life on the grand scale. So goes \\"Prometheus,\\" for it can't answer those questions either, but it does make you wonder.<br /><br />A new chapter has been born, one that leaves room for other, maybe more intriquing chapters to come, full of more ambiguous questions for the next film to explain?<br /><br />Quite the accomplishment, Mr. Scott!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|first half of the book is really good. second half (once they get the capitol if i'm not spoiling too much there) is mediocre.<br /><br />i really started disliking katniss; she's wining and selfish.<br /><br />i've seen a trend in books lately where there is no real conclusion to the story and i feel this way about this book as well. at least one whole chapter please dedicated to wrapping things up. i didn't read three books to draw my own conclusions; i want a finish to the story and the couple lines we were fed i did not find satisfying even though i was happy for the way it ended.<br /><br />for example (SPOILERS) after she killed coin she's taken away. okay i'm thinking this is going to be good, their going to realize the monster coin really was and how she wanted another hunger games and instead i get another whole chapter about katniss being drugged and sad. i've had enough of katniss being drugged and sad. i wanted the trial! that would have been the interesting part. then peeta; all we get is the bush digging, making the book, and a paragraph about them ending up together? hated it.<br /><br />it just seemed lazy and i liked the first two a lot. maybe the movies will be better. i haven't seen the first one yet.

B003L16FAE|5.0|Good grief! So many overwritten reviews on technical nonsense on this particular Blu-Ray. People seem passionate about tiny, meaningless image quality details. If you're passionate about this movie, just watch it forget about those pretending to be image quality experts. The pros do that fine, and people here are trying to spin on that.  They seem spun out. The movie is awesome, never looked better. Now \\"go, get to the choppa!\\"

Beautifully written - gripping at times - I could not put the book down.  It is thought provoking.  I am sure I read faster using the Kindle!
B005LAIGZU|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Critics gave Act of Valor a tough time pointing to \\"a clich&eacute;d script, stilted acting, and a jingoistic attitude.\\" However 80% of viewers said they \\"liked it\\" on Rotten Tomatoes. I agree with the non-reviewers.<br />Act of Valor is a great film, that not only tells a solid story but let's us see how Navy Seals actually carry out a mission.<br />The realism comes from the producers, Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh, spending so much time working closely with the SEALs on a documentary. They respected the SEALs and the United States Navy respected the filmmakers. So a pact was made and Act of Valor became the first film to use actual Navy SEALs as the cast.<br />Members of Bandito Platoon, SEAL Team Seven are at home with their families at the beach. They know their time is limited. Their commander reminds them to get all personal matters out of their minds, and that if he needs to he will meet with their spouse or any family member who they are having a problem. He tells them their minds need to be clear with only the mission at the forefront.<br />Their mission is to extract Morales (Roselyn Sanchz), a CIA'operative, whose partner has been killed and she captured, tortured and most likely, unable to move on her own.<br />The seven man team moved into the jungle after making a successful HALO jump. They decide to enter the compound ahead of time, because they can hear screams coming from Morales. Two provide cover as five do a search by search room-clearing textbook style. Despite their professionalism the mission goes array.<br />This movie will keep you captive in your recliner.

He is quickly moved to a CIA'safe house in Cape Town, South Africa.<br />The \\"housekeeper\\" is a low on the totem-pole agent Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds). Matt has been with the agency for a good while but has become bored since his assignment has been just to sit in that safehouse and wait. Nothing has happened until now.

0345803485|3.0|I had heard about this book however didn't consider it until a good friend was reading it.  When I went online to buy I read several of the reviews and thought twice.  Then I figured what the heck, and went forward with my purchase.  My review/opinion:  No this is not or will be a literary classic....however, it's fun.  It's the perfect book to devour while out at the pool.  It's a fast read and let's face women have been reading trashy romance novels as far back as you can go.  I read the references to Twilight (which was my \\"fun\\" summer reading a few years ago) there was a slight similarity but only slight.  I enjoyed the book, enjoyed the steamy scenes and always read before bed ;)<br /><br />Maybe some of the negative review writers need to be spanked.  Just kidding ladies.  It was fun a read, now on to a classic.

0812417755|1.0|This is a review of this particular edition from Perfection Learning. It is terribly made, and overpriced. they are basically putting out a permabound edition of the paperbacks here, so in reality you are buying an overpriced paperback. The copyright pages even note the book was a paperback edition. STEER CLEAR OF THIS EDITION of Slaughterhouse 5 and any edition of any book by this manufacturer. Not worth the extra price at all.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I chose this app mainly because I need to track scores at gymnastics meets using Excel.  OfficeSuite's version of a spreadsheet is the best I've used -- including DocumentsToGo.  After getting used to the gestures and nuances, I find it very easy to create spreadsheets, add functions, do averages, etc.<br /><br />The word processor is just as easy to use.  I would never use it to create long or complicate documents, but for adhoc notes, letters, etc. it works great.<br /><br />One gripe is the PDF reader.  It is painfully slow and doesn't offer any tools such as text reflow and highlighting.  Another item on my wish list is linkability to Microsoft's Skydrive.<br /><br />For what I use it for, this app fits my needs well however.
B001KL3GY0|3.0|I bought You Could Have It So Much Better on a whim after digging \\"Do You Want To,\\" the theme song on an anime, Paradise Kiss.  (It helped make my decision when I found that the CD was $5--seriously, just go buy it right now.)<br /><br />You Could Have It So Much Better was my introduction to Franz Ferdinand.  This was lo-fi stuff.  On a shuffle alongside the rest of my CDs, it sounded like crap.  The lyrics didn't make any sense, the instruments and vocals were out of tune, it sounded like it had been recorded on an old tape deck.  Sure, one song's all about the revolting things his ex-girlfriend used to do (and how much he misses her anyway), another seems to be about the annoying qualities of some kid who apparently really wants a car, another's refrain is \\"I'm evil and a heathen.\\"<br /><br />For all that, the songs showed remarkable creative and emotional range.  I got used to the crappy production after a while.  Franz Ferdinand was the band you sing along with at top volume when it comes on with the same abandon they do, because in the end, it was unadulterated, unselfconscious FUN.  Maybe they didn't know all that much about music, but they sure were having a ball, and so you do, too.<br /><br />So it was with great excitement that I got Tonight.  You can hear from the first few notes that it's a whole new Franz Ferdinand.  The drummer has range now, not the \\"pound as loud as possible\\" approach of yore.  Everything's on tune.  The producer utilizes modern recording equipment.<br /><br />My first thought was that this was the Franz Ferdinand album I'd been waiting for, taking all the greatness they already had to the next level, but after spending several weeks trying to enjoy it, I have to say, I'm disappointed.  With the exception of a couple of songs I really like (\\"No You Girls\\" and \\"Can't Stop Feeling\\"), nothing grabs me.  The music might be technically better and more complex than before, but in the \\"bettering\\" process, most of the fun and personality seems to have been sucked out.  Forcing restraint in their gonzo style seems to have turned it into work rather than fun.  I'll buy anything they release, no matter what it sounds like, as long as we're all having a good time, so I hope they can find that spark of pure joy in music once more.
193418070X|5.0|Fantasy books were my first love when it came to reading, and I grew up on stories bursting with mythology, knights, and princesses (my favourites were those that had characters who could be both a knight AND a princess). Nothing gets my heart pounding and the pages turning like a magical, adventurous fantasy novel!<br /><br />I first heard of Graceling immediately after reading The Hunger Games a few years ago - I kept getting recommendations for it, but for whatever reason I didn't pick it up until recently. Waiting to read this book until now was one of the biggest mistakes in my reading history! I'm convinced that Kristin Cashore is a genius and this book is proof of that.<br /><br />Reasons to Read:<br /><br />1.A richly developed fantasy world:<br /><br />This is a must for good fantasy books; I need to buy into the magical world and the best ones have a well-established world with its own rules and norms, but with enough similarities that we can relate to them. Plus, I like books that include MAPS of the fantasy worlds. That's pretty legit for me. And the names of places, things and people should be vaguely familiar but not so overdone that they come off as silly and fake. Graceling easily avoids any and all of these issues and stands as one of a few YA fantasy books that works so well!<br /><br /> 2.Familiar problems & issues:<br /><br />I don't think it's much of a secret that Graceling delves into some questions regarding the role of women within a society and the obstacles in their way as equal members of society. What may be surprising, however, is how WELL Kristin deals with this and successfully weaves it into the story. I wouldn't call it subtle, but it is oh-so poignant. Katsa is a bit of an anomoly in her world, where women are often mistreated and lack the means to protect themselves; but as she slowly begins to recognize how problematic this is and ultimately questions if she can do anything about it. It's striking, and resonates so well because of how familiar it is to us.<br /><br />3.Katsa & Po's friendship:<br /><br />I love Katsa, and I love Po! Even separately, they were fantastic characters that I found amusing and amiable. But it's the way that they played off each other and slowly grew closer together that truly sold me on them as characters and their role in the story. Here's a couple you can't help but root for the whole way through; and most of all, I loved seeing a respectful male lead who wants to encourage the heroine and do everything he can to help her in the way she needs and respect her decisions.<br /><br />So, I've now joined the ranks of Graceling/Kristin Cashore fans. I'm KICKING myself for waiting this long to have read it, and I've moved on to Fire already :) Graceling is a thought-provoking and addictive read, one that will leaving you craving more. I could honestly say so much more about this one, but I'm going to save it for a spoiler-filled review, coming soon :) Perfect read for anyone looking for a heartbreaking, emotionally touching, thought provoking read.<br /><br />This one has a well-deserved new space on my favourites shelf; and I can't wait to finish off Fire and then get started on Bitterblue (as soon as I manage to get my hands on a copy)!<br /><br />Thoughts on the audio:<br /><br />A few people had told me that I must listen to Graceling on audio because it was good- and they were right (again. Clearly I have awesome people recommending books to me). This would actually be a perfect book to introduce a new listener to audiobooks because it's Full Cast, although you'll also be spoiled by it for other books. Full Cast is fantastic because it's such a great quality; there are multiple narrators, all of whom are excellent. Plus there's a little bit of background music at times that helps create a good atmosphere for listening to the story. Hands down, the best, most addictive audio book I've ever listened to. WELL worth the cost of buying it!<br /><br />If you're new toaudiobooks, or just haven't given this one a try yet then I HIGHLY recommend that you pick it up. Like now.audiobooks, or just haven't given this one a try yet then I HIGHLY recommend that you pick it up. Like now.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|So I'm not going to lie, this is much different than her other albums...but still good music. Her previous albums have been very blues/jazz feel, with the instrumentals in the songs...this one has a very 'beachy', foreign, Jack Johnson type feel to it. Which I still like, but just not the same Melody that I've grown to love. I will listen and enjoy, but look forward to her next album, and hoping she returns to her original style of music, in which she is incredible.

I just want to let everyone know the excellent conditions the books are, even though my country is far away from USA, and they travelled by plane and everything. The 4 books i've ordered arrived only 3 days later than the estimated day by amazon. I'm reaaally looking forward to reading them all, they look great!
B000B589JI|5.0|I love this canister, it's real useful and convenient when you go out somewhere and don't wanna be lugging around a big Zippo fluid can. It even has a flint holde, opening tool for changing flints, a key chain, and a clip if you wanna hang it on something. A must have for all Zippo owners !
B0052VUNHC|5.0|After reading the Fifty Shades trilogy I was having a hard time deciding what to read next that could possibly hold a candle to the lovely Christian.  After researching many many reviews, I found Beautiful Disaster.  As soon as I began reading, I could NOT put it down.  As hard as it was for me to admit, Travis replaced Christian as my FAVORITE HERO almost immediately.  This book had me feeling a million different emotions all at once!  I wanted to strangle Abby more times than I can count, but that was a big part of what made me love this book so much.  Hands down, Beautiful Disaster and Travis are on the top of my list, even after reading 15 other books since I finished BD!  Definitely recommend!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|super fun and addicting...good graphics as well. plenty of things to do in the game its really interactive! the missions are fun to complete as well
B003LXSY60|4.0|These guys have no other band that sound like them.  Great music to just chill to with a bunch of friends (I think at a bar scene) and just hang out to.  So much fun!
0385344228|5.0|I read this book, because it was a book club selection. Once I started reading it, I had a difficult time putting it down. I liked the style in which the book was written, it was written in mostly a first person narrative style. However, every once in awhile, to punctuate the story, the line was broken with the main character as a witness in front of a grand jury, with the prosecutor asking questions.<br /><br />The story is about a family, and how the family reacts when the 14 year old son is accused of murdering a fellow classmate, who bullied him. There is much with respect to strategy and thought process. While the mother began to doubt her son's innocence, the father never did relent in his belief. The ending, of the book was not predictable. It left a sucker punch to the gut.

B002GHHHH4|1.0|&#34;Over the Top&#34; (1987) wants to be &#34;The Champ&#34; of arm-wrestling movies, but ends up being hopelessly mawkish. Try though he might, Sylvester Stallone is unable to transform the sport into a cinematic concept — it's hard to get excited about protracted muscle-bulging mayhem. Sly earned $12 million for this Golan-Globus turkey. You're better off watching Sammy Hagar's &#34;Winner Takes It All&#34; video (featuring a Stallone cameo), which lasts a mere four minutes.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|i love this game. its just like super mario bros.  but thats the point. i thought it would be hard to control on my kindle fire, but its actually really easy and really fun.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this app, awesome. great for people who like course games. as good as Mario. ha ha ha ha.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|It's very hard to describe what Storm Corrosion's \\"sound\\" is, or really to make any viable comparisons.<br /><br />The closest thing I could compare this to would be a cross between Steven Wilson's previous project \\"No-Man,\\" particularly some of the harmonic, softer material from their Flower Mouth album, and the organic, free-form structure of a Fantomas album.  Throw in some of Robert Fripp's solo \\"soundscape\\" experimentation and you have a starting place from which you could approach this, if anything.<br /><br />Making these sorts of comparisons isn't intended to mystify the album too much as an avant garde sort of work; Storm Corrosion is very easy to listen to.  The unique characteristic in light of these similarities is that the music isn't terribly abstract, and is quite straightforward to the ear.  It is a quiet, mostly instrumental, more subdued sound, and at times might ring somewhat hollow in material and form.  It focuses on spacing and ambiance more than percussion and rhythm.  I rather like that honestly; it's airy and minimalistic sound is compelling in it's own way.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend a listen!  Stand out track for me is #2, the title track.<br /><br />This is actually very good work, just make sure you can approach it without the expectations that might be associated with the collaborator's respective back-catalogs.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|This is the movie that bonded me to strangers I never knew before or since one Spring day in a small theater in Pasadena, California. The afternoon showing mid-week meant the seats were just a quarter full, and as I watched the story journey through loss and joy, love and loneliness, I felt not just me tears but those of every patron around me, our sorrow bonding us and, for me, amplifying feelings that I still feel to this day any time I think of the movie or here the achingly beautiful musical score by Ennio Morricone.<br /><br /> It was to be my most-loved film and the romance is not diminished 22 years later.<br /><br />I won't speak to plot for fear of spoiling what should be a moment of discovery for those who haven't yet seen this film. Nor will I write -- with one exception -- of character development, other than to say the story is driven by two people I will always cherish and made joyful and sad by those around them. The exception being the character that is the place of the story: As someone who married a Southern Italian I can say the film captures so much of hat to meant to grow up in a small, Southern Italian town.<br /><br />Many have written the film is a tribute to cinema but I suggest it goes farther: It is a tribute to life, with love of film as one of the driving forces.<br /><br />It wasn't until many years later I saw the director's cut. It is both remarkable and remarkably different than the theatrical release. But here's what's critical: I don't think the theatrical release would have held such deep meaning to me if I has seen it only after the director's cut. And I think the director's cut carries more meaning for having seen the theatrical version first. Precisely what that is I won't say for fear of spoiling the treasure of watching both.<br /><br />Both versions are available on one DVD set on Amazon. Make sure you buy or rent or download the version that is subtitled. The dialogue is often sparse but almost always touching, a quality that is diminished if you don't hear the actual voices of the actors.
0887431453|2.0|I originally bought this 6 months ago for my son.  It was just the right level of challenging for him.  It included writing, matching first sounds to pictures.  It also had a several mazes and other fun things.  We moved and the book didn't make the trip so I ordered it again.  They have completely changed it and the material is very simple.  Half the book is now mazes which of course my son loves but are not really educational in the slightest.  If you are just looking for fun worksheets this is fine but if you want any kind of educational material I would skip this one completely.  There are many other better ones on the market including the one they sell at Wal-mart.
030758836X|5.0|I envy those of you who haven't yet had the fun of reading this wonderfully entertaining and original novel.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is the kind of book that compels you to read even when you DON'T have time.  If you appreciate skillful writing, it will hook you like an addiction.  You will resent distractions, ignore the phone, postpone making dinner in order to stay with it.  It's that much fun to read, I promise.<br />Warning:  it is not for the reader easily put off by the dark side of human nature, or sinister characters, or vulgar language.<br /><br />***SPOILERS about the ending<br /><br />I am adding a few thoughts to my original review since I want to defend Gillian Flynn's choice of endings for \\"Gone Girl.\\"  The complaints about it, and the one-star reviewers who \\"LOVE the book up until the ending,\\" make me want to rush to its defense, since I think it is so chilling and so appropriate for what has come before.<br /><br />There is a reason, even more powerful than the baby, that Nick remains with Amy.  He NEEDS her, as perverse as that may be (and I agree that it IS perverse). He loves who he is when he is with her!  She controls him and he ultimately complies because she makes him feel like the man he WANTS to be:  Cool Nick.<br /><br />To me, the beauty of the ending is that it IS open-ended and subject to conjecture.  It makes perfect and brilliant sense.  The author doesn't stoop to a Hollywood \\"tie it up in a neat little knot\\" conclusion; what she has chosen to do is far, far more sophisticated.  The evil and horror are still out there, going on and on in an ultimate deception. The novel purposefully leaves questions unanswered so that the reader must THINK about it and wonder:  What will ultimately happen to Nick and Amy and their baby?  Is Nick buying time because of the new life coming?  Will he change and do the right thing? Or is he so needful of the artificial roles they are playing that he cannot escape?<br /><br />There are many possibilities.This conclusion steps the novel up to a new level of horror, and I love it this way.<br />What a complex and horrific commentary on the choices people might make in toxic relationships. There are levels of depth here that transcend the ordinary thriller.<br /><br />This chilling, Hitchcock-like noirish ending has many precedents in great literature.  Off the top of my head I can think of several other wonderful novels with ambiguous endings.  \\"The Sense of an Ending,\\" (by Julian Barnes), winner of the 2011 Man Booker prize, will keep you wondering about its conclusion for a long time.<br /><br />-\\"Gone with the Wind\\" - remember \\"Tomorrow is another day\\"?  But what about Rhett and Scarlett ?!?<br />-\\"Atonement\\" has a mind-blowing ending which negates much of what comes before - but it is extraordinarily beautiful.<br />-\\"Rosemary's Baby,\\" which sold over 4 million copies - talk about a chililng ending where nothing is resolved, but the evil is just beginning!<br />-\\"The French Lieutenant's Woman\\" by John Fowles - on Time Magazine's list of the 100 best novels of the century.  It has THREE endings, and the reader is left to  choose!  Would today's readers accept that or would they nail Fowles with nasty reviews?<br /><br />Then there is the hugely popular (and Oscar nominated) movie \\"Body Heat,\\" in which Kathleen Turner gets away with all that Amy does, and more....and the only resolution is that she's shown in the last frame sipping a drink on a tropical beach.  Really terrific movie!<br /><br />I've only scratched the surface, but I think it's pretty safe to say that many great works of literature and film could not claim to have a tidy resolution in the end. I personally love a book that makes me think...I love ambiguity because it shows the author respects the reader and counts on him to use his intellect to ponder the situation at the novel's conclusion. I think \\"Gone Girl\\" is just that kind of clever, intelligent challenge of a book.  It is original and thought-provoking, a plot-twisting ride by a marvelously skilled writer.

B0074EIQUG|4.0|Dr. John's latest effort is a worthy addition to his extensive catalog and is recommended for anyone who's a fan of his work.  I saw this LP premiered at a SXSW showcase in Austin last March, and am pleased to report that although the Doctor ain't getting any younger, he's definitely as cool and hip as ever, maybe even more so.  This album rocks a bit more than some of his last few efforts, and also is a good deal more political.  \\"Big Shot\\" sounds classic, and who but the Doctor could spit out \\"Yeah, I'm a big shot\\" and infuse that line with all the dripping sarcasm necessary to drive home the point of the song?  Well worth a listen, and a good addition to the collection of any fan.
044024630X|1.0|Like most of the other 1 star reviews I too am a long time reader of Lee Child.  This book is just b-o-r-i-n-g.  I usually tear through a good book in a few days.  I had to force myself to finish this book over a few weeks, and that to me says it all.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|For the first half or so of the movie, it seemed a bit like the Blair Witch Project -- a bunch of stupid teenagers acting just so. So, you discover you have super powers, and you decide to \\"have fun\\" using them in public? Uh, yea, exactly. It's beyond stupid. Out of all three of them, nobody said \\"Hey, we better keep this hidden from, oh, I don't know, EVERYONE, lest we end up locked up in an underground lab for life for study.\\"<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen the story developed a bit more as far as what may have given this ability. Maybe some hints as to what was under the ground or where it came from. The police, I figured, were investigating the site with the hole, but we never hear anything. I suspected the kids would have been tracked down at some point before the last 15 or so minutes of movie. Did nobody else really know what's under ground?<br /><br />As far as the ending, I would have rather it end another way. As it is. *spoiler. stop here if you haven't seen it* his alcoholic father lives, rescued by the remaining guy, who kills the angry one and gets the vacation to the Himalayas. Poor young guy gets picked on the entire movie, beat up by his dad, goes a little psycho, then gets killed. What an ending for him. The older cousin who seemed to have a little more sense, since, he first came up with the idea of having rules, I suppose he deserved to live for being the more responsible one?<br /><br />After it all, it seemed like a nice film. The first half was very unequal in terms of a story or action compared to the last half. I really don't see even teenagers today being that stupid after getting special powers. Maybe that's the purpose of the movie, to set a good example for today's youth, as so many movies have done in the past.

1439192812|5.0|I'd say this is a great science book for kids, however, there are plenty of adults out there that could learn much from THE MAGIC OF REALITY.  Although beautifully illustrated, this is not Dawkins at his best; rather, this is Dawkins at his most accessible.  Instead of writing deeply on one or few subjects as he does in his other great books, he provides an overview of all the big science concepts, leaving biology for physics, cosmology, geology, and religion.  Highly recommended for beginners of all ages, but not for the more advanced folks... - lc
0771035799|5.0|It seems a bit gratuitous to write the 223rd review of Ben Goldacres book \\"Bad Science\\" but having decided that it would be more of a fault not to recognise the brilliance of his book I'll go ahead any way.<br /><br />The Bad Science that particularly irks Goldacre and takes up the bulk of his book is that which relates to the medical sphere. It's not that he thinks purveyors of crystal healing, homeopathy or the wannabe scientific but far from terrific \\"nutritionists\\" should be soundly horse whipped weekly or even fortnightly, but that he wishes they would stop pretending to be what they are not which is science. The other target of his ire is the media, the scare-mongering, the cry wolf-ers who were up to their necks in the MMR scare-mongering without understanding more than a tiny fraction of the whole story. With regard to MRSA he gob-smacked this cynical reader with the information that the \\"scientist\\" who was coming up with the +ve results for the newspapers was working from his garden shed, done up with pieces of kitchen fittings and sub-standard scientific apparatus: The Walter Mitty of the world of micro-biology no less!<br /><br />He's also interesting, though it is by no means a central part of the book, on the attractions of the quick (quack?) fixes to deal with complex problems within society. The account of the Teeside Fish oil fiasco is fairly disturbing, as is the bizarre (and trademarked) exercises that are apparently carried out in hundreds of schools across the land. Hopefully this aspect of his writings will be explored further in a later book.<br /><br />Totally recommended, Goldacre is an effortlessly witty writer and by some slight of hand. . . sorry . . . by rational explanation he makes statistics, especially those relevant to the study of the efficacy of medical treatments, entirely comprehensible. 100% recommended. A first step to immunising yourself from irrational medical nostrums, saving yourself a pile of money as well as having a wellearned laugh.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I bought Documents to Go Pro (DGP) several months ago.  I haven't been happy with it's performance and the way documents look on the screen (I really don't use Excel or PowerPoint).  So I thought I'd give OfficeSuite Professional 6 (OSP) a try.  I'm certainly pleased with my experience with OSP.<br /><br />Compared to DGP, OSP loads Word Documents much faster.  And as for the look of the documents, DGP does not hold a candle to the OSP \\"real\\" feel of being in a Word document on my computer.  I certainly won't compose long documents on any Android Office App, but OSP makes it easier to shoot off quick documents.  I also like the editing and save features on OSP much better.  They are more seamlessly integrated into OSP. I can easily edit docs with OSP that just weren't worth the time with DGP<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I bought this App.  It really is a good Microsoft Office stand-in on my tablet.
0385360169|2.0|I ordered the audiobook of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' because I do not have time to sit and read a long book or a series of books. I am an avid audiobook person but have to say on this one inparticular, it is not good. The reader, Becca Battoe, does ok with Ana's voice but her roommate Kate sounds the same and her voice for Jose and Christian is HORRIBLE!! They sound muted, tired and very boring! It is very hard for me to picture Christian being the hot guy he is with the voice she has put to him. He reminds me of a tired Miss Jane from the Beverly Hillbillies. It is sad because I am loving the book but hate the voice and will not buy the next two audiobooks of the trilogy. I will have to find time to read them and put my minds own voice to him.
B00000JTB2|5.0|Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan in Session<br /><br />  Albert King (1923-92) and Stevie Ray Vaughan (1960-90) recorded this live CD on December 6, 1983 in Hamilton Ontario. The story of how this came about is detailed in the ample notes that accompany the disk.<br /><br />  The collaboration of the blues icon Albert King and the Texas blues star Stevie Ray Vaughan will provide the fans of each a thoughtful and enjoyable listening experience.<br /><br />  One of the real pleasures of this CD is the banter between songs. Listening to King and Vaughan joke, tease and talk blues was a unexpected extra.<br /><br />  Oh yes, what about the music, well expect to get your sox's blown off. A worthy addition to your music library.

0857520652|4.0|This is a neat story, very quiet and quaint, at turns touching and funny and frustrating. Harold meets all sorts of people along his journey, and we get to hear their stories of heartache, triumph, unfulfilled wishes, and total mundanity. Harold revisits many of his own percieved failures and missed opportunities, and tries to recapture his love of life and his love with Maureen.<br /><br />It's the sort of story they make into a hanky movie, which isn't usually my scene, but I actually quite enjoyed the book. It was a slow read, but satisfying. My only real complaint is that everything seems to be exaggerated. It seems to take FAR too long for him to cover ground, even with all his stops and problems. And does a pair of shoes really need new soles after only 60 miles? Would a man on a walk really capture so much attention? I don't know. For a nitpicky reader like me, it was distracting. Ultimately, though, it doesn't matter how realistic it is, it's still a great story. :)
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I installed this app because so many of my friends said it was great!! So I did and I just tried it today. I was SO unimpressed I'm deleting it as soon as I finish this reveiw.

So we made sure we fir everything right. Then when we finished it said the same thing so I ended up reinstalling this horrid app TWICE!! Wouldn't liar and wouldn't let me play. Overall this app is a piece of storage filling junk!! I don't know if its just my kindle But this app sucks. The End. (my thumbs hurt.)

B005H2IAM6|5.0|I am a huge fan of the classic anime films & series, and have to admit that I had been looking forward to seeing this movie since the first trailer came out, but I can't recommend this highly enough.  If you have any affinity for the original, you will definitely want to see this!.  I still can't believe how great they made everything look.  Aside from a 'Rule 63' Doctor and transformation of IQ-9, the Yamato crew character design is perfect.  The music is just bigger, fuller versions of the original anime soundtrack.  The Gamelons no longer just look like blue people, but I think that they've done pretty well there too.  The Yamato and the Black Tiger ships are ripped straight from my memories.<br />Some changes to the plot from the original film, and the ending is a little too drawn out for my tastes, but after all of the awesomeness, I still had to give it five stars.  If you're a fan, you were probably just looking for confirmation that it hasn't bastardized your treasured memories...and I can assure you without any doubts in my mind, that it has not.  You can purchase without worry.<br /><br />BTW, The Steven Tyler song only plays over the closing credits, and is not in any other part of the movie.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. its so much fun and addicting. I got my bf and his daughter hooked on it.
B001E45XT4|3.0|the thing broke after 3 weeks. No kidding<br />Its massive, heavy and can get a little hot for you ears, although the sound quality is good, the mic is ok... the quality of the headset itself its a bit of a let down.<br /><br />Even the cheapest senheiser headset is way better than this *even the ones with no mic*, but overall, I mean, I paid 29 bucks for this thing, so, for what it costs, its very good.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I came across this book via a \\"Robo-Recommendation\\" on Amazon's site. Glancing at it, I was not real impressed, but figured that I would take a moment to view the promotional video. The video piqued my interest and I added it to my \\"Wish List\\" since the book was not yet available. I was reading Marcus Luttrell's new book Service and by the time I completed it, Fearless was available. On a whim, I purchased it and wasn't expecting much.<br /><br />Less that a week later, I blew through this book and was very surprised by it. I am a Christian, but do not consider myself to be very devout. Adam's story is nothing short of amazing.  I'm left with the feeling that even though I've never met Adam, he has touched my life.<br /><br />This book is a quick and pleasurable read that is the life story of Chief Adam Brown.<br />I did not know that this book had any religious overtones when I purchased it. If I had known, I most likely would not have selected it. Fearless has caused me to reexamine my faith and has brought me closer to the Lord. I would like to thank the entire Brown family for having such an impact on me and my family's life. Adam's last request to have his story be told completely unabridged is a truly selfless act that lives up to the title of the book Fearless...<br /><br />Order a copy today!<br />You will not be disappointed.

1597371378|5.0|I want to order the Little Women audio cd, but all the reviews are lumped together with the book. I know that some versions of the book are only the first half. If anyone could tell me if the audio includes both halves of the book?
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this book.  You can't help but fall in love with the 4 main characters and the relationship between Abby and Travis is a roller coaster you'll enjoy being on.  I was almost hoping there was a book 2 to see how Abby and Travis' relationship continued.  I was dying to know how everyone would respond in the cafeteria after they returned from Spring Break!
B004KD5TQI|5.0|This soundtrack is perfect. I've never seen anything like the movie Sucker Punch and having the sound track adds much to my life. If I love a film enough to buy the soundtrack then it is a BIG deal! I've never seen music play such a complementary roll in a movie and listening to it reminds me of the experience of watching the movie which is great because I fear watching a movie so many times that I wear it out and no longer enjoy it. Basically every piece of music on this is a cover of a more famous artist. I love covers because they pay homage to the original while adding the new artists' style in a unique way. I've never heard the Pixies Where is my Mind done like this and Sweet Dreams has never been so beautiful. Main star Emily Browning contributes her own voice to both of these tracks. I had no idea she could sing like that! She could probably make it on her own as a vocalist. I only mention these two tracks because they are probably the most easily recognized by the audience after watching the movie. EVERY song on this CD is great! I even like the artwork and design of the disc case and liner notes. It includes a picture of every girl with her character name and even an abbreviated version of the ending monologue of the film and a note of thanks from the director to those who worked on the music. Anyone who even half likes Sucker Punch should buy this album.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|Five IMPRESSIVE Stars! Unity, indeed. Multiple Grammy-winning jazz virtuoso guitarist Pat Metheny has assembled a tight, hard-swinging quartet that sounds like its been working for a long time and he gives the group an impressive array of original compositions. \\"Unity Band\\" rides the polyrhythms of drummer Antonio Sanchez (especially \\"Leaving Town\\"), anchored by the mellow underpinnings of rising star bassist Ben Williams (great \\"New Year\\" solo), and tenor sax luminary Chris Potter who adds his soprano sax and bass clarinet to the mix. Metheny, in addition to the wide palette of his electric and acoustical guitar sounds, adds the program-based 'Orchestrion EPK' instrumentation to the proceedings, as on \\"Signals (Orchestrion Sketch)\\".The 'best of the best' begins with the altissimo edginess of the \\"Roofdogs\\" unison-theme with hot solos by Metheny and Potter, the avant-garde approach of the tone poem \\"Signals\\" with its unusual array of sounds and effects from both the 'Orchestrion EPK' and the band, the intensely beautiful ballads \\"Then and Now\\" and \\"This Belongs to You\\", and perhaps best of all the exotic intensity of \\"Come and See\\" which has a great \\"Willow Weep for Me\\" Potter quote rising from the musical maelstrom of his solo and a sizzling Metheny improvisation. Pat Metheny is a relentless musical explorer and Unity Band is his impressive new group, producing some exceptional jazz, and it gets My Highest Recommendation. Five RIVETING Stars (This review is based on an mp3 download; 9 tracks + digital booklet, Time: 65:48. \\"Unity Band\\" was chosen as the Grammy-winning Best Jazz Instrumental Album of 2012.)
B005LAIGW8|1.0|Without a doubt, this is the worst movie that Marvel has ever been involved in.  And yes, I am including Dolph Lundgren as the Punisher and the Captain America made for tv movie back in the 70's.  Save your money and buy the first Iron Man, or the Avengers movie when that comes out on video.
0143121316|5.0|Kissinger's long and often interesting story helps us understand China and Kissinger better. They both come across as a lot more practical and down-to-earth than they are reputed to be.  As Kissinger writes the story, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin deserve remarkable credit for some of the most successful leadership of the 20th century.<br /><br />This book isn't a perfect story. There are far too many times when people earn diplomatic compliments for being insightful when they're really being stubborn or rude, or simply idiosyncratic and lucky.  \\"Kissinger On China\\" still reveals an important story of historical events in the words of the people involved, and as such can make an excellent gift.<br /><br />Kissinger's narrative helps remind us to think about relationships with others on more than one level. I found it inspiring. It helped me find valuable new ways to get along with others: be determined, honest, and tough in addition to polite.<br /><br />Perhaps the most inspiring vignette was Mao overruling the diplomats. \\"Don't send out b***s*** communiques.\\"  Say where you don't agree, and your statements about where you do agree will be more powerful. It was also interesting to see Mao's comments about preferring to deal with right-wing governments because they're more reliable.<br /><br />Kissinger may be over diplomatic and over intellectual in many cases, but in the end he comes across as a much more normal guy than you'd expect for a Secretary of State and a Harvard professor.  Memoirs from the key Chinese figures, especially the very practical Deng and the affable Jiang, would be fascinating.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Only half way through 1st book of the trilogy, but very engaging, and I can't put it down.  Great work!
0061537969|2.0|A first person animal story appeals to many people, and gives this book a certain charm for that audience.  The writing is workmanlike, certainly excellent for a dog, but unremarkable for a human.<br /><br />But if you think about the story line itself, this one contains too many tear-jerking life events.  If it weren't for the dog as a narrator, the story line would be preposterous.  The plays to the emotions are too dramatic, and the connections too implausible.  I felt manipulated.  Those who feel differently may like the story more.<br /><br />SPOILERS:  The man gets married and starts a family.  His wife dies of cancer.  His in laws sue for custody of the child.  They set him up for a statutory rape prosecution to win custody.  With great patience and understanding and complete financial ruin, the man wins the legal case.  The man gets a job as a test driver for Ferrari.  The dog dies.  Maybe the dog comes back as an Italian boy who's a racing fan.

B006GECE9Y|5.0|If you have a Kindle Fire, you have two options. You can use the stock software, like Amazon wants you to, or you can root it, install the Android 4 ROM, and then get to use Dolphin HD Browser (as well as LastPass and XMarks plugins).<br /><br />I rooted my Kindle just for this one program. I don't like the fact that I have to work around some mild bugs in my Android 4 ROM. They're quite annoying, but they will never be as annoying as Amazon for trying to FORCE me to use their browser. The result is that I literally uninstalled ALL of Amazon's software - bar none.<br /><br />Amazon is usually great, but this time - you suck Amazon.
0812992792|4.0|The Orphan Master's Son is a story of a most wondrous and great puppet master.  His name is Kim Jong Il and he decides who a person is and what they do with their lives.  In fact, if he doesn't like you, he will make you in to someone else and everybody else must accept this as well because this man is the Dear Leader and everything he does is for the betterment of his people.<br /><br />At the start of the novel we meet Pak Jun Do.  Jun Do lives in an orphanage with a man he believes to be his father, although we never learn the truth.  He does well at jobs assigned to him and works his way up through the ranks as a government pawn, sent out on missions to snatch Japanese citizens from their shores and bring them back for the dear leaders amusement.  He later joins a team of fisherman intent on catching shrimp for the Dear Leader feast.<br /><br />Accidents happen during the course of these events and elaborate stories must be made up in order to ensure people involved are not punished because there is only a very slim window you can live in, to guarantee your own safety from the Dear Leaders wrath.  These stories eventually make Jun Do a hero.  He even gets to make a trip to Texas from North Korea.  Later, Jun Do does something to land himself in a work camp, where he labors in the uranium mines which eventually leads to a run-in with Commander Ga , the Dear Leaders rival.  A scuffle between the two render Ga dead and Jun Do escapes, taking commander Ga's place in his home.  Ga's wife, Sun Moon, their children and even the Dear Leader accept this change and treat Jun Do as if he was always Commander Ga.<br /><br />This is part where Johnson starts to lose me and it begins to be a struggle for me to continue with this book.  I just had such a hard time accepting the likelihood that something like this would really happen.  Unfortunately, this fact is central to most of the story, hence the difficulty stomaching the seriousness of the story.  I do believe Johnson was attempting to demonstrate just how controlled people are by fear of the Dear Leader.  The Dear Leader, undoubtedly, was quite please to be rid of his long-time rival.<br /><br />The Orphan Master's son is a complex work for me.  On one hand I feel it paints a pretty good picture of what life must be like for the average citizen in North Korea, but on the other hand I felt it was presented with an edge of sarcasm.  This may be, partially, a result of my having listened to the audio book version.  Another part of me knows that the author was trying to present just how ridiculous life under the rule \\"Dear Leader\\" can be.  For me this took the edge off the seriousness of the material that I feel may make the uninformed reader discredit the ridiculous stories contained within the book.<br /><br />When I was nearing the end of this book, I was sure that it would be a 3-star read for me.  There are several times I guffawed, like when the Dear Leader gives food aid to all the starving people in the United States.  After the prologue, I immediately boosted my book rating to 4 stars.  I had not realized just how much research went in to this creation and have to give the man credit for going to North Korea and asking some tough questions.  This is a tough book to rate, categorize and review, I could not recommend it outright.  I can say that if you are interested in the life of North Koreans, this may be a book for you to read, but I think you need to have a least some idea of what the heck is going on in North Korea to have an appreciation for it.s attempting to demonstrate just how controlled people are by fear of the Dear Leader.

B007SGM084|3.0|I appreciate that Anastasia was a very young and naive woman, however, I almost stopped reading after a few pages into the first book.  Her musings were getting on my nerves and I felt that even though she was young and inexperienced, she could be described as \\"dense\\" in the ways of life.  Also, her tripping into Grey's office was a bit childish on her part and the author's for going overboard on portraying Anastasia as the sweet, inexperienced, young, naive woman.  We got the point, E.L.!<br /><br />Yes, Grey needed a lot of psychiatric work, and it took Anastasia to fulfill what Grey's psychiatrist could not do or give him...the love of a woman. Don't know any woman who could have \\"survived\\" all that Anastasia went through in one day w/Grey.  A bit much on the near death experiences happening in one day w/ex-subs, working w/a psychotic boss, et al. then getting home to more drama and, of course, sex, but never having the time to figure out what was going on or could happen to oneself.<br /><br />All in all the trilogy was a good read, certainly different than most books on the market today, and certainly gave Johnson and Johnson a run for their money on sex education, sexual exploitation, and sexual obsession. My Kindle was close to catching fire at times.

1594744769|4.0|I read this book in about six hours.  It was engrossing, fairly well-written, and just a lot of fun.  If you're looking for some sort of complex literature, you should probably look elsewhere, as the book isn't that serious.  My only problem is with the ending, as it just kind of dropped off, leaving a few things unexplained.  If it is part of a series, good.  I can't wait to read the next installment.  If not, well, that was just a really stupid thing to do.  Overall, though, I thought the story was fantastic and the photos were a nice touch.  I recommend it.
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Those who love well-crafted songs and classic soul REJOICE! The debut album, HEAVEN, from Rebecca Ferguson, a 26-year-old from Wales with a brilliantly unique voice and top-drawer songwriting skills, wis a collection of yummy adult pop songs dipped in luscious vintage soul.<br /><br />Runner-up in the 2010 British X-Factor competition, Ferguson was refreshing, classy and original in a TV genre known for contestants with more gall than talent. Ferguson advanced to the finals, but didn't win (despite the support of high-profile supporters like Adele, who voted over 80 times for Rebecca).<br />Past contestants have been harshly critical of the X-Factor, not Ferguson. Though she could have benefited from greater confidence, Rebecca possesses what is rare among competitors: dignity.<br /><br />Ferguson's voice blends Aretha's powerful intonation and Nina Simone's polished imperfection. There is no trace of insecurity on HEAVEN, every word and note rings with assurance.<br /><br />Rebecca's range of expression is captured with expert production by Eg White (Adele, Duffy), Wayne Hector (Tom Jones, Toni Braxton) and Fraser T. Smith (Leona Lewis).<br /><br />Honest vocals verging on a session sound set her apart from the herd of auto-tuned popstars yodeling up and down the scales. She delivers each song with conviction.<br /><br />The ballad \\"Shoulder To Shoulder\\" is a poetic gem about affection and argument that begins with the stunning confession: \\"I feel safe when you're near me, and I can hold you completely... though you constantly hurt me.\\"<br /><br />The locomotion of \\"Run Free\\" is reminiscent of the churning bass from Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean.\\" \\"Mr. Bright Eyes\\" is a flirty track that could be a Motown golden-era hit. The dizzying strings, brassy horns and the stage band verve of \\"Fighting Suspicions\\" sound like a classic James Bond theme. The punchy bonus track \\"Backtrack\\" sounds cheerful, but tells the story of a woman who refuses to put up with her lover's transgressions. Ferguson's first U.K. single \\"Giltter & Gold\\" is a cautionary tale for those who would be tempted to barter their soul for gain.<br /><br />The piano/viola ballad \\"Teach Me How To Be Loved\\" washes over with quiet intensity and sheer vulnerability:<br />\\"One foot onto the ice, I hold my breath and try to believe...<br />\\"The fallen empires, the shattered glass, the wicked echoes of my past,<br />\\"I've seen it all before, that's why I'm asking:<br />\\"Will you still be here tomorrow, or will you leave in the dead of the night?<br />\\"So your waves don't crash around me, I'm staying one step ahead of the tide.<br />\\"Will you leave me lost in my shadows, or will you pull me into your light?<br />\\"Teach me how to be loved.\\"<br /><br />Through all the moods of this album, the focus remains firmly on Ferguson's vocals; and it's a terrific instrument fueled by heart, not vocal acrobatics. HEAVEN restores adult concerns to the R&B genre that have been largely missing for the past few decades.<br /><br />Rebecca Ferguson proves that she is romantic, but not a sap.

B005MYEPXC|4.0|It took me awhile to go back to watching Owen Wilson in these light comedies after his real life suicide attempt because my suspension of disbelief was kind of shattered after that. I'm mean how can I take lightly and laugh at the characters he portrays when his real life is in such despair?<br /><br />Anyway, I got over it when watching MIDNIGHT IN PARIS on a flight from Los Angeles to Tokyo and I must say that I really enjoyed the movie and Wilson was sort of channeling a young Woody Allen for his character \\"Gil,\\" a script writer who is trying to write a novel. Gil and his fianc&eacute; \\"Inez,\\" played by Rachel McAdams, go to Paris with her parents, and at midnight, Gil gets taken on a magical adventure to the roaring twenties and cafe society, meeting such luminaries as Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Josephine Baker, etc., all in their prime, and even gets to go further back to the \\"Belle Epoch\\" era.<br /><br />The film makes great use of the sights in Paris and is shot with a warm filtered lens, so that everything has a yellow/reddish glow, reminding one of a romanticized version of \\"Paris in spring-time.\\" Not only is the movie visually appealing, but there's a subtle message about how one can get caught up in living in the past -- or at least the idea of the past -- when really the only time that matters is the present.<br /><br />Graphically, the MIDNIGHT IN PARIS Blu-Ray has stunning picture quality, as it should, and though it isn't a overly serious or uproariously funny movie it has its charm and can be regarded as a comfort movie for those times when we all wished we were living in another place and time.<br /><br />Extras are paltry but as follows:<br /><br />*****  SPECIAL FEATURES  (HA!) *****<br /><br />Q&A IN CANNES -- 04:57-minutes<br />Allen and cast take questions from reporters in this short press junkette.<br /><br />PHOTO GALLERIES<br />Stills of cast etc.<br /><br />TRAILER -- 02:04-minutes<br /><br />I'm not sure what the Amazon mix up is about but this is what was on my Blu-Ray of MIDNIGHT IN PARIS.not sure what the Amazon mix up is about but this is what was on my Blu-Ray of MIDNIGHT IN PARIS.

1451608659|4.0|A memoir is the story of a person's life and their experiences and no one should be entitled to review that.  Accordingly, this review focuses only on how the information is presented and whether the audience of potential buyers would take an interest in it.<br /><br />As fans of celebrities we pick up on a person during or after their major achievements.  In the case of Moceanu (for most) this would be 1996 when she and the U.S. Woman's team won a gold medal in the team competition for gymnastics.  She was just 14 years old.  I assumed it took a lot of hard work to get there, and that the path was not easy.  I also assumed that it was a childhood lost and replaced with the hard work and determination of an adult.  This book certainly confirms these theories.  I feel I can write this without it being a real spoiler for anyone.<br /><br />We (the public) see the glorious results and have some appreciation for how difficult it is to achieve the results, but no true understanding.  This memoir humanizes Moceanu's achievements and it does it in an incredibly well thought out and touching way.  For example, most fans knew her family was Romanian - but probably few considered what that truly meant.  It meant that Moceanu is a first generation American who came from a poor family of immigrants... a family which had a financially unsteady situation.  It may be hard enough to achieve greatness, but it is even harder living in a two-bedroom apartment with your parents, sister and grandparents.  Most great gymnasts tend to be on the small side, but have any fans considered what it is like to be the smallest person in your class selected last to play a sport in gym class, have a funny sounding name and come to school with food that is unlike your classmates' food at lunch time?  No one imagines the small tiny hardships that add up to a difficult life when they see a girl and a gold medal on a podium in front of the entire world.  This memoir helps you to relate to Moceanu as a human - a young girl who faced kids in school as cruel as the ones you went to school with, but she faced them with much more adversity than most of us did in our own lives.<br /><br />It is a poorly kept secret that elite child athletes often face abuse (which comes in multiple forms:  physical, mental, emotional).  Gymnastics seems to be particularly notorious for this.  What I appreciate about this memoir is that it reads like someone trying to tell a story as a way of explaining their life...  and not like someone who has an ax to grind.  Many memoirs are \\"grinding axes\\" in disguise, but fortunately this does not come off as one of them in my opinion.<br /><br />Moceanu does a great job reflecting on what was great in her childhood and what she appreciated about her life as well as noting things she has set out to change about her own children's childhood.  It also brings an additional remarkable component about her lost sister and how the discovery altered everything she knew and perceived about her family which, frankly, was already enough for ten lifetimes!<br /><br />If I had one criticism of the book it is the way in which the chronology was broken up to weave past and current together (i.e. the story of her lost sister).  It was awkward to follow and I think the reader's feeling of being disjointed outweighed what Moceanu was probably going for by doing it.  This is a small issue mentioned only because no product review should fail to mention \\"the negative\\".<br /><br />The story is remarkable and inspiring, there is no question of that.  It is told well and with great detail that takes a lot of courage to share with other human beings (let alone publish in a book).  You do feel that you are a better person for having understood the path someone else experienced in life and the challenges they faced and the lessons they learned.  You can not ask for more after reading a memoir.  Highly recommended.human - a young girl who faced kids in school as cruel as the ones you went to school with, but she faced them with much more adversity than most of us did in our own lives.<br /><br />It is a poorly kept secret that elite child athletes often face abuse (which comes in multiple forms:  physical, mental, emotional).

B007OTZ654|5.0|Having the 99 \\"abbey road remaster\\" this thing sounds more like you're listening to a great band in the studio compared to everyone fighting for what instrument is the loudest. that 99 remaster was so compressed the drums didn't even sound real. This remaster everything sounds crisp and great. Makes you love the album even more. I'm a bit too young (27) to hear the original RCA LP from the 70's but i don't see how it sounded any better then this. I don't get the people on here who just get on here to write negative reviews..and the negative reviews never prove a point. This is the definite CD version of this classic album.

B007SAP7S0|5.0|Now if every remaster/reissue sounded this good. I always thought the original \\"91\\" version of this album sounded really good, but this remaster brings out the definition of every instrument (which are all played by Kravitz himself) except for the solos on the first 2 tracks on the album..played by SLASH! This album is like a tribute to all of his heroes of rock and R&B this is by far my favorite Kravitz album. The grooves are great. the Guitar riffs are great. the vocals are his best (IMO) and the production is solid. The bonus tracks are ok i guess but i really got this thing for the updated sound...which is UPDATED! sounds fantastic.

B0086T71MM|5.0|\\"It's what you would do.\\" Peggy to Don. Best line of the show. Perhaps of the entire series. That relationship, Don and Peggy, I submit, is what this show is about. It is the central relationship of the entire series. They are the two characters who thoroughly, wholly get one another. They see themselves in one another. They are scarily alike, but just enough different to make it drama. Don is the past, Peggy the future. They created themselves, just as the firm creates a world in each of its ads. Sad? Hardly. Peggy's glee as she steps into the elevator completely changes the tenor of the episode. Fantastic. This is Mad Men at its best: Layered, deceptive drama unfolding, with advertising and all it means the spine on which it all hangs. The prostitution thread was the diversion, a foil to the main story, I think. That line and Peggy's smirk are what really happened here.

B005LAIIS0|3.0|I found the movie somewhat unrealistic. As a hunter Liam could have made weapons out of the parts of the aircraft, as well as wood. Rules of survival say stay with the aircraft, as most today have an ELT. To travel under those circumstances without every member of the party being armed with something throughout the whole movie with such a threat present may make for a good movie but not reality. Still had good visual effects and not a bad storyline. Liam is a great actor and played a great part.
B00845PV16|2.0|I watched the first Ghost Rider before this one, to refresh myself with the storyline.  There was no point.  This was like watching The Incredible Hulk, after watching the Hulk.  It's not a sequel, but rather another tale, that tries to convince you that the previous movie never happened.  The movie's flashbacks to the origin changes the story, the character's powers changed, the devil is different by name and ability, and Cage's acting just got worse.  It's pretty sad when the lead actor is the worst actor in the film.  The storyline was cliche, a throwback to 70's occult films, and badly so.  I wish I could get a refund for this waste of my time.  I encourage you to avoid at all cost.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|John Scalzi has some great stories, but Redshirts is not one of them. When I heard about Redshirts last year, I was very psyched. A typical Scalzi novel is filled with wit and humor and given the premise, Redshirts sounded like it was going to be full of that and so much more, while potentially delivering a fascinating story. Instead, we are treated to a curse laden short story that got stretched into a novel, and because it was still short and lacked depth, had three afterthoughts attached. What does it say when the codas contain more character depth than the novel itself? Sad, but true.<br /><br />A Scalzi protagonist is typically consistent between his novels: pun master, sarcastic, stubborn, and usually acts on behalf of the greater good. With Redshirts, all major characters felt like they were the same person because they all acted the same. Despite the novel's short length and that I read it in two days, I found myself getting confused with some of the main characters, not only because they all acted the same, but also because several names started with the same letter. Some disparity would have been appreciated.<br /><br />I really had high hopes, and while Redshirts is a very quick and easy read, ultimately it is only mildly amusing. It does not feel like Scalzi put as much focus as he has with his other novels. Redshirts is a respectful nod to Star Trek, but it constantly separated itself from any Star Trek kind of atmosphere with the often unnecessary and excessive swearing. Despite that, I welcomed the absurdity of the story's twist, which handily added to the attempted humor of the story, but it is still that same story that ultimately fails to deliver. Compared to Scalzi's other works, it is pretty easy to recognize why Redshirts falls short with the story, characters and humor.

B000JCSPG0|3.0|The basic movie available for download becomes clearly NOT an original version based as you can tell it has been edited so that it can be shown on tv where movies cannot have cuss words the way sitcoms can. In the discovery scene where Daniel Jackson claims the ability to decipher the script on the alien world, Jack O'Niel originally stated to the General, \\"He's full of Sh**\\" but in this varient you hear, \\"It's your call.\\"<br /><br />I always hate when things are not allowed to be as originally released unless a director's cut puts in more matter, but to NOT indicate this on the ad page is nearly deceptive and that is why I am making this post.

B005LLX582|2.0|Interesting how the positive reviews try to make up excuses for this movie being the way it is.<br />Often the characters are mumbling and it is hard to know what they are saying.<br />The kids in the movie often play games and the viewer is totally lost trying to figure out what games they are playing.<br />Brad Pitt is often seen just giving looks without any communication with his kids or his wife.<br />I guess mind readers might like this movie.<br />The makers of this movie make no effort in trying to help the viewer make any sense of the movie.<br />The photography is awesome. I thought I was going to watch a movie and watched it because of the reviews.<br />I guess if you watched the movie a few times it might begin to make sense.

B0077ATSSQ|2.0|I'll start by saying this; I am a huge fan of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel.  In fact, it is probably up there with `The Road', `Lord of the Flies', `American Psycho' and `The Remains of the Day' as one of my five favorite novels ever written (that I've read, obviously).  When this film was green lit and Hollywood was buzzing over it, I was ecstatic.  While I can't say that I worship Daldry, I do think that `Billy Elliot' is a masterpiece and I really, truly loved `The Reader'.  `The Hours', in my eyes, was a bore and a mess and a missed opportunity, but I see some of its merit.  I was underwhelmed by the casting decisions, mainly because Bullock and Hanks aren't my ideal actors (far too commercial for a film like this) and Horn was a complete nobody (I mean, he's from Jeopardy Jr. for god's sake) but the supporting cast which included Sydow, Davis, Goodman, Caldwell, Wright and Gandolfini (I can't believe they cut all of his scenes!) had me excited, and this prose is just so good.<br /><br />Some books are just not meant to be adapted.<br /><br />This makes me want to cry, but it's true.  I had this epiphany while watching `Everything is Illuminated', also adapted from a Safran Foer novel, and it happened again while watching `Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close'.  Safran Foer's writing is too absurd and intricate to be captured on the big screen.  A lot of his character development, while interesting and engaging on the printed page, comes off as painfully unrealistic on the big screen.  I told my wife, about halfway through the film, that Oskar is almost identical to the way he is depicted in the novel and yet I never had the urge to push him off a bridge while I was reading the book.<br /><br />Daldry's take on Foer's novel just doesn't work.  Foer's novel is too complicated and too detailed, and Daldry misses a lot of that detail.  I understand that the prose had to be focused more, considering that they couldn't make a five hour movie just to fit in everything Foer put in his book, but then again if you aren't going to incorporate all the facets of the book that make it so special, maybe you just shouldn't make the movie.  By skipping some of the books important character development (that whole backstory with Oskar's grandmother and the renter is especially important to the impact of the story) the film falls flat in areas where it should have really soared.<br /><br />I'll break up the negative by saying that Max Von Sydow was extraordinary and deserved that Oscar nomination; maybe even the Oscar just for that `STOP.  NO MORE!' scene alone.<br /><br />But alas, back to the pit of despair.  I was especially upset with the film's editing choices.  The construction of a novel and a film differ, and a novel can get away with excessive use of flashbacks because they can be clearly defined and incorporated in ways that don't take away from the particular sequence being depicted at that moment.  In film, flashbacks can be tricky, and if they aren't defined properly they can take away drastically from the film itself.  There are a LOT of flashbacks here, and while backstory is necessary to the development of this particular story, the way that they are administered (especially with the incorporated of that horrid narration) kept me getting increasingly more and more frustrated.  They took you out of the moment and put you somewhere else only to take you out of that moment and cause you to scramble to put yourself back where you were before the flashback started.  That narration didn't help much either.  I don't really like narration, unless it is essential.  `Little Children' probably has the best use of narration I've seen in a long time, but it is a rarity to find a film that uses it appropriately.  The fact that Oscar feels the need to tell us EVERYTHING is not appropriate.  The audience isn't stupid, but the narration makes us feel that way.  Then again, Thomas Horn's delivery is atrocious and adds to the annoyance of the narration.<br /><br />I hate picking on the kid, but it is easily the worst child performance I've seen since that last Sandra Bullock movie.  It's just so painful to watch because he tries so hard to be awkward that he comes off, well, awkward, but not in a good way.  The character of Oskar Schell is an odd one, sure, and so maybe it's just that he doesn't translate well, but I found Horn's manner of speaking to be so incredibly obnoxious I wanted to punch my television screen.  In the book, Oskar thought about weird things and he was unusually smart and curious and he had this maturity that was laced with so much immaturity that he was a compelling character, but I didn't read effeminate, and that is how Horn plays him, which is just odd and off-putting.  Also, the way he talks as if he's reading a book, so rehearsed, is just strange.<br /><br />I'll end this with some positive ink.  The score is AMAZING and the film is gorgeously lensed.  Sadly, technical aspects don't make for a great movie, and this film fails at nearly everything else.arration.<br /><br />I hate picking on the kid, but it is easily the worst child performance I've seen since that last Sandra Bullock movie.

0767803434|2.0|I'm just tired of movies that have no individuality.  They don't even try to attempt something remotely original, and that seems down into their casting decisions.  How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain?  Honestly, how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort?  Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those `women who wish they were as powerful as men' roles.  That is the big issue with `Air Force One', there is nothing original here.  The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation.  It doesn't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really.  The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed, but the tension just doesn't live up upon multiple viewings, and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it isn't worth watching more than once.

B001KRVLCI|2.0|The thought of John Travolta and Nicolas Cage in the same movie is just like an overload of dreckitude that I can't even fathom the idiot who thought this up, but apparently it went over well so what do I know.  I still question the taste of the world when I realize the draw that these men actually have in Hollywood, but I wash my hands of it.<br /><br />It's about twenty years too late, but it appears that the world has started to smart up to these guys.<br /><br />`Face/Off' is your standard action thriller in the sense that it lacks a lot of brains and instead infuses a lot of dynamite into each frame.  Cage is his usual bland self, and he basically sleepwalks through the majority of the film.  He tries to be all flamboyant and edgy in the first part of the film, but it comes across as stagy and laughable really.  John Travolta fares much better, because his mockery of Cage's flamboyancy is more believable and more fun to watch.  The idea of face swapping is rather preposterous, especially when you factor in the vast differences in the builds of these actors and the supposed technology they claim to use in the film is merely shrug worthy.  The thriller aspect of the film is light, but the action (especially the film's bookends) is heavy and fun to watch.  I shouldn't have expected more, but I did, sort of.<br /><br />Woo has a way with action scenes, but he's produced far better in his career.  In retrospect, this film doesn't hold up in the way it did back in the 90's and I'm sure half of the film's supporters would feel that way too upon a recent viewing.

B0011UF79C|5.0|I remember when I first saw `Gattaca'.  I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I remember quite vividly being completely blown away.  It just moved me in ways I wasn't expecting, and the dense originality was such a breath of fresh air.  I was taken away to this place I didn't know existed, and that is a rarity with this genre that still seems to bent on recreating other interpretations of the same.  It's rare to find a science fiction film that has its own identity, and not one ripped from the souls of another.<br /><br />In `Gattaca', the world has a pretty terrifying idea of what constitutes humanity and equality.  In this future world (not so distant), genetic manipulation is used heavily to influence the future of our offspring.  Classified as either `Valids' (those who have been genetically manipulated to be superior humans) or `In-Valids' (those born naturally), people are separated out and given certain privileges based on their status.  For Vincent, those privileges are not forthcoming because he was born naturally and thus is deemed inferior.  He has poor eyesight and a few other conditions that genetic manipulation could have eliminated and so his dreams of space travel are nothing more than mere dreams since he is unqualified to actually reach for them.  Vincent sees a way to reach his goals with the help of Jerome, a `Valid' who has suffered an accident and thus is crippled.  Offering his services (in the most complex of ways), Jerome essentially hands over to Vincent his `Valid-ness' and helps Vincent secure a position at Gattaca, a NASA of sorts that will groom Vincent for space travel.<br /><br />But all one has to do is yank the string and this whole façade could unravel before Vincent's very eyes.<br /><br />This film is so incredibly intricate and well thought out that I'm astounded every time I watch it.  It is also a technical achievement, for everything from the sets to the costumes to that wonderful score are all especially impressive; and then you have Jude Law's heartbreaking performance that is so sincere and commanding and unforgettable.  I wish that more movies were made with this intense interest in storytelling, in crafting something profound and unique and beautifully grounded.<br /><br />Boo to all that say this is boring!hen you have Jude Law's heartbreaking performance that is so sincere and commanding and unforgettable.

0743579275|5.0|Evolution is a fact, is what Richard Dawkins tells us again and again in the first chapter of the book. At times it could feel like brainwashing if it wasn't for the arguments and the facts that go along with it. \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" presents evolution from different perspectives following a similar approach to Stephen J. Gould's collections of essays, but (naturally) puts the pieces together more coherently in the end. It is almost a shame that there are endless excursions into quasi-arguments from creationists when evidence upon evidence for evolution is presented. (Sadly it seems necessary to reply to all sorts of allegations and attacks on scientific results again and again - we can call it a learning process.)<br /><br />The book starts with an excellent summary of the definition of a scientific theory versus the use of that same word in common speech - a delicate difference which creationists seem to ignore and mix on purpose. A scientific theory is the most fundamental formulation with which we can describe our world. It is either true or it is wrong and contrary to a model it should be generally applicable. The rest of the book is devoted to the general applicability of evolution to the heap of evidence we have collected. Regardless of any missing links (which we obviously can never completely fill) evolution is consistent with every single fossil that has been collected and any living species that we know about, quite opposite to internal contradictions of other \\"hypotheses.\\" This is maybe most impressive when it comes to independent evidence for plate tectonics and geologic timescales.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins reads the audiobook himself (together with Lalla Ward) and his professorial voice makes it all the more believable. There are several references to illustrations, photos, and figures in the text which are attached as a pdf-file to the audiobook. It is usually good enough to look at a handful of pictures beforehand if you can't look them up at the time they are discussed - they are described in detail in the text, too, where necessary.<br /><br />People who are interested in the topic will enjoy this book without a doubt. It should be recommended to everyone else even more - not so much for the purpose of convincing them but to spark a certain amount of curiosity and thinking about the world around them.at the time they are discussed - they are described in detail in the text, too, where necessary.<br /><br />People who are interested in the topic will enjoy this book without a doubt.

B007TBCTRK|3.0|Ill begin by explaining that I am not a fan of the Alien or Aliens soundtracks.  I've listened to both and as a big fan of James Horner's other scores, Aliens is not one of my favorites.  That being said, I was disappointed to see the direction Ridley Scott has gone with his composers since Kingdom of Heaven.<br /><br />This score claims it is all by Marc Streitenfeld but the best track \\"Life\\" and the theme was written by Harry Gregson Williams.  The theme is echoed throughout the score but never returns to the grandeur of the original track.  While watching the movie, I thought the soundtrack would be better than this.  It has some memorable cues, especially when it is not trying to focus on ambient themes since they sound copied from the Goldsmith soundtrack (and not in a good way).  I really enjoyed the sounds in \\"too close\\" which I must admit sounded awesome in the theater.  Overall, the whole thing is unremarkable and would merit a passive listen only if you are a big fan of soundtracks and liked the first two.<br /><br />Before I conclude, I did not compare this soundtrack to the original two directly  but judged it for its own merit.  I was really hoping for an epic and sweeping orchestral score and I got one track to go back to that is not even written by Streitenfeld.  I just hope Scott goes back to his roots with his next epic score.

B007KDFWRG|2.0|I like Susan Tedeschi and I like Derek Trucks but put them together on this album and one plus one equals less than what they could do separately.<br /><br />After getting over my initial disappointment of this album, I played it a few more times and it did not get any better. My opinion, this album is a snoozer.<br /><br />With Derek Truck's association with the Allman Brothers Band and with his guitar hero being Skydog, I was expecting some Statesboro Blues jams, but they did not happen on this album. I was expecting some blues and some blues rock on this album and it ended up being some sort of hybrid between jazz and blues (I believe), but just did not do much for me.<br /><br />My benchmark for jazz and blues is John Mayall's Jazz Blues Fusion and this album does not even get in the same solar system as the classic, Jazz Blues Fusion,in my opinion.<br /><br />It was slow slide for Trucks, except in a couple of rare instances where he picked up the tempo.<br /><br />Susan Tedeschi vocals did not disappoint. She is one of the best blues rock belters around and in my opinion, she saved this album from the recycle bin.<br /><br />I am not sure why they included horns on this album. The horn solos were just not very good and sounded amateurish. There just does not appear to be much chemistry between the various musicians as they moved in and out of solos and it sounded like they were not gelling to the music.<br /><br />It really sounded like the overall band was thrown together at the last minute and had not rehearsed much.<br /><br />Two songs I thought were good 1).cover of Everybody's Talking and 2). Midnight in Harlem. Best songs on the album, IMO.<br /><br />Overall, the album just did nothing for me. There are numerous five star rankings on this album so there are people out there that obviously got a lot out of this album, I did not. I would not recommend it.

B0053O89IS|4.0|Season 7 of this popular drama about the relationship between a genius anthropologist (Emily Deschanel) and a cocky FBI agent (David Boreanaz) kicks off with the duo adjusting to their unplanned pregnancy and their new shared life. Although Brennan and Booth have long spent much of their waking hours together, both in and out of work, things are vastly different when they're also living under the same roof.<br /><br />Much of the previous seasons' conflicts stem from, and center upon, the two's clashing personalities and approaches toward life, so naturally, that also comes into play when faced with decisions on how to raise their baby daughter.<br /><br />Although the season is only thirteen episodes - shortened because of Deschanel's real-life pregnancy and maternity leave - a number of key episodes and plots are featured. These include \\"The Hot Dog in the Competition,\\" where a new intern, Finn Abernathy (Luke Kleintank) joins the Jeffersonian squints. A genius who completed years of schooling in record time, Finn would be a welcome addition to the lab - if he didn't also have a questionable past that causes some of the others to worry.<br /><br />In \\"The Male in the Mail\\" Ralph Waite returns as Booth's grandfather Pops. This time, he brings disturbing news of Booth's long-estranged father, which of course evokes Booth's memories of his troubled childhood and in turn his feelings toward being a father himself.<br /><br />Booth's son Parker (Ty Panitz) makes only one appearance this season, in episode 10 (\\"The Warrior in the Wuss\\") when he returns from England and meets his baby sister. Booth and Brennan worry about how the 11-year-old, who's been an only child up to this point, will adjust to a new sibling and to the new family situation overall.<br /><br />Ryan O'Neal makes two guest appearances as Brennan's father Max, first in \\"The Family in the Feud,\\" where he offers to babysit little Christine, causing his daughter to revisit her mistrust of Max over his abandonment of Brennan as a teen. Then, in the season finale - \\"The Past in the Present\\" - Max again appears, this time to help his daughter and granddaughter when their lives are threatened by computer genius serial killer Christopher Pelant.<br /><br />As always, Tamara Taylor as Dr. Cam Saroyan, TJ Thyne as Dr. Jack Hodgins, Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro and John Francis Daly as Dr. Lance Sweets do an incredible job as supporting cast! They truly help make the stories what they are, and the show the success that it is.

B003A4IFGY|2.0|TP's early albums and his Jeff Lynne efforts have all gained a space on my \\"best ever\\" albums, but this one doesn't even come close.  I didn't give this album a one star, because it is possible that people who really like the blues might find something redeemable here.  But when a great rock band does a blues album, as Steve Miller did previously, it lets the fans down.  Anyone can do an unimaginative, by-the-book, self-indulgent blues set without even thinking, and that is what TP did here.  TP once said in an interview that he doesn't \\"write\\" songs, he just pulls them off the cosmic radio.  For his next album, he needs to change the station.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|The band was in shambles after Test for Echo, due to Neil's losses. Their follow-up, Vapor Trails, showed a band struggling to remain a band. Vapor Trails was a tremendous letdown for a lot of fans, myself included, not to mention holding the award for probably one of the worst sounding albums ever released by a major label, but it contains a lot of passion. Snakes and Arrows has some great moments and a few decent tracks overall, but it falls flat as whole. With Clockwork Angels we see Rush back in full swing. They want it again and they're pushing themselves to be as good as they know they can: Solid playing at a very high level, complex and intricate arrangements that keep your attention, and a passion that shows they really want to make something great!<br /><br />We thank you! Can't wait to see it live!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I read the other reviews and thought it was a good app. When it finished installing my virus protection told me it was malicious. I removed it immediately. my device is a Transform Ultra 3G
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it!! whenever i am bored i always go to this app!!:) works well except for an occasional glitch.
1469984202|5.0|This book is great! I bought this book after previewing the first chapter and getting hooked. I have lent this book to a few friends and recommended it to many more.  Everyone I know who has read the book hasn't been able to put it down.  Wool keeps you guessing what is going to happen next and never gets dull.  And it gets better - the author, Hugh Howey, already has the sixth installment (First Shift - Legacy) out and is working on others.  The Wool series has quickly become one of my favorites and Hugh Howey is now one of my favorite authors.  I'm looking forward to checking out his other work.<br /><br />Don't pass this book up!
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally! It is here! I've had to steal my brother's iPad to play this, and now it is for Kindle Fire!!! Also, this is an amazing app!!! Have fun with this one!!!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I think picsart photo studio is better than instagram!! there is more effects &amp;&amp; more and cool stickers!!!!! this app doesn't not glitch eather whoaa who!!!!
B007Q476KU|3.0|This is the first Spielberg flick that I have seen since \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\".  What a disappointment. While the film was inoffensive, it was predictable and cliche in the extreme. Also, from a guy that has done such movies as the Iwo Jima movies, \\"Band of Brothers\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", etc.: How could he come up with such ridiculously inaccurate war scenes?  The calvalry charging through a line of machine guns and not stopping to kill the gunners? Phosgene gas spreading at the speed of sound?<br /><br />If you like horses more than a plausible story, you will like this.  I, for one, will not be picking any more movies simply based upon the Producer.
B007G51UV0|1.0|I can't review this motherboard because when i installed it doesn't work, the mother motherboard was DEAD... I was very dissapointed at that point but amazon.com refund me all and we have other one from ASUS but not the same model...<br /><br />See you all!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm terrible at giving reviews (I just end up babbling) so i usually refrain, but this book... This book absolutely floored me, leaving me completely emotionally spent, yet utterly satisfied! What a fantastically written story! I loved the believabilty (is that a word?) of each character and all of their life situations. I loved belly laughing at times, and having tear-stained cheeks during others. I literally could not stop reading after having worked a 12hr night shift! A highly recommended read!
B007SWZVBQ|3.0|This CD is not as good as the previous ones.  The song choices were not as good.  Hopefully there will be a Glee CD #8 soon.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is awesome and so fun but like every time you jump sometimes it does not jump with you you move to the right or left. sometimes it does not work but any way I loooooove this game buy it any upgrade it and fruit ninja is trying to copy apple but I love it hater girlzz

B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game ever.You should get it now. be careful though.Hurry up though.It is hard.The first time I played Temple Run it was on my aunt Tara's ipad.I was really bad at first but got better. My high score is 137-376.
B00000JNO2|5.0|I've loved everything LS ever did so maybe it's just me but I don't understand why folks think this was a below average attempt by Lynyrd Skynyrd.  This is typical Lynyrd Skynyrd with the triple axe attack.  Double Trouble is the best song on the LP and was inspired by a conversation between Ronnie and Gary Rossington in the drunk tank after being arrested.  Ronnie asked Gary how many times he had been busted and he said 3 I think, Ronnie said I've been arrested 11 times to which Rossington responded, \\"Your just double trouble aren't you?\\" and a song was born... \\"I Got the Same Old Blues\\" is another J.J. Cale song done well by the boys.  If you are a Skynyrd fan and don't have this Cd you definitely need to buy it.
0316044695|5.0|I read this book in about 4 days!  It makes you truly appreciate what these soldiers endure and sacrifice for those of us here in the USA.  As they say, the best stories are always the true stories and this is a great story about a lot of American Heroes!  I highly recommend this book and just wanted to say thank you to all the men and women in the US Forces that do so much for us.  Thank you!  ....and thank you Marcus Luttrell and the rest of the SEAL team.  I for one can say that those who made the ultimate sacrifice for the rest of us, will not be forgotten.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Love most of the songs on this CD. I've got it playing on repeat in my car. This guy impresses me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the worst book ever for many reasons. The character is annoying as all hell. If I read that he was so hot one more time I was going to blow my head off. Basically a horny 13 year old could have written this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun and I really like playing it the graphics are cool<br />very addictive cant wait to open more levels
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like this game because first u cant lose puzzle pieces and its like a real puzzle....... so I really like this game
0553582038|1.0|I'll keep this short since previous reviewer's mentioned the same feelings I've had.  This is a totally different book from the first 3, centering on new characters that were rarely mentioned before.  Large amounts of story happen behind the scenes and we never get to read about the important plot points.  Most are just mentioned in passing, usually one or two lines.  There are large amounts of dreams and scenes that do not carry the story foward, you can skip pages of descriptions and dreams without losing any plot points.  Overall, a very boring and tedious book after reading the first three.  Very disappointed, I may stop reading this series all together.  It seems like George R.R. Martin is now just in it for the money.  Very sad.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|When I first started this book, I wondered about the story.  As I continued reading - it became a very interesting mystery.  I could  not wait to get back to it and find out what was going to come out next.  The characters were completely interwoven, but you had to piece it together.  I think she is a great author and would read another one of her books.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is probably one the most addicting and fun games I have ever played. WARNING:sometimes when you turn or jump the kindle fire doesn't react so u die. besides that this is a truley awesome game!!!!!
B007R41E8O|1.0|I had problems with downloaded also and I know it is not a problem with my device it is a new Kindle Fire.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I couldn't believe we had missed this movie on the big screen but was pleased that we had made this purchase to fill the gap.<br /><br />The computer generated graphics, objects and animations are top notch.  I didn't notice one animation flaw on our 1080p projected image (96\\" screen).<br /><br />This movie provides all of the information necessary to tie together Captain America and The Avengers.  Although I typically struggle to see dark blue and brown movie tints this feature has an orchestrated flow that allows light into scenes that I would normally loose.  The physical struggles presented throughout the video were realistic enough to prevent a fantasy-world approach to the film.<br /><br />My hat is off to the director, animators, and screen writer(s) for a job very well done.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Addicting, lots of modes and levels. Can not wait for more. Used to hang on start up sometimes but latest version seems fixed.
B001DRF84W|3.0|Somewhat a complete history of the Hulk.  The background information leading to the creation of the hulk was a little challenging in my opinion but it does add fictional credibility to the story line.  The Blu-ray rendition of the Hulk character sometimes reveals the digital graphics but it definitely enhances all other aspects of the cinematography.  Well worth the money if you are interested in completing timelines of all Avengers characters.
1469984202|5.0|WOOL Omnibus was a huge hit for me.  After a few good books being digested, I'm getting picky about what I pick up but I had taken note of the reviews/stars and thought I would trust in my fellow reader.  Good call on my part.<br /><br />I love how Hugh Howey sucks you in and smacks you upside the head with events, so one has to stay on their toes when reading WOOL.<br /><br />What a cracked society, living underground in silos, and the punishment for grievous crimes is to have to go outside and clean the camera lenses.  But cleaning isn't all it's cracked up to be.  And that's just the first part of the story.<br /><br />The rest is an incredible read where Howey fills the tension of an upcoming moment with plenty of details.  Details you want to know and yet want to rush through them to get to this moment of resolution.<br /><br />Tension, drama, excitement and wonderment are all here.<br /><br />I do have a negative-nanny thing to say about it... and that it's not long enough. I NEED more!<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Howey!  Now... on to the prequel.  I'm not even \\"17\\"... or \\"18\\" pages in yet, and I know I'm in for a fun ride!  HA!
B0086700CM|5.0|so fund and addicting.my sister gets mad Cu's she cant beat me its just a beast game.its simple and fun.it took no time to install.its just amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0088TG252|4.0|The movie was great. I really loved it except for the shaky camera work. Other than that the story was exciting. The cast was A1 and the action, very good. However, it was hard to see what the action really was because of the shaking and movement of the camera work.
B003EYVXTQ|2.0|The movie was boring. There is a reason why it grossed so little (about twelve million dollars or so as I recall).  I then bought the book to see if the book was better than the movie.  Nope.<br /><br />But Jennifer Lawrence played her role well. The setting of the movie (in a very poor part of the country), and the type of character Jennifer played was similar to the role of Katniss Everdeen in \\"The Hunger Games\\". I think she may have been selected to play Katniss specifically because of her performance in Winter's Bone.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! I fell in love with the characters. I normally don't write reviews but I recommend this to everyone
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so incredibly addictive. You start playing and can not stop...you just keep trying to beat your previous score. As the title says...just do it.
0547569653|5.0|This book caught my attention after I'd read 'Born to Run', and I must say it's very good reading.  Scott gives a lot of color and details into his life as an ultramarathon runner.  His motivations, his philosophies, his races, his love for running, all given in a wonderfully readable manner.  Some books you can't put down.  This book, you'll want to put it down from time to time, just because it truly inspires you to go running!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much!!! Its SUPER addictive! I am always trying to beat my high score. If you are looking for a game that is super fun and addictive then this is defenitly your game!!!! FIVE STARS!!!!!!
B00634GHJA|5.0|Nice app, I like the way how I transfer my photos and videos. I recommended to all, I like it. Thanks!!!!

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Did not disappoint and well worth the time and money...loved it. It was compelling and exciting and I feel they did a great job not making a repeat of the first Sherlock. Great movie, great director and definitely great actors.
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is hard at first and is pretty hard to beat, then you get use to it so its super fun!!
0767840135|3.0|This was a good show, started off a little slow but then picked up. I feel as if dralion and allegria are a lot more worth of purchasing.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was totally taken by surprise when I began reading this series of books. I was originally surfing for light reading but then I decided to refine my search and pick the \\"highest rated\\" books. When \\"Wool\\" came up at at 4.9, I thought, \\"how could so many people be wrong about this author? I have to take a chance\\". I am glad I did. This was the first book I ever took to work and read on my lunch break. I couldn't put it down. I started telling my family the storyline at first and then they started coming to me asking \\"what was happening.\\" I think I have a new favorite author. The price for Wool Omnibus Edition almost makes me think I am stealing from you Hugh **laughs**, so I will go purchase \\"First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series)\\" and give you a little more income.
0441009425|5.0|If you like SF (\\"hard\\" or \\"Space Opera\\"), you will *love* it.  It is the start of a cycle, but stands on its own.  Read it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|really good summer reading, sure keeps your interest, always wondering what will happen next. makes you want to continue onto the next chapter.
B005Z271Y6|3.0|This lady has an incredible voice that lends itself comfortably to different genres such as jazz, blues and country. However the concert was ruined by her complete lack of education and insensitivity to the fact that not everyone who likes Adele's work enjoys hearing F-bombs every second word. Like a 10 year-old who's just discovered swearing, she uses the F-word much as another person uses adjectives.<br /><br />Adele, if you want to restrict yourself to concerts in London where your filthy mouth is acceptable, good luck to you. You will find, as you begin to travel the world, that your potty-mouth style will not endear you to the vast majority of the fans you crave.<br /><br />A very good concert marred by this one, ongoing lapse in judgment.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|One reader got to 88% of the book, another to 50 pages, before they had to put it down. I think I only got to 15 pages (or so, right after the two main characters meet for the first time) before I threw the book down in annoyance. People are saying this is bad as Twilight, well, I was able to finish that. This, this is really trash. The writing is just so very juvenile and amateurish. Fanfiction-ish, at its worst. I cannot believe this is a bestseller. I cannot believe how so many other people think is this is anywhere in the vicinity of good. As one other reader stated, it's like this book is written by a [hormonally imbalanced] 12-year-old.  The author tries way too hard to write something erotic. I rolled my eyes at Anna's \\"awkwardness\\", I rolled my eyes at the author's attempt to portray Grey as the ulitmate man-of-your-dreams/sex-god. You could say I shouldn't be saying this much when I've barely read the book. Well, that was all it took really. And to see the many other, rightfully negative reviews of this book, I'm glad to see there are people who know a good book when they read one. What appalls me is to see the positive reviews of this book. Really? What is the world coming too?
1592802974|5.0|If there is one thing I need to say about this book, is that many of its timeless lessons are garnered from reading between the lines. I first read it when my boss was given a copy by her boss back in the early 90's. I read it then and I still read it today. I feel for thise that can't see the value or require the lessons to be hammered home. The people in this book remain steadfastly successful and so it should be that we take their insights with us and build on our own foundations.<br /><br />A must read.<br /><br />Nick Radge<br />[[ASIN:B007T97DJQ Unholy Grails - A New Road to Wealth]]
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This series, i've since read both books so far in it, are fantatsic. The author creates a great story, with really great character development. These are just very engrossing novels!
B0086700CM|4.0|I would have given 5 stars but sometimes it glitches in the middle of the game causing me to lose. other than that, my fav game at the moment.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game totally rocked I play it every day get it!!!!! I have it on kindle fire and its easy.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|very fun but sometimes boring when you cant find anything to match but overall I really like it, even though its not your typical game but I like how its based and works
B0086700CM|5.0|Really fun &amp; addicting. I love to reach the objectives and trying to beat my score! Its good to keep busy &amp; if you like games with goals!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|The game is quite fun,  being I love art,  but the loading screen keeps freezing. I even re-installed it,  only to have the same problem.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Complicated beginning, harder to go back on a Kindle, almost wish i had taken notes on the characters! There are so many aliases for each character, it was hard to keep them straight.  But once you're 1/4 through they become more clear.  I am guilty of neglecting life just to find out what happens next!
B000000OF6|5.0|The music is awesome.  Both CD's have Queen's best music.  They sound great. I highly recommend the set! The only issue we had was when we ran the cd's on the computer.  Microsoft Media Player read the song list off CD-2 and displayed incorrect song titles (a bit confusing if ripping).  The song list on the cd box is correct but the electronic listing is goofy, so when the song title appears on our mp3 player, it has the wrong song title. It doesn't affect the quality of music any, it's just a minor irritation to those that need all their ducks in a row.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|song writing at it's very best from slow tracks to upbeat one's, this band is a hided gem should be better known in the uk if you like lady antebellum you will like the band perry.
B001TAFCBC|1.0|About halfway through this mess, I stopped the movie and read some of the reviews.  I hadn't read the reviews before, but had seen the high rating.  The movie was such a disjointed, boring, confusing mess at the halfway point that I thought I must have looked at the wrong rating.  I then tried to keep watching, couldn't, and skipped ahead to the end.  Bottom line:  I did NOT like it.  I didn't find it entertaining, interesting, funny, etc.  I find it odd that people are so hostile toward those who did not like this movie.  I'm sure I'll get hate responses to my review.  Whatever.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has so much buzz that I had to give it a try. The story covers one of those \\"ripped from the headlines\\" dramas that NBC's Today show loves to cover. A wife disappears and suspicion soon falls on the husband. But do not be misled, this outing is far more layered than its packaging. It is constructed from two different views reminiscent of David Mamet's Oleanna with the plot's twists and turns causing us to pick sides while repeatedly fooling us.<br /><br />These alternating viewpoints made me quicken my reading pace, I did not want either main character to have the final word so it was a challenge to put it down. Author Flynn's descriptive prose is another reason for speedy consumption. In this era of soundbites and 140-character Tweets, her book is replete with taut, entertaining quips and observations, such as her description of a character with a \\"rocket-science brain and the rodeo spirit\\" or that one enjoyed \\"taking thick afternoon naps\\", or the husband's lament that \\"My wife was no longer my wife but a razor-wire knot daring me to unloop her\\". Each page was an archaeological dig into the psychology of this couple which is appropriate because this is much more than a whodunit...it is a far more engrossing whydoit.<br /><br />Embedded throughout is an indictment of the media in sensationalizing human drama and misfortune. When a few layers of the onion has been peeled back it is noted that \\"The bigger the lie, the more they believe it.\\" The real criticism is directed at the blurring of news and entertainment and the manipulation and misdirection that results. George Orwell said, \\"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed. Everything else is pubic relations.\\" Arguably, everything is public relations and always has been.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn does not waste a page in this dark and suspenseful read ... if this is one of your book club's selections then look forward to lively discussion and dissection.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|amazon really messed this one up. can't play the game without buying more features. do not download. miniclip took a great game and made it awful
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a fast paced and attractive game.  I love that you can play for a little or as long as you like. it is very challenging.
1451648537|5.0|I've heard many good and bad things about Apple. After reading this book everything made sense. I'm left with the question: Can Apple survive without Steve Jobs?
B00802JMPO|5.0|It was alot better than expected!<br />I had read the prior review and was discouraged. But I kept hearing good things from other people. Was def better than expected.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love it the opinions are endless I tell you. I would highly<br />recommend it. It is so much fun!!!!!!!!!
031261246X|5.0|It's great reading books that you can recognize real world scenarios in. I just finished a course in network security and loved reading about things I learned about. I also watch Mark's Case of the Unexplained series and I downloaded his Sysinternals suite. What great tools to use to solve PC and IT problems. Thanks Mark and looking forward to your next book!
0867905018|5.0|I already bought one a few yrs back and was thinking of giving the new copy to a neighbor of mine who  thought seemed a little lost in the world.<br />I only hope she don't take my gift the wrong way as i only mean well.
034580404X|5.0|I love, love, love these books.  They take me away to a fantasy world, I really need at this time in my life.  I wish I could be Anastasia Steele.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is my favorite Pride and Prejudice movie thus far. There are I think 3 versions out there or that I know of. This one is the best by far. Colin Firth...mmmmm:) He actually had a relationship in real life with Jennifer Ehle. Knowing this also made the movie great too since you know that they had chemistry on and off the screen.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I get frustrated with games that require real money in order to complete goals. I got this game because I have a similar game on my Pc. I think the would be a lot more fun if I didn't have to buy credits to finish projects.
B0086700CM|5.0|if you haven't got this app then wow.... its like the best game ever!! I would really advise you to get this app
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|Worst movie, slow weird sceens. Way too long, not a thriller or action, just BORING, waiting for something, anything to happen then credits its over. Stupid ending, no girl no money, does he die? I dont know. Its like they ran out of money and just stopped filming. Both thumbs down 0*
B0070UFMOW|5.0|This is a great product.<br /><br />I have a Cowon J3 and this amp makes my portable music experience a lot better. It's very cool and brings out some sounds I normally wouldn't hear if only using my headphones.<br /><br />I'm using Grado 225i (still breaking in) and this amp completes the package.<br /><br />Very fun to mess around with the equalizer and see what works. (I've read a few people enjoy turning the Bass +2)<br /><br />My headphones (which are known to be a little colorful, yet clear for vocals, rock and electronic...), became more enjoyable at comfortable levels.<br /><br />I can say with confidence that I now have the best portable music set-up on the block.<br /><br />PS: This thing is solid. Built to last a long time. With plenty of outputs and a solid build, I would compare it to an iRiver H340.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|She sounded great in \\"I want to know what love is\\".  She should consider a vocal career.  Very good CD.
0345803485|5.0|This book was a great story and I could not put it down.  I read all three of the books in the series within one week.  As a twilight fan I love the parallels to twilight. I was sad once I had read all three of the books because it was such an escape from my busy working mom of three life.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games that will keep you playing for hours...I would recommend this game to any1 that loves flash games.
B004U52VPS|5.0|We bought this after our 4 year old son begged for it for months. Truthfully, I thought it would be tedious and a bit boring, but I was wrong! He loves it and we do to. But we veer from the game in that we don't use the cards or keep points, or we only use the cards occassionally. To us, the best part is in the building and then knocking it over. And 1 game isn't enough. To truly build something fun and creative, we bought 2, this one and the Ice one. After playing for a while, we thought we could use another one, and we bought the one that is exclusive to Target (Easter type one).<br /><br />We've had no problems with lost pieces, and find they are fairly sturdy (although we do only play on the carpet). I think the best part of these games is that you use your imagination to build whatever you want. We call it playing freestyle, and it's kept him entertained for long periods of time. It's great to do this as a family.<br /><br />Give this game a chance, maybe buy more than one, and I think you'll see the expanded possibilies of this game.
B000FVRABG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the music.  I listen to it many times each week. It is great value for the money. I liked and have enjoyed all the bonus pieces included. The service from Amazon was excellent.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game a lot it is fun and challenging for little kid's. it is 101games in 1 game.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|The CGI, props and sets carry the movie. The script although based on the fantastic stories of ERB is what holds this movie back. By analogy would you buy a 30 year old computer and be entertained by it's functions? No. The book and it's predecessors were based on a subject that we didn't know much about at that time and for an audience that had knowledge of the subject area that a 10 year old would now laugh at. The dialogue especially seemed too dated and Hollywood dumb speak like. The rest of the script when compared to scifi, fantasy and other futuristic films that have come out these past two decades also seemed old and dated. A movie and it's inspirational book are two different mediums - it's OK to allow the movie to be scripted as a separate identity yet still pay homage to it's text inspiration. Know and write for the audience.
B0086700CM|4.0|This one is pretty good. The graphics aren't great. But..the gameplay is challenging and fun. Temple Run is a worthwhile download.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this puzzle game is very addictive. not only do I enjoy it I cant get it away from my kids. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys puzzles.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I had been looking for an app like minecraft and got this. Its very fun! If you don't think this proves its goodness get the free lite version!
B0086700CM|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I downloaded this game. Let's just say I cant seem to put it down. It's VERY addicting. A must to GET!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0073PPKNM|5.0|If you haven't heard this artist you are truly missing out.  She will set your soul ablaze with her sultry tones.  Not in the past 50 years have we found a singer of this quality and it will likely be atleast that long before another comes along.  Read her bio if you truly want to be impressed, actually, listen to her music if you TRULY want to be impressed.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book had far too much sex and not enough story. The relationship between the two main characters reeked of the Twilight series and was completely unrealistic. I will not be purchasing the second or third book.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive wanted for the amazon app store to get temple run for forever. they were a little late but it still came out and I love it!
B00514HDNW|5.0|Great story. Much better than the movie.<br /><br />Kindle edition is okay. I didn't see anything that called attention to itself like poor formatting or anything like that.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|Saw this in theaters and it was a very good experience. Very entertaining and really keeps you on the edge of your seat i think they really showed out with this final destination they took the next level of entertainment and i really enjoyed this movie so i knew i had too add it too my collection of movies.
B004MYF4SS|4.0|This starts out as a murder mystery but soon becomes much more. The lead character, a policeman named Fin, lost his 8 year old son 4 weeks before the story begins. He is sent to Lewis because there is a murder there which might be connected to the one he is investigating at home on the mainland. He grew up on Lewis and the story turns to dark episodes from his past told in the first person.<br /><br />There's some lovely descriptive writing here and the story is intriguing and involved. I felt, though, that the loss of his young son didn't seem to affect him as I'm sure it would. The author seemed to remember and just mention it now and then which, for me, didn't ring true. It's less of a murder mystery and more of a memoir of childhood. Suppressed memories surface to explain the complex relationships but I was still left with a question. As this is the first of a trilogy I would expect not to have all the answers. Definitely a good story.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|The movie was good and had plenty of action scenes. The idea was somewhat far fetched but seems to be the norm lately.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I kept hearing everyone talk about this book, and that got me interested. Then, I started reading all the bad reviews on amazon and almost didn't read it. So know that I was extremely skeptical when I decided to read this book, almost to the point of looking for things wrong with it.<br /><br />Yes, it's true. The writing is horrible. It was a great idea that definitely could have been better executed. How many times can you use the words flush, blush, crimson, and scarlet??? There are other ways to convey the same meaning. It got old. Fast. However, I was able to over look that, as well as the other writing flaws. This book sucks you in and you just can't stop reading. I finished the entire trilogy in a week. I couldn't stop. I read everywhere I went, even at work. Luckily, I have a job where that was relatively easy to do. :) While reading the first book, I did come across things that made me think \\"ehh...  I'm not sure about this,\\" but I kept reading because it just sucked me in. I didn't even know it was a BDSM novel until it was revealed in the book. That and the bad writing is what made me unsure I would like it. In my opinion, the sex scenes were better than your traditional romance novel. None (well maybe some, but not much) of that awkward wording that makes you think \\"people don't talk like this!!!\\" I was reading a sex scene in the 2nd or 3rd book and thought to myself, \\"I feel like I've already read this....\\" So yes, maybe the sex was a little too frequent and the author basically ran out of ideas. Because of this, there were times I was thankful that she just implied they were having sex and skipped over the details of it. Other than that, I thought the sex scenes were hot and well written. I did have a problem with the references to Ana's pubic hair, though. I mean... What 21 year old girl, virgin or not, doesn't shave down \\"there.\\" I thought that every woman under the age of at least 30 (probably even older than that) shaved. Maybe I'm wrong though :/(I'm 24 years old)<br /><br />Another major complaint: The whole \\"fifty shades of..\\" thing was only clever and interesting ONCE, when you read it on the cover of the book. I hated how she kept trying to push that. She should have just ensured that the reader got the meaning of the title (which you do get it eventually) and left it alone instead of using it everywhere \\"five shades of crimson\\", \\"seven shades of Sunday,\\" etc... I was okay with it the first time she used it in the book, but after that she needed to drop it. I guess this goes back to bad writing and poor editing.<br /><br />I wish the author would have described in better detail what they both looked like, as well as done a better job of developing the characters. I also want to know more about what Christian was thinking along the way, how and why he got to where he did towards the end of the trilogy. I also want more details about how he reacted and felt towards what happened at the end of the 3rd book (I won't say what it was so I don't spoil it for others)<br /><br />I love Christian Grey. He is the dream (except for being completely messed up). Dominant, controlling, bossy, jealous, sexy, successful, etc. Of course you wouldn't want some or most of that from a man in reality, but I enjoyed reading about it. It's a fantasy, and I wouldn't have it any other way. He has to be extraordinary for any woman to want to read about him. Who wants to read about some every day guy?? I loved it.  I also liked Ana. She acted the same way any woman would act in front of a man like him and she stood up for herself when she needed to.<br /><br />Despite the obvious problems, I LOVED this book and am so happy I gave it a chance, but I'm so so so sad that it's over. I want more. Now!!! I don't even know what to do with myself now. This has been my obsession for the past week and now it's over. oh, will I ever find a replacement, something comparable (better written this time, hopefully)??? Lol. Just read it and try not to dwell too much on the writing or some of the unrealistic or repetetive parts. It's a great story and definitely kept me interested. I even teared up in the third book. In a way it is so bad, but it is just addicting for some reason. I may even re-read it! :)<br /><br />I usually like to know the reading background of people who give me their opinion of a book because usually they rave about something and turns out that's the only book they've ever read so they have no basis for comparison or idea of what a good book is. Some of my all time favorites are The Red Tent, Hadassah: One Night with the King, Harry Potter Series, Dying to Please.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|First, my bona fides:  I've been a Rush fan since 1980. I've been to see them live every year they've performed since the mid '80s without missing a tour.  Has anyone noticed the crazy-looking Siek with the turbin who has been front and center at their concerts for the past few years? I've got a really cool Starman tat on my right shoulder. I named my son Geddy. And yes, I do listen to other bands besides Rush. :-p<br /><br />Most Rush albums had to grow on me. I can remember listening to Power Windows and getting this feeling in the pit of my stomach that they were losing it. Then the next listen I noticed the really sick guitar licks in The Big Money. Then the next listen I emotionally connected to Middletown Dreams and felt a little sad.  In all of their albums, the initial uneasiness upon the first or second listen was eventually replaced with adoration and respect. I frequently listen to Caress of Steel, which is supposedly their worst album.<br /><br />Not so with this album. I immediately recognised it as their finest work to date. The casual Rush fan probably doesn't get the story of the album: a young man's journey through life with it's trials, setbacks, devastation, and finally redemption (a novel is following shortly and I can't wait to read when).  Double-entandre is a standard Peart lyric writing tool.  The album can also be taken as Rush's journey through life, and it certainly has meaning to me personally as many of its themes reflect my own disappointments with my life. I've lost my religion, my country, and my self-respect (being a Service Academy grad who has been working construction for  the past two decades kind of hammers your self-esteem).  When I was listening to this at my manly construction job, I literally teared up while listening to The Garden. I've got my own garden to tend to: a wife and two kids. \\"A measure of a life is a measure of love and respect, so hard to earn and so easily burned.\\" Then Alex wailed and my throat closed up. I have a blessing at home. I have the love and repect of three wonderful people, and it doesn't matter what I do for a living. I won't be remembered for that. I'll be remembered for \\"The way you live, the gifts that you give.\\" That song is the most beautiful song they've ever produced.<br /><br />All of us old guys are starting to feel our mortality and are reflecting on a life that is almost done.  I think this is why this album touches me.  It won't be long before we all go into the great beyond...or we go to where we were before we were born: not existing. Rush has been my constant companion.<br /><br />One a happier note, the bass in The Anarchist makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. The way Alex and Neal take off running like three-legged racers running a 4.20 40 yard dash at the beginning of said song boggles my mind given that these guys are turning 60-ish.<br /><br />My bro-in-law also informed me that he spent the day all choked up while listening to the album. I guess it's an album for old guys.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really loved the book. I did not think that it was a book I would like, but once I started reading the first one of the series. I had to order the second two.
B007RP4D5Y|4.0|On \\"Unity Band\\", Pat Metheny reveals that he can look in two directions at once.<br />The group he's assembled here is an all-star ensemble.<br />Drummer Antonio Sanchez has been with him for a decade, while double bassist Ben Williams makes his first appearance with the guitarist, as does tenor saxophonist Chris Potter (whose soprano and bass clarinet playing are on display, too).<br />Metheny makes full use of this ensemble's possibilities.<br />He looks back through his catalog and composes for this band from some of the information gleaned there. One can recall the swirling melodic euphoria of the Pat Metheny Group in the guitar and guitar-synth interplay in \\"Roofdogs\\".<br />On the ingenious \\"Come and See\\", Metheny's many-stringed Picasso guitar meets Potter's bass clarinet to create a tonal inquiry before Williams and Sanchez establish a deep blue groove. When Potter adds his tenor and Metheny his electric, we get a Latinized swinging pulse that is ever so slightly reminiscent of the 80/81 band with Michael Brecker and Dewey Redman (this isn't the only place that happens here).<br />Fans of Metheny's more abundantly lyrical side will appreciate the breezy sway of \\"Leaving Town\\", though its melody -- twinned by his guitar and Potter -- is full of compelling tight turns, before the rhythm section evokes a deep, swinging blues and the guitarist gets refreshingly funky in his solo.<br />On \\"Signals\\" Metheny uses his Orchestrion and guitar with live loops: the band employs live loops throughout the intro on top.<br />Potter's tenor solo is emotive, grainy, and reaching, while the atmosphere recalls -- only generally -- the album the guitarist cut with Steve Reich.<br />The nocturnal, smoky \\"Then and Now\\" has a torch ballad quality due to Potter's utterly songlike solo.<br />The set closer \\"Breakdealer\\" begins at the boiling point and gets hotter.<br />The title hints at what Sanchez does throughout the tune while pushing forward, but Williams not only keeps up, he adds propulsive shades of his own and rocks the arpeggiated changes fluidly.<br />Metheny and Potter are free to sprint and they do; both dazzle with their lyric invention and knotty, imaginative, nearly boppish solos.<br />The two front-line players are surely at their best in one another's company on the date: you expect them to be. Yet it's the rhythm section that astonishes thoroughly. Their interplay is not only intuitive, it's informative: it points to new corners for Metheny and Potter to explore.<br />Given the guitarist's more compositional solo experiments of the last few years -- all of which have been very satisfying -- \\"Unity Band\\" is a return to what he does best: composing for, and playing with, a band of top-shelf players.

B0012CH350|5.0|I have had 2 other smokers in the past ALL CRAP!  I got them because they were cheap (big mistake).  I have a Weber grill and love it so I decided to get this smoker.  It was easy to put together.  There was one bolt missing in the hardware kit.  So I called CS for Weber figuring it would be a nightmare.  A CS rep picked up the phone right away (no endless prompts).  He wanted to make sure he got me the correct bolt so he just sent out another hardware kit.  Also I called on Thursday night and shipping had already picked up for that day so he sent it Saturday delivery.....  Are you kidding me??????  Any other company would of told you 2-3weeks to get it out.  Weber is an awesome company and I will continue to buy their products.<br /><br />On to the smoker<br />All I have to say is wow!  I have never been able to manage temps in my other smokers above the 200's.  I lit this thing up for the first time and waited for it to warm up.  I went out and the temp was pegged at 375.  Needless to say I was excited.  I adjusted the vents to get the temp to 250 and it just stayed there.  AMAZING!  Get this smoker don't screw around with the other ones.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|The 1979 film ALIEN took the modern-day lead in alien invasion and/or possession movies with some fairly gruesome special effects (remember the alien bursting through John Hurt's chest?), and making it so that any film of this sort more or less has had to utilize those same methods from that point on, with the most noticeable example being John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING.  And now, in a new century, thirty-three years after that huge box office achievement, ALIEN (and BLADE RUNNER) director Ridley Scott has returned to this theme with PROMETHEUS.<br /><br />Named for the Greek god who stole and gave the gift of fire and was cast out from Mount Olympus, the spaceship \\"Prometheus\\" and her crew are venturing through the galaxy to find the origins of the strange lights in the sky that ancient Earth civilizations, including the Egyptians and the Mayans, reputedly saw some thirty-five thousand years before--an idea floated around by theologian Erich von Daniken.  When they arrive on a planet hundreds of billions of miles from Earth, they find evidence of this in a huge hollow mountain on the surface.  Unfortunately, what they also find is that this alien presence is extremely hostile; and one by one, they die very horrible deaths.  In between, they come to realize that these aliens are actually intent on hitching a ride on \\"Prometheus\\" and coming to Earth in order to either destroy or possess every living human being there.  In doing so, they have to sacrifice themselves, often in the most horrible ways; and in the end, one of the female crew members (Noomi Repace), who had initially been infected and impregnated by one of the alien beings, manages to escape the planet in one of the various spaceships left over from the alien race.  But there's something she doesn't know yet....<br /><br />Although he had done some impressive work following BLADE RUNNER, including GLADIATOR, BLACK HAWK DOWN, BLACK RAIN, and 1492: CONQUEST OF PARADISE, Scott had been basically been overshadowed by his younger brother Tony, who co-produced PROMETHEUS with him, David Giler, and Walter Hill (the last two the original co-producers of ALIEN), and had upped the hyper-directional stakes with 2004's MAN ON FIRE and the 2009 reworking of 1974's THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE-TWO-THREE.  In essence, Ridley was going back to the basic premise of ALIEN, so much to the point that it could be argued that basically PROMETHEUS itself is a basic reworking of ALIEN, with a \\"Chariots Of The Gods\\" plot thrown in, and some up-to-date and extremely graphic alien special effects.  The crew of \\"Prometheus\\" here is far less well known than the cast that comprised the crew of \\"Nostromo\\" in ALIEN; only Charlize Theron, who had won an Oscar in 2003 for portraying a serial killer in MONSTER, and Guy Pearce, who was in the 1997 film noir hit L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, have any real \\"name value.\\" As a result, whatever success PROMETHEUS can claim, though it is substantial, must rest on how well the entire cast, the gruesome plot, and Scott's direction hold up under very close scrutiny.  In general, Scott is a fairly classical director, relying more on what he learned from masters like Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles than his younger brother, who has taken the MTV \\"splinters to the brain\\" style of direction to new highs and lows, this in spite of the many special visual effects, and the many ultra-gory make-up effects sequences as well.<br /><br />Given how many dozens of alien invasion movies there have been since he made ALIEN, one wouldn't understand what more Scott could do to make PROMETHEUS really stand out.  And in truth, he really doesn't.  But the one thing he does different from most alien invasion films is that he is given a good plot outline from Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (based on unused elements from the original Dan O'Bannon/Ronald Shusett script for ALIEN), a good cast, and credible production values, the kind that somehow seem to fly out the window in most blockbusterfilms because of the need to concentrate on spectacle.  Therefore, despite some imperfections and a lot of gruesomeness, PROMETHEUS succeeds better than most others of its kind today.
1466401885|5.0|Intense and captivating book.  I read this after Fifty Shades per all the recommendations and I really, really liked this.  I think I liked it better than Fifty.  Definitely couldn't put this one down - got swept up in the story!
B003PPDBQ2|3.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.  The plot was interesting and very well developed.  It was easy to relate to the characters and to sympathize with their experiences and with their responses to the enormous events taking place in their lives.  The book is incredibly easy to read and is utterly compelling.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|As a kid I loved the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories and I wound up loving the original Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes -- Sherlock was tougher, funnier and hilariously played by Robert Downey Junior. Unfortunately this sequel loses the entire point of a Sherlock Holmes story: he's supposed to use his idiosyncratically brilliant deductive powers to solve mind-bending mysteries. In this movie Sherlock is more of an action figure who fights all the time, pursues a sloppy plot of international intrigue blah blah blah, and never solves anything. It's pretty sad: it turns out that a Sherlock without a confounding murder mystery is just an irritating twit with a few mildly colorful sidekicks. In a word: avoid. See the BBC production instead, it's far more Sherlock.

B000HKYA1I|5.0|This movie is hilarious... and very touching.  Definitely not what we expected.  The 1st half is highlighted by the Ukrainian guy hilariously butchering English similar to Borat but PG-13 rated instead of R rated, and the 2nd half is fairly serious and tear inducing similar to Schindler's List.  There are a few off color jokes me and the wife could have done without, but we still loved it.  Loved the soundtrack too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Each time I use this app, I discover something new about it. It's really fantastic. I use it mostly to take notes in church while following the teaching. My favorite things are that I can easily switch back &amp; forth from the Bible to the notes &amp; how easy it is to copy passages onto my notes. Not just reference them, but actually paste WHOLE VERSES onto my notes. This is really a great app.
0553582038|2.0|I felt like I had been conned by the time I was mid-way through this book.  It is a complete time-waster.  Feels like the author had simply lost his way and had to keep the series alive with irrelevant stories about mostly irrelevant characters and plot lines.  I finished it because there may be a few details in it that will be relevant to the books that follow.  If there is a Cliff Notes for this volume, get it.

B007HJ91HU|3.0|I like that the new version was updated.  I was surprised that I would enjoy the movie as much as I did.<br />Both the old and new version are in my opinion \\"B\\" movies and equally fun.<br />What I didn't like was how the dance sequences were filmed, the camera cut around too much and you only caught glimpses of them dancing.<br />You're going to enjoy the movie and kick up your heels to the music!
B00AEFY0F2|1.0|it's a classic case of Sad But True that the art of comedy doesn't get anything close to the respect it deserves. if it did, a shameless bastardization (not to mention just plain STUPID idea) like Forrest Gump would be grounds for burning at the stake!<br />in a nutshell, the character of Forrest Gump is Gomer Pyle in melodrama drag. think about it: he's a &#34;hick&#34; from the rural South, he's not the sharpest quill on the porcupine, he even serves in the Marines! all that's missing is the catchphrases (&#34;shazam!,&#34; &#34;goooooooooolly!,&#34; surprise surprise surprise!&#34;).<br />honestly, you can't help but wonder, how is it possible for established talents like the director of the virtually faultless Back To The Future trilogy and the star of such winners as Big, Dragnet, and Apollo 13 to complete miss the glaring banality of this concept? and what the hell was the Academy smoking when they declared &#34;best picture of the year&#34; what would ultimately prove to be the worst picture of the DECADE?<br />curiously, i don't think i've ever heard anyone cite their own candidate for Worst Film Ever Made based on what i would consider the make-or-break element, namely it's motives and/or degree of respect for the audience's intelligence. they never seem to look beyond production values, and so the title tends to go to the innocuous likes of Plan 9 From Outer Space or Manos: The Hands Of Fate. certainly no one will ever mistake those for the work of Orson Welles or Steven Speilberg, but at the same time they're comparatively innocent films. both are sincerely trying, however unrealistically, to give the viewer a good time.<br />conversely, Gump isn't a particularly badly made film - it's actually quite workmanlike on all technical fronts - but alas, that just makes it even less bearable. that makes it, on top of everything else, proof positive that all the craftsmanship in the world can't make a good movie out of an insipid premise.<br />here's a thought: big screen revivals of vintage tv series were coming into vogue at the time, and they had dedicated themselves to this Gomer Pyle motif...so why not go all the way and do the official big-screen version of Gomer Pyle: USMC? it's hard to say how much better that film would've been, but let's face it: it couldn't POSSIBLY of been any worse. if nothing else, at least it wouldn't of been plagiarism!<br />they have an expression in the Industry concerning the scarcity of a decent script or a particularly insightful premise: you can't polish a turd. Forrest Gump is what happens when you try.tage tv series were coming into vogue at the time, and they had dedicated themselves to this Gomer Pyle motif...so why not go all the way and do the official big-screen version of Gomer Pyle: USMC? it's hard to say how much better that film would've been, but let's face it: it couldn't POSSIBLY of been any worse. if nothing else, at least it wouldn't of been plagiarism! they have an expression in the Industry concerning the scarcity of a decent script or a particularly insightful premise: you can't polish a turd.

0062119044|3.0|I will begin by saying that this honestly is not one of my favorites. I generally go for books that move at a much faster pace than Kevin. The story is told through a series of letters written by Kevin's mother Eva. I found this to be both an exhilirating dive into her subconcious and yet incredibly exhausting. I got rather bored with listening to her drone on and on as I tried to repress thoughts of \\"What is wrong with this woman?! Why does she feel so sorry for herself all the time?!\\" It felt like listening to that friend we all have who only has emotional baggage to discuss. Though to be fair Eva, Kevin's mother, has good reason to be bogged down with baggage. So I surpressed my inner cynic and carried on to the end of the book.<br /><br />That being said I am giving this 3 stars because Ms. Shriver is a without argument a fantastic writer. She tends to go a bit heavy on the details, which honestly had me skimming more than a few pages. There is no doubt that she put a lot of thought and depth into her main characters but I found some of it irrelevant.<br /><br />I also have a very hard time enjoying books in which I find the charcters irritating and pathetic. However that is how they are meant to be written so I certainly cannot fault the author for that, it really just is a matter of my tastes.<br /><br />I read a few reviews after I started reading Kevin. Quite a few people said they saw the twist at the end coming. I actually did not. I had a theory that was quite similar but it certainly did not spoil the ending for me.<br /><br />Most importantly Shriver did get me thinking about how I would have acted in this woman's position. I mean really, what do you do if your child is just born bad?

B00005V7CT|3.0|I really liked this movie.  However, it had some flaws.  What I liked was the English culture, the manners, the style.  The whole gist of the movie seemed to be taking a weekend in time dealing with the interactions of the upstairs/downstairs characters.  My problem with the movie is that there was so much interaction occurring at the same time.  It was interwoven and hard to pay attention to everything at once.  Especially with the English & Scottish accents.  I had to take a star off the rating for this movie simply for the lack of English subtitles.  I cannot understand why they were not included with a movie this heavily accented.  (To my way of speaking.)  I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I could have understood it as it went along.  The accents were very pretty but they left too much puzzlement in their wake.<br /><br />To bottom-line it, I enjoyed the movie but couldn't understand a LOT of the speech.  I would have bought the Blue-Ray version if it had included subtitles.  However, I was fortunate to come across the Netflix version (instant watching) which does have subtitles which can be viewed on some devices, notably [[ASIN:B005VBVQBU Xbox 360 250GB Holiday Value Bundle]] and I understand the new [[ASIN:B005CLPP84 Roku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player]].

B0052VUNHC|1.0|I had trouble finishing this book and was left disappointed.This book sends the wrong message out to young people. Travis was creepy, violent and jealous possessive and I found the HEA hard to believe.
B000002GFT|4.0|Sandy Denny's vocals are dead ringers for Grace Slick's. If you played \\"Wooden Ships\\" next to this, they could be from the same album. Maybe this is a bit overrated. People tend to be fanatical about Richard Thompson, though he never caught on in the U.S., and neither did Fairport Convention. Still, this is nice stuff, among the first Brit groups to celebrate their own trad music. Without this first, there is no Pogues, Flogging Molly, Dropkick Murphies etc...
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a brilliant film adaptation of an excellent book.  The Help realistically protrays the white women of Jackson, Mississippi in the 1960s and the ways they treated their colored help.  Although I had already the book, the film portrayal of discrimination was so shocking at times that I almost felt embarrassed to be watching it, shamed of our country's history.  Yet, the movie offers an optimistic hope about the true goodness of most people and the ways in which wrongs are often eventually righted.<br /><br />The movie is both funny, moving, well-written, and beautifully acted.  This is the best movie I have seen in a long time, and unlike most of my other reviews, this movie does actually deserve an Oscar.

B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I'm totally busted!  I must admit to loving this teenaged drama, even though I am more than a few years older than the target demographic.<br /><br />The series is about four teenaged girls, who used to be best friends:<br /><br />Aria just returned from a year in Iceland, where her parents moved to try to repair their troubled marriage.  Upon her return, she falls for a guy . . . only to discover this same guy is her new English teacher.<br /><br />Hannah used to enjoy the best things in life, but since her parents divorced, her mother has been struggling to pay the bills and Hannah has been resorting to shoplifting to maintain her lifestyle.<br /><br />Emily is great at swimming, but struggling to figure out her love life.<br /><br />Spencer has always been the good girl with great grades, but she is fighting to be noticed by her parents as she lives in the shadow of her older sister.<br /><br />The reason they \\"used\\" to be best friends?  A year ago, the fifth girl in the group, Allison, went missing during the middle of the five-girl slumber party.  And Allison's disappearance tore the girls apart.<br /><br />But when the girls begin receiving messages from a mysterious A, a person who knows things that only Allison knew, the girls must come back together to try to reveal A's identity.

Watch it yourself and see if I'm wrong!
034580404X|3.0|I rated a 3 because it was a fun, easy, and distracting read. That being said, did we really need a descriptive sexual scene every third page!? It became tedious to read because of that. I like a good sexual description as much as the next girl but that was too much for me. These books were basically Sexual manuals/how to have kinky sex guides.

B004HW7JI8|4.0|The mysterious intrigue continues in season 2.<br /><br />Four teenaged friends with diverse interests and talents must work together to solve the identity of the mysterious A, who stalks their lives and sends threatening messages.<br /><br />The plot thickens in this season as more potential suspects come out of the woodwork.  The girls try to navigate everyday pressures such as boyfriends, parents, and homework . . . while trying not to fall into A's deadly traps.<br /><br />Some of the plot points start to get a bit tired in this season and some things are a bit too over the top, but overall it still captures your interest.<br /><br />A is finally unmasked at the end of the season, but season three (which has just started playing on television) promises new mysteries!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|In a very different world, this girl faces one challenge after another, trying to save the people that she loves.  It's filled with surprises, threats, death, love and suspense and in a society that is quite different.  It'll keep you on the edge of your seat.  You can't read one book without reading the other two.  The first is definitely the best and second and third were good, too.  The only disappointment for me was the ending of the third book.  It was good but a little bit lacking.  All in all, an excellent, obsessive trilogy that I'll probably read again.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the trilogy! Couldn't put my Kindle down! The first book was a shocker, but then the story really developed in the second and third book. I can see why it is such a popular series.

B002QW7ALM|4.0|Wow, was I surprised at how good this was. I marked it 4 stars, but this is pushing towards 5. Ignore any bad reviews. If you are a sci-fi or horror fan you will absolutely love this one. The story is great! A complete multi-leveled script with many varying ideas that will leave you guessing. Stuck on a ship in the middle of space with no power and no idea of what their mission is or was. Two flight crew members must piece together just what is happening and how. All while trying to ward off the Pandorum, a brain altering space psychosis. I'll stop there as anything else might ruin this rampant tale of sci-fi action. Other than the story, the action is great! It coincides with the extreme isolation and suspense created by the setting and plot. Other reviewers complained about the story, lighting and fast cut scenes. Any complaints about the story are just ludicrous. Those individuals weren't sci-fi fans because the story is fantastic, period. The lighting is not nearly as bad as reviewed by some. I have seen FAR worse lighting in movies. This lighting was good and was appropriate for the setting. The cut scenes, though, are a little fast at times and can be distracting, but there aren't so many of them that it takes away from the film. So this is a highly entertaining movie that any sci-fi/horror fan will love.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|Oh...My....God..... This was just awful. 158 Minutes of painful acting and completely unlikeable characters. I have to also mention to Mr. Emmerich that he put just a tad too many cliffhangers into the movie. I mean, come on. This one stupid #$$ family avoids how many giant fissures and fireballs that it kind of got a little annoying that he was making these flying leaps across gorges in a limo AND an RV. Come on! Yes, it worked in SPEED, but it only happened once in SPEED. It was every three &#$%ing seconds in this farce. The reactions by the actors/actresses were also just horrible. Around 95% of the earths population was just violently killed and the remaining 5% of the people are cheering for the life of one man who didn't drown. Yay, all my relatives and friends are dead, but this guy didnt drown. COME ON!!!!! WTF!!!! Absolute garbage. They also end the movie, and I mean the last &#$%ing line of the movie, with a memorable quote about bedwetting. Yes bedwetting ends this 158 minute vomit fest. If you are looking for cringe inducing action scenes involving Limos, RVs and airplanes evading every gigantic piece of thundering fireballs and crumbling skyscrapers AND you like to gag while viewing sappy dialogue about stepfathers and world peace. Then by all means rent or buy this barrel of $#1%.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|It is, I believe, the best writing tool for the touch-pad, the others have a soft tip which I don't believe works as well.  It is a bit awkward to use, since it is so big but for the most part does it's job.  Only been using it to take notes from what I was reading, but works well.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I normally never review anything, I see a lot of reviews on here by people who seem to think way too much of their opinions. However I feel so strongly about this album that I had to tell any Rush fan out there that might be unsure about whether or not to buy Clockwork Angels that you shouldn't wait one minute! This is a great album! I've listened to it all the way through several times now and there is not one bad or even just so so song on this entire album. I loved Snakes & Arrows, no complaints about that album at all, but Clockwork Angels beats it. Good story for a concept album, nice artwork inside the cd sleeve. They really let loose on this album, this might very well be their best album ever. I really like how they made a concept album dealing with one story throughout the entire cd & yet each individual song can stand on it's own. If you pick out any one song & listen to it you don't feel like somethings missing. Rush seems to be at their peak right now & are playing probably the best they ever have. I'm not certain about how well this album will appeal to someone unfamiliar with Rush, but definitely a long time Rush fan will love this album without any doubt at all. If you're a fan of progressive rock but don't listen to or know a lot of Rush's music I think you should give it a try, I feel that it will not disappoint anyone who listens to it.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I was (am) a great Garth Brooks fan and have every album he has made (except the compilations) - during the late 80s/90s he changed the way people looked at and listened to country music, and although he now comes in for a lot of verbal abuse for not sticking to the true country sounds of his first (and most of his second album) there is no doubting the impact he made. And he had b...s too. He was the only US artist to come over to the UK to perform when the US troops were engaged in Kuwait at the beginning of the 90s. He was a true gent, stopping to exchange a few words of appreciation when I bumped into him outside the Cambridge Theatre in London as he went in before his show, which proved to be a great morale-booster for the predominantly American audience (especially 'If Tomorrow never comes', still one of the greatest most emotional songs in country music)<br /><br />I don't listen to him so much any more - there have been so many changes in my musical tastes and my collection has grown somewhat over the years that there has not been the time - but a recent CD by a new highly regarded band (Jason Boland and the Stragglers' 'Rancho Alto' if you must know!! -  I heard some similarities in tone, arrangements and song subject)) sent me back to listen to Garth again and I took the opportunity to pick this CD up on the cheap. And I am very glad I did. Much better recorded it seems than some of the earlier albums which to me did not have the clarity of, say. Alan Jackson's albums, and containing nearly everything a new budding Garth fan should wish to hear. That is, some of the very best country music of the last fifty years - yes, I know he supposedly 'sold out', but good music is good music, whatever the genre, and Garth recorded (and wrote) some great songs, marketed himself brilliantly and produced live performances the like of which are now copied by a whole range of 'country stars'. Sadly he was not able to perform his 'trapeze and high wire' acts in the UK buthis performance at the Birmingham Arena in the mid-90s was one of the best, most high energy concerts that I have ever seen.<br /><br />It would be nice if he could return with an album going back to his roots (10-12 beautiful real country songs a la his debut) but it is unlikely to happen - so we are left with his recorded output plus the compilations (Double Hits Live, The Hits and this one, an album (and DVD) of immense enjoyment from beginning to end. Definitely a keeper!
1423140591|5.0|Finally Percy returns!!! Sadly, he cannot remember much of anything.  A girl named Annabeth is the only thing he remembers from his past.  As Percy becomes part of Camp Jupiter he can't help feeling like he's done this all before. He soon befriends two fellow campers, but neither of them are particularly popular.  Frank is clumsy and cannot seem to get passed his probationary status, all the while wondering who his godly parent is.  Hazel, on the other hand, knows only too well who her father is.  She still can't live with herself. Despite the odds the three underdogs go on a quest to save Camp Jupiter.  But it might be all for nothing if the Greeks and Romans cannot come together.  It was so great to read about Percy.  I love his sense of humor.  It was great to know why certain things made Percy happy, even though he couldn't remember them.  This story also makes it entirely obvious how amazing Percy is.  Although this book is tremendously easy to read, I have read about Percy since I was very young so I feel a sense of loyalty to the story.  I recommend not reading this book until someone has read the Percy Jackson books as well as The Lost Hero.  Otherwise things might be confusing.

B007ADIRDM|5.0|I don't know if this is a new facial sculpt or if it's just an excellent paint job, but this might be my favorite of all the Clawdeen Wolf dolls. While this playset will come later this year as a two doll set (Draculaura as an exclusive at a club store) my daughter wanted Clawdeen the most so I picked this up for summer. Really happy with it - the small accessories are well thought out and detailed, the furniture is sturdy and not the super brittle plastic of some Barbie sets. This has the slight give and pleasant texture of Clawdeen's bedroom set. The couch isn't sculpted as one piece, but has a line & space that makes the cushion appear to be removeable. They are not, but that detailing adds to the overall look. The red chair stands well on it's own or with a doll on it. The coffin table legs are a little flimsy, but again the detailing is perfect. My only quibble might be with the bookshelf. I thought it was a hard backed shelving unit with a sticker but it requires slight assembly. The graphic is printed on a medium weight cardboard (double sided so it is attractive from the front or back) attached to the three piece shelf unit by four small cobweb pieces that lock it in place. The top U bar is locked into the bottom shelves and the table for the cash register hooks into the front of those. This is probably most likely to be damaged, aside from the coffin table legs, but still appears pretty sturdy. Great set - I think this is our favorite item. [[ASIN:B0063NPLTS Monster High Cleo de Nile's Vanity Accessory]] is very detailed as well, but the play value is more limited than this coffee house themed set. Any doll makes sense hanging out on this sofa. We had to make a new shelf for my daughter's Monster High wall since all her dolls want to hang out here. If Mattel sold the chairs in different color combinations I'd be sunk - my girls adore this furniture!
B006TZBGBW|5.0|Well I was on the fence about this one simply due to the fact that I have all of these in one form or another (CD, cassette, vinyl), but when the price dropped to $105 for 17 cd's I was sold.  It was also a nice touch to issue \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" with the proper \\"Killing Machine\\" cover, and adding the cover art to the disks themselves.  If you only have a few of these cd's then this is a really good deal and remember that several of these are double albums.  I have been a fan of Priest for 28 years, would of been longer but I did not hear them untill I was 9 and spent the summer with my older cousin.  In my opinion a true fan would not be without this set.<br /><br />Update... I received the set yesterday and got a chance to look it over and read some of the other reviews.  First I do not think it is a cheap set or a waste of money considering what you pay for it.  Is it packaged in a simple mannar, yes it is, but I actually like it that way as it keeps 17 cd's in a small and compact unit.<br /><br />I also noticed that just about every disk has a couple bonus tracks on it (a studio and a live track) and some have more.  Also in comparing it to some of the older disks that I have it seems like the quality is better but that just may be in my mind.<br /><br />Since everyone is bringing up the Ripper years I will put in my two cents on that too.  I for one was never a fan of the ripper stuff (nothing against him personally as I think he can sing great and the proof of that is how many other projects he has had), I just prefer Halford singing.  Would it have been a nice to have all of the ripper disk in there too, maybe, but where do you draw the line...What about Metalogy as it had alot of live and rare tracks in there.  If you go to the official priest site there is a section just for the Ripper years so they are not trying to erase that part of history they are just focusing on the Halford stuff which is what most fans want.  Maybe they should make a Ripper years box set and see how that does.  No \\"Complete\\" collection will ever be complete as there are tracks that are issued on albums in different countries and thru the various re-issues so I always know when I see something say complete it is not really.<br /><br />Would I buy this again now having held it in my hands....YES!
1401300529|5.0|Although it has taken me five years to finally get around to saying something about this brilliant book, (I read the book when it first came out) what I can say here echoes most of the accolades reviewers have given this book. Without question, this is a brilliant book about the Korean War, though it is not a definitive history. There are plenty of other better histories of the war from start to finish, if that is what you are looking for.<br /><br />However, what these histories lack, and where Halberstam excels, is the human side of history; the way he reports about history and the people who are a part of it. It is the kind of writing which propelled him to literary heights with The Best and The Brightest. He had this talent for bringing history alive by the people who made it all happen. We learn much about the first year of this conflict, this so-called \\"forgotten war\\" especially the role that Gen. MacArthur played in the conflict and his less than adequate handling of the war. Although his Inchon Invasion was a master stroke of military planning and execution, he never spent a night in Korea and ignored intelligence reports which could have prevented the debacle at Kunu-ri and Chosin. What I like most about Halberstam's style of writing is how he shows the reader how everything is connected and that this book is just as much about the Korean War as it was one of the first showdowns of the Cold War era with three superpowers: China, the Soviet Union and the United States.<br /><br />This is an important book and one of Halberstam's best.<br /><br />Jeffrey Miller,<br />Author of War Remains

B0079J28NW|5.0|I received the long awaited movie. Words cannot express the amazement of High Definition Blu-ray is today. I am very content with this. Looking at this is almost of a 3-D with out the glasses. The clarity of the picture is amazing. The sound is another super WOW. Lucky for me I do have the system with the HDMI connections, the sound is awesome. The extras just a few more then the DVD. However I do have one minor issue that pertains to the captions, they stop when they sing. Would of been nice to of had them on there. This is more of one that you have to see it to understand how awesome this is. I recommend this to all Beatles fans. I like it very much.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Worth the read. I thought I would actually try to read the book before seeing the movie for once. I'm glad I did. Obviously written for \\"kids\\" but this is no children's story. A bit fantastical but the pages fly by because the read is so easy. Cast of characters is diverse enough and plot and sub-plots are manageable (I hate flipping pages and re-reading because I missed a tone or other subtle hint). The few times I questioned continuity I discovered I was mistaken. If you want an intellectual journey with a huge cast and plots so complicated you need a note pad to keep it straight... this is not your book. But, if you want to be entertained, let your mind slip to a fantastic futuristic land, root for the underdogs, and enjoy a book that absolutely wont let you stop turning pages.... this is definitely it.  My best advice to you is save the dollar and buy the trilogy ...... if you read one, you will read them all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This delivers exactly what you think it will - it's a great page-turner. Writing isn't the best quality, but if that's what you were looking for you wouldn't have searched for the title in the first place, right? Finished very quickly and immediately bought Books 2 and 3... HOORAY.

B005OCHOZS|4.0|I pre-ordered this book before it was released. Then I charged up my kindle and anxiously waited for the release date.<br />I read this book in three evenings. I couldn't put it down. It was great motivation as I am training for my first marathon (I've done 6 half-marathons and have been looking for a new challenge).<br />Who knows, maybe after that I'll try for an ultra.<br /><br />Since I've finished the book, my goal is to go back through the chapters and pick a few recipes to try to see if I can add a few more plant based meals to my regular diet. The connection between food and our bodies really is amazing. I also enjoyed seeing Jurek's personal and family relationships develop and play out over time. I don't think I'll ever go vegan, but if you're looking for a quick easy read, with a little inspiration along the way, you should read Eat & Run.<br /><br />'Eat & Run' is like 'Eat, Pray, Love' for runners!!
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Solid playing, here and there, but overall, somewhat clumsily crafted, produced and perhaps, the absolute worst mixing/mastering job from any professional recording in recent memory.<br /><br />Let's start with the musical review, since like most of us, I can still appreciate and enjoy excellent songwriting and music, even if it's recorded badly.<br /><br />Musically, I can generally sum up the project to one word -- Monotonous -- the formal definition of which is:<br />1. Lacking in variety; tediously unvarying.<br />2. Characterizing sound continuing on one or few note(s).<br />3. Having very little inflection; limited to a narrow pitch range.<br /><br />Indeed, we can hear and enjoy some athletic playing and good runs on this record (it is Rush, after all), but Inventiveness, Cohesiveness and I hate say it, Musicianship, are sorely, and very regrettably, lacking here, relative to their other stellar achievements.  Mostly mediocre-to-weak compositions and production (though \\"Garden\\" and \\"Wreckers\\" are pretty sweet).  The craftwork of song-writing seems to be below par here -- as if it was overly spontaneous and not thought through carefully enough to create the masterpieces that we've all come to expect from them.  And -- WHERE ARE THE MELODIES?!  I would have hoped that, during the 5-year lapse between \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" and this record, they would have had an opportunity to thoughtfully wield more craftsmanship and care, versus patching together pieces of tired jam sections in hotel rooms and the studio.  Perhaps it was all composed too hastily, but I fear that it's worse than that, and perhaps, Geddy's and Alex's reservoir of habitual fingerboard patterns contained in jam session sound-bytes has reached its limit and their formula now needs more professional stretch and discipline.<br /><br />The Worst-of-the-Weak is:  \\"Wish Them Well.\\"  Geddy's egregiously repeating and layered vocal choruses have become increasingly annoying over the years, but the irksome repeating/echoing/reverbing phrase, \\"...Wish them well...\\" is unbearable.  Oh, did I mention the repetition?  Wish them well, wish them well, wish them well...  Ugh.  Geddy has an amazingly talented voice, but sometimes, with all due respect, I wish he would just shut up for a while and let the instrumental sections stand on their own and shine through, without feeling compelled to fill each millisecond of musical space with repeating lyrical phrases and overwrought layers of vocal echo, repeating phrases and overdubs.  What's interesting to me is that with \\"Snakes,\\" I thought Geddy's voice had reached an operatic level of sophistication, confidence, freedom, range and quality, but those honorable achievements have not been sustained in this record.  Moreover, his vocal intonation is really bad here -- singing sharp and flat all over the place.  Either he's finally losing that range or again, perhaps the entire project simply was written and recorded too haphazardly and hastily.<br /><br />Admittedly, Rush raised the bar quite highly for themselves with \\"Snakes and Arrows.\\"  Alas, they have missed the mark with this project.  I find it very difficult to love anything about this record, like I have with ALL of their others -- yes, even \\"Vapor Trails\\" -- though I suspect many fellow fans will merely love, unconditionally, everything this band does, which is OK.  Let's face it:  These guys are intelligent, kind, well-meaning people and outstanding musicians, but simply botched this record.<br /><br />With respect to the co-producer, Nick Rasculinecz, I was very impressed with his work on \\"Snakes\\" -- I thought he unshackled Rush out of their comfort-zone at the time, freeing them to express a more live, improvised, jamming feel, yet with crafty structure and close attention to melody and harmony.  His approach and energy fostered a new trajectory and an environment for the band in which each song was interesting, unique and mostly, beautiful. He also seemed to inspire arenewed freshness, vigor and level of enthusiasm with the band.  But alas, like many of Rush's myriad rehashed/reused riffs and patterns on Clockwork Angels, perhaps Mr. Rasculinecz also tapped his creative well dry during the \\"Snakes\\" project.  After blowing his proverbial wad with \\"Snakes,\\" Mr. Rasculinecz evidently became a non-objective sycophant -- which is the last thing artists should seek from a co-producer.  Rush needed to move on, to be stretched by other creative co-producers and explore new dimensions, both personally and musically.  They deserved better.<br /><br />Now for the audio quality.  What can I write that hasn't already been written so eloquently by so many other diehard fans here?  It sucks -- it just simply sucks:  A WALL of overly compressed, muddy, distorted sound.  I am not exaggerating when I say that my ears actually hurt after listening to 1-2 songs (has anyone else noticed this?).  I've tried listening on four different audio systems:  My audiophile listening setup at home (Wadia, Jeff Rowland, ProAc), my 2011 BMW system, my professional audio recording setup (Sound Devices DACs, iMac, B&W headphones) and the iPhone -- ALL sound horrible.  I wonder how the band could have allowed this to be released with such wretched audio.

B0088RQ4X4|1.0|I managed to struggle through act 1 and then turned it off - sorry, but after all the for-and-against hype from the lovers and haters, I wanted to watch this for myself and hopefully like it.<br /><br />The #1 reason (for me) was that I couldn't get behind any one character... I didn't care about ANY of them. To me it just felt like scene-after-scene of \\"stuff\\" just happening, which leads into the #2 reason for disliking this: it simply felt incomprehensible.<br /><br />Nebulous character goals, unfeasible CGI monsters, epic worlds inhabited by... oh never mind. See? I can't even re-think this thing without wanting to slash my wrists. Ugh!!

B004GJDQT8|5.0|The Barcode reader did not work at first, Now the BAR CODE SCANNER WORKS on android 2.2.2. Thanks for the fix.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I am a voracacious reader of Sci-Fi and Fantasy.  I have read all the old stuff and I read all the new stuff as it comes out.  And while I will give just about any book in the genres a try, my standards are exacting.  I give out my 5 star ratings grudgingly.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I found myself completely engrossed in Ryan's Raven, which I purchased on Kindle for $1.50.  I found the book to be superior to Sanderson's Way of Kings (which I enjoyed), and nearly as intriguing as Rothfuss's new work, albeit in a somewhat more conventional epic fantasy plot structure.  If this sounds like high praise, that's because it is.<br /><br />The only problem with the book is Amazon's $1.50 price, which frankly makes uncomfortable, given how much I liked the book.  This is a far better piece of writing than most books Amazon charges 10x as much for.<br /><br />The only book I can compare this to is Hugh Howey's scifi masterpiece, Wool, which Howey self-published on Amazon at a very low price.  I hope Anthony receives similar attention, as his book is every bit as compelling as Wool.
0446581356|3.0|I bought this book looking to get some more in depth information on make-up application.  I am not a novice but I'm no expert either, I had pretty much stuck to one basic style my entire life.  When reading the reviews I was hoping to get a more in depth view and description of make up application. This book was very informative when it came to tools and products, I learned A LOT about products for different skin types, how to find my skin type, and the different tools and their uses. However, being that Bobbi Brown is known for the \\"natural\\" bronzed look that was pretty much all the book described how to do. I wasn't looking in the \\"costume\\" or \\"bridal\\" styles but I would have liked to have been shown varying ways and styles to apply make up instead of the one look.  Other than that, this was a great book. I would say this book would be great for the person looking to learn more about tools and products and not necessarily the application of the make up itself...unless you are only concerned with the bronzed look.
B005LAIH2W|2.0|I had to take two breaks because I was so tired of the slow moving action. It's difficult to disagree with over 300 viewers, but what can I say?<br /><br />The fx were good.<br />The action was slow.<br />The acting was awful.<br />The script worse than the acting.<br />Lynn Collins was the best of the movie, but they didn't show enough of her and she was too covered up for the role.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|The youth of America are accustomed to quick sound bytes and simple song structures. They don't want to \\"think\\" about their music as they listen to it. I believe this pertains to some of the newer Rush fans who have negatively reviewed this brilliant album. Perhaps their ADD prevents them from focusing on the messages in this concept album. Who knows? My advice is to take the time to sit and listen to the music while reading the lyrics. Read what other fans have interpreted from their own listening experiences. Rush spent the time and effort to evolve as a group and present something that should please most fans. You should give them the same consideration.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Some reviewers (historians mostly) are disappointed with this film's lack of accuracy about the Crusades.  Their knowledge is commendable and their frustration somewhat understandable.  However, this is film, a cinematic epic, not the History Channel.<br /><br />The era of the crusades was, like any other time in history, not monotonous.  Everyone did not believe or think the same way on every point.  Perhaps Scott's Balian and Saladin were not as tolerant or beneficent as he would have us believe, but there were surely people who were.  (As far as real history is concerned, both of these gentlemen fared quite well).  There always are some good people about, and this gives a message of hope for humanity.

B007SYWFRM|2.0|Right now (after the recent update around 6/10/2012), the only word I can think of to describe this app is obnoxious. And even though I spent 3 weeks on it, have spent some real cash on it for in-game currency and have 2/3 of the land, I'm uninstalling this app, as well as spending even more time writing this long review. Unless you want to get addicted (and check in a few times a day) or spend a lot of real cash for in-game currency, stay away from this game.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />Graphics are cute and for the most part nicely done<br /><br />Performance/Stability:<br />I have this running on my kindle fire. Occasionally the app is slugging when it has to draw a lot of animation. mostly when zoomed out and I'm collecting money from many families all at once.<br />The app is stable for the most part but a few times crashed me back to the home, a few times refused to start (either hung or crashed back to home) and I had to reset my kindle fire to get the app to start. Also the screen keeps flickering when viewing the collections pages.<br /><br />Social features:<br />You can sign on to facebook or gameloft to find friends. One of the quests given to you is to raise your reputation, which is to add friends. I have no interest in doing so because that's just another way to get you addicted. In the previous version you can visit a village of another random player, but that works only some of the time. other times it asks me to install an update and restarts the game. but when I try to visit another players village it gives me back the same message.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The basic formula is this, you build up families of various animals, they give you coins, points. Coins are used to buy more families and land and also \\"fun stuff\\" which is just other buildings that give you coins. Points are used to level up and unlock more animals/buildings. There are some animals/buildings that require acorns instead of coins. Acorns is the in-game currency for premium content. Yes, you can play the scrat kufu game to win some acorns and various rewards that give you a few acorns a time, but other than that, you need to pay real cash to get acrons. Of course, if you can't wait for the coins to come you can also pay real cash to buy more.<br /><br />The price for in-game currency tend to be on the high side. To give a little perspective, the rhino, costs 50 acorns each. To complete the rhino family you need 4 rhinos, so 200 acorns. The Dodo bird costs 450 acorns each so it's a whooping 1800 for the family. It costs USD 6.99 to buy 140 or so acorns (price per acorn is lower if you buy more at a time, there's a package that gives you 2000 or so acorns for USD 99) and you can see this adds up very quickly, so make sure you disable in-app purchasing or turn off wifi/internet before letting your little ones play.<br /><br />Of course, you can keep playing this game without spending a single buck on in-game currency, but the price of buildings/land get progressively more expensive (the next piece of land I buy will cost me 700,000 coins) and then you're left with checking in every few hours to collect money from your buildings. Different buildings give you different amount of money every so often. e.g. the mammoth family give you around 4000 coins every 3-4 hours (forgot the exact time), while the sloth family gives you 100 coins every minute or so, but if you only check in daily, you get 100 coins from the sloths instead of 144,000 coins. There are decorations you can build next to a family to boost the income, but the decorations cost coins/acorns too.<br /><br />I can understand this business model of having f2p content and p2p content, a lot of games operate under the same model. But what's annoying is that the families will start to leave if you don't feed them often (you feed them after you collect coins from them, in order for them to keep giving you money), I've had the sloth family leave once but they were cheap so I could get them back easily, but imagine you spent a few days collecting hundreds of thousands of coins getting a bonycap only to have them disappear after you come back from vacation? The feature in itself is annoying and assumes that you'll check in the game every day or two. Oh, and I forgot to mention, to complete a family you need 2 adult animals and 2 baby animals; when you pay for a baby animal you don't get it immediately, you get an egg that hatches in some time in the future, say 6 hours for mid-level creatures. once the egg hatches you have 12 hours to collect the baby. If you don't the baby will run away and either you write off the coins/acorn you spent on the baby, or spend more acorns to look for it.<br /><br />What's even more annoying to this game is its notification feature. I have them all disabled in the settings menu, but that doesn't stop it from generating notifications on my kindle fire (yes, even when you're not playing) saying \\"you have money to collect from your families!\\". No thank you, I'll check in when I please, stop bugging me.ck easily, but imagine you spent a few days collecting hundreds of thousands of coins getting a bonycap only to have them disappear after you come back from vacation?

B005LAIHSG|3.0|Charlize Theron is perfect in this role. She made the movie. The scenery was awesome. The Black Forest was cool and creepy and the Dwarfs were good as well as the creatures and special effects in this movie. I personally won't buy this unless i can get it used for a few bucks. It was a good movie but lacked something in my opinion. It just wasn't the block buster i had hoped for.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|It's interesting how divided McCartney fans and Beatles fans are about this album. Some don't like it because they want a new rock/pop album from Paul. Some don't like it because they hate standards. Some don't like it because they are apparently just noticing that Paul is 70 and doesn't have the voice he had at 20 or 30. So I was skeptical when I bought it and what a pleasant surprise. He sings beautifully -- soothingly, sometimes above his register. He's obviously experimenting vocally like he always does, only it's with his aged voice. And its the age in his voice that gives the material emotional heft. When he sings More I Cannot Wish You, it's as a father to a daughter. When he sings Get Yourself Another Fool, you know exactly who he's directing that too! My favorite is My Valentine (his new song for his new wife) and I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter. I also love Ac-cen-tu-ate the Pos-i-tive, especially the way he puts and \\"r' at the end of \\"Jonahr and the Whale, Noahr and the ark.\\" His own original compositions on the album all sound like old standards and I can give no higher praise.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Three complaints.<br /><br />1.) Boring.  So much unnecessary detail I didn't care about. SO LONG.<br />2.) Misogyny.  Brotherhoods.  Kicking women out of the room.  Diana has no personality & lets Matthew boss her around, lie to her, etc. with only the weakest of protests, if she musters up the personality to have any opinion on his appalling behavior at all.<br />3.) Matthew is a jerk.  I spent a solid two thirds of the book desperately wanting him to screw up and/or die.  Also, I thought this book was about witches; I have no interest in vampires and frankly I found the constant descriptions of his cold fingers/face/skin/whatever to be explicitly un-hot.  If the author wanted us to find him hot I would have recommended less talking about his heart beating once every 4 minutes and more descriptions of his ripped abs.<br /><br />Will not be reading sequels; the author obviously fundamentally disagrees with me about a woman's place in a relationship/a war/the world and is writing a heroine constrained by those views.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Ridley Scott's first three films - The Duellists, Alien, and Blade Runner - established his reputation as one of the most fascinating directors of his time.  His intricate visual style, which he called \\"layering,\\" drew comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's work.  But the comparison was not apt; whereas Kubrick wanted his visuals to serve his highly personal intellectual themes, Scott never strayed too far from his roots as a director of commercials.  Scott always looks for arresting images which will indelibly remain in the viewer's memory long afterwards.  He's not a great storyteller, not a big \\"idea man,\\" and has marked impatience (as anyone who knows the story behind Blade Runner knows) for those who are.<br /><br />Prometheus is a collection of arresting images and scenes which - when considered as a story - don't amount to much.  The writer - a frequent JJ Abrams collaborator who helped turned Star Trek into execrement in 2008 - met his usual qualitative standards here.  Whereas Alien was notorious for one gruesome scene, Prometheus spends its final hour on a flesh-defiling parade of bodily penetrations and mutations.  In his youth, Scott bragged about his sense of restraint in Alien; he claimed that most of the horror in that film was inferred.  The septagenarian Scott could learn a thing from that young man.  Some vestiges of the good visualist remain; the harsh beauty of Iceland's lava fields serves as both primordial Earth and planet LV-whatever.  If Scott settled for an IMAX film about that beauty - or showed some semblence of good taste during the latter stages of the film - it wouldn't have felt as if one of his snake-like uglies slithered in and picked my pocket.  Instead, Scott conducted a symphony of pus and slime in an abatoir.  Perhaps in anticipation of what's to come, the space travelers find themselves retching as soon as they emerge from cryogenic sleep.<br /><br />The themes - such as they are - are displeasing too.  An extra-terrestrial source of humanity has been done before in science fiction - most notably in Kubrick's 2001 - and done better.  It seems that Prometheus' writer was watching an old episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation (\\"The Chase\\") while working on his drafts.  Even the progenitor seen on TV looks suspiciously familar.  Prometheus is somehow sillier than this source material though, evoking memories of Erich Von Daniken's book Chariots of the Gods.  In that popular early seventies work, every exotic feature of an ancient statue or building was seen as evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation.  Though the protagonists of Prometheus are scientists, this film not only feels pseudo-scientific (we've come to expect that in sci-fi cinema), it actually feels anti-scientific.  It's not that Scott can't be bothered to get things right, it's that he would rather be wrong.  In a nod to changing audience demographics, Scott makes his heroine a Christian-scientist too.  It makes one think of Charlton Heston's rebuke of his antagonist in 1968's \\"Planet of the Apes\\" in which he sees a fundamental contradiction between his opponent's joint-role as both Minister of Science and Defender of the Faith.<br /><br />There's also a clumsy misstep here; it's always a mistake for a bad film to refer to a good one.  Scenes from \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" are played here, including some choice lines.  It starkly reminds viewers of how far cinema has sunk since those glorious days, as well as how their time could be better employed.<br /><br />But Scott is right about one thing; his images are indelible.  I sympathize with victims in the Aliens films, always pleading: \\"Get it out, get it out!\\" and ultimately: \\"Kill me!\\"humanity has been done before in science fiction - most notably in Kubrick's 2001 - and done better.

0307591549|3.0|From my blog:<br /><br /> Title: The Happiness Advantage<br />Author: Shawn Achor<br />Pages: 210 hardcover<br />Summary: The idea of this book is that a lot of psychology research over the past few decades has shown that people are much more productive, creative and ultimately successful in all aspects of life if they are happy. This covers happiness in terms of deep satisfaction with the direction of your life and shallower happiness of feeling appreciated and cared about by the people around you, etc. The book presents the evidence throughout with actual studies that have shown these results and talks about studies that have shown how people can increase their happiness in their life with deliberate steps, such as purposefully noticing the nice things that happen during the day and purposefully giving other people compliments. It tends towards advice to managers about how to increase their employees productivity, but as someone who isn't a manager currently, it was still helpful.<br /><br />I'm generally a happy person and have found evidence in my own life that I am much more productive when I maintain that happiness, but it was nice to get reassurance that I'm not crazy and advice that I will keep in the back of my mind for when times are tough (ie in grad school) of how to continue to maintain a happier mindset.<br /><br />This book is definitely pop science and some of his explanations of scientific studies gave this science major the heeby jeebies, but for the most part it looks like good science and good advice for people who really want to reach that upper crust of performance in their lives but don't know what they are doing wrong.<br /><br />More reviews at [...]

0316067598|4.0|Initially I thought the author spent too much time explaining the training necessary to become a Navy Seal.  However, once I read his actual battle experience, it helped me to better understand how and why he and his team mates were able to endure that which they did and to perform with such bravery.  My hat off to the author and, of course, my gratitude, however inadequate,  for the supreme sacrifices they made.  It is, in my opinion, a very good read.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I failed to read customer reviews before purchasing this item. the author has no sense of artistry and the characters are childishly sketched.  there are novels that resonnate with nebulous and deep regions of our psyche, and there are books that feed us cheap candy -- may as well watch tv.  this is a fantasy for chicks w/ no sex life and too many cats...and I'm a female saying this --  i'm embarrassed to own it.  Within 5 pages I am reminded of something Fran Lebowitz said, roughly to the affect of, if you want to write a book and you CAN -- DON'T.  Everyone wants to write, but almost no one truly masters the craft.

B001PBEJL4|1.0|I had been waiting for the bluray release of this beautifully visualized interpretation of the classic stage musical from the first moment I began collecting a bluray library. I was very disappointed with the inflated pricing of this cardboard picture book packaging. Wait another month and get the same bluray disc for a fraction of the cost. This \\"collectable\\" release does nothing but take up twice the shelf space of a standard bluray case. Trust me. If you love a stylized romantic fairy tale, you will watch this fantasy again and again, but once you've realized the insignificance of the pointless book sleeve, you won't give it's content a second thought. Save your money and live the dream!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|[No Spoilers] I've been reading Sci-Fi Novels for 25+ years. I've experienced the works of most of the well-known Sci-Fi Masters -- both old (50s) and new (90s, and onward). Everything about this series of books was a work of genius. First, the story. It had all the elements of great story telling. Surprises, twists, characters you'd care about, adventure, and so on. Second, fictional structure. Every \\"book\\" starts the story (or continues the story, where it left off), in a slightly different way. The author used structural variety in fun and creative ways. Third, subject matter. The messages. There are plenty. The story makes you think - about people who lead, justive, law, society, future, war, etc. I haven't enjoyed a book so much in a long time. Thanks Hugh, for your wonderful stories....

B003P2WO5E|5.0|Ok, I'm reading fantasy books for over 20 years now and till Stormlight I never wanted to read sequel as much as I want the one from Stormlight Archive. The first book is really something special that simply leave you hungry for more! Anyone that enjoys epic fantasy should get this masterpiece as soon as possible!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know another review is not needed for this piece of drivel but wanted to add my one star to the mix so that hopefully some folks will save their dollars.  I am admittedly an old lady who remembers the earth shattering days when court battles were fought to allow wonderful old Grove Press to publish such erotic classics as Lady Chatterley's Lover by DH Lawrence and Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer.  These examples of excellent porn hold up even today because their writers were geniuses who knew how to weave a story that focused on sex and relationship and featured flesh and blood, complicated human beings.<br />I bought and read \\"50 Shades\\" just to see what all the hype was about and like many other writers here, was appalled by the poor writing, lack of background research and generally juvenile characterizations.  I do not know these people nor do I want to know these people-I will put the $20 required to buy part 2 and 3 of the trilogy toward the purchase of trashy supernatural romance novels, any of which will surpass \\"50 Shades\\" in plot, character and erotica.
B000LXH11C|3.0|With these type albums your relying on the taste of someone else.<br /><br />I think it would be better to buy the complete albums.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This was so amazing.<br /><br />I've been reading a lot of paranormal YA at the moment so I thought i would take a break and read some contemporary. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Slammed is one of my favourite books of 2012 already, and I can tell that's not going to change. Where to begin?<br /><br />The story<br /><br />The plot in Slammed is fresh and unique, and I have to say nothing like how I expected it to be. I started out reading, expecting to be in for another generic YA experience, but boy, was I wrong. This book had such an unexpected twist; I was shocked when I came to that part of the story, and GUTTED! Without giving anything away, Lake (best character name ever) moves to Michigan with her mom and little brother after her father's death, hating the idea and hating having to leave the family home in Texas where she'd grown up. Within a couple of days, however, she finds herself warming to her new home town when she meets Will. There's an immediate connection between them. The tension between Lake and Will is utterly believable and I found my stomach butterflying with excitement whenever there was interaction between the two of them. Even after the event that means Lake and Will can't be together, the scenes with the two of them are filled with longing and tension, and I spent far too long gripping onto my kindle a little too tightly, hoping that they would cave and get together.<br /><br />The secondary twist later on in the book was also unexpected.  By this point I'm willing to admit I'd already shed a few tears, but this was game over. It takes a lot for me to get that emotional over a book, and Slammed had me sobbing like a baby (sshhhh... don't tell anyone!)<br /><br />Tied in throughout the book were lyrical references from my all time favourite band, The Avett Brothers, which were used in beautiful ways. This only made me love the book even more because it was done with taste and the references were relevant to what was happening in the book.<br/><br />The characters<br /><br />Lake is a smart girl who's very independent. It's great that she has half a brain cell, unlike female protags in a lot of YA these days. I loved her passion for her family, and eventually for Will and his albeit small family, too. Will is caring and feels very real to me- he's not perfect. He makes mistakes. They both do, which is refreshing. I found myself really loving both their little brothers, which was amazing because most younger siblings in novels like this are cast as nuisances that are only there to carry plot from one point to another. In Slammed, they were a huge part of the story, and you really fall in love with them. In fact, i defy you not to fall in love with all the characters.<br /><br />The writing<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's approach to YA was great because it was different. She didn't get bogged down in how attractive Will was, which some books are prone to do. She concentrated more on Lake's feelings for him instead of how he looked, which was great! The pace to the book was also good. It flowed nicely, and I've read that some other reviewers thought the middle section dragged, but I didn't experience that at all. I felt the tension build up was pitched perfectly, and everything came together at exactly the right time for me. That didn't mean I wasn't slipping off the edge of my seat, begging for Will and Lake to get together already, because I was!!<br /><br />The poetry<br /><br />I gave the poetry a separate section, because it deserves it! I'd heard of slam poetry before but I'd never really seen/read much. From the first moment in the book when Will performs, i immediately had to know more.  Slam poetry is as much about the performance of it as it is about the words, and some might think it would be hard to convey the feeling behind performance poetry by simply writing it. I guess for some people it might have been difficult, but Colleen Hoover really nailed it. Her words and inflection come through perfectly and pack a real punch. It totally inspired me to write my own slam poetry piece and I had a blast doing it.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone! It deserves every one of the five stars that I and so many other people have given it.<br /><br />Seriously, get this book!
0553328255|5.0|I read a few of the stories, and then bought this because I prefer having a physical book to a digital copy. The stories were awesome. I read them all. I'd definitely recommend this volume to anyone interested in detection, forensics, or Sherlock Holmes in general.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love the album, but I must say the play list is a bit strange.  It lists the album name as \\"Eyes Open\\" Snow Patrol.  The list of tracks are certainly not what is on the CD.  Weird.
1400052181|4.0|This is an incredibly well-researched book and both educational and interesting. It took years to research and write, that's obvious. It's important to set expectations though before you start it - some parts become tedious with so much and such detailed information.  Several book club friends agreed, it is definitely worth reading; just be prepared to skim through some parts without feeling guilty. What makes it so worthwhile to stick with is - it's simply amazing both what doctors did to make people human lab rats without controls, and also what one person's cells could do across the entire world to impact medicine in so many ways. Pretty amazing.
B007R9MFPU|5.0|Ultravox is back with a bang. I was excited but skeptical when i heard the band was working on a new Album. I knew it would be better than U-Vox given that the guys admitted that their heart wasn't into it while recording U-Vox, but i didn't expect this new release to be as good as the 4 outstanding Albums \\"Vienna\\" , \\"Rage in eden\\" , \\"Quartet\\" and \\"Lament\\". I'm here to tell everyone that to my surprise it's actually better than all Albums with the exception of maybe \\"Quarter\\". I know that Ultravox fans are almost equally divided as far as their favorite release.I think \\"Rage in eden\\" is a top with 28% .<br />I rank all 4 in my top 100 albums of all time with \\"Quartet\\" ranking second to \\"The Hurting\\" release by Tears for Fears. Just to bring some musical perspective about this review.I'm not going to use big adjectives to try and sound sophisticated.I'm just a big music fan.I have over 3000 cds. more than a third  is from the 80's new wave and modern rock era. artists like,Omd,Tears for Fears,Ultravox, Icehouse, Human League,Blancmange,Heaven 17, The Cure, echo and the Bunnymen, Thompson Twins, Roxy Music,The Fixx,Talk Talk,etc. I also listen and like current acts like Muse, Travis,Coldplay,The Killers,Radiohead,Coldplay,Keane,and lighter stuff like heather Nova and kelly Clarkson. This is the bottom line about this new Ultravox cd appropriately titled \\"Brilliant\\". the Album clocks in at 53 minutes with 12 songs.It's about 3 songs and 12 minutes more than the average Ultravox Album. There are 6 standouts,5 solid Album tracks, and one song that i would consider a skip or a weak song. Here is a quick overview of the Album.The production is  top notch. Midge Ure vocals and Guitars never sounded better. It sounds like vintage Ultravox taking advantage of new recording techniques to sound even crispier.<br />Track  Score  Quick description<br />1. Live  10-  Album opens with \\"Hymn\\" like Anthem coming very close to the masterpiece.<br />2. Flow  9+  Slight drop of in paceand quality but awesome solo guitar sending chills to my legs<br />  pushes this song to a standout level.bass and drums sound a bit like Depeche Mode with<br />  with some U2 like guitars.<br />3. Brilliant 9.5  Solid first single.Although \\"Live\\" is slightly stronger as a potential hit prospect.<br />4. Change  9.5  One of my favorite songs on the Album borrows sounds from \\"Model\\" and \\"Fade to Grey\\"<br />  to create a completely different and original melody.<br />5.Rise  8.5  Solid Album track. here the quality drops with 4 of the next five songs ranging from<br />  good to very good.With the exception of song 9 titled \\"Fall\\" which is a skip.<br />6.Remembering 7  Pleasant song with several interesting musical ideas.<br />7.Hello  7.5  The longest song of the Album. Almost 6 minutes. Catchy but not good enough to be a<br />  a single. solid enough if squeezed between 2 standouts.<br />8.This One  7.5  Like remembering, another quiet song with several interesting musical ideas.Not at the<br />  of \\"Visions in blue\\" but slightly better than \\"remembering\\" and significantly superior<br />  the track that follows.<br />9.Fall  5  By far the weakest song on the album.In fact the only boring song that i would call a<br />  a skip.Considering the cd has 12 songs, I'm looking at 2 songs as bonus tracks as far<br />  judging the album in it's entirety.<br />10.Lie  10  Let it lie is my favorite song on the Album.I call it a masterpiece. perfect song on<br />  level of \\"reap the wild wind\\" the best song i heard since \\"Street spirit\\"by<br />  radiohead.<br />11.Satellite 9.5  Another standout. potential single as well.One of the catchiest songs on the album.<br />  great chorus.Nice solo violin.(Especially the second half.First half seem to stall)<br />12.Contact  8  Album closes with another gentle and quiet song.<br /><br />In summary there is a reason why most fans rave about the album.Don't pay attention to the hand full of negative reviews.It must be bitter John Foxx fans.Even my 15 year old daughter loves the album. She is a big fan of the 80's. She discovered the 80's on her own.i didn't even have to push.This album has 6 songs that i would call standouts plus 5 solid album tracks which as a fan and benefit of technology i like the extra tracks.One can always eliminate a song or two for his or her continues listening pleasure.I do wish that there was an actual Album (Record) release as well.In that case i believe there would have been 2 less songs, since the songs average over 4 and a half minutes each. I do admit the album would flow (No pond intended) better without the song \\"Fall\\" and another slow song. but as far as grading this Album, it's 5 stars without a doubt. \\"The Hurting\\" by Tears for Fears is my favorite album of all time has 2 skips. Any album with 4 or 5 standouts is a 5 star as far as i'm concerned, (Unless the rest of the Album is awful of course).

B005EGXTEE|5.0|I hope to one day be an avid reader.  At the moment, unless a book gets my attention in the first chapter I can not continue reading it.<br />I found this book to be at times riveting.  A fantacy tale, but very enjoyable.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I have been an avid reader of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle since I was a little kid.<br />I loved the books and found myself searching old Books stores for old copies of these classic works.<br />The stories of Sherlock always amazed and astounded me with his autistic nature.<br />But one day I came across the final book or the death of Sherlock Holmes.<br />I was devastated.<br />When you see that Irene Adler is killed I almost lost hope in this film.  The movie industry too often takes the best characters or enemies who were in multiple stories and kill them off too quickly.  Irene who was his equal, his secret love, and Sherlock's dance on the dark side dies...<br /><br />then when the film gets you back in we pan to a large Waterfall and I knew EXACTLY where this was going.  It was the Death of Sherlock Holmes.  I again wanted to destroy this movie.  I was so sick of this film... but I must say that it did redeem itself with the story line that comes after the funeral.<br /><br />This film did what great film should do; it engaged, it enthralled, and it caused me to feel up and then be dashed, only to bring me back and dash my spirits again and finally leave me with a teasing '?'.<br /><br />This film is excellent and another great adaptation that would make Sir Arthur Conan Doyle giddy like a school girl to watch!

B000F4LPJ6|3.0|My wife and I are usually huge fans of Japanese films, especially Japanese horror/suspense/action films. This film came with stellar reviews, not only online but from a couple friends. We were quite excited, because we thought we had found a new treasure to put on the shelf with our collection. We found this NOT to be the case. We have promised a couple friends who were fans of the film, that we would give in another go (and after paying $30 for the DVD you almost have to) but I don't think it will change our minds much. (I will submit another review if by some miracle watching it again changes our minds.<br /><br /> Mr. Sparx
B003ASLJQS|5.0|Great movie, Great acting ( especially Sean Penn ) Great screenplay, great direction, Great cinematography, Great cast. This truly is a fine movie worthy of multiple viewings. A movie that belongs in anyone's library who like the genre.<br />Scott M
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I truly enjoyed the book - was interesting and very different from what I am used to reading.  Once I started the book I could not put it down.  The next 2 books are equally as good
0439023521|4.0|I typically don't read YA books but the movie has caused quite a stir for this novel among young readers and adults and that piqued my interest.  The premise is excellent - a revised North America, post-quelled rebellion, in which the ruling class keep the masses in place by forcing an annual to-the-death competition pitting 12 girls and 12 boys against each other.  It's a solid story and exciting at times but as an adult reader I was hoping for a bit more depth to the characters. I also expected more of a battle between good and evil (in this case the government vs. the beaten down masses) but perhaps that will follow as this is just book 1 of a trilogy.<br /><br />For me at times the story line seemed to emulate a violent video game more than anything else.  And, yes, I know it's a YA book so I make this comment merely to alert other adult readers who are certain to read it as well.  It IS a good story, I do recommend it to other adults and I will read book 2.  A note to parents of teen readers: there is a good amount of violence and death so it may be more intense than many of the stories your children typically read.<br /><br />A final comment: for those readers who really enjoy PA books and want a novel that I found to be much more riveting, I highly recommend The Stand by Stephen King.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a lot like Mario in a lot of great ways. It's a lot of fun and a great way to pass the time. It's great especially since it's free.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app and use it often. It helps me organize my personal life and my business life. Anyone who doesn't have a photographic memory in every aspect of their lives should definitely use this app!
B007H9B8FS|5.0|This was for me the most anticipated album in the last 7 years. I have been huge fan of the band for a long time and have seen them perform live quite a few times. Since the band took the break in 2005 this is the moment I have been waiting for. By now album has been out for 4 weeks and I totally clicked in with every song ...<br /><br />This is Classic Garbage - it's unmistaken sound. At first, it was really too-much to take in. After many, many, many listens I completely got into the album. It's great to hear Shirley's voice again. \\"Big Bright World\\", \\"Control\\" and \\"Beloved Freak\\" are the tracks that stand out for me. All three songs are very different from each other but are special in their own way. Shirley's vocals on \\"Big Bright World\\" are intoxicating - they give me shivers every time I hear the song. \\"Control\\" is very powerful - it's almost a solution to conflicted situation. Sample of Klaus Nomi on \\"Beloved Freak\\" works so well on so many levels. \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\", \\"Blood For Poppies\\" and \\"Battle In Me\\" are very up-beat, positive sounding and they stick out in their own way. They have that pop-appeal, instant-listen friendly sound and could easily be played on the radio. \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" is very different from anything else Garbage has done before - I think it's very special song. \\"I Hate Love\\" seems like Shirley's theme - another great song. \\"Felt\\" is very nostalgic and innocent. It's supposedly inspired by beginning of the recording music for Shirley. It's a cool story to share with fans. \\"Man On A Wire\\" is another great song. It sounds to me like song that should have been on first album. It's a homage to Philippe Petit, a man who walked the wire between twin towers in NYC in 1974. There is a documentary out there about that man that came out about 4 years ago with same title.<br /><br />The same week the album came out, I saw the band perform in Toronto and it was incredible experience. They only performed four songs from this album.But hearing new songs live got me into this album completely. I play it all the time and I am really enjoying this classic Garbage sound that sounds so fresh and new at the same time. I know that all Garbage fans got what they were waiting for. They are the band that always delivered something special on their albums and this one is no different. Some things are definitely worth waiting for.
B000ID1J0E|1.0|This movie is horrible, don't waste your time or money. I turned it off at 20 minutes. I like Johnny Depp, but his character in this movie is very irritating. I couldn't stand the monotone voice overs and the constant paranoia; it wasn't funny at all. What do people see in this movie?<br /><br />I read some reviews comparing it to Fight club or American Beauty. NO WAY!  Those movies were stimulating and entertaining. Fear and Loathing is a dud.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Amazing and accurate. tells me exactly how much battery I have left to do anything! This is a must have app for any device.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|This was the best movie I have seen since maybe the first Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br />  I read the Burroughs books many years ago and was thrilled to see Barsoom come alive.  The acting and visual cinematography are brilliant.  Amazing that a movie with so many new unknown actors was done so well.  Casting was brilliant and daring.  With no big box office names they made a fantastic cinema event.<br />  The DVD is brilliant with great sound and fantastic color.  I first saw it in 3D at a theater and could not wait to get the DVD.  It is just as good on TV.<br />  The special effects are the best ever.<br />  The DVD also includes a ten minute or so bonus feature on Edgar Rice Burroughs, which is very informative and I wish even longer.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Reading this book is like sitting around talking with a good friend and laughing your butt off the whole time.  Her thoughts meander in a world of total random hilariousness.  Just my style.  Thank you Ellen, keep them coming.
B0028R3NCU|1.0|We bought half a dozen of these with 4GB to 16GB chips to give as gifts, and recently found many of them do not work in all devices. Chips work fine in other readers including some \\"cheap\\" 99 cent shipped from China. Kingston claims some USB ports have insufficient power, but then why do the other readers work fine? Disappointing and embarrassing to have given what we thought were premium devices, and find they are faulty.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Of all the superpowers displayed in this film, let's not forget that the greatest superhero isn't even on-screen (though his powers are on display throughout).  I refer, of course, to scriptwriter and director Josh Whedon!  Any Buffy fan will not be surprised at the Black Widow (essentially, she's Buffy \\"all grown up\\").  Nor will we be surprised that Whedon elevates a comic book tale to (if not exactly great literature) far more than its origins.  Most of all, anyone who believes a summer action film can be fun without being mindless, and can have a \\"soul\\" as well, will rejoice in Whedon's achievement.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the least articulate member of the Avengers (the Hulk) is given the single best line.<br /><br />Pure Whedon!
B0086700CM|5.0|its a fun game play it all the time its a game that your brain has to react to quick I like that kind of game

B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Holy Bible app is the best! I rarely take (have!) time to sit and read the Bible, so having someone else 'read' it to me is a wonderful treat!  This app is highly recommended, and it is now my number one &quot;easy listening&quot; preference!
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Easy to use, easy to set up. I can watch and listen and talk to my baby from anywhere, including work. We have a multitude of Apple devices, so the monitor works with every single one of them via an app. One drawback is that they limit the data transmitted over 3G, so that you'll only be able to see your baby for 5-10 minutes at a time before it stops you. However, if you have Wifi, then you're unlimited. The picture is clear and the sound is as well. Expensive, but alas, worth the cost due to easy setup and easy use.  Recommended.

B004GYNPL2|5.0|I'll start by saying that this app just works! I have hundreds of web logins and other data that I need at my fingertips but in a secure app - and mSecure does the trick!<br /><br />I've used Splash ID for about 3 years... first on my old Palm Pre, then on my HTC EVO 4G (Android) in frustration becuase they were both very buggy/unstable, crashing litterally about half the time I used it. 2 weeks ago the Android app on my HTC EVO 4G just flipped out and would only crash upon launch, thus useless. (At least the Windows version was stable).<br /><br />So with a little searching I found mSecure. The transition from one app to another is usually a major pain, BUT this was painless! I was quickly and easily able to import the Splash ID data into mSecure (using the Windows software) AND the ability to sync via Wi-Fi and back-up to DropBox are awesome features. So my frustration is over and I now wonder why I waited so long.
0553582038|5.0|Like a few others who have read this book, judging from the reviews on this site, I was expecting a major letdown. Now that I've finished it, I think I am at a loss for words. Never seen a bigger group of people who have completely missed the boat on something. This book was excellent! What is everyone thinking?<br /><br />Really? Are people just impatient with the author? Were they upset about the absence of certain characters? Did they just not devote the attention to the story that they should have?  It's been a long time since I felt the need to defend a work of fiction but I'll try.<br /><br />1) I know people just want Mr. Martin to finish the story. I agree. I want to know how this is going to end. But forcing the author to finish this on anything but his own time will make for an inferior product in the end. If he keeps me engrossed like he has, George R.R. Martin can take all the time he wants.  I hear people complain about his writing style. Specifically how he seems to get lost in description here.  This is nothing new. Anyway, he is creating a world, if you let his descriptions take hold, you can find yourself getting lost in them too.  The 1st 3 books are full of this same thing. Why complain about it now?  In truth, this may have been the easiest and quickest read of all the books thus far (I have not read ADWD yet). Yes, this doesn't beat A Storm Of Swords, but if you can accept that and judge this book on it's own merit, there is still a lot to savor.<br /><br />2) The absence of a few characters are dully noted. That being said, their presence is still felt throughout the story in the hearts of certain characters who miss them, in the paranoia of the characters who fear them, and in the anger of the characters their actions have affected.  And while characters are absent, the ones front and center in the story manage to keep us enthralled. The changes in Jaime and Cersei, the eagerness of Brienne to complete her task against all odds, deep changes in Arya and Sansa both, the Greyjoys stepping up their game even further, and how the after affects of things that went down in book 3 set off chain reactions throughout the kingdom, all make for plenty to get into and enjoy.<br /><br />These books do require your undivided attention so I would not take reading them lightly. There is payoff, but you have to go through a lot of rough things 1st. You should know by now, even from the 1st book, that Martin's vision is pretty dark and cruel at times, so if actions from previous books upset you, you'll probably get upset again. If you can handle that, then more power to you. If you can't, why are you still reading?<br /><br />I don't know if any will find this review helpful. I do hope it gives people incentive, who haven't made it to this book yet, to keep going and enjoy regardless of what has been written before.  If you have read it and dismissed it, maybe you should give it another chance without the constraints of having to wait for it.
0062011847|5.0|As Pratchett himself suggests any copper going on holiday will almost immediately be tripping over corpses. For city boy Sam Vimes, a holiday in the country is an unspeakably awful thing to have to endure. There are strange and unfathomable traditions that he must try to uphold upon pain of well Lady Sybil. When Vimes is framed by persons unknown his bloodhound nose kicks into action and hell hath no fury like a Commander messed with.<br /><br />Pratchett does his usual effortless job of bringing to life his characters and weaving a wonderful plot full of humour and humanity. Vimes tackles serious issues like bigotry and injustice. Pratchett's fantasy tale resonates with the troubles we face in the real world around us and amongst the chuckles he never lets us forget it for a moment.<br /><br />A beautifully told tale full of compassion, realism and the brutality of those that believe themselves above the law. Quite simply Terry Pratchett at his very best.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|This is simply a classic of the genre. It ranks with Starship Troopers and The Forever War. I enjoy books that make me see things in a new perspective, that is one reason I read Sci-Fi. This book is a stand out in the field and one of those that makes you think. I warn you however once you get started on the trilogy you won't stop until you are done. Books like this are hard to find and it is finding them that keeps me reading. I read Mr. Scalzi's introduction to the new release of The Forever War. I cannot believe I had not run across it until now. I cannot recommend this book enough. If you like it I would also suggest looking up Armor by John Steakley [[ASIN:0886773687 Armor]].
B000VD5I94|5.0|An incredibly violent film. Gruesome scenes of group murder, toxic waste deformity, and a callous view toward the value of human life in general. Yet also very funny, in its dark way. The scene of the cybernetic protagonist visiting his former home -- which his wife abandoned after he was formally pronounced dead -- is haunting, even chilling. A no-weapons-barred attack on 1980's corporate greed.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I loved this book so much I read it twice and bought copies for friends and family.  This book got me back into running after sufffering a knee injury while training for a marathon.  It also introduced me to barefoot running.<br />It is an entertaining read even for the non- runners.

B007RRFUHM|5.0|I had already researched Kimbra long before buying this album so I knew this was going to be a fairly safe bet. For those of you who already know some of her works though, be careful because there are multiple versions of this album, and some of them have songs that others don't!<br /><br />Here is a list of all the songs on this version:<br />Settle Down<br />Something In The Way You Are<br />Cameo Lover<br />Two Way Street<br />Old Flame<br />Good Intent<br />Plain Gold Ring (Live at Sing Sing)<br />Come Into My Head<br />Sally I Can See You<br />Posse<br />Home<br />The Build Up<br />Warrior ft. A-Trak and Mark Foster<br /><br />Some of these songs I had never heard before, so that was a very nice surprise to counteract that some of my favorite songs were not on the album. I would DEFINITELY recommend this to my friends.
B007RRFUHM|5.0|I never review my purchases and I'm a very frequent online shopper, but I just had to say something about this album. It's fantastic. Listen to \\"Come Into My Head\\" with headphones on and at the beginning, with the way they have the sound balanced, it's as though the music is actually passing straight through your head from one ear to the other! I listened to Settle Down after hearing her voice in Somebody That I Used To Know, and I assure you that the rest of this album is just as good. You won't regret it.

B004LP3AYI|4.0|The saga continues in book 2.  Not, perhaps, as gripping as the first book, but very well worth the read.  Again, Goodkind combines some solid life lessons with a great fantasy story set in a world of his own creation.<br /><br />This entire series is not something you should miss.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've always loved this game and I would play it on my friends' iPods and iPhones but I just now noticed they have it for kindle o.o lol
0762445262|4.0|Yes as was stated by another reviewer, this is a small 2 inch plastic Bat-Signal, but unlike said reviewer, I knew that when I bought it as it gives the dimensions. This cool Bat-Signal works great and can actually project on walls when lights are dim. I bought this to use with my Heroclix games and the scale is perfect for that. The book is pretty much useless (as is the case with most of these items, but really you're buying it for the Bat signal anyhow, not the book). I would have given it 5 stars, but took off one for the book.

B007SRX6XQ|5.0|Having read and loved Colm Toibin's THE MASTER, (if you're enamored of Henry James, you should sample it) I was delighted when our library fiction book group selected this book about an Irish immigrant moving to Brooklyn.  Toibin is a first-rate writer.  In this book he sets up an interesting dilemma.  What if you were an immigrant and after coming to America, you returned for a visit to your home town to find a charmed life awaiting.  All the stars were aligned for you.  You are now polished, educated, sophisticated and wanted by your townspeople, even the dashing local suitor.<br /><br />But, in the meantime, you realize you have changed.  America, with its sprawling splendor and opportunity for growth beckons you. Your hometown seems a tad provincial after America and there is an American suitor waiting for you there. But it's home and comfortable!  And it's still a struggle back in America, to fit in and to prosper.<br /><br />Which would you choose?  And why?<br /><br />This may have been a dilemma that many immigrants faced in the 1950's and even today.  The riches and promise of America vs. the allure of home, the familiar, the quaintness and security of your own culture and country.<br /><br />What I loved about this book, is that the author represented America and its acceptance of and help for immigrants as overwhelmingly positive. We read about what is corrupt and tawdry about our country, this book reminds us of what is positive. I kept waiting for the heroine to be exploited or the priest to be corrupt, as seems to occur in so many modern novels. We're continually reminded of the sordid nature of our culture.  So, it was refreshing to be reminded of what is good and decent about America and its treatment of many immigrants. This is a genuinely upbeat book which is a welcome change for book groups.<br /><br />The author set up an interesting dilemma that would be enjoyable for book groups to discuss.  Which fate would you choose?  And did the heroine make the best choice for her?<br /><br />Our book group relished this book and the insight it offered into the 1950's immigrant experience.e the best choice for her?<br /><br />Our book group relished this book and the insight it offered into the 1950's immigrant experience.
0547569653|4.0|As a running enthusiast and purveyor of healthy food, this book was right up my alley, even though I did not know much about his running career before-hand. The book flows very well and the play-by-play accounts of major races speed by. It is chock full of tales of idiosyncratic running pioneers and offers an inside view of the elite running world. The book describes in very personal terms his rough upbringing, unlikely turn to an ultra-running career, and subsequent self-doubt and analysis of life. Before even reading the book I wondered what the point was of running an 'Ultra' and it still seems like an obvious bad idea for 99.99% of people. However, Scott's book is a motivating tale that challenges the reader to push the boundaries of their own life, challenge themselves everyday, and leave little impact on the Earth. I wish him the best and hope he has found the peace he was searching for throughout the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a cool app that is a fast paced game that puts you in the place of the escaping hero

0345803493|4.0|I read Fifty Shades of Grey in a day and I agree the writing and at times the grammar is awful. But I loved Ana's inner goddess. I laughed aloud almost each time she speaks.<br />The character of Ana appears to be stolen from Stephanie Meyers..Bella (klutz who needs protecting and Edward tells her he is dangerous..Christian, a stalker. just like Edward except that I liked him more.<br /> Ana develops a backbone like Bella...the sex, I have read better in Harold Robbins, when I was growing up. but all in all it's cute, and something to do on a rainy day.
B007URCTOG|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE, WITHOUT A DOUBT, IT WILL CERTAINLY TUG ON YOUR HEARTSTRINGS. A GREAT LOVE ENDURES ALL THINGS, JUST WISH THE MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN A LIL LONGER TO ELABORATE ON THEIR LIVES NOW, SINCE IT WAS A TRUE STORY.
0385341008|5.0|Stumbled across this book by an amazon recommendation.  As other reviewers mentioned the letters format was odd for me at first - but I quickly slipped into the story and the format became very comfortable.  The main character is witty and there are wonderful references to history and literature.  Not my usual type of read -  but I enjoyed it so much I bought a paperback copy for a friend (read mine on my kindle).
B003XQM2YU|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE, ADVENTURE, ACTION, GOOD JOB ON EVERYONE'S ACTING ROLE, GOOD STORY-LINE AND LOVED THE EMPHASIS ON HONOR.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|...I still enjoyed the hell out of it anyway.<br /><br />First - let's get a major (or not considering how often this is covered in movie reviews) spoiler out of the way.  This is NOT an Alien movie.<br /><br />It is, however, set in the same universe.  Do you recall the ship on LV426 in the first Alien movie discovered by the ill-fated crew of the Nostromo?  Ever wonder who the other aliens were, the ones who originally piloted the craft which included the well-preserved remains of a giant humanoid featuring a chest wound that only foreshadowed what was to come?<br /><br />Ridley Scott answers those questions.  You may not like the answers, but the answers that Ridley Scott does provide are plausible and yet raise more questions at the same time.  Where did humanity come from?  Did we originate from elsewhere?  Does life exist elsewhere?  Do ancient sigils hail from somewhere else?  Two archaelogists would love to find out although their opinions differ from the scientific on one end and from faith on the other.<br /><br />Ridley Scott doesn't usually make the same movie twice and if you're expecting a Blade Runner or Alien out of Prometheus, you will be sorely disappointed.  Prometheus (unlike the Nostromo) is lavishly appointed by its funder, Mr. Weyland, and features state-of-the-art navigation and equipment unlike the funded-for-blue-collar-workers' ship, the Nostromo.  Our crew is also well-equipped to map out the areas, although they do take questionable risks at times.<br /><br />Even so, what they encounter ultimately will change the origins of the Alien mythos and their intended purpose may not be as far off from the vision that Weyland-Yutani had in mind for them later on in the franchise.<br /><br />Yes, you'll read in some of the reviews that some characters are cardboard cutouts, some lines are cliched, and it is also not a game-changer in the sci-fi genre, but what Ridley Scott still manages to accomplish is an enormous sense of scale in both his world creation, environments, and scope of story.<br /><br />This movie certainly invites additional outings to be sure and with additional questions to be answered, I hope that he's on board to continue the ride.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I HAVEN'T BEEN DISAPPOINTED WITH ANY OF THE MOVIES FROM THIS SERIES. GREAT ACTING. LOVE, ROMANCE, ACTION AND SPECIAL EFFECTS. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT ONE IS RELEASED AT THE MOVIE THEATERS!
B005I6EVUG|2.0|I purchased this cover along with my Kindle Fire back in January 2012 and initially liked the cover.  My Kindle Fire fit snugly in the case and the cover felt solid, like a real book.  However, within four months the bottom right elastic strap broke and two weeks later the bottom left strap broke. Tried to glue the straps but no luck. This cover was fairly expensive so I assumed the cover would last a few years, not four months. I'm very disappointed with the quality of the product and most unhappy that I now have to purchase another cover.  I will be looking for a cover without elastic straps and hopefully my next purchase will last more than four months.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It isn't often that I resent being interrupted to eat, but this is the case regarding these books.  interesting reading--from start to finish.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I just finished this first book in the trilogy, and it was seriously one of the worst books I've ever read. The erotica drones on so monotonously in some places that it's almost laughable. I found myself reading the sex scenes and ROLLING MY EYES in sheer exasperation.<br /><br />Of course, it wasn't really the preposterous love language that finally did me in. It was the hitting. Can you say FIFTY SHADES of misogyny? WTH?!?! I mean, yes, I'll admit, there isn't much sexier than a man who knows what he wants, but when \\"what he wants\\" is to hit me ... ahhm, isn't there a problem? I, for one, don't care how gorgeous a man is, if he pulls out his belt and starts swinging it, I'll be heading for the nearest exit. Hitting isn't part of the ever-complex \\"grey area\\" of my universe really. It's hitting. Duh! Don't do it. (Also, let's consider the possible consequences before we convince an entire generation of young women that it's sexy when a man hits you.)<br /><br />So why doesn't Ana just leave the control-freak billionaire, and all the hitting, alone?! Well, it's probably for the same reason I couldn't put this book down! She can't explain it and even feels GUILTY for it, but she actually kind of enjoys it! And I can't, in good conscience, blame her. I hated this novel, cover to cover, but every night, I went back for more. It was strangely and torturously addictive.
B0000025L0|4.0|This album was made in 1976, so it is before my time.  It was made back when jazz musicians where trying to figure out how to fuse rock n' roll and jazz without losing any musical sophistication.  I can appreciate this one today as a 4 star album, but at its time it was pioneering though it has been all but forgotten in the shuffle of seemingly countless albums that may be purchased.<br />Stanley Clarke was never really a household name and really it was only commonly known among those that loved bands like Return to Forever and Weather Report, which have also been practically forgotten in musical history.<br />Unfortunately, for most people their knowledge of fusion doesn't go much beyond this time period, and there is tons of great new fusion that never achieved the popularity of Stanley Clarke, but for many young kids getting into fusion their knowledge of music doesn't go this far back extensively.  Those that have heard of him are probably either jazz musicians or bassists that can count themselves among the elite of any genre.  Those that probably love him today are kids that are musically talented and love jam bands, because really there is no difference between a jam band and the genre of jazz known as jazz fusion.<br />Though this one is relatively unimportant as far as being known to the consciousness of modern music, it is deeply imbedded in the subconscious of modern music.  In fact, if Stanley Clarke came out today, then he probably would have achieved greater popularity than he ever did with this album, and School Days is possibly his most important effort.  My guess is that though people did not know much about what Stanley Clarke was doing at the time he released this album, that he would have been very successful among the Millennial Generation as a jam band.  That is, Stanley Clarke is one of the founding fathers of bands that made good music that would later enable bands like Phish to fill stadiums, and though I often criticize popular bands, I have to admit that Phish is quite talented.  However, Phish does not hold a candle to the musical skill of Stanley Clarke.<br />Like most good jam bands, Stanley Clarke's music is capable of inducing a peaceful state of mind comparable to hypnosis.  However, most of the rhythms of music are capable of inducing a hypnotic effect, it is just that Stanley Clarke does it in a way that I would estimate that more people would find pleasant than say heavy metal, and in some ways that makes me a minority.<br />Stanley Clarke has been called a virtuoso by many musicians, and I won't subtract that from him.  So, you might wonder why I subtracted a 5th star in my review.  The album lost the 5th star is that it suffers a little bit from being artsy fartsy, where this particular style of artsy fartsy is not my favorite, and I tend to like music that sounds heavier, more than music that seeming tranquilizes me into a pretzel of rhythmic thought.  That is, what this music album is any hooks.  It is ultra complicated jazz, and though it does have its regressions, they just don't seem all that great.  Thus, it is not on complexity that this album loses a star, but in its failure to have any catchy simple parts, such that there never seems to be any building of a foundation, and playing off of that foundation, and when there is a simple foundation given, it is not stupendous enough for the 5th star to be given.<br />As the Victor Wooten album says, \\"Yo!  Victor, you can't hold no groove unless you have a pocket.\\"  I don't seem to be able to find enough pockets on School Days, and when I search for them, and in this way the album seems to put me in a daze.  Thus, it would seem that \\"Days\\" in the title is an attempt to play on the word, \\"Daze,\\" of which I generally prefer music that makes me feel stone cold sober, if not aggressive.  I would imagine that someone who loves Phish or the Grateful Dead would possibly better be able to progress onto this style, and likewise listen to it withmore enthusiasm than I do.  Thus, for a person that may prefer a legal high, as opposed to doing drugs, this album is possibly a cheap high that might put one in a stupor.  As for me, I don't feel like a free man when I am in a stupor, but rather I feel that stupors are enslaving.  Perhaps, that means I should listen to the album some more, and thus it will probably be the next one to go in my 100 disc changer mix.<br />The rhythms of this album are comparable to the rhythms of the wind, just a few steps below.  When it comes down to it, though sometimes I like to listen to the rain, and sometimes I like to listen to the wind, buying an album for me that is so artsy fartsy that it might be comparable to these things is beyond me.  That is, why put School Days in the player when you might be able to open your window and listen to the way the wind blows and get the same quality.  Or if it is cold outside, why not just turn on a fan or a microwave and listen to the patterns of their humming instead of listening to School Days?  Thus, this is really just a matter of preference, an opinion only, and that opinion is that I prefer music that has a pocket, or at least seems like it has a pocket, especially as a way for me to enter into the rhythms of the song for the purpose of grooving to it, as opposed to flopping to it.more enthusiasm than I do.  Thus, for a person that may prefer a legal high, as opposed to doing drugs, this album is possibly a cheap high that might put one in a stupor.

0765348276|5.0|I love science fiction.  It was my first literary love (and with the sole exception of ASIOF) it is my favorite genre and will be.  This is the best science fiction I have read.  Before this it was Ender's Game, but the science and where might go with it is personified in this book.  And in addition to this the main characters are funny.  The major majority of reviews on this book liked it, which means the minority are idiots, because they are funny.  This is science fiction + comedy not comedy + science fiction (I am looking at you Bill the Galactic Hero).
B007BLDFWG|4.0|I found this movie intriguing. It was slow moving and all about the flash backs. The characters were well developed and the acting was fantastic but the story line left me asking so many questions...like, was Martha that damaged that she would stay in this commune and suffer abuse. Her constitution seemed too strong. Why didn't she get pregnant? What happened at the end??? I hate endings that let you determine what could have happened! Overall, it left me thinking about it for days.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I was out of the country when Season 2 of Downton Abbey was shown on Public Television.  I ordered it on Amazon when I got back.  It came much sooner than they said it was and I got to watch it all and not have to wait till the next week for the next chapter.  Maggie Smith is excellent.  I look forward to her and Shirley MacLain in the third series.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read a lot and I was debating if I wanted to read this book because of all the negative reviews I have read.  I must say you can't always go by others reviews because sometimes you will miss out on a really good book which is the case here.  The reason I did not give 5 stars is only because I was sick of Anastasia always saying Holy Cow or Holy F---.  I think Ms. James could have left that out and also \\"they answered dryly\\" that is quoted a lot and the author I think could have used other phrases.  I must say overall it was a very good read and now I'm off to read the 2nd installment.  I hope I enjoy it as much as I did this book.  Keep up the good work Ms. James!

B003KLGKAA|5.0|Part Poseidon Adventure, part Die Hard & Robots of Death, this Doctor Who episode had it all. I can't say enough about the production of the episode. It had me on edge the entire time I watched it. I kept wondering how it all would end and when I found out I just couldn't get enough. But I warn you, it is sad, and not at all predictable compared to most Doctor Who plotlines.  This episode is one you will not forget and Tennant is already up there in the top three or four Doctors of all time. He certainly is the best since the show was revived. How I wish he had been the Doctor since its inception. Eccleston bailed on the show (From What I Hear) and Tennant took over and brought Doctor Who to an entirely new level. I wish he had not left the show.  Who is Matt Smith and what is he like? Well, now I know. I liked Matt Smith but he is n David Tennant. I have to order the Complete Specials because there was a gap for me between the Fourth and Fifth Series.  I liked The Fourth Series and how they integrated Donna Noble into the show's script. I'd forgotten that she was the woman in Runaway Bride. Donna Noble and her family were a joyous bunch. While overall I liked the Third Series better, this Series more than held its own, especially the reunion episode: &#34;Stolen Earth.&#34; Seeing the whole gang of former companions come back together was a joy! I so wish that Tennant had had the part from the beginning. There would have been so much more that the show could have done. I highly recommend this DVD and I give it Five Stars.    A.

B006DHAT5K|4.0|Heroine in bed with guy she's in a nowhere relationship with.  Said heroine quietly simmering over peer's upcoming nuptials.  She takes notice of her life and does a reevaluation.  Lots of potty humor.  I'm going to give the makers of \\"What's Your Number\\" the benefit of the doubt because it was released months after \\"Bridesmaids\\".  But it makes you think whether these are coincidences or conventions of the genre.  Regardless, I enjoyed the film immensely.  In fairness Anna Faris' Ally is a different character type than Kristen Wiig's Annie.  Whereas Ally is bubbly Annie was more neurotic.  There is also undeniable chemistry between Faris and Chris Evans.  My wife said Faris was married to Evans in real life but she wasn't sure.  I have no recall of this film being in theatres but my wife said it was for a moment.  I don't know if the \\"Bridesmaids\\" factor had an effect on it's lackluster showing at the box office but \\"What's Your Number\\" deserves to be judged on it's own merits.

B000001FMX|5.0|It's easy to take glam rock for granted.<br /><br />Ever since the 1980's, many rock fans have been put off by the spandex pants, the poodle hairs, the saccharine power ballads and unbearable machismo of many crappy glam metal bands that weren't named Def Leppard or Guns N' Roses. But what these people don't know is that some of the best glam rock bands came out in the 1970's and that none of these bands had to resort to Desmond Child or Diane Warren to write successful singles. These bands let their music do the talking and were every bit as raw and dangerous as the Rolling Stones, the Who and the bands that followed like the the Clash and the Stooges. One of the bands were, of course, the New York Dolls.<br /><br />Even though the Dolls looked like something out of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, they were a force to be reckoned with in the studio, as this stunning debut album indicates. They were punk rock before that term existed, glam rock before that term became popular. Simply put, the New York Dolls are not only the fathers of Guns N' Roses, Motley Crue, Aerosmith, Kiss and Def Leppard but their do-it-yourself aesthetics and raw, reckless sound paved the way for many punk bands like the Clash, the Sex Pistols, Dead Boys, Crass, the Dictators and Richard Hell. Produced by Todd Rundgren, NEW YORK DOLLS is an irresistible blend of unembarrassed camp, sleaze rock and proto-punk menace, with elements of girl group pop, Stones-like riffs and glam rock hooks thrown in for good measure. Each track oozes with sleaze, danger and kitsch, in which David Johansen screams and howls like a possessed lunatic while Johnny Thunders and Syl Sylvain deliver gritty guitar riffs worthy of the Rolling Stones and Chuck Berry. This was rock n' roll at its most decadent, way before Guns N' Roses and Motley Crue brought sleaze rock into the mainstream.<br /><br />And what a gloriously decadent album this is, starting with the ferocious classic \\"Personality Crisis\\", complete with nasty riffs, piano chords and Johansen's frightening singing. Then comes the sexual strut of \\"Looking for a Kiss\\", which dares to plagiarize the opening verse of the Shangri-La's \\"Give Him a Great Big Kiss\\" and the trashy rocker \\"Vietnamese Baby\\", with an opening riff that would make Keith Richards proud. The album slows down with the gleeful country-blues of \\"Lonely Planet Boy\\" before the band rises as \\"Frankenstein\\" and have a wail of a time on the trashy sing-along \\"Trash\\" and garage boogie \\"Bad Girl\\". The album closes with \\"Pills\\", which is an intoxicating mix of harmonica and guitar riffs, and the adrenaline-rushed closing track \\"Jet Boy\\", which contains a chorus that will make you pump your fists in the air. Filler? What filler? I don't see a filler track in sight.<br /><br />The New York Dolls only made two studio albums in the 1970's but those two records (this and TOO MUCH TOO SOON) blow their contemporaries out of the water; not even the Sex Pistols were as good and dangerous as the Dolls at their prime. It's a crying shame that the Dolls are not recognized by the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame because without the Dolls, none of the bands who are in the Hall like Aerosmith, the Sex Pistols, the Stooges, R.E.M. and Guns N' Roses would have existed. It goes to show just how ahead of time this great band was back in the 1970's.<br /><br />It also goes to show just how wrong it is to associate glam rock with the poodle metal bands of the 1980's. Many rock fans will tell you that glam rock is nothing but pedestrian, commercial wuss music but the music of the New York Dolls provides evidence to the contrary that glam could be just as punk rock as Johnny Rotten and Johnny Ramone. Anyone who wants to know what real glam rock is all about, this album will come as a revelation. Trust me. You won't regret it.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to buy at all costs.riffs, piano chords and Johansen's frightening singing.

B007FLHW3K|4.0|Well I got this delivered 31 days ago and just finally got my bike out for the summer to install the light it is DOA. The moment you plug the battery pack in the lights turn on and won't turn off. None of the buttons work and all it does is flash multiple colors nonstop. Contacted Amazon today about returning it for a replacement and they said no since it's one day past the return window. So now I have to go through the manufacture directly. Too bad since I have many of the older units that I bought as refurbished/used/demo from MonkeyLectric in the past that still work perfectly and the new one is a dud. I will update this once ML contacts me back but as of today I give them 2 stars and amazon 1.<br /><br />**MonkeyLectric responded back the say day with a fix for this issue. So if your unit locks up you can reset it by pressing the power button 4X, then the theme button 4X, then the color button 4X. Wait 10 seconds and then turn off the unit. I did this and it works perfectly. Great customer service from ML, I should have just contacted them first.
0812550706|4.0|Sound familiar? A young boy goes to an out-of-this world school where he is groomed to save the world?<br />Hmmm, yes, there are elements in this book common with Harry Potter.<br />The difference is that this is science fiction - and although it was penned way before the young wizard picked up a wand, it's set way, way in the future.<br />I enjoyed this book but I have to say science fiction is not my favourite fare.<br />The author is a skilful conjurer of characters. I knew this from reading his how-to book Characters and Viewpoint a few years ago.<br />He did not disappoint.<br />This book is written in a very easy style, it's a good story, with some twists and turns, and, true to his word, Scott Orson Card does bring his characters to life.<br />Ender is a boy with a social conscience<br />If you get past the Harry Potter parallels, there's more food for thought too sbout the world we live in right now.<br />It's worth a read.

B007I1Q4W2|4.0|There are certain kinds of stories used in movies that become so popular that they pass the tipping point plunging into the hackney. Among the myriad of genres available to the screenwriters the one most prone to overuse is found in the realm of horror flicks. Even in that sliver of filmmaking there are slices that have become overused for example the slasher flick. Without a doubt another has to be the zombie horde. The ravaging mass on staggering undead has become exceptionally popular in some rather unusual ways. People dress up as zombies and normal going out into the night on `zombie' crawls' acting out scenarios of doom on the city streets. A very popular television series featuring these `Walking Dead' demonstrates that this kind of story is far from being played out, there are still aspects that can be discovered if the filmmaker has the insight and talent new twists on the zombie film can still be had. Considering the undead has been a staple of horror films since the thirties when most were the result of intervention of a practitioner of the occult forbidden arts of voodoo. Since George Romero reinvented zombies as social commentary theses rotting corpses have had the potential for innovative plot lines as well as some of the worse quick and cheap independent movies. Fortunately for devotees of movies there are still creative filmmakers willing to think out of the box. John Geddes happens to be one such auteurs and his latest opus, `Exit Humanity' demonstrates that this old dog has a few new tricks left. He is part of a new vanguard of horror masters that has looked into history for a setting; transplanting the familiar creatures of death into a well known historical setting, the Civil War. He is among the first to proceed on this tangent but the trend seems to be growing. Many `steam punk' stories are based in this turbulent time in our country's history as well as a recent action horror film that turns Abraham Lincoln into a vampire slayer. Mr. Geddes pulls back in time to an era when there was certainly no shortage of fresh courses just waiting for reanimation. I was hesitant when I read the synopsis on the screener but within minutes of watching the film I found myself enthralled, my attention affixed to the screen, realizing I was watching something special.<br /><br />There is a certain fascination that many Americans hold for the bloodiest war ever fought on our soil, the Civil War or as some in the Deep South continue to refer to it, `The War of Northern Aggression'. The summer is an appropriate time to turn our attention to this conflict as July Forth does mark the anniversary of the most costly battle in the war, Gettysburg. This film immediately draws the audience into the brutal violence of the time by opening with an all out battle scene. We see a familiar sight for war buffs and frequent viewers of the History Channel, battle weary men clad in the grey and blue of their respective nations clashing in mortal combat. Then, slowly we notice there is a third force merging into the fray; a sizable force of zombies. Rather that commit a lot of film to a prolonged explanation this scene economically defines the foundation of this alternate universe. Socioeconomic fight that lead to dividing the nation has been settled on the battlefield but now as the two sides attempt to heal and rebuild the battle lines are once again drawn. Instead of policy and geography determining you allegiance it is now a bitter struggle for the living to defend against the ravenous host of the decaying undead.<br /><br />The film continues to renovate persistent tropes by updating the `found footage' motif. True to a period appropriate story telling the video footage has been replaced by recently located journal. This provides an intimate first person account through the personal experiences of the narrator, Edward Young (Mark Gibson). Innovations like this are accumulated stacking one layer upon another creating a solid foundation for the story. With such a fanciful departure from both the classic Civil War film and the traditional zombie flick. If fans of either kind of flick complain about the mixture or divergence from the typical then you can be certain they have not seen this movie. It is not uncommon for a story set in this period to feature a man who lost his wife and son but once again the construction of the plot surrounds the anticipated character archetype and places him in a totally novel set of circumstances.<br /><br />It is one thing to use a journal as a prop to ease into narration as the written word gives way to dialogue but Mr. Geddes takes things a step further. Common to the journals of the period Edward accompanied his words with numerous drawings of the people and circumstances he encountered in his life. As the camera focuses o one of these sketches the audience is whisked into the depicted scene becoming a firsthand observer of the story. This is simply put brilliant adding an immediacy and intimacy to the film that is usually lacking particularly in a movie featuring decaying antagonists.<br /><br />I found myself compelled to watch this film several times, with each viewing is discovered yet another layer with nuances I had not yet explored. It has been a very long time since I felt that way about a horror film. Much of this is derived by the mélange offered up by the director. He is relatively new to his craft as writer and director with one previous feature to his credit, `Scarce'. There he took on the standard horror ploy of isolation. I look forward to obtaining a copy to add to what I am certain will become a growing collection of this artist's work. The drawings slip into period style animation before finally morphing into live action. This enhances the overall effect of transporting the audience back in time to witness the travails of this simple solider. In all this film is rich in detail with but a few technical missteps. Fir something made on a miniscule budget it is the epitome of the independent film; talent, innovation and art over the overwhelming need for box office.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good book, a little bit predictable...but got me hooked anyway...the other two are really REALLY better than this... Absolutely recommended....
B005LAIGW8|2.0|I watched a rental of this movie last night. Saved me from having to buy it, thank goodness. I see some people seem to love this movie and brand anyone \\"haters\\" who disagree. Let me say something about my experience. First, if you liked the first one you can save your time and money. This is in no way the same movie or character. The only similarity is the flaming skull which does look pretty good. Everything else is a complete make-over. They changed his costume to a Batman-ish shiny suit( you know how they like to \\"improve\\" on the original, maybe supposed to resemble charcoal?),dumped the cool Hawg (precious little saddle time here)and have him more like a Ghost Walker cause he spends more time riding shotgun than anything else. Here, anything he rides is a ball of flame but he's only on them for seconds at a time. He's more powerful than the Devil???? Yeah right.The story is very confusing and what's with the strange convulsing and rocking from foot to foot? I can't blame Nicholas Cage but the director. Agree or not, this Ghost Rider is anything but fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|i think this game is full of action and fun. i play this game just about everyday and Love It! every time i play this game...i feel happy....
B007L3BMGA|5.0|i am not one to read romance... but this book touch my little heart. i know that i'm not going to meet a millionare, EVER! but i love to just dream of the possibility. i love to dream of meeting someone like \\"fifty\\".  i will forever refer to the man of my dreams as my \\"christian grey\\".. (if i ever find him) .. a girl can dream can't she?<br /><br />this is the only series i have ever read twice.. sigh :)
B005C0DHEY|5.0|I live in Garfield County Colorado in the middle of a ravaged land filled with fracking wells!  This documentary shows what we see in reality first hand here in Colorado.  It is no game, no show, no fooling, it's the real dam thing.  Streams that bubble up and faucets you can lite with a match.  Strange ailments and contaminated ground water.  It's all true, it's all a horror and if you own a piece of America you think is all yours get ready for the surprise.  If you didn't specifically include the mineral rights in your purchase you just own the top ground but you don't even control that.  Who ever owns the mineral rights can set a well right next to your house and there is nothing you can do about it because mineral rights owners have priority over land owners when it comes to extracting minerals.  A money grab set into law centuries ago and still the law today. If this doesn't do us in GREED will! We're hell bent on stupidity!
B007SGM084|5.0|I enjoyed reading the trilogy.  I'm glad I purchased it for my Kindle.  Some of the content might not be suitable for younger readers, but that would be up to parental discretion.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because it is everywhere.  It has the worst plot EVER.  If you download a sample and wonder where the story continues to... it doesn't.  I found it offensive that a college educated woman would stay with a man who tells her over and over how he is going to F... her.  Porn in print, plain and simple.  Highly offensive treatment of female main character.
0307951529|5.0|Best Book I've read in a long time.  Full of inspiring examples and a ton of useful information that one needs to start up a microbusiness.  This is a MUST read!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I bought this book looking for a quick romance read and it's price.  It was horribly written, as if by a dysfunctional high school teenager.  Although the setting of this book was supposed to be college, it reminded me more of high school trysts than anything else.  I doubt this author has ever even been on a college campus.  The story starts out with main characters who appear to be half way decent characters.  Any integrity they start the story with quickly degrades.  A dominant male who has given up bringing his slut-a-night home for Abby the virgin... come on! Who gave this trash five stars???
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is so fun add me dtrcity ya add that I'm a great neighbor I tip when I can and gift almost every day
B00632HWOG|5.0|I don't need a fancy app to manage my email. This is perfect! Easy to use. Updates in the background of my Kindle Fire. No fancy stuff here...who needs fancy with email. Right?
0452289963|5.0|This book is always somewhere in my home where I can grab instantly. It doesn't feel pressuring to read it as if you have to find enlightenment or your screwed. It simply explains what you already know and deepens that understanding. I could go on and on about this book but it seems like it's different everyone. I highly recommend at least reading it once, if it's right for you great, if not, thats ok too!
B000JIHP88|5.0|You movement is smooth and quiet. The night light is a bit dim, but it is very good on batteries we have had it for a month now and haven't had to change the batteries we use it a couple of time a day. Our baby is 4 months old and she loves it. She won't sleep in the vein without it. In short the best mobile we have tried we have had three.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|this game is ok but it can be a little nerveracking sometimes and also frusterating. and it does get old after a while so I would recommend this game maybe
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I read this book with a mixture of fascination and horror. it was very easy to become involved with the main female character and i wanted badly to give her some advice! Not a book for everyone but it was confronting and strangely enjoyable!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is written by an amazing 10th grader.  The book is so simple.  But hey its fun candy for some.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this app. Unlike Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja, you can never get sick of it because you are always improving. If you play Angry Birds, you will get stuck and I'm unwilling to play it 20 times as to passing a level. In my opinion, Fruit Ninja gets boring quickly because it is timed. Classic is not timed, but it is really hard. I prefer Temple Run, as it is addicting. When you buy things, they help you in your games. The game goes on until you die, and that is what I like best. As for in-app purchases, you can use parental controls, and I've accidentely clicked on buying things, and I haven't spent a penny.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|I had good success with the Nite Ize 1W LED upgrade early on, but I think that I own 7 of them, going back about 3 - 4 years, both with and without the tail switch. To date, all but 1 of them have failed. I'm talking about lights that haven't had the batteries replaced 3 or 4 times.<br /><br />What I'm really surprised about is that I couldn't, and still can't, find anything negative in either Google or Yahoo. Nothing about failure, defective, broken, etc. All of the search results were sales related. I couldn't find ANY objective reviews that might have warned me of their relative short usable life.<br /><br />That leaves me still looking, (I guess like many of us), for the perfect 2 AA EDC LED.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|After watching these 2 DVDs, I could not believe what I had found. This is a TV SHOW that is MUCH MORE SUSPENSEFUL & GRIPPING than many other horror movies. Not only it contains horror but it also cleverly deals with some psychological matters. For example, it reveals troubles in friendship, and marriage. On top of that, it emphasizes parental love. There are many scenes that emotionally tortured me.
0525478817|4.0|Fair or not, in my mind this book gets compared to My Sister's Keeper. I found the two main characters very entertaining, they were interesting and for myself fairly relatable. The story is great and heartfelt. John Green has a way of making very real topics feel very real. This book gives a wonderful look in the mind of a cancer patient. Great for teens and adults. Good book but it didn't really wow me. Most people really love it, so give it a read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is my first review on Amazon, and normally I don't write one because everyone is different and has their own opinion. But this time I felt the strong need to say that \\"I don't understand the fascination of this book!!!\\" At first I could relate to the character, but then she goes into I love him, I hate him, and she cries all the time, and yet is sexually aroused by Christian. I thought to myself, maybe I have been too sheltered and don't understand women, but Hey wait, I am a woman and I don't understand this story line. It became an emotional disturbing story, not the S&M, but the story line. In one sentence she is thinking he is messed up and the very next sentence she is wanting to orgasm. The feelings, emotions, switches so quickly that it does not make sense, and therefore you can't tell if she is enjoying herself or hating herself, or if he is hurting her. She seemed intelligent, but then the author dummies her down during and after sex. Either you like it or you don't.<br />If you are confused by my writing above, then congratulations you now have a feel for what the book is like.<br />I think if the main character were older and more experienced in the S&M it might be more sensual, instead it is disturbing. I will not read another book of the author's. A friend said this book was a lot like Twilight. If that is the case I won't read that either.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|I would rate this transmitter EXCELLENT overall.  I use this transmitter with my iPod Nano 6th generation, along with the outstanding Jabra Halo2 Bluetooth Headset.  Pleased to report the transmitter and headset had absolutely no problem syncing and pairing up!  And most important, the overall sound and audio quality is pretty amazing for a Blue-Tooth wireless set up! The transmitter does draw more power than usual from the iPod Nano battery supply.  So this could be an issue for anyone looking to listen non-stop for hours on end.<br /><br />However, I only listen to this setup during my powerwalks, which are about 30-45 minutes tops, so this is more than adequate.  Overall, though, bottom line, this transmitter delivered as promised and did not disappoint.  A bit expensive (yes, I'm cheap), but overall an excellent product which delivers as promised.  I highly recommend this transmitter.
1936608898|5.0|Honestly, my favorite part of this book was the Meal Map. Many people come to paleo/primal eating suddenly realizing that if they want to eat well, they're gonna have to cook for themselves.  The Meal Map really helps with that, bc it presents Master recipes (along with the all-important variations) for ground beef, chicken/fish/pork, frittata, roasted/sauteed/grilled vegetables. curries, and soups. This is a great way to gain confidence in the kitchen, vs getting a bunch of unrelated recipes.<br /><br />You can agree with the rest of the science/practical info in the book all you want, but changing what goes in your mouth is how it actually -works-, so providing the tools for feeding yourself right is key.
0345525558|4.0|The author initially winds a tale of flowers and the travesties of the foster care system, not unlike White Oleander. However, the story carries on to find its own two legs focusing on floriography and one specific foster home the child lives in. The subject matter of relaying emotions using flowers as a conduit was fascinating to me. The author frequently explained a floral meaning, but also casually mentioned some--piquing your interest to hunt down the answer--unbeknownst to me until the end, my edition had a floral \\"dictionary\\" in the back of the book.<br />There was a part of the book where I literally threw it down. The subject matter is not graphic, just difficult. The story and the characters were so intriguing that I did end up picking the book back up and continue reading it, but not without distress. (I was vindicated to note that the author herself would write only a few sentences during these scenes and then have to go lay down). The ending was superb and tied the story together with a bow. Well written and enjoyable read
1451678193|5.0|I'm not much of reader besides the required books from school and what';s on the internet. However I have read a few books I like, like All the King's Men, Arrowsmith, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the main Tolkein books which were actually read to us kids by my father.<br /><br />However while reading the Martian Chronicles, I remember thinking, wow, this is a good book.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|[[ASIN:1466401885 Beautiful Disaster]]I'm not going to lie, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. However, it left me slightly concerned. I am a 21 year old college student, and I've been through the wringer when it comes to college relationships. While I enjoyed the fantasy of the book, it left me slightly discomfited with the relationship described. I just hope that younger readers, who are still quite impressionable, stay away. This book centers on what I would call an unhealthy relationship, and uses drama and unrealistic situations to both draw the readers in and bring the characters together. I'm just worried young readers will receive the wrong impressions about relationships from the book, as what is portrayed is not something any young girl should strive for. I loved the action and sappy love story, but I hope young girls never use it as a future model.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!  I was hooked after only a few runs.  I play on my kindle fire and it works perfectly.  There aren't any annoying delays like a lot of games I've tried.  This game is straight forward and fun.  There is no need to pay for things within the game in order to enjoy it.  There aren't dumb advertisements or pop ups trying to get you to purchase coins.  This is a fun and addicting game.  It is the best game I have ever downloaded and it's free!

B007CKNX28|5.0|If you like The White Stripes and the Raconteurs, you should dig this album. It has elements of garage rock, country, blues, and rockabilly all rolled up into one awesome record.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent second season of one of the best tv shows on this decade. The script is excellent, as well as the actors. The only thing that I consider a little worse than the first season is the direction. The first season has a more film quality than the second season. Either way, an almost perfect show.
0345529057|5.0|awesome series, can' t wait for the next few books and hope it doesn't get too dry. Next great epic series
B007PVHBHC|5.0|Where to start?  Banga is simply fabulous and it deserves 10 stars and many many awards!  You definately would regonize this as a work of art authored by the one and only Patti Smith, but you also cant miss that it is an original creation.  Patti is 65, but unlike many of her contemporaries, continues to evolve taking it to that next level. This work goes full circle with elements of her past work integrated throughout, but still having a new original feel, sound and energy all its own. It is almost spiritual at times yet provacative! The background intrumentals are intersting and so well recorded. Her voice is more beautiful than ever and so pure whether she is singing or saying the words.  I love all the songs, but especially like her voice on the recording titled \\"Maria\\". And the song \\"Seneca\\" is hauntingly beautiful and highlights the quality of her voice.  I love that all of the songs are original except the last which is a cover by Neil Young, \\"After the Gold Rush\\".  For those of you/us of \\"that generation\\" this album will resonate with you. She is the poet laureate of all generations.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|I purchased this to be used for headphones with my Xbox 360. The item works exactly as described, and well. Using it with Klipsch Reference S4's, the sound is absolutely amazing; no other sound comes out of this except what the audio equipment delivers. It's a fantastic device for the price.<br /><br />However, keep in mind this does not amplify the signal! This means you're listening to the audio at line level, and there's no way to adjust the sound out of the Xbox 360 (and I assume any other similar devices). I've found the volume to be perfect, but it may be too quiet for other people. Keep this in mind when purchasing, depending on your intended application! This of course was my oversight, and was not at all mislead.

B007I2BZIE|4.0|I was less than impressed with Snakes and Arrows, Vapor Trails, and even Test For Echo. Counterparts was the last Rush album I really got into....until now. Honestly this album took a few listens to get into. Some songs stood out instantly, BU2B, The Wreckers, and The Anarchist were instantly likable. Then over a few listens songs like Headlong Flight, The Garden, and Caravan sunk in and \\"clicked\\". This is a complete album. It really needs to be treated as a whole piece and not separate songs. It's like reading chapters of a book out of order or randomly. The album really flows together.<br /><br />I really hope Rush has another album or two in them. Clockwork Angels appears to be the band headed in a great direction.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Who would have thought that this book would be so deep! I was amazed at how compelled I was by the story. At times I was crying, but could not put down the books!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Best app I have ever seen.  Well thought out navigation methodology. Very quick response so lt is as excellent tool for use during sermons. The reading plans are great.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Much like anything else with the word &quot;zombie&quot; in it, this game is mindless fun. At least, it appears to be at first. A few stages in and, much like chess, SvZ begins to show why it's so ease to pick up and yet will take hours to master. I'm on my second play through, using a different set of henchmen and the game still feels fresh, not repetitive like so many mobile games.<br /><br />I'm not Commander Shepard, but I still approve this message.
B0086700CM|5.0|fast paced, fun and exactly what I'm looking for in a simple game for my phone. really challenging for how simple it is.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I only read the first few chapters of this book.  I thought it was not well written and sort of silly and hokey.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

0738727326|5.0|This deck was an amazing buy from online. The pictures of the deck were no where near as beautiful as the cards were and the order came in on time and without any problems. The deck was a gift for a friend and it was a great beginner and middle user deck.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This is riveting stuff.<br /><br />My friends are prodding to me to listen to something else for a change.<br />Without them, it's be hard to turn this off.<br /><br />Their's is an absolutely fresh and unique twist on an old sound.<br /><br />Seen live, they're unforgettable.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I tried to buy this app for my kindle fire about ten times. Kept jumping through hoops to get them to accept my money. Finally gave up. I guess ya'll are so rich you don't really need my 99c. Good luck with that business model.

1849025975|5.0|An interesting account of the Spanish civil war. The writers voice here makes Orwell's influence on Christopher Hitchens very obvious. Hitchens' commentary on various things sounds a lot less original after going through this book. Orwell is a great journalist, he really drew me into something I knew next to nothing about.<br /><br />This book has it all: humor, detailed accounts, summaries, introspection, and practical application. Also remarkable is Orwell's ending where he humbly and wisely cautions the reader not to jump to conclusions too quickly based on what he said, encouraging them to consider the impact of his biases, oversights, and ignorance. Even though he was a socialist and I'm not, if I had to get a dead author to cover a major world event on the ground level, Orwell would be high on the list.
1439152799|3.0|I love Kate Morton's way with words, her creativity, the mystery of \\"who dun it\\" but it was an easy book to put down for awhile and I tend to base how much I like a book on how hard it is to stop reading it at any point. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to take his/her time reading a book and who appreciates good literature.
B0086700CM|5.0|At First I Thought This Game Was Just Another Boring Old Game!But I Went To Skool N Everybody Was Talking About It!!Then I Seen My Cousin Playing It And I was Like What's That's Game called She Said Temple Run I Was Like So That's What Everybody Been Talking About It!! It Is Somewhat Addicting!!But Very Funn!!I Really Recommend This Game To Anybody And Everyone!!!!
0062060562|4.0|This is my kind of book. You have to keep turning the page, holding your breath Ben doesn't find the diary. But I agree with the reviewer who said it just got wrapped up too fast, too vague. Would recommend it to anyone.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|All Stallone haters should see the first Rocky and the first Rambo. Both movies are great and although Rocky is better, Rambo is almost as good. Stallone is of course not a Shakespearian actor, but here he is really in his element - John Rambo is after all a devastated, battlescarred veteran, who clearly was not great in social contacts (or great verbal communication) even before the Vietnam War, but who now is really close to a human wreck, with autistic tendancies.<br /><br />In fact, this movie is about a lonely, impoverished, homeless and deeply depressed man who at one moment turns back and bites the bullies in police uniforms who (really sadistically) abuse him, just because he wanted to buy something to eat in the wrong little town. When it finally appears how dangerous he is, he becomes the target of a manhunt, which ultimately gets totally out of proportion.<br /><br />There will be no more details - if you didn't see it yet, you deserve to be surprised. The only thing I am ready to reveal is that the National Guard is providing one of the (few) humorous moments in the movie... Stallone gives a very good performance, and Brian Dennehy (the \\"redneck\\" sheriff) and Richard Crenna (colonel of Green Berets) are even better. I always liked this movie and always felt a great pity for the main character.<br /><br />Oh, and also you will be surprised by the bodycount - although maybe not in the way you would expect...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|one of the improvements wanted would be the ability to sell more than one item at a time; also without having to place item in valley first
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|I like Hollywood blockbusters and they are my usual poison but from time to time I simply MUST take a break and watch something that is NOT Hollywoodian, is not a sequel and doesn't involve too many car chases, superheroes, explosions, laser beams and idiotic scenarios. If you are looking for such a thing, you will not find much better that \\"The Ninth Gate\\".<br /><br />To begin, one precision - this is the adaptation of a great novel, \\"Club Dumas\\" by the Spanish author Arturo Perez Reverte. The book is amazing but very, very hard to adapt to the screen - so Polanski had to make many changes. As the result, you can now watch a great movie and read a great book, in whatever order you like, without being disappointed by one of them.<br /><br />This movie is about ancient books, people who collect them and people who live by trading them - and it is an amazing thing how passionate this world is. It is a great achievement of Polanski that he managed to keep a very honest pace of events, when placing the action mostly in librairies, bookshops etc. The gallery of persons shown in this movie is, typically for Polanski, made of characters mostly excentrical, frequently upsetting, sometimes very funny, but never, not even once, boring.<br /><br />This is in large part one Johnny Depp show, and this is a great show. His character (Dean Corso, trader in ancient books) is in this movie slightly less antipatic than in the novel, but clearly he is not a totally nice guy. The way Johnny Depp acts in this movie confirms the impression I had for many years now - he is not only handsome, he is simply one of the greatest actors alive (and doesn't even need dreadlocks and gold teeth to prove it).<br /><br />Emmanuelle Seigner plays a character that is totally ambigous (she is just The Girl - we never know what is her name) and I will not reveal anything more about her. She is beautiful, mysterious, tempting but distant and she certainly is leading the main hero somewhere. But we do not know where - until the last image. Lena Olin (Liana Telfer) and Frank Langella (Boris Balkan) are other stars of the show - they are supporting characters and appear less on the screen, but they are both very important.<br /><br />However the real \\"hero\\" of this movie could only be... a book. This book is called - what else - \\"The Nine Gates\\" and was written by a heretic alchimist around year 1515. The Inquisition then burned the author with all the copies which was possible to find - and the further we advance in the movie, the most we realise, that for once, for this one time, the Inquisition could very well have done the right thing! You desserve to discover the rest of the story by yourself.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie. Reading some of the previews below I couldn't understand how you can be bored by it? Thanks to Polanski's unique touch there is more atmosphere in every scene of \\"Ninth Gate\\" that we actually can take in. There is a pair of extremely handsome and talented actors. There is the discreet but beautiful musical score by Wojciech Kilar. There is a deep and very very dangerous mystery. There is an almost sadistic, totally unsuspected twist towards the end. And there is finally, well hidden in the shadows, one writer, who really doesn't need an agent to take care of his bookwriting career.... See this film! It is worth it!know where - until the last image.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I have to say that this is one of my favorite movies that I've seen in a couple of years. It's without a doubt, better than the first one. It's hilarious, better plot, better cinematography and the acting on everyone's part is great. RDJ once again provides a hilarious, charming, and brilliantly mad Sherlock Holmes with his partner-in-crime Watson (Jude Law). There is some beautiful homoerotic subtext in this film that makes it that much funnier. Moriarty was cast wonderfully by none other than Jared Harris. Honestly though, DEFINITELY worth the watch. The movie is INCREDIBLE and I absolutely LOVE the ending. =D<br /><br />MUST WATCH!!
0439023513|5.0|A very satisfying end to the  saga of Katniss Eberdeen. We see Katniss  finally leading the rebels of District 13 against President  Snow, leading<br />to a satisfying conclusion. The evolution of Katniss from  a rebelliou young woman to a symbol and firebrand leader of the rebel forces.
B00006GO99|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable listen from start to finish.  No new ground being broken here or new frontiers explored, just great musicianship all around.  Definitely among his more accessible works, this would be an ideal place to start for the newbie jazz listener not familiar with Monk's unique and rather unorthodox style.  As far as sound quality is concerned, this is one of the better remasters that I have come across.  Highly recommended.
B0088TG252|5.0|Good flick but predictable bad guy. Loved the action scenes and Ryan is good in this too. Like seeing Ruben Blades again too.
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|The blu-ray disc worked perfectly for me and I saved money buying it on amazon instead of a store :)
B0085776BG|4.0|Loved the story and action in this flick. Would recommend to anyone but would have liked to see and learn more about what they had to go through versus the white pilots.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a retired Librarian I ordered this book to discover what the controversy was all about.  Speaking as an older adult,  I found the book to be quite implausable, with the plot overwhelmed with highly discriptive, kinky sexual content. I didn't feel the need to read the other two sequels; one book was enough.
B003QSO11W|5.0|This movie is so funny and quirky. Love the whole lone wolf hitman idea and him falling in love again with Minnie Driver.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|I can't get enough of this movie. I'm surprised by all of the negative reviews really. It's exactly what it should have been. Granted, the comic version is a bit different but this movie really retained the feeling of the comic. Michael Cera did a perfect job bringing Pilgrim to life.<br /><br />I would have given this 5 stars. The only reason I didn't was because of the packaging. I wanted the DVD/Blu-Ray version. When it arrived, the packaging only mentions the Blu-Ray specs with absolutely no mentioning of a second disc. I ended up contacting Amazon support because the only way I would know there was a second disc was to open it and rendering it unreturnable by their standards. Turns out there was a second disc (tech support offered to accept the return if it was wrong). Just a heads up to others who were confused like me.<br /><br />Now stop reading the reviews and go watch the movie!!!
B007X15GRQ|5.0|This was really good I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I always enjoy a Mark Wahlberg movie tho. Am going to watch again in a few minutes it was that good.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very well written, but a depressing plot and subject. I frequently had to put it down and calm down. But I always picked it up again. Very hard to read near the end, very emotional.
0345803493|1.0|I've read all 3 of these books. After reading the first in the<br />series, I decided the 2nd one couldn't possibly be as bad.  If<br />you enjoy reading about various ways of having sex, you'll love<br />these books.  After the first 3 or 4 sex \\"scenes\\", I scanned the<br />rest.  I must say though that curiously did make me read all 3<br />books.  I'm finishing the 3rd one now.  Leaving out the pages<br />and pages of sex or even thinking about sex, I could have read one book in about 30 minutes.  I have to admit I am curious about the<br />outcome of Ana and Christian's marriage but oh my, it took a<br />long time to get there.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app by far.  Love the reading plans and being able to switch versions quickly.  Highly recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down! This world just pulls you in and makes you care so much about the people, the situation, etc. Really fantastic. Please write more about this world!
B0015442YU|5.0|Terrific movie. Have seen it several times and am sure I am not overstating it.  The pricipal actors are great: Oldman is unrecognizable and superb; the others are excellent in their roles. Quite imaginative and horriffic.  I understand how some viewers may have been taken over the limit with the flesh eating and brain eating, but it is about a monster of a man after all. I think it was great work by Hopkins, Moore and Liota and just felt a need to respond to those who rated it less than excellent.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Like this flick but it is what it is a sci fi flick about other worlds. Good action scenes and characters also good cg.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I enjoyed the book tremendously and was disappointed in the movie.  Some important aspects were lost in the film: the terror that the book authors experience every time they get together at Aibilene's house, the real reason why Constantine was fired, the fact that Hilly turned the toilet-damping incident to her advantage, etc., etc., etc.  Instead, saccharine sweetness is added to all relationship and Skeeter is turned into a White savior. I would recommend the book to a friend, but not the film.  Too Hollywood.  Too happy-ending.
030758836X|3.0|I already see a handful of reviews that felt the same as I do.  From the start this was a great book, enjoyable to read, and I had a hard time putting it down.  It's a thriller, and you are regularly left wondering \\"what's next.\\"  The character development was solid, and the format of alternating narrators is interesting.<br />However, the ending is a complete and total let down.  I was sure I would go back to read some of the author's earlier works, but now that I'm finished, I am not so sure.  I had begun recommending this book to friends before I had gotten into the last couple of chapters, and I am recommending it with reservations.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Only slightly above average cinematography and acting save this movie from being a waste of time.<br /><br />Alaska is full of these bitter end-of-the-road guys. Liked that they were a bit more dimensional than the usual portrayals.<br /><br />Liam Nissan is s'posed to be the smart one keeping everyone alive but makes every wrong decision in the book.<br />\\"Hey guys...it's dusk...what say we wander off into the woods away from the visible-from-the-air plane wreck where we know wolves are waiting to nom our asses?\\"<br /><br />All the guys...in unison \\"CAPITAL IDEA!\\"<br /><br />You gotta side with Darwin here.<br /><br />This movie wants to be a treatise on life and death and god and nature and masculinity. Life is a non-stop 10k wiffle ball bat to the groin...accept it...face the bat to the groin head on and take it like a man, mang.<br /><br />It is pretty gory and the effects are good. Otherwise watch fight club again if you need a dose of bro-vado.
0312641893|5.0|I was super excited to read this! Ever since I've read the summary and seen the cover, I've been jumping up and down in anticipation. Having said that, I was also really worried. I was scared that it would be another Ash by Malinda Lo (if one of you have been reading my reviews, you understand how much I despise that book). You know, with the whole Cinderella re-telling thing going on.<br /><br />Well, I only have this to say; OMG!!!! I LOVE THIS BOOK I WANNA READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN! THE LUNER CHRONICALS ARE THE BEST! EVERYONE IN THE WORLD, PICK UP THIS BOOK AND BE TAKEN INTO A WORLD OF A ROBOT CINDERELLA, A HANDSOME PRINCE, A DEATHLY PLAGUE, AN EVIL MOON QUEEN AND- AND- AHHHH, I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN ITS AWSOMENESS!<br /><br />Literally, everything was perfect; the writing, the characters, the timing and the plot.<br /><br />*gasps* OH THE PLOT!<br />It was a bit predictable - I'll say that - but Cinder was so much fun! I never had so much fun reading a book since Skulduggery Pleasant (and people; that's one BIG statement)!<br /><br />The new Cinderella - Cinder - was so awesome. I connected with her immediately. The Moon Queen, oh the Moon Queen! I LOVED HER TOO! But I didn't find her `evil', per say, more `Bratty'. The Prince. Hot. Nice. Timid. In love with him? Who wouldn't be! Every time he was mentioned...*sigh lovingly*<br /><br />Conclusion: I LOVE THIS BOOK! *fangirls*<br /><br />Jezz. Reality just hit me. How am I supposed to survive without having the sequel, Scarlet? Write, Meyer, write like the wind!
030771652X|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this novel which truly crosses genres - literature/drama/thriller/mystery whodunnit. The central character develops wonderfully into the older sister she thought she was but never fully embodied until the death of her little sister forces her to face who she really is. Her wry narration also makes you smile from time to time, even while she's in the midst of a desperate search for her sister's killer.
0307594165|5.0|I read a lot, but I would rarely describe the act of reading a book as a privilege. This is one of those rare occasions: I just finished reading HOME by Toni Morrison.<br /><br />First, there seems to be some confusion as to what we should call this 147-page book, whether \\"novella\\" or \\"novelette\\" or \\"long short story.\\" HOME is none of these things. It is a short novel, and it reminds me of several other short novels that are truly \\"novels,\\" such as [[ASIN:0142000698 The Pearl (Centennial Edition)]] by John Steinbeck and Hemingway's brief masterwork, [[ASIN:0684830493 Old Man And The Sea (Scribner Classics)]]. As with those books, you can find the whole world between its slender covers.<br /><br />Some of the less enthusiastic comments here are essentially comparing HOME to Morrison's other works and finding it somehow lacking. There's just one problem with that argument: HOME isn't her other works, nor does it try to be. It is a new and strikingly different entity altogether. The best writers don't simply repeat themselves every time they sit down to work, and this is one of our best writers.<br /><br />Morrison is one of that small group of artists who consistently inspire the rest of us. Am I gushing? You bet I am. I'm a writer; not a great writer, but I do have the wit to know when I'm in the presence of greatness. If you're wondering whether ot not you should read HOME--or any of her books--the answer is yes. Absolutely. As for its brief length--well, Ms. Morrison can do more in 147 pages than most writers accomplish in \\"full-length\\" novels. This deceptively simple story of a young black man in the rural America of the 1950s has a great deal to say about the young man, his environment, war, poverty, love, family, and the world in general, then and now. And nobody could possibly say it better. Highly recommended.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|Truly a unique and memorable film. Judging this film by either anime rules or conventional Hollywood animation rules will leave it misunderstood. It has elements of both and could best be understood as a fusion of both, but then again it also seems to be an effort to shift the entire arena of 2D animation into the 3D animation level seamlessly. Beyond that the plot has more going for it than most anime of course but it still remains a character driven film at its base.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books are for only the open minded people I never once picked up any three of these books for the adult part.  Only to see why Mr. Grey was the way he was I love how the story ends.  There are parts of the book (in all 3) that I was like enough of the sex but over all I am glad I didnt listen to the negative reviews.  I just got done reading all 3 in about 2 days and I plan on re-reading them. :-)
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is great!  I used to be an avid gym rat, until I had some surgery done.  So now Im back at it, and after reading Mike's book I just realized how I was doing almost everything wrong.  This book explains everything, from workouts, diets, supplements, and so much more.  This book had more information than the hundreds of fitness magazines that I own and that I will soon be recycling.  Another great thing is that Mike actually responds to your emails, if you had any questions.  Wish I had read this book along time ago, I would have saved so much money.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|My eight week old baby has been in the hospital since birth and I miss him terribly when I can't be there. We've set up this monitor in his crib so I can always see him and he can hear my voice anytime. It's wonderful. I have been pleasantly surprised by how receptive his nurses and doctors are to having the video monitor in his crib...they love the idea. I love that I can talk to my baby even when I'm away from him. Great way to stay connected.<br /><br />The only downside is that sometimes the picture freezes or disconnects me...but usually it operates smoothly.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game iis finally here on the amazon marketplace.  its not that good. the game is unresponsive sometimes and makes me die. but overall its good
B004UID2LC|2.0|2 weeks ago this was flawless. Now it doesn't work, an update is in order. Before this happened it was easy to use and without a hitch to get started.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|Firstly, let me say that I was really looking forward to watching this, in the main I have nearly always enjoyed Spielberg's movies, but this is so sweet and sickly it should carry a health warning. I'm not usually cynical and, irrationally, I enjoy a good rom-com or movie with an element of the proposterous, however this film has more Hollywood clichés than even I can cope with, (spoiler alert),:<br />The drunken waster of a father who turns out to be a war hero.<br />The horse doing something it should never be capable of, at the very last minute, in order to help the family keep the farm.<br />The horse, along with it's 'best pal horse' somehow managing to climb into a windmill, along with the sick young girl it has given hope to, to hide from the Germans.<br />And so on, and on and on, until the horse and the young boy, (now man), that originally befriends him return home from war in a twilight scene shoot in such unnatural colours that anybody experiencing such a sky would be 'running for cover', thinking the end of the world had come.<br />Yes there are some scenes worthy of Spielberg: The cavalry attack, the battle scenes and even the barbed wire cutting, but overall, and regretfully, I can not in all honesty recommend this film unless your movie diet requires excessive syrup.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|(SPOILERS Ahead) \\"Prometheus\\" is quite an entertaining movie with stunning visuals but has a plot that will leave you stumped if you are not paying attention or do not think things through. The acting is quite entertaining. The movie, while not specifically a prequel of the \\"Alien\\" movie, definitely has elements that clearly tie it in to that movie. If you go into \\"Prometheus\\" expecting to have everything laid out for you, you will be sorely disappointed; this is not \\"Transformers\\" - expect to have to take the information given and cogitate. For example, one character, after arriving at the planet and exploring the \\"mound\\", becomes quite drunk and morose. Well, you have to realize that his dream of actually meeting one of the aliens had been dashed - what was to be his greatest achievement of his life had just been utterly destroyed. How would you respond if your dreams were dashed to pieces? Another example is David's poisoning of the aforementioned drunk. You have to listen to the conversation that occurred between them: \\"What would you do to realize your dream?\\" \\"Anything and everything\\" \\"Exactly\\" (or sentiments to that effect). Couple that with David's objectives and it becomes quite clear why he did what he did.<br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, turn to \\"Transformers\\" and other movies of that ilk. This is not one of those movies. Both \\"Transformers\\" and \\"Prometheus\\" are good movies, but for very, very different reasons. If you are looking for a movie that will make you think, and has stunning visuals to boot, this quite easily could be a movie up your alley.

B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Bossypants is mostly full of laughs, but has its serious moments as well. Sometimes I wished I could literally give Fey a high-five for her blunt honesty, like after reading \\"I Don't Care if You Like It.\\" Fey focuses on women earning respect in the workplace, urging women to \\"Do your thing and don't care if they like it.\\" Fey is as smart and opinionated as she is funny, which is evident in her success in the entertainment industry.
0345803485|1.0|I spent close to $40 for the three books in the series and am very disappointed. This is not a series about a BDSM relationship, or anything close to resembling one. This is simply a series of books about sex, and not very interesting or imaginative book, either.<br /><br />Every stereotypical thing a person who isn't familiar with the BDSM culture might believe is written about here. Why must it be that a man who is a Dominant has to have issues in his past with his mother and been abused sexually? If this is the mainstream media representation of a BDSM relationship, men will have a very hard time finding a girl who doesn't believe that tears, threats and demands will get her what she thinks she wants in the end. This is nothing more than a book about two people having what they call \\"kinky sex\\", though spanking and blindfolds really aren't that kinky. And \\"The Red Room of Pain\\"? Really?<br /><br />I kept waiting for Christian to assert his dominance and stand firm to his wants and desires, and not continually acquiesce to hers. It's actually disheartening to see a character that could have had so much potential to portray a Dominant with accuracy, weakened by him constantly conceding to Anastasia, in order to maintain any kind of relationship with her. It would have been nice to see Christian stand firm in what he wanted, and Anastasia figure out that what she really wanted was a master that stood firm, not caved to her demands. It makes you wonder what core belief philosophy the female author actually writes the story from, because it is certainly not one of male dominance.<br /><br />There was no level of suspense at all in these books. You could see everything coming pages before it happened. The repetitiveness of everything, including the sexual scenes, was boring and pointless. In my opinion, it wasn't even a good book about sex. It certainly wasn't a book about a BDSM relationship.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|This review is intended just to give some offset to all the 1-2 star reviews due to picture quality. I won't be reviewing the actualy films, so let's get to the BD.<br /><br />I don't know what these other reviewers are watching. The Jurassic Park BD is far and above any of its dvd counters. There is a thin layer of grain, more noticeable in some scenes, but it is thin, and not distracting. I honestly don't know HOW they come to the conclusion of horrible video quality here.. There are a few MINOR issues, which I noticed only a few times throughout the entire collection.<br /><br />My guess is that alot of these people simply haven't tweeked their TV sets at all, and have sharpness way up, or have their tv's set to \\"vivid\\".<br /><br />To put it simple, and hopefully help you, if you want to own these films, there is NO better version out there. PQ is great, and AQ is OUTSTANDING.<br /><br />Hope this helps you.

And they actually sound really good with a headphone amplifier, I have the Fiio E3 and it makes these headphones louder which is nice since loudness is mainly what they lack. But for the price these headphones cant be beat and I will probably buy more of Behringer products since they seem really good for the money!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|(Usually I don't bother writing reviews. In fact, I've never written one before, because I never felt terribly strongly in either direction about the product. That being said, I feel I gotta warn others about this series. )<br /><br />Everyone who told you this book (and it's sequels) is awful is right. I'm pretty sure the woman who wrote this didn't use an editor. At the very least, she ignored all of the microsoft word grammar suggestions, cause the mistakes are everywhere. I felt like I was reading an episode of Seinfeld (you know, where they use the same joke over and over again and it's supposed to get really funny again by the 30th time?) because throughout the whole trilogy the main character was CONSTANTLY referring to her 'inner goddess' and her subconscience. Except I don't think this was meant to be funny. Pretty sure Ana Steele needs some therapy for her schizophrenia, and her inner goddess probably needs to put some clothes on and get off of her divan. (Side note: did anyone else imagine a sort of I Dream of Jeannie-esque cartoon character every time the inner goddess came up?) Not to mention, it was 50 shades this and 50 shades that. I get the reference, and I get the reason Ana picked that to call him in her inner dialogue, but seriously? Couldn't think of something that flowed a little better, hmm? Every time you get part-way into the story, either she checks in with the voices in her head, or she thinks about her '50 shades' (literally her pet name for Christian) and it's like a bucket of cold water. Imagine calling your lover 50 shades (of ****ed up). It's weird. Not to mention that the characters seem to communicate in terms of smirks. I never realized how much one facial expression could say. over. and. over. and over.<br /><br />The one thing I'd like to applaud this book for is it's strange ability to get women to claim their sexuality in public, which is definitely commendable, and the only thing that differentiates this from other trashy romance/Harlequin books (which are usually somewhat better written). It's probably because it doesn't have a shirtless man about to ravage some beautiful young maid on the front cover. Alas.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say..this book is hot hot hot. So far I've read part one and part two. I have part three but I know once I read it the series is over. THis is a great read and is worth the money.

B0051CSIKQ|4.0|First off, don't let that awful title throw you, this is not some sophomoric teen vampire comedy. The storyline resembles the Woody Harrelson-Jesse Eisenberg flick ZOMBIELAND, but this is no comedy. The story is told with the just right straight forwardness to be an acceptable piece of goey pulp goodness. This is the sort of horror film that George Romero or John Carpenter might have made in their best years.<br /><br />Set in a post apocalyptic future, after vampires have taken over most of the world, and human, cannibals and scavengers compete for the rest. Focusing more on character and their story than just gore or violence. This is a cool low budget horror opus co-produced by Larry Fessenden, a sort of modern day Val Lewton. Getting some good performances from the likes of horror hottie Danielle Harris, 80's movie star Kelly McGillis, and a scene stealing, should be a star making performance from Nick Damici in the central bad a** role. Damici, who also co-wrote the screenplay with director Jim Mickle, makes me think of a cross between 70's action star Warren Oates and Fred Ward. The dialogue is at times a bit wobbly, and the narration is often pointless and pretentious. Still, this is a welcome return for a genre that in recent years has suffered quite a bit of diminishing returns. It's worth it.

B004GJYR7I|5.0|86us Bringing up Baby by Howard Hawks (1938, 102')<br /><br />Bringing Up Baby (1938) is an American screwball comedy film directed by Howard Hawks, starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The movie tells the story of a paleontologist winding up in various predicaments involving a woman with a unique sense of logic and a leopard named \\"Baby\\". The supporting cast includes Charles Ruggles, Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Catlett, and May Robson.<br /><br />The screenplay was adapted by Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde from a short story by Wilde that originally appeared in Collier's Weekly magazine on April 10, 1937.  Bringing Up Baby has been adapted several different times. Hawks himself recycled the nightclub scene in which Hepburn's dress is torn and Grant walks behind her in his 1964 comedy Man's Favorite Sport. Peter Bogdanovich's 1972 film What's Up, Doc?, starring Barbra Streisand, was intended as an homage to the movie.<br /><br />(This text is edited and abriged from Wikipedia material - RC)<br /><br />Neither Hawks' adaptations/recycling nor Bogdanovich's homage equal Katharine Hepburn's performance  - speed and wit - in the movie. It has not aged; stick to it!<br /><br />86us Bringing up Baby - 15 June 2012

0061438294|5.0|The product arrived on time and was well worth the price.<br />The author explains everything well and the illustrations proved to be excellent.
0199233381|3.0|While reading this book I went through excitement at first, to boredom second, and finally to annoyance that the book would not end already. Considering that it is an extremely short book that could easily be read in one day, that is not saying much for it.<br /><br />I am not sure who the target audience of this book is. If I had to guess, it is for people with a mild interest in Greek history, but who don't really have the time or desire to dig to deeply into it, and who might choose to read while on an airplane, or on the subway, or something like that where they have little choice but to sit still for a while.<br /><br />I am not a fan of Dr. Cartledge's writing style. I have read his book on the Spartans, and his biography of Alexander the Great (which I am reading for a class), and it is fairly consistent from book to book. It usually has long sentences that seem to run on, full of strange place names or obscure people. He also tends to go on tangents a lot. For example, his chapter on Alexandria was talking about the assassination of Philip, the Seleucids, the Battle of Cannae, and finally ended with the stoning of Hypatia. There was some Alexandria in there, but not much.<br /><br />On the positive side, the organization of the book is chronological, from pre-history, to Archaic, to Classical, to Hellenistic, and he does this by highlighting the cities that were in ascendance during these particular time periods. Also, there are a few interesting facts or bits of knowledge that even veterans might gain. For example, I always thought Miletus was an island, but it turns out it is actually on the mainland of Asia Minor.<br /><br />I guess its good that people do write these introductory level books, so that everybody has access to the ancient Greeks.
B0053R3J7G|5.0|This Lego set is pretty big. At first I thought it was expensive for the price, but it comes with a lot of stuff. It has a car, a barbacue, a fireplace, tons of inside room to place whatever furnishings inside the house, a roof that comes off and opens on 2 sides. I purchased it on Lego Shop at Home because it was cheaper there. I think it was $69.99. There are also a lot of pieces in this set so you pay for that in the price. Overall, this build has a good educational value. You have the option of building 3 different models. I would recommend buying it before it goes out of season and becomes expensive. Legos seem to jump in price after a year of being out.

B007HO392S|3.0|There is no doubt that Carrie Underwood  can sing; her first album was arguably one of the best Country albums of the previous decade.<br />Her rendition of \\"I told you so\\" is one of the most perfectly sung/recorded songs in many years. The problem is, with each successive album she has moved further and further from her country roots. While Carrie is certainly capable of singing a rock anthem, and more up tempo songs like \\" Don't even know my last name \\" and \\"Before he cheats\\" She is at her very best when conveying strong emotions. (\\"why did you have to leave me\\" , \\"Jesus take the wheel\\" and  the aforementioned \\"before he cheats\\" to name a few) And that is what is missing on this album there really isn't a single memorable song on this album. While the songs are sung well they are no better or worse then a thousand other well known artist could do, and Carrie Underwood is capable of so much better than that. In short she needs to fire her manager, take a sabbatical, clear her head, regroup and return to her old self; and maybe spend a little less time in Hollywood.
0307730697|5.0|This is a story about a man who made mistakes.  A man who loved his family. A man who time and time again would do the best he could despite his failures.  Based on the life of Adam Brown, who becomes a Navy SEAL, this story will inspire you, make you laugh and cry.<br /><br />The story begins with Adams parents and ends with the continued impact Adam had on the people he came into contact with.  It wasn't Adam's fearlessness that made the book for me.  It was his love for others.  He saw a need and took care of it when he could, even to the point of getting shoes for kids in another country because he saw they were barefoot in the cold.  Was he perfect? no.  But, he is an inspiration.<br /><br />Author Eric Blehm writes in a way that makes the reader feel like you are there.  He uses descriptive detail without over using it.  The information he gathered makes the story come to life, and is put together for an easy read.  I believe for an author to do a biography is a huge challenge, and Eric did an excellent job!<br /><br />This isn't just Adam Brown's story.  It's his wife's, Kelley Brown, his children's, his parents. It's also the story of the men who were his friends and those who served with him.  It is my opinion that this story will take you on a journey of a man who was not perfect, who made mistakes, who loved people, who had a passion we should all want, who loved his family (including his extended SEAL family) and did what he needed to do to get things done.  His story will share with you his ultimate hope, one he placed in Jesus Christ. We need to hear about the heroes, thank you Eric for your ability to not just gather information, but your ability to put it together in an incredible book.<br /><br />**Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes.

1594744769|5.0|Shaunta's Review:<br /><br />I have a confession to make. Sometimes, I judge a book by its cover.<br /><br />Shocking, right?<br /><br />The cover of Ransom Rigg's bookMiss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is incredible. Not only that, but the whole book is filled with great, creepy old photographs that tie into the story and make it a fabulous multi-media experience.<br /><br />I admit that based on the blurb and the cover, I expected something scary or at least thrilling. Instead, this was a great fantasy story about family (the one your born in and the one you make yourself) and the aftermath of war. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is fun. There's a little mystery, the parts that are scary have to do with World War II and Nazis, and it ties the past with the present in a beautiful way.<br /><br />What I loved:<br /><br />Reading this book was like going along with Jacob and his father to Wales, to explore the ruins of an old school and find out about his grandfather. I adored the photographs as a whole, and found myself going back to look at them even after I finished reading the book. The tone of the book is slightly fantastical, which makes me more than slightly happy.<br /><br />What I didn't love:<br /><br />My only complaint about the book is that occasionally it felt as though the author sacrificed the story to fit in the pictures. I would have loved for the book to either give itself up entirely to the whimsy of the photographs, or go all out on the scary stuff.<br /><br />Grade: This book gets an A- from me. Almost perfect.<br /><br />(This book was provided by the publisher for review. The opinions are my own. I am half of the Story Carnivores book blog. Come by and say hi!)

But i honestly think this like any other movie out there is either a hit or miss. Some people like it and some dont. You cant judge it before you see it tho! I loved it so much i saw it twice, and i might go see it again. I know im going to see it when it hits the dollar movies with my friend. I went to see the movie because Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp are in it. I am a huge Helena Bonham Carter fan and i absolutely loved her as Dr. Hoffman. So over all i suppose what im saying is I LOVED it. I cant wait for it to come out on DVD.
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is an incredibly well-written and original page-turner, one of the best I've read in a long time and one that haunts your thoughts long after you finish it. It begs to be read carefully since every word is used precisely and the descriptions articulate truths that will resonate with the reader. It is impossible to put down and each chapter ends with material that forces the pages to turn. I liked the ending and thought it fit the novel's themes and characters, but even if you don't, the experience of reading it is worth the price. Be warned: there is a fair amount of \\"R rated\\" material and language; it's not a novel for those who are offended by profanity.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I'm a big Liam Neeson fan but man, this movie was horrible. I expected an action flick but was stuck instead with something closer to a psychological thriller. Everything about the wolves threw me off. They didn't have a single realistic action. The ending provided no sense of completion. I didn't fall in love with the characters until the end of the film and by then it was just depressing to watch, knowing what would inevitably happen. I have never had to say this before today- I want my two hours back.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre has produced a beautiful and thought provoking film. I found Prometheus to be one of the summers best and one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have seen. The cast delivers superb performances especially in the cases of Fassabender and Rapace. Scott has delivered stunning visuals, and has created a believable universe that is rich in mythology. I would warn viewers to not expect an Alien movie. This film while a prequel is it's own self contained story and only subtle hints at the events of Alien. I believe many were expecting a straight forward prequel and the lack of connections to Alien is one of the primary reasons for all the negative reviews of the film. To be fair, while the film is a great movie, it is not perfect. The film suffers from obvious cuts to the story and these are most prevalent during the film's third act. I am hopeful that the extended cut that will be released on DVD  will help to answer many of the films unanswered questions. Despite the film's flaws Scott delivers a stunning and dark world that fits comfortably in with the Alien Saga. I hope Scott returns to do the promised sequel.

0345803485|4.0|I had to get my hands on this book as soon as I read Ian Somerhalder mention playing the role of Christian Grey. This book started out very strong plot wise but somehow unraveled and never really reached its full potential. Though at times the writing can get tedious (how many times is Ana Steele going to 'hitch her breath' or mention her 'inner goddess'??), I stuck with it, completely intrigued and totally captivated by Christian Grey. If you take this book for what it is, it's a fun read that explores the fantasy of getting swept away by an insanely rich, beautiful, possessive, sex crazed, dominant billionaire. If you are looking for a book with more substance (erotic or otherwise), better look elsewhere. With so much buzz around a 50 Shades movie, this is one of those rare cases where I think the movie might actually be better than the book. All that said, you bet I bought the rest of the trilogy. Christian Grey is like crack. :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok - so we are not talking about a book that's bound to become a literary classic.  However, if you read it for what it is, it's an enjoyable book.  I picked it up after hearing all the media hype about it and the \\"mommy-porn\\" title it was given.  I wasn't disappointed.  It wasn't the sex that drew me in, it was the characters.  Many women will not admit it, but on some level, we can all relate to Ana and that stage in our life where we feel clumsy, insecure, inadequate.  With Christian, it is extreme that at 26 he's a billionaire, pilot, sailor, pianist, etc.  It was his control-freak gone mad that I liked.  It was attractive for me, it was sexy as hell.  I look at my husband who is quite the mama's boy and I wish he'd be more forceful like the character, in bed and out of bed.  I found myself wishing my husband would say \\"Laters, baby\\" or tie me up during sex.  I can see how it has spiced up marriages and relationships.  Don't read it if you are expecting literary greatness.  Read it if you can tune in to the characters and the underlying story of Christian and why he is the way he is.  I've read all 3 books repeatedly and continue to find it enjoyable & can't wait for the movie to come out!
0062060554|1.0|This book was horrible.  The premise was tired, the plot development was forced, and the ending was insane.  Some of my book club friends thought it was predictable.

I am shocked that anybody thought this was riveting.

B002RKSZKI|2.0|I think this is the worst Jane Autsten book I have read.  I had to force myself to finish it and was very tired of it by the end.  The diologe is long and boring.  I won't read Emma again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Unfortunately I saw most of the movie first, so getting into this book was a slight challenge. I am on the last book of the trilogy now...I am AMAZED that these books are as stunning as they are. Thoroughly impressed!
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|Whomever is hating on this film is completely missing out. This movie is funny, fun to watch and precisely what my wife and I needed for our movie night. What more could you want from the \\"Wet Hot American Summer\\" creator? We loved it! The only thing I thought, was when Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter and Wain himself have little cameos ... I missed Stella and wanted the three to be a bigger part of the film! Hopefully there will be future Wain projects that include them more thoroughly. I will not spoil any plot points here, but needless to say, I watch a lot of the films that come out each year and was quite happy with this one, one of the best of the year!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book.  While parts of it were sad, the dog's perspective made it very interesting.  An easy read.  Not too long

1612130283|1.0|The erotic scenes are okay the first time, maybe the second time, but after that it's just BORING! This is not a well-written book. If you insist on reading it, know up front it is NOT believable. No character development to speak of for either Ana or Christian. And I have to agree with all the reviewers who complained about overuse of words and phrases - Christian's \\"hot,\\" Ana bites her lower lip every fifteen seconds driving Christian mad with desire, the way his trousers hang on his hips, etc. ad nauseum.<br />More importantly, one has to totally suspend belief that a 21 year old virgin would get involved with a BDSM freak. And the author in no way explains why Christian turned out this way. OR why a reasonably normal 21 year old femaie is not only a virgin in this day and time, but has never \\"touched\\" herself. Oh, please...<br />And suspend all belief that Christian, with his Dominant nature, would turn even a LITTLE soft under Ana's influence. I think not. Then he reverts to character at the end, and Ana is distraught beyond words.<br />The book has no depth, no believable plot, and no believable characters.<br />At least one other reviewer commented that he or she had researched the author, as the book appeared to have been written by a teenager. Can't agree more. If I have to read one more comment from Ana's subconscious, or her inner goddess, I think I will SCREAM!<br />Trite, predictable, and a sad comment on our society that this book is selling so well. What have we come to?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its awesome. my girls love the game. they ask to play it all the time and have told their friends about it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am sorry ladies, but I think these books are terrible. I read nightly and all kinds of genres and the literary aspect of these books is terrible. Single words are overly used and then lose emphasis in repetition and the story line constantly stalls and falls flat. in addition, too much of the book is told to us instead of in a sensory way allowing us to feel what the character sees and feels. If you're lookin for romance try Lauren Wittig's scottish novels like Charming the Shrew instead!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|fast paced read. very exciting. a great ending to the best trilogy out there.Suzanne Collins' writing style lets you get inside Katniss's mind and really feel a part of the story
B007I2BZIE|1.0|After loads of scathing remarks that followed my first review, I decided to take that one down, listen to the album for a couple weeks straight, and come back with something that was hopefully more balanced.  Here it is.<br /><br />You would think Rush would be the natural candidate for creating a concept album, right?  I mean, they had 2112 and Hemispheres that were almost there.  The concepts on each of those albums were vivid, the lyrics pointed and musical, and the playing was out of this world.  Take the first \\"side\\" of Hemispheres, for instance.  THAT is how you do a concept album.  The entire thing tells a story from start to finish.  There are themes, variations on themes, returns to those themes, memorable lyrics and melodies, signature guitar riffs, solos that add to the song and are memorable, rhythm grooves, and well placed drum fills.  You don't need to refer to liner notes or worse, a novelization, to grasp the story.  On Clockwork Angels, you have almost none of these elements.  Each song is an island, and yet they are supposed to be part of a bigger story.  They just don't tie together to paint a musical picture of this steampunk universe that Peart has created.<br /><br />The lyrics might be okay as prose, but for song?  On some songs it would seem that Geddy was handed a lyric sheet right before he went into the vocal booth and told to just wing it with the melody...because many times there just isn't one.  One also gets the sense that a lot of the songs are in the same key.  Either because it was done purposely to give a sense of the mood of the characters in the story, because they ran out of ideas, because Alex loves playing open strings, or because Geddy's vocal range is shot.  Might be a little of each.<br /><br />Drum work was directed by the producer by waving a drum stick like a baton to conduct Peart through the parts.  Peart actually praised this method of drum composition on the fly because it freed him from repetition (ahem...grooves) and having to think about the parts.  This just tells me that Peart is bored with playing drums altogether.  He's obviously one of the best players on the planet and he's run out of influences.  So he lets himself become a marionette of some young producer who obviously really digs tribal rhythms on the toms.  On the rare song on the record that has some kind of extended groove, it soon breaks down into yet another tribal rhythm.  Neil or Nick obviously love that.  Compare and contrast the drum work on CA to that of Hemispheres:  random tribal nonsense with an occasional groove, or tight grooves with amazing, well-placed fills.<br /><br />The guitar work, which I was very much looking forward to hearing, is just okay.  Well played, for sure, and good tone, but hardly a memorable riff to be found.  The closest we get to riff-oriented guitar rock is \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\", and even then it's not some inspired riffing.  It is forgettable.  The solos?  Too few, too far between, and too forgettable.  They don't serve the song, aren't melodic, you can't sing them in your head.  Alex has cut some VERY memorable solos in this time.  Even the non-melodic ones are still quite memorable.  Nothing on this record, though.<br /><br />It was suggested by many that I go back and listen to the album over and over and that eventually, I'd come to appreciate it.  I even set aside time to listen to it with headphones and no distractions.  Dedicated listening time on good equipment.  Does listening over and over until I like it just mean that I'm such a big fan that I am forcing myself to like the record?  Yep, probably.  Would I have done this for any other band?  Nope.  Repeated listening only served to strengthen my original opinions.  This is a highly forgettable album from Rush, and it pains me to say that.  I really like Terry Brown era Rush, up to and including most of Signals.  But I also do like their stuff from the mid 80's, the 90's \\"return to roots\\" and even the stuff from the 2000's.  But this Nick Raskulinecz guy...he has got to go.  He's an admitted fan and far too attached to the band to say no to them.  That's not what they need in a producer.  They need Terry Brown or someone like him.<br /><br />The composition, mixing, and mastering I lay at the feet of Nick.  He owns that disaster.  There is no light and dark (save on \\"The Garden\\"), no open spaces.  It is a constant, heavily compressed, overly loudness mastered, sonic assault on the eardrums that leaves one fatigued after a short time of listening.  He really needed to arrange these songs to let them breath.  Silence is golden in the right places.  Nick is of the school of modern rock and metal, though, and he obviously enjoys overly compressed, loud music.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Forgettable.  Like two songs better than the others: BU2B and Seven Cities of Gold.  The rest I wouldn't care if I ever heard them again.
B005TPCQ5I|3.0|Well, this film is portraying a tragic love story that is frankly boring at some parts and quite depressive. You should know how this film is gonna end whenever anyone says it's \\"depressing\\". Basically, it's about two young souls meeting each other over the course of 20 years before finally realizing they *belong* to each other. Oops, sorry what I meant to say is that they *know* they belong to each other but for some stupid reasons like family, background, career and well substance abuse as well as separate pathways in life they never fully do so and waste a lot of time and when they actually do it's too late.<br /><br />If there was one moral to this story I would say that, if you found someone who you think is perfect for you, someone who you think understands you better than anyone else, someone you can talk to whenever you're feeling blue or suffering from problems, someone whom you have strong emotions for that can make you go crazy or wild or whatever and they feel the same way about you. If you truly love them, you've been with a lot of people but no one made you feel the same way and if they've been in relationships and still think you're the one for them, If the feeling is mutual and the obstacles that are getting in your way of being together are *not* that ultimate. Then why wait? Why go back and forth? why waste time? You never know when are you going to die or when are they going to die. So, wouldn't you want to spend time with them while you still can? Evey day is a blessing and it can also be the last day for you. Life is just too short to beat around the bushes especially in love, so if you made the mistake of letting this person go and your feelings for them and their feelings for you haven't changed there's no reason to hold back.<br /><br />Well, other than that the acting was good. The movie reminded me of Atonement except it was a lesser version in my opinion. If you don't like sad/too realistic for life romances then this movie is not for you. If you're a fan of the happily ever after idea then just skip this. However, this movie portrays a mistake I'm sure some of us have done in life you know when you had that perfect partner next to you and you just made them go and now you're thinking what the hell was I thinking?If you're a fan of the happily ever after idea then just skip this.

B0054R6BFM|4.0|My daughter liked this book from the first chapter and asked if I would read it too. once I started, I found it hard to put down. Suicide is such a difficult topic to discuss, this book gives an opening to communicating with our teenagers about the topic. Although many of Hannah's reasons seem minimal and her attitude more of anger, I feel Jay Asher got the point accross that our choices can affect people more than we know. he also makes it clear that Hannahs choice was still her own and she had better options she could have taken. Great story overall to open discussion on a very tender topic.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels holds some of the finest songwriting I've heard from Rush in a long time.  I don't know if working on the material while touring allowed them to spend extra time refining it, but it sounds like they've really made an effort to break outside their comfort zone.  This is pretty progressive stuff for a Rush album, and for this 20-year Rush fan Clockwork Angels is an instant favorite.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is amazing even though it lags when your battery is running lowing would recommend this app to anyone and everyone
0345803507|5.0|What much else is there to say besides this book is incredible.  Most shy away because of the BDSM description on the back of these books, however, this is nowhere near as bad as what I thought it was going to be.  It was tasteful and between two consenting individuals.  The 3rd book obviously still has a lot of sex, but it really gets the reader more into Christian and Ana's relationship.  This whole trilogy has been fantastic and I finsihed it very quick.  E.L. James really has a way of getting you to connect and become attached to the characters.  I found myself mad, shocked, happy.. I laughed and I cried and I shouted at several times throughout this book.  I pretty much cried throughout the whole epilogue at the end of book 3, I just couldn't help it.  I loved this trilogy and thus far, hands down the best books I've ever read. They're in a league all their own.
B0055PGUYU|1.0|A political book disguised has a book on people and business. Instead of research backed by fact it is a paradigm backed by selective editng. A cynical, political, manipulative quote from Raham Emanual used to force a unpopular liberal agenda down the throat of a unwilling American public is actually turned into a virtue by the author. A liberal agenda that has proven to be disaster worse than original problem. Cowardly Using Paul Oneal's quotes to take shots at George Bush or actually suggesting fixing out of touch beauracys with with more bloated out of touch beauracys the objective is clearly guided by idealolgy not fact or insight.
1612130283|1.0|I bought the book motivated by Dr. Oz' comments  in his show.  The book is just 527 pages of a couple, Mr. Gray the \\"dominat\\"and her \\"submissive\\" Anastasia,having some encounters,under his rules,being spanked, disgusted and she always satisfied even under the most inconsiderate way OF HAVING INTERCOURSE because they clearly spelled out that they F.. they do not make love. Very rude way to treat any woman. You will have to put up with this from cover to cover.Do not waste your time.I was always waiting for it to get better but like a bad movie it never did!
0670023329|4.0|The book describes a truly awful existence at the very bottom of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, where it was necessary to cheat, steal, and betray just for an extra scrap of food in a system where every single rule seemed to be enforced by being threatened to be shot to death. The interesting thing was that Shin and his fellow prisoners hadn't even needed to have been indoctrinated as the rest of his countrymen; he was literally in, or more exactly out of the way, from birth to death. The story is told dryly; the author tells the facts but never seems to get into the mind of his subject, and, despite having lived so closeted all his life, Shin mysteriously deals remarkably well with his escape and dealing with all that he has to encounter. The most striking part of the book is when he gets rescued after some wandering in China and the well-organised welcoming apparatus of the state of South Korea takes care of him. This all takes place in a country (South Korea) where its inhabitants are so busy getting on with their lives that they don't really care. And then, when you have convinced yourself that despite all that, Shin has been given a future, you find that, like so many of his escaped compatriots, he is quite incapable of holding anything down.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I couldn't put this one down.  The sweet agony of Abby and Travis' relationship was exciting, heart-breaking, and oh so good!
B007IX383I|5.0|I never really followed Anathema, although I did really like A Natural Disaster, and I thought We're Here Because We're Here was OK.  Thus, I was a little skeptical about this one when I heard about it, but I decided to preorder the vinyl anyways.<br /><br />Best decision I've made in awhile.<br /><br />Weather Systems is diverse and interesting, and it contains no shortage of great melodies and  interesting musical passages.  It is delicate and heartwarming, yet there are parts that get you tapping along with the music.<br /><br />The whole album is solid, but the highlights, for me, are The Gathering of the Clouds and Lightning Song (which feel like two parts of one song), and the 2nd half of The Storm Before the Calm.<br /><br />I enjoyed this so much that I decided to get a copy of the 5.1 DVD/CD edition (so I have copies for my record player, my Jeep, and my surround sound system).  The surround sound mix is crisp, and really brings out some of the more subtle instrumental and vocal lines (check out, for example, the layered vocals in The Gathering of the Clouds).  I heard things I didn't know were there, even after listening a half dozen or so times.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|The movie wasn't as action packed as I thought it would be, but it was pretty interesting, well shot and over all pretty good.
B00772M1F6|5.0|Listen to this album and you'll hear tunes that make you think of Little Richard or Gene Vincent or other roots rockers - maybe even Ike Turner or other early R&B groups. The music is basic and mostly 3-chord simple but appealing and easy to like. If you're a fan of 1950's rock 'n' roll this new music will restore your confidence in the ability of youngsters to carry on a great tradition of rock's pioneers. J.D. writes most of his own music and plays a decent guitar. If you get a chance to see the band live they create great excitement with their audience. All the cuts are good, no clunkers or fillers. Get this and dig it!
B0080CL0HM|5.0|With any book to movie translation, there is a chance that material will get lost or that actors involved will fail to capture the essence of particular characters. However, I am pleased to say that Bel Ami exceeded my expectations of seeing the classic novel brought to life onscreen. Although it would make for a more interesting movie experience if viewers have read the novel before-hand, the movie does an adequate job of portraying the scheming, manipulative, womanizing Duroy in his quest for money and status.<br /><br />Following roles in movies such as the Twilight Saga, Water for Elephants, and the highly underappreciated Remember Me, Robert Pattinson proves once again that he can take his place among the talented actors on the screen today. His ability to make you feel sympathetic for such a roguish character are to be commended.<br /><br />In addition to Pattinson's outstanding performance, the acting prowess of the women involved in this film are not to be ignored. Uma Thurman, Christina Ricci, and Kristen Scott Thomas do an impressive job bringing each of their characters to life as well.<br /><br />Also not be ignored is the spectacular setting, brought to life by the props, costume design, and music included in the film.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie, and I think it is a shame that it has gotten so little publicity.

0307454894|4.0|It's rare that you come across a book that you can't put down.  I actually read The Reader in a day, which while not impossible, is pretty impressive considering how inconsistent I am as a reader.  Some books will take me months to get through while I fly through others.<br /><br />The Reader tells the story of Michael Berg, a young teenage boy who falls in love with a mysterious older woman.  After a brief time they become lovers and he reads to her all kinds of stories of fiction, non-fiction and the like.  One day she disappears with barely a trace and a few years later he finds her again, only this time she is on trial for war crimes as a Nazi SS guard at a satellite concentration camp to Auschwitz.  This conflict of passion and guilt manifests itself into a life long journey for young Michael and his struggle to find meaning in post war Germany.<br /><br />The writing, and English translation I should say, is superb in it's bare bones style.  Very minimal and to the point, which seems to my mind as a common trait among Germans, especially apparent in their arts.  The story is engrossing and I was caught up in the immediacy of the longings of sexual awareness, as it was described very lucidly in the first half of the story.  While I don't particularly prescribe to works of eroticism, this was very intriguing and effective in elucidating those desires in a suggestive yet powerful way.<br /><br />The one thing that I felt was hard to get over at times was the sense that Michael and Hanna both in their own ways seem quite selfish.  But again, as I've gotten older I've come to appreciate stories in which the lead characters aren't perfect and have traits that I don't admire in human nature.  Most protagonists tend to be ideal in nature in the sense that when we are reading, we are imagining ourselves as that character, but in this case, and the case with many books I have read as I get older, is that it lent itself to the mood of the story.  There is a sense of finality and curt resolution to the tale, as evidenced by the short chapters, each rarely more than five pages at most.  There are also so many areas that also question the tone of morality and what deserves forgiveness or what deserves damnation.  But the tone of the book doesn't seem to want to give defined answers as black and white, and like life is full of gray areas.  A worthwhile read, and a complex tale of love and passion, not only romantic, but of a love for literature and the joys and burdens of reading.lity and curt resolution to the tale, as evidenced by the short chapters, each rarely more than five pages at most.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Canadian progressive rock masters Rush's newest, and 20th studio, album Clockwork Angels is a MUST OWN!<br />Following the superb 2007 album Snakes and Arrows album and its off-shoot tour which came out as a live album and subsequently DVD in 2008, Canada's pre-eminent progressive hard rock trio Rush (singer/bass player Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer/lyricist Neil Peart) took some time off to recharge the batteries through 2009 and also Neil Peart became a proud father again in 2009 to daughter Olivia (his first child with current wife Carrie Nuttal and sort of closure on the heartache and trauma that he went through in the late 1990s). Then the band got to work on Clockwork Angels in spring 2010 and the first inklings of the Clockwork Angels album were the two great rockers \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\" which came out as a download only single and limited run 45 and limited run CD single. Then the members of Rush took a break from recording to embark on the Time Machine Tour which the band premiered these two new killer rockers and also play the Moving Pictures album live and basically honor the band's longevity and also giving glimpses into the future for what Rush would unleash once the Time Machine Tour would end. Also the band's documentary film Beyond the Lighted Stage came out as well. Once the Time Machine tour and off-shoot live DVD and CD was taken care of and finished, Rush plus producer Nick Raskulinecz and engineer Richard Chycki got together to finish recording Clockwork Angels. If I thought Snakes and Arrows was a great album, this album tops it!<br />We kick off with the aforementioned \\"Caravan\\" which is about travel and moving and here it is remixed than what appeared as a single in 2010. Next is the also aforementioned \\"BU2B\\" (a/k/a \\"Brought Up To Believe\\") this time featuring an acoustic intro which sets the mood before rocking out and this too was remixed for Clockwork Angels. The song is just rocking. Next is the title cut which speaks about one flying through time, space, life, over cities and people and the freedom to simply go and soar higher and higher. This epic is another great rocker. Neil's drumming starts \\"The Anarchist\\" (which is preceded by \\"The Pedular 1\\") is another brilliant straightforward rocker of a song with brilliant lyrics. \\"Carnies\\" is next and is a rocker about falling into the magical secretive world of the carnival, with its deceptive lights and \\"demon music and gypsy queens\\". \\"Halo Effect\\" begins with an excellent acoustic guitar riff which then goes into a mid tempo rocker which is almost a love song in tempo but is lyrically far from it.<br />Then the second half kicks off with \\"Seven Cities Of Gold\\" which begins with a stellar Neil and Geddy interplay before Alex's guitar lets loose for another brilliant rocker. Then we have \\"The Wreckers\\" which almost sounds like a cross between U2 and \\"Warning\\" by Green Day but a nice breather from the heavy rock this album has given us so far. Next is the album's first proper single \\"Headlong Flight\\" which is an over seven-minute monster of a rocker. This track was lyrically inspired by Neil's late drum teacher the late Freddie Gruber's quote to Neil before his passing of \\"I had a great life and I'd love to do it all again\\". We then have \\"The Pedular 2\\" which then gives way to \\"BU2B2\\" (a/k/a \\"Brought Up To Believe Too\\") which is a reprise of sorts of its older brother but affective. Next is the beautiful and affective mid tempo rocker \\"Wish Them Well\\" which lyrically states that there are better places to go, be, people to see and know, jobs to take and a positive song. We close with the best album closer Rush has ever made \\"The Garden\\". This seven minute epic is basically Rush's way of saying \\"Hey! it's okay to dream and to forget the negatives. Hope is there, and forever waits for the right person to take flight again\\". The orchestrations here are haunting and one of my favorite Alex Lifeson guitar solos (the solos on this album has Alex playing with a fire not seen since Signals in my view).<br />On a sad note, in addition to Neil Peart's drum teacher Freddie Gruber passing away, the band's longtime personal photographer Andrew MacNaughtan also passed away just exactly two days after taking the photo of the band that appears on the inner digipak sleeve on this CD (and strangely enough his death happened to be on the day after my birthday). This album is dedicated to the memories of both Gruber and Macnaughtan.<br />Also, Hugh Syme's artwork alludes to Rush's classic 1976 masterwork 2112 with the clock stationed at 21:12.<br />Clockwork Angels is Rush's best album since Signals in my view and I say BUY IT NOW!<br />RECOMMENDED!lex playing with a fire not seen since Signals in my view).<br />On a sad note, in addition to Neil Peart's drum teacher Freddie Gruber passing away, the band's longtime personal photographer Andrew MacNaughtan also passed away just exactly two days after taking the photo of the band that appears on the inner digipak sleeve on this CD (and strangely enough his death happened to be on the day after my birthday).

Each day, I would see more & more reviews about this amazing book and finally found the time to read it. I was very impressed!<br /><br />The pacing in the book refects how the main character sees her life. It starts off at a slower pace and ends up racing towards the end - without leaving the reader thinking \\"Huh? What did I miss?\\"<br /><br />The world that the author creates blends in seamlessly with our own so that after finishing the reader will notice something in their own back yard and think, \\"Maybe.\\"<br /><br />The best compliment, I can give is that after I finished the Forever Girl, I read another book and still found myself 3 days later thinking of Rebecca's work.<br /><br />Well done!

His actions on his final mission were indicative of the way he lived his life. Fearless.\\" Adam's CO in Afghanistan<br /><br />Eric Blehm keeps the pacing of Adam's story moving. He does not linger too long in any one place.  He is honest about Adam's life. Early on he seems bigger than life, as the qualities that made him a Navy Seal reveal themselves in his childhood. He was tough, relentless and kind-hearted. Adam stuck up for the little guy.<br /><br />But, like many, he needed direction. Soon after graduating from high school, a dating relationship would lead him down a bad road that would long outlast that bad relationship. She would introduce him to drugs, including crack. This is the drug that nearly cost him everything.<br /><br />Adam's story is about 2nd and 3rd chances. After a few arrests, time at Teen Challenge and yet still struggling with addiction he decides he needs to enter the Navy with a long term goal of becoming a Navy Seal. It is then that someone takes a chance on him- Captain Buschmann, the father of one of his best friends.<br /><br />It is the story of love, perseverance and faith. His parents, siblings and wife struggled to love him because of his addiction. It never completely went away. Like most addictions, it re-surfaced at inopportune moments.<br /><br />Not only did they have to persevere with Adam, but Adam had to persevere through numerous injuries that would have forced a lesser man to give up. He had a high pain threshold, to say the least. Being a Sealtakes a tremendous toll on your body due to the physical conditioning necessary (at one point he had a 4 inch long bone chip removed from his ankles, and should have had the bones fused). He would suffer freak injuries to his right eye and hand that should have resulted in him being washed out to the Seals. But he learned to shoot left-handed and passed the training and tests to join the elite Team Six despite them. He was prone to accidents as well. He could have (should have?) taken disability long before his final deployment. But that just didn't fit who Adam was.<br /><br />In his youth his grandmother would bring Adam and his twin sister to church since he parents didn't go to church. He prayed that God would save them. He would bring them to saving faith, and the means was Adam's destructive addiction to crack. Broken, Adam would eventually reaffirm his own faith in Christ. He was not a Bible-thumper, but loved the men he worked with and invited many of them to church. After Adam's own death on a mission, one of his best friends came to faith. Six weeks later, that Seal was with the others on the CH-47 that crashed.<br /><br />  \\"Are we going to abandon our faith, or apply our faith?\\" Adam's father Larry Brown<br /><br />Blehm tells a very engaging story about a unique sort of man. Passionate in his love for his country, an expert in warfare, Adam was also a goofy dad who loved to play with kids at church and while in the field. Seeing Afghan children without shoes and winter approaching, he started a drive that provided over 500 shoes for children. His was not a merely intellectual faith.<br /><br />The book is understandably short on mission details. Most of his work is still classified. But the book relays lots of information about the final mission that took his life. It was his last deployment. He'd just received his bachelor's degree and hoped to get an MBA. He was ready to settle in at home with Kelly and the kids. His death rocked the faith of his whole family, which is understandable. Their faith didn't present them easy answers. They struggled.<br /><br />Mild Cautions-<br /><br />First, there are aspects to their faith that come across as more superstitious than biblical. I'm not saying they aren't Christians, I think they are. But the idea that someone is \\"with you\\" or \\"present\\" after death is contrary to Scripture. Christians are in the presence of Jesus and did not suddenly become ubiquitous.<br /><br />Second, since it deals with military culture there is some off-color language and experiences that most non-military people like myself don't get. For instance, he takes a bet to place his scrotum (Blehm used the more common slang term) on a fire ant hill for 30 seconds. Having been bitten by fire ants often, I'm not putting the most sensitive part of my body on a hill to be attacked.  Especially as my friends watch, or hold me down.<br /><br />There was much to like about this book. I've read other books by and about the Seals and Delta Force. This was up there with Marcus Luttrell's Lone Survivor. You get a glimpse into the training and personal lives, shaping influences and more. You are left with a deep appreciation for the work they do for the other citizens of the country they love.<br /><br />[I received a promotional copy of this book from the publisher for the purposes of review]
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I love David Baldacci and have read all of his books. This one was one of the best!  I absolutely love it--could not put it down. He keeps you in suspense throughout the book and your mind is racing to think what will come next, but whatever you're thinking--it's wrong.  He will surprise you with the endings.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Awful I tried to use it in church and you need wifi I love the app Bible.is is very much better and isn't as confusing as this app!!! :/
B007U1FEJE|5.0|With Brian Wilson playing a more prominent role in the group than he has in a long time, That's Why God Made The Radio is probably the most significant Beach Boys album in 40 years.  Brian Wilson and Mike Love's writing and production are excellent.  The familiar themes of summertime and beaches are still very much a part of the Beach Boys' sound, but are now intertwined with themes of aging and reflecting on one's life.  It is evident that the group put a lot of effort in this album, with well crafted songs and harmonies that are absolutely gorgeous.  Beach Boys fans will love this album from start to finish.

B006LSZECO|3.0|On their fifth anniversary Nick's wife Amy disappears.  This is every true crime story - the husband did it, or did he?  The book is written in two voices - Nick's and Amy's.  The writing is very good, the characters are different and the elements of the story have you shaking your head.<br /><br />This is a LONG book - split into three parts.  You are introduced to the main characters, watch the disappearance unfold and follow the investigation.  Even the ancillary characters are well written and interesting.<br /><br />But the ending is awful.  There is no other word for it - Flynn could have ended this book any number of ways, the way she chose is disappointing at best.<br /><br />I was going to pick up her previous works but this one has left me with no interest in reading anything else by this author.  She nails character, prose and story telling - but you have to end the story without leaving the reader wondering why they bothered.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|More of a story line than the first of the series.  It is easy reading and fun.  Anyone who read the first will have to buy this second one.
0763644765|3.0|While we loved Yummy/Yucky and Birthday Box, I'm just not sure what I think about this book.  The pictures are great and honestly they tell the whole story.  It's very cute and amusing.  There are almost no words, however, and no words at all on several pages so you have to kind of make it up as you go.  This is fine if you are that sort of parent but, for those of us Type-A types, it's a little off-putting.  We've only had the Potty book two days though so I'm willing to give it a chance and work on my storytelling and improv skills.
0553103547|5.0|I love this book! I can't wait to read the rest of the series. It's very detailed, yet never feels boring.  The chapter flow between the mains is seamless.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|because I never seem to catch shows from the beginning.  I think its because I didn't watch television for 7 years and so after I didn't watch alot of it.<br />I got into glee over 2 years after it started.  As a matter of fact if it hadn't of been for the Glee Project I probably never would have never watched it at all.  I love Broadway, been there twice and going back this year actually but the idea of a singing and dancing tv show sounded a bit corny to me.  I figured it would be like Highschool Musical and didn't realize that it would be the show tunes I love performed by such great actors and singers.  I caught season 2 when walking through the living room and it was on as a re run as Kurt was singing Jazz Hot from Victor Victoria and I that was my introduction to a show that I would after a couple weeks of watching The Glee Project with my mom tune back into.  This show always lifts my spirits and the characters are very colorful.  Its a celebration of the underdog.  This shows got just about every type of person in it you can imagine.  Its got gay kids, it taps in on disabilities, its got different ethnicities (alot of them... I don't think many will feel left out) , its got cheerleaders and its got jocks.  Its got the crazy coaches and goofy teachers.  And as the stories unfold, singing and dancing takes over.  I love the way it can always make me laugh no matter how my day was.  It's the kind of show that you find yourself singing and dancing to in the house by yourself when nobodies watching.  I hope it goes on for years to come.
B00846REIS|3.0|When New York City newbie Eva Tramell first came face to face with the gorgeous and rich Gideon Cross, she was, quite literally, knocked on her butt by the power of her attraction for the man. It was almost a pity that all that dark and gorgeous was attached to such an offensive personality. Before she'd even learned his first name, the stunningly magnetic Mr. Cross announced his intentions towards Eva in as...plain-spoken a way possible.<br /><br />Then she finds out that Gideon Cross is owner and CEO of Cross Industries and owns the building she works in. That's too much complication for her. It doesn't matter how hot the man makes her, it's not wise to sex it up where you work, even if she hadn't been extremely offended by his initial...offer.<br /><br />QUOTE:<br />\\"Think of the rudeness. I'm offended by how he just threw it out there. I hate feeling like a vagina with legs.\\"<br /><br />Problem is, it's not just Eva feeling that intense chemistry. Gideon is feeling it as well. And domineering, successful Gideon is only used to one thing: getting whatever he wants whenever he wants it. He wants Eva.<br /><br />In getting what he wants, though, Gideon ends up with far more than even he'd bargained for. For the first time in his life a relationship with a woman is more than casual sex. It's more than he knows how to handle, and more, maybe, than the baggage carried by two wounded souls can handle. Giving in to their intense desire for each other will either end up bringing them more happiness than they'd ever dreamed, or burn them out and leave nothing but ashes.<br /><br />~*~<br /><br />It would be so easy to hop up on a soapbox and focus not on the content of this book but the rigmarole surrounding it. To chime in with my opinions on the similarities between this book and Grey. Then again, as I understand, Grey has it's own issues in that regard. Frankly, it's hard not to imagine that Day hopped on a coattail or two with this book, then rode them straight to the bank. The ramifications of that decision are what they are and honestly, they're none of my business. I have no greater or lesser power than the singular decision on where to spend my money...and where not to. So no soapbox. Just a review.<br /><br />There's little doubt that Day is an accomplished author who can produce a sophisticated narrative. Parts of this story I enjoyed quite a lot. I liked the relationship between Eva and her best friend Cary, even when it gets complicated. I appreciated the emotional baggage Eva, Gideon, and Cary were dragging around, and could clearly see the affect of that baggage on the corresponding character's actions and decisions. Some of those things fit together to create a sweeping landscape of emotional damage and relationship evolution for all the characters throughout the story, but especially in the emotion-packed second half.<br /><br />On a less positive note, my impressions of Eva and Gideon sea-sawed throughout the book. In the very beginning, I liked Eva's fortitude and her grasp on her self respect, and she really nailed Gideon with some excellent put-him-in-his-place zingers, but I wasn't at all happy with the endless and excessive gushing about just how god-like he is in looks and sex appeal, especially at the expense of solid backstory and character definition. At least she was consistent in her worship of the hunka hunka burnin' love, because that was about all she was consistent in, including her reaction to her family's money, which she claimed to eschew even as she took advantage of it at every turn.<br /><br />There just seemed to be fairly little substance to Eva's character beyond her desire for the man and her determination to not give in to that desire. Until, of course, she completely compromised herself because her lust was just so very, very overwhelming and she wanted Gideon just that much.<br /><br />Even with all that, Eva still made a better first impression than Gideon did. The twenty-eight year old,massively rich, massively gorgeous, massively arrogant, creepy stalker guy who, with no explanation for how this would even be possible, seems to own a majority of New York City. Willing suspension of disbelief was out the window at that point.<br /><br />I don't care how rich you are, what twenty-eight year old man has had time to start, then build his own fully diversified corporation up to the point of making him one of the richest and most well-respected men in the world? Cross, however, is not only obscenely rich and good-looking, he owns and manages his own company, owns the building Eva works in, the one she lives in, at least two of the clubs she goes to (which he has an active enough hand in to be able to track clientele by credit card usage), one of the health clubs, a hotel, and his own home. In New York City.<br /><br />Yeah...not really seeing how that's remotely plausible. If he'd inherited either the fortune, the company, or the property (preferably all three), that would be one thing, but that's not what his limited backstory seemed to imply. Not that much in the way of detailed backstory for his character is really disclosed.<br /><br />I'll say this, though, as the story progressed, I found myself warming to Gideon and souring on Eva. At least Gideon was trying, albeit in a completely dysfunctional way at times. Eva just runs away like a child when things with Gideon get screwed up (which is, admittedly, frequent). Then Gideon chases after her, they make up, and proceed to have the BEST. SEX. EVER. Every time. This seems to be the basic formula of their relationship throughout most of the book. Even when she's telling him she's not running...as she's running. It got a little absurd at times.<br /><br />The sex is explicit, graphic, and erotic, yes. And there is certainly quite a lot of it. No problem for me there. I had no problem with the romance between Gideon and Eva in the latter part of the book, either. It had it's ups and downs, but I started to really like Gideon and wanted him to have some happiness, and Eva had some lovely moments of establishing personal boundaries and forcing Gideon to recognize and respect them. He was controlling and dominant, yes, but other than that freaky stalker stuff in the beginning, he didn't strike me as all that different from any random &uuml;ber-alpha, possessive male. He was also obviously helpless in his feelings for Eva, and that was endearing in places as he is so clearly in uncharted waters.<br /><br />I don't think [[ASIN:B00846REIS Bared to You]] is a bad book, exactly, so much as an uneven one. It has elements that work very well, and it has characters who are sympathetic and likable, though that comes and goes for each character. Some elements of the story are utterly unrealistic, and Gideon and Eva are extremely childish in places. They're also utterly hot and wonderfully erotic in others. Parts of their story touched me, parts annoyed me, parts disgusted me, parts amused me. In the end, summing everything up and averaging it all out, the pluses didn't quite outweigh the minuses...but they did at least mitigate some of them.<br /><br />Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me through NetGalley. This rating, review, and all included thoughts and comments are my own.<br />~*~*~*~<br />Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.massively rich, massively gorgeous, massively arrogant, creepy stalker guy who, with no explanation for how this would even be possible, seems to own a majority of New York City.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have read all 3 books in this trilogy. I rather enjoyed the first two books. But the beginning of 3rd book fell flat for me. The writer strayed away from the writing technique. The back an forth between present and past was confusing at first. The book ended well though.

B005J4TLN4|5.0|Most alien invasion films are about government agencies or suburbanites defending their home against extraterrestrials with a combination of pluck, luck, and firepower. \\"Attack the Block\\" is how the 99% handles it.<br /><br />The invasion takes place on the British equivalent of Fourth of July known as Guy Fawkes Night or Bonfire Night.  The exploding fireworks ensure all manner of mischief goes unnoticed, which is how nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) gets mugged by a gang of punks: Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones), Biggz (Simon Howard), and their leader Moses (John Boyega). After terrorizing Sam, the gang's attack is interrupted by an object smashing into a nearby vehicle.  Sam flees while Moses investigates, only to discover that a ferocious, hairless monkey-like alien is inside. After killing it, they take it to the local drug lord Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter) and his minion Ron (Nick Frost).<br /><br />It turns out that the flat where Sam lives is also home to the gang, a fact that becomes important later as they discover that the alien invasion consists of far worse things than little hairless monkeys. The special effects behind the aliens is simplistic but terrifyingly effective - they're basically stunt men in pitch-black gorilla-like suits with glow-in-the-dark teeth.  That's it. Fur with teeth.  You forget how inculcated we've become by the endless churn of big budget films that use subpar CGI to convince us aliens are really present in a film until you see three of these things barreling down on Moses.<br /><br />\\"Attack the Block\\" is an unflinchingly graphic look at gang life.  The gang members are children who swear, do drugs, and brandish weapons.  And yes, some of these kids are going to die.  The violence is also tempered by humor that only kids can provide, nimbly switching from fighting for their lives to gasping in child-like wonder at the awesome thought of going after what they alternately call Gollums, Gremlins, Pokemon, or monkeys. It's hard to imagine this film being made in the U.S.<br /><br />If \\"Attack the Block\\" only had interesting aliens it would be a passable sci-fi film, but the plot elevates the movie above the usual pablum by keeping class struggles front and center.  When Sam is forced to ally with Moses gang, they turn from predators to protectors.  When each sees how the other half lives, they come to realize the sad set of circumstances that caused their paths to collide. When Moses points out that his gang would never have mugged Sam if they'd known she lived in their flat, she ferociously tears down the macho-construct of territory and ownership. \\"Attack the Block\\" doesn't set out to create world peace, but it's never afraid to let us know that we're as much responsible for our own plight as any alien threat.<br /><br />And that's what makes \\"Attack the Block\\" great.  Block by city block, it spotlights our own class warfare by introducing a new, lower class: aliens.monkeys.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|The individual tracks have been reviewed and commented on so well here that there is no need to rehash. I just wanted to add my voice to those who stand in amazement that a rock band with so much mileage behind them can still create something so vital and full of life and thought and possibilities.<br /><br />Even the most open minded listeners will probably find this a challenging listen for the first few times, but stick with it and it will keep rewarding you. Use the CD booklet, follow along with the narrative and the lyrics. Then it will be easier to \\"hear\\" all the great music that is going on around it afterward. At least, that's what worked for me.<br /><br />This is a much different vibe from Snakes & Arrows, so if you liked that one, don't expect a repeat. This is a band that never repeats itself and values changing and growing and evolving more than any other rock band I have followed. That philosophy definitely appeals to my taste for the \\"new\\" and the \\"different\\".<br /><br />Congratulations to RUSH on a monumental achievement.

031606792X|2.0|This book definitely falls into the \\"when will it ever end\\" category.  Half of words could have been taken out and the storyline would have held.  I do have a question for Ms. Meyer - did you have to replace the S-N-A-R- L keys on your keyboard?  If I had to ready the word snarl one more time I think I would have erupted into a tantrum of my own.  Get a thesaurus and expand the reader's vocabulary.<br /><br />This never-ending book begins with the wedding (this book has been out so long that anyone who was interested already knows this part or saw the movie) and continues with the traumas and dramas of a mortal girl in love with a vampire, but is the recipient of unrequited love of a shape-shifting werewolf.<br /><br />After you get past the parts where the vampire does not need to breath under water and later she can hear him breathing, you have to settle down and lower your expectations to an overwrought new mommy vampire that is trying to save the vampire world and protect a not quite immortal child.<br /><br />There were hopes for this book when the middle third was told in Jacobs's voice, but that glimmer of optimism quickly faded when Bella's voice took over again.<br /><br />I understand that my teen / young adult years were decades ago, but come on, I can stretch my imagination like the rest of them - until this book.  Bella is an annoying character that seems to have no awareness, Edward, who went from wanting to possess her in the first couple of books, turned into a wishy -washy weakling, Charlie has no problem accepting of his daughter's turning and Jacob seems to have taken on a completely new persona.<br /><br />Why did I finish the book, actually the whole series, because I had hope.  I had hoped that this distraught main character would somehow pull the rabbit out of the hat and mature into a worthwhile character.  Guess I set my expectation too high.

0802473164|3.0|This is a worthwhile read. Recommended to me by a female friend who said she has read this book with her husband prior to her marriage (and presumably helped), I who is never the one to skimp on a good non-fiction read, decided to purchase this very affordable and short book.<br /><br />The book focuses on marriages, but the concepts covered can be applicable to all relationships.<br /><br />The author cogently argues that much of marriage problem is differing styles of communication that doesn't meet the needs of the other.<br /><br />The author provides 5 different ways to communicate to each other and how each one is important and fulfills the psychological needs of each individual.<br /><br />Beautiful and well done.<br /><br />But how about when the communication problem is not the cause but a symptom of a more deeper underlying problem? It seems author doesn't necessary believe in such scenario. In essence, the book assumes most marriage problems are communications problems. Perhaps.<br /><br />The author details a story of how a wife with a husband who never accedes to her repeated request to paint the walls in the bedroom despite he having ample time to do it. She constantly makes the request (read: nags him to death) and he never does it. The author sees the problem as a communication issue and provides a recommendation. He says his recommendation has had tremendous results on that marriage (and I believe him), but I wonder if he has only fixed the symptom and not the cause (the husband doesn't care about her anymore or painting the walls in the bedroom?).

B007MDB71O|4.0|When this movie came out I thought it would be a rental because I listened to the critics who didn't rave about it.  So I rented it from Amazon.  I liked it so much that I bought the BueRay.  While science tells us there is no life on Mars the author of this tale wrote it before science really knew much about Mars since telescopes like the ones of today had not yet been invented.  I found the acting was pretty good and the CGI was execllent.  The story, while not plausable, was one that was entertaining and kept my attention.  I've heard it said that this is a Star Wars adverture written ahead of its time and I have to agree.<br /><br />The good thing about today's technology is that if a movie doesn't seem all that great you can always buy the movies for far less than going to see it in the theater.  In my area movies are $12 and snacks, popcorn and a soda is another $10-15 so if you and your wife go see the movie it's about $40 and you don't have it to watch again.  So waiting for the BlueRay only makes sense.  But I kind of wish I had seen it on the big screen too.
B007OWG3LM|4.0|It has been nearly four years since we last heard from Sigur R&oacute;s as a full band, but J&oacute;nsi, the group's lead singer and guitarist, has kept exceptionally busy in the interim. With a solo record and tour in 2010 followed by writing the soundtrack to the film \\"We Bought a Zoo\\" in 2011, J&oacute;nsi has given Sigur R&oacute;s fans plenty of music to keep them occupied while they wait, but that wait is finally over. For many fans, however, the atmospheric nature of \\"Valtari,\\" which is Icelandic for steamroller, may not be quite what they were expecting.<br /><br />Having a record labeled as \\"atmospheric\\" would be a near death sentence for many bands, but not for Sigur R&oacute;s. Where their last record, 2008's \\"Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust,\\" took the band's typically epic crescendos in a more pop-oriented direction, \\"Valtari\\" does almost the exact opposite. Opening with \\"&Eacute;g Anda,\\" Sigur R&oacute;s quietly fades back into our lives like a mist building over water. Without any percussion to offer us a tempo, the first two minutes simply glide from note to note with J&oacute;nsi's distinctive high pitched vocals offering nothing more than a quiet \\"ooh\\" in the distance. Sigur R&oacute;s has plenty of subdued tracks in their back catalogue, but as the first song following the cheerful and frequently upbeat \\"Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust,\\" it is somewhat surprising to hear the band make such an immediate change in course.<br /><br />After just over three minutes, lyrics finally make their first appearance on \\"Valtari,\\" but for anyone familiar with Sigur R&oacute;s, they know these lyrics are frequently sung in a made up language. Often referred to as \\"Hopelandic,\\" J&oacute;nsi's choice of \\"words\\" is often meant more to convey an emotion than any real meaning. Although \\"&Eacute;g Anda\\" may not be as uplifting as the majority of Sigur R&oacute;s' last record, there is still a definite feeling of hope to the track before it abruptly cuts off and unravels into a dissonant blur of distorted bass.<br /><br />The first single off of \\"Valtari,\\" \\"Ekki M&uacute;kk,\\" pulls the album back out of the depths of distorted bass with the aid of shimmering violins and the familiar crackle of a record player. On Record Store Day this year, Sigur R&oacute;s even released a vinyl version of the single that plays from the inside out; a unique twist on an already unique band. As \\"Ekki M&uacute;kk\\" develops, the feature becomes an acoustic piano and J&oacute;nsi's voice; the only two voices without a veil of effects to disguise them. Piano chords set an incredibly slow tempo, but with so many layers filling the gaps, it's easy to simply close your eyes and get lost in the mix.<br /><br />The highlight of the record, \\"Var&uacute;ð,\\" is the least like any other track on the album. Although the song slowly builds from a minimalist instrumentation like many Sigur R&oacute;s selections of the past, \\"Var&uacute;ð\\" is the only track on \\"Valtari\\" to be given the full grandiose treatment. J&oacute;nsi's voice swells with the strings during the choruses to create quite possibly the most beautiful moments of an already stunning album, but halfway through, drums take over the mix to the point of distortion and every other instrument follows suit. This is a definitive Sigur R&oacute;s crescendo and it is the only one heard during the eight-song set that makes up \\"Valtari.\\"<br /><br />There isn't another band on earth doing what Sigur R&oacute;s is doing. Sure, bands like Godspeed You! Black Emperor paint beautiful pictures without the need for words, but the swells of sound that flow so seamlessly from track to track are undeniably Sigur R&oacute;s before J&oacute;nsi even opens his mouth.<br /><br />\\"Valtari\\" closes with three instrumentals in the true definition of the word, but for a band utilizing a made up language, they could all easily be considered instrumentals. Although there is still plenty of beauty in each of these finalselections, at over six minutes apiece, their lengths become apparent to the listener well before the end of the song. Having waited four years for a new album, many fans of Sigur R&oacute;s may be underwhelmed by the second half of the album, but on repeated listens of the album as a whole, it becomes easier to at least grasp the band's latest direction and accept it for what it is, atmospheric.<br /><br />It's nearly impossible to grade a band such as Sigur R&oacute;s against other bands or even against themselves. If \\"Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust\\" is your favorite Sigur R&oacute;s record, then you may be a bit disappointed by what \\"Valtari\\" has to offer, but whether you're new to the band or have been following them since their first album was released in 1997, \\"Valtari\\" only gets better with every listen.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Var&uacute;ð\\"lections, at over six minutes apiece, their lengths become apparent to the listener well before the end of the song.

Yes, they're mostly beautiful people, but they all have their flaws. It makes them more relatable.

B007QXU0ZO|3.0|It has been almost three years since Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros released their debut album. For those of you who had the pleasure of hearing it, the hit single \\"Home\\" is likely still stuck in your head. With their long-awaited follow-up record finally here, the biggest question seemed to be as to whether they would be able to build upon their success with a now familiar audience. Unfortunately for Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, that answer is likely no.<br /><br />Much like Arcade Fire and The Polyphonic Spree, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros are not lacking when it comes to band members. With 11 members at last count, Alex Ebert, the band's lead singer, and company make each song feel like a sing-along. Sometimes they harmonize and sometimes they just throw in the occasional whistle or hoot in the background to add a live feel to their studio recordings, but each member plays a crucial role and helps the music to stand out from a standard four-piece rock band.<br /><br />Although the number of members makes them relatively unique, to get radio play, the songs have to be more than just unique, they have to be catchy; that is where Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros fall short. \\"Here\\" is not a bad record. In fact, as an album, \\"Here\\" is significantly more consistent and enjoyable from start to finish than \\"Up From Below\\" was in 2009. However, there is one extremely significant missing piece and that is a standout single.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" still receives a great deal of radio play even today because it is completely engaging. It is almost as if you can hear each member of the band smiling as they sing. With an infectious whistle and a unanimous shout of \\"hey\\" urging the track onward during the chorus, \\"Home\\" encourages crowd participation whether you're seeing the band live in concert or just singing along with the album in your car.<br /><br />On \\"Here,\\" the tracks are a little more subdued. The debut single, \\"Man on Fire,\\" sounds like a small group singing along to their favorite Johnny Cash track. This is not a bad thing, mind you, but even on hit singles like \\"Ring of Fire\\" and \\"Going to Memphis,\\" Cash was never one to sound cheerful. There is still fun to be had during the listening experience Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros offers, but even as \\"Man on Fire\\" is building to its climax of diverse instruments, it never quite reaches the emotional heights of \\"Home.\\"<br /><br />Following \\"Man on Fire\\" on the album is \\"That's What's Up,\\" a track with the bouncy bass line of The Beatles' \\"Octopus' Garden\\" and the vocal work of a farming family singing together on their back porch. Like the preceding tune, \\"That's What's Up\\" is very enjoyable to listen to, but it never really grasps the attention of the listener. The foot-stomping beat might have you tapping your foot along by the end, but the variety of voices singing during the chorus is somewhat distracting, especially with slightly delayed entrances by some of the participants.<br /><br />As \\"Here\\" progresses and takes shape, there is a great deal of variety thrown at the listener. \\"I Don't Wanna Pray\\" would fit right in with an early-American folk record while \\"One Love to Another\\" utilizes a nearly by the book reggae formula. The whistling that put Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros on the map even makes a return appearance and helps to close out the record, but as the slowest of the nine songs on \\"Here,\\" the whistling heard on \\"All Wash Out\\" does little to remind fans of what made them fall in love with this band to begin with.<br /><br />If you are already a fan of Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, \\"Here\\" is much easier to swallow than it is for new listeners. With the variety of styles and instruments applied to this oversized band, they are able to make songs that would have been popular in the early 1900s feel fresh and new. However, for those unfamiliar with the band, \\"Here\\" is not the kind of record that captures new audiences on a single listen. Lucky for Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, Mumford and Sons' new record is not due out until September the competition for new folk-based music on the radio is still somewhat limited.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Man on Fire\\"isten.

B007CKNX28|4.0|Jack White has one of the largest shadows in music today. Between his work with The White Stripes, The Raconteurs, and The Dead Weather, his guest vocal appearances with the likes of Danger Mouse and The Rolling Stones, his production and composition work for a host of notable artists, and his own record label, Third Man Records, it's a wonder how he ever has time to sleep. With each project he becomes a part of, however, his shadow grows and comparisons to his past successes are more and more inevitable.<br /><br />Since the formation of The White Stripes in 1997, Jack White has become a musical icon. His gritty, minimalist style with blues, punk, and rock influences has added even more variety since moving to \\"Music City,\\" Nashville, TN in 2005. With \\"Blunderbuss,\\" he finally has the chance to let his creative juices flow without being held to the constraints of a single project. The result is easily the most diverse album he has ever been a part of which also means there is less of a defined direction to the album than past releases.<br /><br />Opening with \\"Missing Pieces,\\" Jack White opens up about his experiences with women; including his recent divorce from Karen Elson. As a Rhodes organ presses him onward, White poetically declares \\"sometimes someone controls everything about you and when they tell you that they just can't live without you, they ain't lyin', they'll take pieces of you.\\" Lyrically, \\"Blunderbuss\\" contains some of Jack White's finest work to date, but most of the edgy guitar riffs that put him on the map to begin with are replaced with laid-back analog grooves and an expanded instrumentation.<br /><br />One of the few throwback moments for Jack White occurs on the album's second single, \\"Sixteen Saltines.\\" Thanks to White's nearly shouted vocal delivery and heavily distorted guitar, \\"Sixteen Saltines\\" is sure to be the highlight of the album for anyone still mourning the announcement that The White Stripes are officially finished.<br /><br />Although fans of The White Stripes may get preemptively excited for the remainder of \\"Blunderbuss\\" after hearing \\"Sixteen Saltines,\\" Jack White did his best to quell their expectations by not releasing it as the lead single. Fans' first taste of the record, titled \\"Love Interruption,\\" is a complete departure from White's past projects. Although White has had his quieter moments in the past, \\"Love Interruption\\" is almost entirely acoustic with White taking on a much less angst-driven persona. Nashville singer-songwriter Ruby Amanfu even offers a distant, wavering accompaniment to Jack White on the calm flow of the track.<br /><br />As \\"Blunderbuss\\" takes shape, the Nashville influence on White becomes more and more apparent. From the pedal-steel of the title track to the violin, harp, and honkey-tonk piano mixed into the remainder of the record, there is far more of a country vibe heard here than on any Raconteurs album. \\"Hip Eponymous Poor Boy\\" and \\"I Guess I Should Go to Sleep\\" both sound as if they could be playing in the background of a saloon out west with only White's signature voice to remind us of the song's creator. When mixed in with the hard rock track \\"Freedom at 21\\" and the classic blues tune \\"I'm Shakin',\\" the album loses some of the flow that made all of White's past projects such enjoyable listens straight through, but there's nothing wrong with a little variety.<br /><br />Before its release, \\"Blunderbuss\\" seemed to be flooded with 5-star reviews and unanimous praise from critics. Although it is an excellent record, \\"Blunderbuss\\" is not without flaws. \\"On and On and On\\" lives up to its name by quickly dragging the close of the album to a crawl. The final track \\"Take Me With You When You Go,\\" brings a bit of the lost energy back, but the odd vocal harmonization and random instrumental breaks all feel out of place, even on such a mixed bag as \\"Blunderbuss.\\" This leaves the end of the record somewhat disappointing, even for listeners with a completely open mind going into it.<br /><br />On \\"Blunderbuss,\\" Jack White purges his brain of a multitude of ideas; weaving a variety of styles, influences, and instruments together. Thanks to some clever lyrics and a knack for lively mixes, the end result works surprisingly well. Sure, there may be a few bumps in the road, but for fans of any of Jack White's past projects, \\"Blunderbuss\\" is a must-own.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Sixteen Saltines\\"n mind going into it.<br /><br />On \\"Blunderbuss,\\" Jack White purges his brain of a multitude of ideas; weaving a variety of styles, influences, and instruments together.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I sat and read this book very quickly.  It wasn't the sex that was the draw for me; I wanted to find out what happened to Grey that brought him to this point in his life.  But that part of the plot is just a tease, and I will have to wade through two more volumes to find out what caused him to become so \\"sick\\".  I have to call it what it is.  He is not just a little perverted; he wants to hurt people in order to achieve sexual gratification.<br />  I hope this is not another book being read by teenage girls.  Think of the damage it could do if they mistakenly believe this is normal and the most exciting thing that could happen sexually.<br />  Being plenty old enough to know better than to buy into this view of sexuality,  I still would like to read the parts of the other books that tell about Grey's early life.  But I doubt if I will buy them.  Maybe someone will tell me later.

I never felt like I had to search for greater meaning to the words in order to appreciate them.As an example there is an exchange between Miss Francine Pefko and Dr. Asa Breed early on in the novel that I found so hilarious I reread it about 8 times.Another that stands out in my mind is the chapter titled \\"Bicycles For Afghanistan\\" in which H. Lowe Crosby describes the current state of the American Bicycle industry.It just goes to show how politics can screw up the simplest of business models and although written in 1963, could very well have been penned yesterday.

I loved being able to envision all of the people, events, drama, emotions as how I would.  This book is based on a very extensive knowledge of BDSM, so if you don't know anything about it, you'll soon learn.<br /><br />The conflict and drama presented in this book was well-depicted.  The only complaint I have is that some of it seemed like it wasn't realistic - how the two main characters were on the same page almost all the time.  The intimate scenes were well-described, and I could really connect to how Ana was feeling.<br /><br />Being the last book of the trilogy, I felt like the ending was rushed and there were some loose ends that she could've cleaned up, but she covered the more important characters of the book.<br /><br />This book isn't for the faint of heart - there is some stuff in it that would make some people squirm, but it's an excellent read.

0345479092|5.0|This was by far the most helpful book about creating a routine that I have found. Hogg's style is supportive and helpful. My favorite parts of the book were the chart on baby's body language and what it means, and the reasoning behind her specific routine. It just made sense. Hogg recommends having babies eat, play, and sleep in that order throughout the entire day. After following that advice, my babies were happier, cried less, and slept better than they did before I started them on this method. It gives parents a sense of control when a baby has turned their world upside down.<br /><br />There were a few times when I veered off the routine, but the Three Day Magic section near the end of the book provided some helpful remedies to get back on track.<br /><br />My only hesitations in regards to this book have to do with the breastfeeding advice as it was different from what my doctor recommended. Hogg's recommendation is to set up one-sided breastfeeding rather than allowing the baby to drain both sides. This worked for me because my babies fell into that habit naturally. If they hadn't, this would have been incredibly frustrating advice.

Written for the general public, this effort is a successful attempt to target pockets of interest within that market. Two such areas are \\"relativity\\" and \\"curved space.\\" In the process, however, Hawking and Mlodinow have actually expanded some of their explanations  in order for them to be more easily understood.<br /><br />New, colorful graphics are an excellent addition and short, enticing chapter titles, like \\"Newton's Universe\\", \\"Wormholes and Time Travel\\", and \\"Quantum Gravity\\", quickly draw the reader into what the authors have to offer. But if you are a veteran student of this subject matter, you may not find anything new.

1577314808|5.0|Excellent book that teaches readers to stay in the present moment. Using a Question and Answer format, Eckart Tolle gives people a distilled but very valuable version of mindfulness taught by many spiritual traditions. In simple language, he definitely makes a good case for the present moment as a refuge from the chaos of life and a place where peace and balance can be found.<br /><br />Tolle's chapter titles such as \\"You Are Not Your Mind\\", \\"The Way Out of Pain\\", and \\"Enlightened Relationships\\" immediately tell the reader that the coming journey is going to be a very personal one indeed.<br /><br />A believer in the natural abilities all people possess to \\"stay present\\", Tolle gives instruction on how to make that happen. As valuable as his guidance is, however, it takes constant practice and support to make such a thing work in daily life. Readers would do well to continue their efforts by taking classes in meditation and/or joining an ongoing meditation group. The spiritual traditions Echart Tolle has borrowed from, such as Buddhism, often have such classes or groups available in many communities.<br /><br />A structural addition that might make this book even more useful would be an index.

B005OCHOZS|5.0|Like most, I read about Scott Jurek in [[ASIN:0307279189 Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen]].  He seemed like an interesting character in that book, but reading about him in his own words actually made him a lot more interesting, especially the fact that he's a vegan ultra runner.  The recipes in the book sound tasty and I'll be trying out a few.<br /><br />Jurek weaves an entertaining tale of how he got into running in the first place and how it was an escape/release from problems at home.  And like most runners, he comes to a point to where he's gone as far as he can and then things fall apart.  It would have been nice to read more about how -- after things fell apart -- he made his way back.<br /><br />Probably the most motivating aspect of Jurek's story though is that he gives back.  Even if he does win a race, set a new record, etc, he stands at the finish line and cheers everyone else who comes in.  If that isn't inspiring, I don't know what is.
B0029LHWFO|5.0|If you want to know the real Barak Obama, read this book PLEASE! If you don't believe what all of the conservative pundits say: that he is an anti-American Communist, then read this book. You will read in Obama's own words that he was raised on anti-American communist doctrine. That he was mentored by anti-American radical Frank Marshall Davis. This is the true nature of Obama in his own words. What's not to believe?

034580404X|4.0|I love this series,  its steamy, sexy if you are not into that kind of book beware.  But it's a good read, page turner, You are not going to be bored.  I won't recommend the book for young adult.
B007Y1ARLA|3.0|I have to say that I am a pretty big Keane fan.  I purchased this album without even reading reviews because Keane is just one of those bands that I just pick up each new album automatically.  However, most bands sooner or later have that album that makes me start to think about my automatic purchase policy.  Well, you guessed it. This is that album for me.  While it is not bad, I will not be listening to it often or going back to it after a month or so, and therefore I am somewhat disappointed.  Having said this, they are a great group and there work as a whole is very impressive.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|Don't let the negative (and probably fake) reviews fool you.  This movie has good themes, lessons, characters, humor, animation, and voice acting.  Over all, fun, yet, thoughtful.  My advice is to ignore the initial amazon star rating, and read through the reviews yourself.
B000FC1LOC|1.0|You have got to be kidding me. I don't think so; not going to happen. Publishers need to get in touch with reality and price accordingly.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Nice app but I have had to uninstall and reinstall several times. Like to play but not worth all the trouble. Please fix.
B000NJVWUA|5.0|AMMONIA AVENUE has the distinction of being the Project's last big hit album, although there were some great albums later, e.g. TRY ANYTHING ONCE and ON AIR.<br />This is certainly a fine collection, spearheaded by its three hit singles---PRIME TIME, DON'T ANSWER ME and YOU DON'T BELIEVE and highlighted by the symphonic title tune and the pensive SINCE THE LAST GOODBYE.<br />Again, as in previous albums, the underlying theme of loneliness, alienation and despair are given life by vocalists Eric Woolfson, Lenny Zakatek, Chris Rainbow and Colin Blunstone.  I find all of Parsons recordings including those without the Project to be refreshing and enjoyable.  Change is always inevitable in any creative endeavor and I think Parsons achieved this change in reputable form.
1936608898|5.0|Melissa and Dallas nailed it.<br /><br />Unlike most other nutrition books out there with a Paleo slant, the Hartwigs have not only addressed WHICH foods can be problematic and HOW, but they also address WHY it's so hard for people to quit those processed frankenfoods, which (in my opinion) is the most important variable.<br /><br />This book is not a diet book that is touting to make you loose xlbs in xdays. This book is so much more than that.  It is a manual on how to free yourself from the grip of unhealthy eating habits. It will change your relationship with food, and give you all the tools you need to make conscious decisions for a lifetime of healthy eating. No counting/measuring, just eating real food.<br /><br />Change your life; break the cycle; Get This Book.

1451648537|5.0|I should disclose: I do not own a single Apple product and dislike biographies.  That said this might be one of the greatest books I have ever read.  Walter Isaacson brings Jobs to life in ways rivaling any literary character of the past generation.  Jobs is neither hero nor villain, but human - he is detestable yet we root for him.  Jobs plays Hamlet, in this American story of the past half century.<br /><br />Do not let the technology scare you off.  This book is more human than inanimate.  In fact so was Jobs - a designer and philosopher rather than a technocrat.  The tech landscape of the last few decades of the 20th century was a battle between industry and artistry.  With Jobs as the quixotic figure representing art.<br /><br />Isaacson is an amazing writer.  He has carefully crafted a narrative - not routed by a timeline but rather thematic episodes.  Apple II, Family, Fatherhood, Relationships, His Past.  A chapter here or there on computer technology quickly turns back to the madness of Jobs persona.  Isaacson captures all of Jobs idiosyncrasies and contradictions in subtle thematic writing that builds a coherent ethos.<br /><br />In the end Isaacson does for Jobs what Jobs did for computers and technology - \\"end to end tightly integrated experience.\\"
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|great game with decent puzzles good gameplay and an interesting story too. I like that it isn't all find it and then some dumb story. this is was a likable experience
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think this game is awesome. So I don't understand what pepo r talking bout when they say it glithes when it doesn't. maybe my kindle is diffrent?
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I watched this on the second day it came out. I was told by friends that this movie was amazing. So I saw it, and was completely amazed. This is not a slow movie, within the first two minutes there is already and action scene. It is extremely funny and full of action. My Uncle convinced my Grandmother (God know's how he did that) to go with him. She hates anything that isn't a western or some love story. She said she loved this movie, she's in her eighties. I was expecting this movie to have a lot of action, lots of special effects and straight to a story. I wasn't expecting explosion of the mind, amazing performances, wonderful special effects, and wasn't expecting it to be hilarious. It was all of these things. I'm telling you if you aren't a superhero film fan, you should still watch this. You won't be disappointed. Promise
0446581356|5.0|When I first saw this book I knew I needed to have it! Bobbi Brown is a great and talented make up artist who likes to share her knowledge with others. That is what this book is about, to let you know you can do great make up without actually being a pro.<br />I went from someone who likes make up to someone who others will pay me to do their make up! Great book!!

B0086QS7N2|5.0|Rush returns to form.  Very heavy, very deep feel to all the songs.  Excellent, thought provoking lyrics from Neil.  This will take a few long listens to fully appreciate it's message.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Before anyone jumps all over me for this review, let me say this.  This is just my opinion, period.  I would encourage anyone to read this book and form their own.<br /><br />Having said that... This story is weak, the writing is poor.  It stresses repitition just to fill white space.  I never felt one iota of connection with the characters.  The sex was bland and nothing special.  A short porn film would be more efficient.<br /><br />I thought the book was a waste of time.  If it weren't for the sex, it would qualify as a YA title.<br />There are far better erotic books available,  Just my opinion.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It was interesting, but not great.  Maybe I've gotten too old for books such as these.  I won't be buying the other two.  Read one, you've read them all
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It has been a long time since I have been so into a book. It is really well written and I loved the story line. I definitely recommend it. You will not be dissappointed!
B0045D3N3O|5.0|Malcolm X is one of the best films I've ever seen. The overall portrayal of Malcolm X from class president to street hustler to convict to political leader is as good as it gets. You cannot truly understand or appreciate the man until you understand his evolution. And director Spike Lee delivers massively here! There are many things to learn here: the charisma, the fiery rhetoric and the sacrifices.<br /><br />Don't walk to buy the Blu-Ray edition movie. Run! It's really that good. The documentaries on the disc are an added bonus as well. Very educational
B005HSL626|5.0|.... I love this game, it is addicting to my whole family( my mom, dad, me, and my lil sister). we are still trying to beat my dad's score. the ONLY PROBLEM is that I WANT A JETPACK JOYRIDE GAME, LOL, SORRY FOR THE UNRELATED THING( IN A WAY, IT IS REALTED). jetpack joyride is from the same company and I have been looking for it on the kindle forever. I hope the company sees this and puts the game on the kindle( for free)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game soo addicted get it for sure. reminds me of roller coaster tycoon expect no roller coasters..
B002BU0DPE|2.0|These headsets are very nice. It has good sound and fits well on the head.<br /><br />However, they break very easily. That is because the wires in the rotating cups tend to bend a lot when the cups rotate. I had about six months use before having problems in the right ear. I took very good care of these headsets, I would set them down carefully when not in use. Unfortunately, after nine months I lost all sound in the right ear cup. For the price, I had hoped I could get at least two years out of these, but not so.<br /><br />I recommend wireless headsets. The wires in any wired headset tend to break, even the P11's, which I bought after the PX21's broke.<br /><br />Anyway, if you buy these, do not expect them to last long. While they work they are great, but some buyer's have complained that they break after a few weeks. These headsets must be used with care.
0316154687|4.0|Sedaris continues to write witty and humorous stories based on his life, but it seems as though most of the interesting experiences he's had since his last book have taken place in either taxis or hotel rooms. No doubt that's a reflection of his life, but it's considerably less engrossing than his last collection, Me Talk Pretty One Day.<br /><br />Still, there are some gut-busting moments and some touching ones too. Or should I say touched?<br /><br />A talented writer -- I'd love to see him try to write some fiction, because if you can make reality sing, then fiction should be easy.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I saw this band on a private rooftop show in Chicago (by accident seeing as I was going up to grill with friends) and they were AMAZING!! They have such an energy to them and have a well written collection of songs that are both lyrically rich and instrumentally great. Get this CD, you will not be disappointed in any way. Just grab some beers, invite your friends, light up the bonfire, turn on The Lumineers, and enjoy!!

B002RI9YCI|4.0|As a colonial who thinks it's time to get rid of the monarchy (at least in Canada), I was not sure how I was going to take this book, which is the story of the Queen's new-found enthusiasm for reading. But I found Bennett's story quite delightful, occasionally quite funny, and thoroughly engrossing. It's not just the story of the Queen, it's also an examination of the nature of reading. It's the kind of book you could easily devour in one sitting, but I forced myself to spread it out over a few days, and I'm glad I did because it made the ending pay off even more!
B001U887WE|5.0|Love them, even though I live in TX and ordered them at the beginnning of summer, I still LOVE them and can't wait until it gets cooler so people will quit making fun of me for wearing lined crocs in the middle of summer!  glad i purchased them!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is one of the most boring stories I have read in a long time.<br />The author is trying to make a point, but doesn't put it across very well.<br />Lots of boring scenes until you know what is coming next.<br />The ending is really the end and follow on stories can be determined<br />without bothering to read read the books.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|I discovered Regina accidentally after seeing some reviews. I was really looking for some updates on Fiona Apple's new CD. This is the second CD of hers that I have heard and it is really good. It is just as good as \\"begin to hope\\" and all of the songs are very good. If you like her music, you won't be disappointed.
B00000IQW5|4.0|This arrived as promised and was in excellent condition.  I had no trouble with it.  It played beautifully.  It is a sweet love story, entertaining enough, and the characters are likable.  It's about life's loves and losses and people who truly care.  It's somewhat predictable, but enjoyable, and has romance for the ladies and action for the guys. Audrey Hepburn's appearance was a great addition to the film.  Such class, grace and beauty.  It's not my favorite film of all time, but I would watch it again and will add it to our video library.  I wish I had seen it in the theater.  I think it would have been better appreciated on the big screen - especially the flying scenes.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. It keeps me organized. You can Color code your notes. You can create checklist and you can create a password on it. You can also put things on your own personal calender

0307730697|5.0|I was nervous to read this book. I knew it would hit close to home since my brother is an Iraq War Vet and barely made it home. I am so glad I got past my initial hesitation and decided to read this book.<br /><br />Adam's story is truly inspiring. Proving that nothing is impossible with God. His faith inspired me to trust more in the Lord. His courage inspired me to be bold in my own life and not be apologetic for my belief in Jesus. His heart inspired me to treat those around me with respect and kindness, regardless of the circumstance.<br /><br />This book will truly touch your heart!
B001GCUO5M|3.0|I don`t know which film was shot first but this film bears striking resemblance to \\"The Ward\\". Leo usually does movies that are much better than this one like Inception.

0877180121|5.0|very basic, great for starter, using it for both my 4 and 7 year old children. Starts from the very beginning, use of right and left hand. useful exercises of fill in the blanks to keep them thinking and ensuring they grasp theory concepts
0345803507|5.0|I first keep seeing the books under New York Times best seller list or top 100. I didn't know what the book was about until I saw an interview with the author and they were interviewing readers. I still thought I'm just not into those erotic romance novels. I couldn't help thinking of those corny novels with fabio on the front of it. Then I keep hearing the books coming up in different discussions at work and on the radio so one day I started looking at the reader reviews and they all seemed to be bad. Finally out of boredam one evening I decided to read a sample of the first book, it was keeping my interest so i ordered the book. After that I was so absorbed, I read all three in a week. I was reading every chance I got. There were times where the sex scenes were to much, I'd find myself skimming thru them. But most of them keep you wondering what were they going to try next! There were also some parts I felt were rushed over, such as Ana telling her parents about being pregnant, or there wedding, or having the baby and showing how they handled the first few months of parenthood. I also would have liked to read more about Kate and Elliot's wedding. James does have Ana daydream back over some of these events briefly, but I would have liked to read more about some of those things along with what Christian thoughts were. I liked that James included that in the last chapter. All together these were some of the best books I've ever read! They get you so caught up in the story, I was sad when i got to the end of the book.. I really hope that James is working on a sequel to this trilogy. I would also be interested in reading other books she may write if they are anywhere near as good as these were! But I think all fans of her trilogy can't wait to pick up where she left off with Ana and Christian.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|It's a fun game that makes you think.  There's always something new as you go from course to course.  I give this a fun thumbs up!
B0086700CM|5.0|couldn't put this game down. I just kept running no matter how many times I died.Believe me I died a lot!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book opens your mind to a kinky fantasy world in a classy way. Infused with a bit of mystery its a must read!!
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I totally love her voice and find her personality powerful, certainly for her young age! Thanks so much, I borrowed from a friend and now I am inlove and will get it in the store.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game and so do my children. It would be great to add some more graphics like slides going down and side to side.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|Loading was fine.  The app allows correct moves, but it repeatedly told me that my king was in check, although it was absolutely not so.  I am deleting this app.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|My local Wal-mart put Clockwork Angels out a week before they should have. I have listened to it numerous times since. I am a Rush ADDICT, with track marks to prove it - i swear!  I have never felt such emotion, beauty and grace in any of their previous works as I did with Clockwork Angels. I believe this will be a hallmark event for Rush and will be much deserved. To me, this is their pinnacle album, and sadly could be there last. Rush has achieved the perfect album! The Songs are complex, but each one has a melodic hook that stays with you. It makes you smile, cry and ponder. What an investment for a mere $12.00! Thanks Geddy, Alex and Neil- and most of all thanks to their producer, Nick, who helped push them to achieve new heights.  This album was made  for Rush fans, no one else! They Stood and Delivered!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I've seen the movie... love the movie... bought the movie. Can't say much more than that, other than I'm pleased with it. I have a BluRay player, but I opted for the regular DVD version of this rather than pay the extra cost. The up-res picture is great, sound is good, lots of special features I haven't watched yet, etc. I'm watching it on a mid-sized HDTV. Comes with digital copy, so that's a plus (I don't use that either, but might if I had a smart phone or tablet computer). I bought this as a present for myself to quality for Super Saver shipping on some other purchases I wanted.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I've listened to this album a few times now and it's made a strong impression already.  My favorites so far are Caravan, Clockwork Angels, The Anarchist, The Wreckers, Headlong Flight, and The Garden.  The others are pretty good too.  The only song I really don't care for is BU2B2 but it's really short so i'm not complaining.<br /><br />Definitely one of the best \\"recent\\" Rush albums (1990+), probably only beat my Counterparts.  It isn't Moving Pictures but i'm ok with that.  There is a good variety of style and the strings were a nice addition.  Rush fans should definitely pick this up, it's great!
B0063IH60K|5.0|No problems with it. Plays good and I like that I can customize the card and other things. recomend it.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Great CD - worth every penny.  There's not a bad song on here and so many of them could be radio singles.
B003W9I9JU|5.0|Finally the whole plot comes together. The first part of a great finale to a great season. This is a great episode of Dr. Who.<br />There are some negative reviews, but they all relate to some sound issues that (from my experience at least) seem to have been resolved. This episode also introduces a few characters that have more integral parts to play in Season 6 and so it contributes not just to the narrative of a season but to the narrative of the show, the arch, and Dr. Who history.<br />Steven Moffat (the show's head writer) forever!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is character & plot driven smut. Be clear about this before you start it -- sexual attraction & sexual activity are a huge part of this book & the sex varies from plain vanilla to spanking & being tied up while blindfolded. So, it is not for everyone. Having said that, it is a character & plot driven story, told from the POV of a virgin female college senior (well, she starts it as a virgin, and remains so mentally through most of the book). The story is well written with no obvious typos, which seems to be rare these days. The characters are interesting.  The plot is compelling. The sex is hot, even when it is kinky. Well worth reading.
B004SEUJKU|3.0|Great movie.  Beautiful Blu-ray picture.  But the sound was not so good.  Explosions were muffled, gun fire was too quiet and the music did not boom through.  The disc was priced well enough, but I would have paid more for a great sound track.
B001229W22|1.0|Expected a lot more from reviews.  Neither instruments nor the vocals were entertaining.<br />Take into consideration that I like many bands in the rock/hard rock/metal [of many types] genres.<br /><br />I wish I could return it but I got it on MP3.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really love kittens and enjoy having small puzzle that fits my kindle. A really good ap for young children. Keep the puzzles coming.

B007SGM084|5.0|I love reading these books. I couldn't stop reading the books. It has a great story line. I recommended this book to all my friends and they love it too.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I have to say I'm not a book worm at all actually I would be lucky to read one book in a year.  BUT this has changed since reading the first book of the fifty shades triology, I'm now up to the final book and it's only been a month since I started reading the series.<br /><br />The book is reviting, exciting and sometimes naughty (but in good taste), you ride the rollcoaster of the relationship between Ana and Christan and the more you read the deeper the series goes into Christian dark past which is very intriguing.  There has been times when I have laughed out aloud or cried out Oh No !  the book will keep you reading for hours, the online price is excellent value for money and I would recommend this trilogy to anyone.<br /><br />Happy Reading !
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a very constructive,  sort of puzzle game<br />i think it helps your ability to construct or build<br />besides,  it is really fun!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love. the game but I cant figure out. how. to make. friends.  it would be fantastic if I could do that.  grafics r cool too...and the movie wont play without pausing and getting stuck.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This product arrived quickly and was as advertised.  It is convenient, lightweight, colorful and protects my Kindle Fire.

Would recommend this over many other Kindle covers.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Back in the 1960's (yeah, i'm carbon-dating myself here), my older brother was reading these paper back books from the author Edgar Rice Burroughs. Titles like \\"Pellucidar\\" (i know this is probably very incorrect) but he had a copy of \\"The Princess of Mars\\" plus my brother collected art periodicals that had the fanzine art of Frank Frazetta, who painted several works of Conan the Barbarian, characters from E.R.B.'s works and because of that that got me very curious to see this movie. The credics gave it 1 star, said it was a mess and hard to understand. I saw this movie with an open mind to the past and I thoroughly loved this movie! I was entertained! Take me to Barsoom! please.....:-)
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This entire CD is amazing!!! It is not very often that I purchase a full album, but thanks to the great price I decided to this time. Worth every penny!! Lana is an incredible artist and you can't beat amazon music!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|One of very few games that i buy that I keep. Great. Awwwsome. All of the above.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A teacher friend recommended this book to me and let me borrow the first one.  I read it in one sitting and couldn't wait to get the others.  I purchased Wool Omnibus and, again, couldn't put it down (which upset my children because they were in need of food/drink/sleep.) It is such a fantastic book that captivates the reader's attention.  Being a teacher, I don't find a lot of time to read during the school year but when summer comes - I don't stop.  I look forward to reading every installment after Omnibus!  I'm even working on getting it included on the suggested summer reading list for the local high school.  Thank you for a fantatic read!

B0059WTMLW|5.0|Easy to use and learn.  Everything you could want in a Sudoku app and more.  Stupid minimum.  Bah, still three short.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|The whole concept that humans were \\"created\\" by an alien race and scientists go in search of them is just ridiculous. We saw stuff like this in \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" 40 years ago. Why add this plot line to the \\"Alien\\" story? \\"Alien\\" was simple, direct, and to the point...humans are the creatures that put a sense of morality in everything they do. As horrific as the Alien monster was, it was simply trying to survive and it just so happens it needed human hosts to gestate its young in. The simplicity of nature's savagery (and we have examples of such parasitism on earth) made ALIEN, together with stellar performances and effects, the great sci-fi-horror-drama it was. PROMETHEUS developed a convoluted, full of plot holes, preachy back story to the saga that just sucked the life out of the storyline....and shameful repetition of some of the events from ALIEN along the way to try and up the horror ante. Epic failure.
B00846REIS|1.0|I just finished Fifty Shades, someone reccomended this book next. But can't help but feel its a rip off of Fifty! If it were just the plot that resembled Fifty then it would be tolerable, but geeze, use almost the same wording?!

B001DD0HPG|5.0|This is the most wonderful collection of classical music that I have ever heard. Julian Bream's playing is always a great pleasure to hear: he brings the music to life with his passion and enthusiasm, and the variety of tone colours that he produces from his guitar (and his lute) is second to none. The range of musical styles covered in this set is astonishing and refreshing. You will find sensitive interpretations of Bach, delicate Dowland pieces (there is lute music here, too!), evocative 20th century solo guitar compositions, expressive Spanish music, beautiful guitar concertos with full orchestra, delightful pieces with Bream accompanied by a string quartet and a harpsichord, and vibrant guitar duets with John Williams.<br /><br />The only downside to this set is that it will make you want to buy everything that Julian Bream has ever recorded, and sadly, many of those albums are no longer available.
B005COO1X6|3.0|The beginning is very promising and the story develops in an interesting way but then the end is kind of bolted on as if Stephen King got out of time and needed to finish it in a few minutes.

B00004YZ36|5.0|I'll add my '5 stars'  to all the reviews of this set.  These are magnificent recordings. And logical given the orchestra.  I had the pleasure of seeing them perform live in California some years ago.  Anda's playing is wonderfully boyant and cheerful. Just the way Mozart would want it. The recordings are sharp and clean.  I bought a set used and it was a bargain for such performances.  Let me add one last point:  If there's anyone on the planet who still doubts Mozart's genius ( hard to believe, I know) then let them listen to the seldom heard Concerto #5. It is nearly inconceivable that such a piece of music could have been written by someone so young.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|My 11 year old son was really looking forward to reading this book because he'd heard about the movie and the story sounded exciting. But ... he was very disappointed. He found it too 'girly' (his words!) with Katniss pretending to like Peeta but it was all for show. He was also expecting a lot of action but it was mainly about Katniss's thoughts and worries. The best bit was a small bit of action at the end when the Mutts attacked.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have to say that this is one of my favorite reads. I was totally drawn in from the very first page. This is by far one of the the best books I have read yet. I'd say just as good as [[ASIN:B00729GQ0A THE FOREVER GIRL (an Urban Fantasy / Paranormal Romance Novel of the Occult) (Forever Girl Series #1)]] Beautiful Disaster was simple incredible, I look forward to more from this author. Simply amazing!!!!!
1579128955|4.0|The content is really amazing! There are lots of stunning photographs and the author did a great job explaining, well, everything.  Explanations are clear and thorough and easy to understand. Everything is concise and thus easy to digest.  However, the book itself ( the physical object as in the pages and ink) produces a strange chemical smell, which I believe come from the ink. No offense: for your information, this book is published in China. The smell made me drowsy and it is so strong, i can smell it when it is 40cm away from me. I love reading books on my bed at night but not with this book. I am even unwilling to touch it or put it on my bed, in case it contaminates it. Therefore, it made me really uncomfortable while reading this book because I have been trying to get further away from this book to avoid the smell but trying to stay close enough to be able to read the text. My body aches and I get frustrated and uncomfortable after a while of tossing and turning and being really restless.... But i still recommend this book though, because of the contents. I wish I had a digital edition or something. Feel free to ask me questions :D

B004UQ03P2|5.0|Bought a MacBook Frame HD Anti-Reflective Screen Protector Film and returned it because it kept falling off my computer screen.  This was more expensive but it works.  Worth every penny.  It took less than a minute to install and it looks pretty good.  You can tell there is film on but its still pretty clear.  I don't see finger prints or bubbles so I'm happy.
B005VCL4PW|2.0|Well, since I read the first three, I figured I should give the fourth Twilight book a shot, and borrowed Breaking Dawn from a friend. I haven't really found love with the first three, possibly because I'm not that into vampires, and I think I'm simply too old for the books. *Sigh* So with Breaking Dawn, the story picks up where Bella Swan has decided she wants to be a vampire so she can live forever with Edward Cullen. She has made her decision between Edward and Jacob, and vampire trumps werewolf in this case. We watch her make her decision, marry Edward, have sex with a vampire and get pregnant with a vampire baby, and read about the gruesome birthing scene that has terrified me. I'll be honest - I stopped really reading by the 100th page of so. So I had a lot of speed reading ahead of me, as this is one ginormous book. With the series not doing much for me, it was hard to keep my attention commanded on the fourth. I haven't watched any of the movies yet, and I probably won't unless I'm super bored one day and stumble upon them on Starz or something. While the books weren't for me, I clearly understand that many, many others love them, and I'm happy I gave them a go.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love it . I don't like putting puzzles together but I really like this.  :) I yelled at my son for downloading it but I like it.
0553801473|1.0|Let me start by saying.. I thoroughly enjoyed books 1-3 and I continue to have high hopes for where this series will go.  At least where it will go if it is ever finished.<br /><br />I can't tell you how sad I was to find this was the book GRRM spent 6 years writing and developing.  I was lucky enough to get into the books late and only had to wait 3 years for A Dance with Dragons.  After suffering through A Feast For Crows I was absolutely stoked to get back to my favorite characters.  Finally - back to the action in the north and the witty dwarf.  This book was almost a thousand pages and I can sum it up in just a few words:  Jon gets stabbed, Tyrion takes a boat trip and fornicates with another dwarf, Daenerys has a lot of sex with creepy men, Aegon lands in the seven kingdoms.<br /><br />GRRM seems to delight in pissing off his readers.  Don't get too comfortable with a character or begin to think of them fondly - he's just going to kill them off.  (By the way I loved his lack of sentimentality at first, but it's starting to get ridiculous.)  Don't expect him to progress the plot in any meaningful way.  This book has more filler than a RNC position paper.  I guess more than anything I was disappointed to read a thousand pages that could have probably been condensed into 500.<br /><br />I can't see how he can finish the story in just two more volumes, but anyway at the rate he's going it will only take 12 years to find out.  The book is so frustrating that trying to describe it here leaves me almost apoplectic.  I would caution you to lower your expectations, and even to wait until the next book before reading this monstrosity.  You may find it much more enjoyable than I did.  Here's hoping GRRM will make a little more effort and stop writing tedious novels that more closely resemble Robert Jordan's WoT than A Song of Ice and Fire.

B007SWZVBQ|5.0|I have to admit, I'm a total \\"Gleek.\\"  I was hooked when the pilot aired before the regular schedule of the program.  I have EVERY Glee CD and DVD.  Each episode of the show is a slice of life (good and bad), and of course the music puts the \\"icing\\" on the \\"cake.\\"  While it's sad that next season will probably be the last, THIS 3rd season put a close on many issues and this Album really brings it musically all together.  All great tunes, performed ideally.  It's worth having in your collection.
B005LAIGQE|5.0|While the DVD and BLU-RAY are still preorder items here in the US, I have just viewed the added features -which we will also be getting in the U.S.- on the international version of the BLU-RAY and IMHO they alone are worth seeing.  The making of the movie feature - titled \\"A 'Big Miracle' in Alaska\\" is extensive (21 minutes) and truly depicts what some of us here in Alaska had a chance to witness as the film was made here.  The ice field set was unique and the use of animatronic whales (rather than tennis balls) for the human actors to relate to on the set is graphically depicted. Had to love seeing again the filming of the whale hunt scene on the lake just down the street from my house.  If you have a BLU-RAY player (or even if you don't) opt for the BLU-RAY version just to get this added feature which is apparently exclusive to the Blu-ray. On the flip side of the Blu-ray version is a DVD copy - so spend the extra 3 bucks for the Blu-ray as you can always take it to a friend's to catch the added feature.<br /><br />\\"Truth is Stranger than Fiction\\" is another added feature  - though this one is shared by both the DVD and Blu-ray which compares and contrasts the real life events with the Hollywood dramatization.  It is also worth viewing.<br /><br />Anyone interested in the behind the scenes aspects of movie making will find the features on the DVD and BLU-RAY a real treat.
0345803493|1.0|\\"Do you know what BDSM is? Bondage, dominance, sadism, and masochism. If you don't know what those words mean, be glad. If you do know, you should understand that the most damaging part of Fifty Shades of Grey is that God created sex to be a partnership that's fueled by love and self-giving, not pain and humiliation. It's not just that this book misuses sex, it redefines it into something evil and transgressive as the lead character dominates in a hurtful manner. How woman can enjoy that, I can't understand! But I do have a theory. It seems to me that in our emasculating culture there is a hunger so great for strong men that women will stoop to BDSM for just a taste. Do yourself a favor, don't!<br /><br />You might be wondering if I've read the book. I haven't. I don't need to. There are many things in this world I need not partake in to discern that they are going to be harmful to me. God has given me more than fifty shades of truth in His Word and when just one of them is in conflict with my entertainment choices, I choose to pass! To be clear: I wouldn't drive my Envoy into the front of an oncoming semi-truck any more than I would open the pages of Fifty Shades of Grey. I love my marriage, my God, and myself too much.\\" Quote from Danna Gresh's Blog<br /><br />I agree completely
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|After all the grief this movie received following a dismal box office performance I did not have high hopes.  Much to my surprise it turned out to be one of the better action flicks I have seen in the last couple of years.  I am regularly disappointed by today's big budget action fare.  JCM certainly exceeded my expectations.  This is the third quality action movie I have seen this in the past month or so (Hunger Games and Avengers being the other two - both a bit better than JCM).  Three in a year, especially this early in the \\"summer\\" season, is a rarity for me.
B00275EHJG|5.0|All of the Toy Story movies were Great! Well written, great animation. This one is about Andy going off to college and parting with his beloved toys. The toys get donated to a daycare by accident and the movie follows them trying to get home to Andy. Something for any age. Just adorable. I cry (or find an excuse to leave the room) every time at the end when Andy gives his toys away for the final time.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for.  I have two five year old boys who wouldn't value the extra frills of bonus features, but really wanted to see all the movies.  The compact packaging doesn't take up much space on the movie shelf and they are loving watching all the movies in order.<br /><br />If you want a bunch of bonus features and are a die hard Potter fan this isn't for you, but for my young family it was perfect and a great value.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I'm directing my review to Rush Fans alone...<br /><br />Rush is the only band I still buy the album of (as supposed to downloading the tunes digitally).  There's something about opening the CD and reading the booklet that only a fan does :)  When the singles came out, \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B,\\" and later \\"Headlong Flight,\\" I was so excited.  These three titles simply ROCKED!  But the release of the full album wasn't the album I expected, to the point I wished Rush hadn't released the singles first.  Still, seeing 2112 on the cover (9:12PM = 21:12 in military time) was a blast!<br /><br />Totally ignoring the Prog-Rock Trio's first full album-length concept story for a second (I'm still mulling over the story, between the lyrics and Neil's added comments in the booklet), songs stand good all on their own.  My recommendation is to ignore the story for now and focus on the music.  Like any Rush enterprise, there's a lot of information to take in and this is just the first week!  What was mediocre yesterday could be today's favorite...  (Such is the life of a Rush fan)  Still, standouts of this album are \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" and \\"The Anarchist.\\"  \\"Headlong Flight\\" remains my favorite; a smile creeps on my face each time it comes up.  \\"BU2B,\\" of course, is a powerful and accessible effort deserving radio time (but this is Rush and that'll never happen) as well as \\"Caravan\\".  I also like the lighter \\"Halo Effect\\"; reminds me of how I felt when listening to \\"Presto\\" or \\"Second Nature.\\"  \\"The Wreckers\\" is also a good effort but it seemed to end too early --was waiting for a closing solo that never flourished (think \\"Bravado,\\" pre-live).  I've never been a fan of fade-out endings to songs (\\"Wish Them Well\\" does this, too).  Just play the end of the song!<br /><br />\\"The Garden\\" is this album's closing title; a seemingly-important distinction in Rush mythios.  I've always been dissatisfied with Rush's album closers --well, after \\"Everyday Glory\\" restored my faith, anyways.  It's difficult to sit \\"The Garden\\" down next to songs like \\"Available Light\\" or \\"Between the Wheels\\" but I must confess the song is inspiring.  Previous efforts \\"Carve Away the Stone\\" and \\"Out of the Cradle\\" were some of my least favorite album enders (and least favorite Rush songs, period).  With Snakes & Arrows' \\"We Hold On\\" brought some confidence back in Rush album-ending tracks. I must confess that \\"The Garden\\" falls into the later category.  It is a great tune that is growing on me (like a fungus) as I listen to it more.  I think this track will become one of my favorites.<br /><br />Power-house album but over-layered and lacking the finesse of Snakes & Arrows.  Still, it's fun and will see a lot of play time.  4-stars.s difficult to sit \\"The Garden\\" down next to songs like \\"Available Light\\" or \\"Between the Wheels\\" but I must confess the song is inspiring.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was searching for some bestsellers to read and came across this. How exactly did this make the bestsellers list?<br />If you are into plain old erotica then fine go ahead and read, if you are a teenager curious about sex then by all means go ahead and read. But for anyone looking for a seriously entertaining novel this will NOT do.<br /><br />The lead character is so daft, I just couldnt comprehend how she blushed and tripped all over herself anytime this man just looked at her. It was just so childlike, after sometime she became difficult to tolerate. She was either crying, blushing, biting her lips or having orgasms at the drop of a hat. I would so prefer at some point if she became a confident sexual woman. What exactly was the story line? seriously?<br /><br />I dont think I will bother to read the rest of these books.

B005RUUUAI|4.0|Okay, so it's actually not delicious, but rather, quite disgusting... brains and rotting zombie corpses and blood and gore...<br /><br />This show is one heck of a ride.  From intriguing characters, to well-done zombie effects, to great locations, to a deep storyline -- more than just zombies, but keeping humanity in a dystopian future apocalyptic society -- this show will keep you entertained from the first bite.<br /><br />Watch it.  It can be cheesy sometimes, and the actors aren't all perfect, but it's a great show and just short enough seasons to get everything in without dragging things out.  Besides, the immersion into the world in which you're hunted and at a disadvantage is pretty scary!

B005LAIGWS|1.0|I like to think of myself as an avid movie watcher and I was hyped about this one. Passed it up in theaters (thankfully) and decided to wait for Bluray. I eagerly checked the mail looking for the red netflix envelope and there it was, popped it in a few hours later and got to watching.<br /><br />Something is just wrong and off about this movie. The acting, the directing style, the plot is wishy-washy, it's hard to exactly put my finger on. I found myself falling asleep within the 1st 30 minutes and finally could not bear it anymore, turned it off. If I had known the same guys who made Crank 1 and 2, I would have passed it up. Now that I think about it, it's totally obvious it was made by the same guys. This falls very short of the 1st one, which was no jewel either but much better than this.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Of course I would love more from Rush, but this would be such a terrific way to go out. For all the press about how this is a concept album like the great seventies pieces, this is the most adventurous Rush has been in sometime, almost like they skipped ahead a few albums worth of progress to record this one. There are moments here where you are like \\"whoa! This is Rush?\\" because they are working for, a very wide palette that includes textures that they have never explored before. I was not fond of \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" for a couple of reasons. I disliked the overproduced sound and missed the positive energy of the eighties and nineties releases on a record that was densely bleak. Everything seems to work better here on an album that works best listening to it all the way through in one sitting. I can't think of a better summation of Rush's career than \\"The Garden,\\" even though that is the least Rushlike thing on here. I find myself wondering where they might go from here after such a triumph. While this may not be the best Rush album, it certainly seems like it will be my favorite.

1781161097|5.0|This book is not a book that traces the production of Prometheus (and various other formats); instead it focuses on several different aspects of the film and describes and illustrates how the film was made. Even a superficial review of the book demonstrates that every image was the result of hours of work by teams of designers expending tremendous artistic and physical energy to the tasks.<br /><br />For example, Ben Proctor, who did most of the design work on the exterior of Prometheus has described the genesis of the images of the Prometheus:<br /><br />&#34;Steve Berg's [who left the project] early illustrations showcased the major features which were of interest to Ridley and Arthur early on -- the four main thrusters which could pivot radically for different modes of flight, a descending airlock which allowed vehicular access to the planet surface, and an overall imposing &#34;oil platform&#34; look when the craft is standing on the ground with all of its work lighting on. There's no question the ship has Nostromo DNA in it, but in continuing Steve's work I also kept in mind Ridley and Arthur's desire for more aeronautical elegance and performance. It's a flagship prospecting vessel, not a &#34;tow truck&#34;, and Ridley said it could hover and dive &#34;like a Blackhawk&#34;. The final result is meant to look muscular but beautiful, with a speedy look but also enough exposed hardware to feel tough and functional. I explored many color schemes and the one Ridley picked is actually a bit Fossian with its bold black and yellow stripes.&#34;<br /><br />It seemed to me that this vision was perfectly realized in the film, and even more pronounced in the images in this beautiful book.<br /><br />The book shows examples of Ridley Scott's basic artistic techniques: he creates &#34;Ridleygrams,&#34; basic storyboards, but enhanced with many, many sketches and ideas. One designer says: &#34;Ridley draws all the time. It's fantastic. Every meeting left us with a pile of Ridleygrams, often loose sketches rather than formal storyboards. These were always scanned and filed, and often proved invaluable.&#34;<br /><br />The exterior shots were a remarkable combination of NASA reference imagery, &#34;especially vortex cloud structures&#34;, aerial shots of real-life locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum. The 3-D extensions were therefore grounded in reality, which comes across beautifully in the still photographs in the book.<br /><br />There are other aspects of the film that are beautifully explored; if you loved the movie, you'll certainly like the book. If you just like movies, you'll learn a great deal. Either way, this is a very enjoyable reading and viewing experience.<br /><br />Robert C.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I got this game because i remember it being the number 1 game for awhile. After i started playing i couldnt stop until i ran out of energy. But honestly the amount of energy is the only bad thing about it
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Good quality, great protection. Easy to use. The Kindle Fire easily slides into the case, zips shut.I bought the lime green color, looks very nice.
B007RKPO84|5.0|If you liked Enemy of God but were less fond of Hordes of Chaos you will love this. Style wise I would sum this up as kind of Enemy of God Part Two. Emphasis is on kind of. Of course its not a carbon copy but it leans in that direction. If there was a an x axis horizontal line with Enemy at -10 (\\"negative\\" has no relationship to music quality) and Hordes at 10 this would be about a -5. I'm not going to go into much detail here and give a review of each song. Its not necessary as Kreator fans know what this is. Get this album. It will stay in your most played like a disease infecting your ears and cranial tissue. Some absolutely killer precision executed solos, melodic rhythm guitar riffs to add balance to the heaviness, and a cast of pro level musicianship. Better \\"production\\" than Hordes to my ears. Its really more of the same style that Kreator has become the last 10 years. Kreator is at such an incredible level that even a basic drum beat, standard guitar riff, etc., sound absolutely incredible. If you are looking for Kreator to change and morph, as many bands do with varying degrees of success, this will not be for you. Its the Kreator we know, all the way to the hilt through your ears. On the negative (if you want to even call it that) there is some riff recycling. But hey this is metal and to be expected. For those new to Kreator that may enjoy this style of metal, this is about as good as it gets.  Kreator is at the top of the game. Purchase Enemy of God also. Then try Coma of Souls and Violent Revolution and go from there. Many label Kreator thrash metal but I feel this is simply metal. To me thrash has a different vibe than this. Just get it.
B004O0TKWG|5.0|Both of these cd's had good audio quality, for the price it's a heck of a deal! The artwork in the cd case will just be the album covers. If you want to update from vinyl and don't mind losing some of the literature this is a good way to go.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|nice game my dad says it's like mario but it's march.please get this game it's awesome! P.S I like it when lep shoots acorns.
B0055OG2BC|3.0|Casino Royale came out at the height of the Summer of Love era.  It's an artifact of that time in many regards, including the production design, the camera angles, the weird effects and the array of actors wafting through the film.  Helmed by too many directors, Val Guest (according to a interview I saw with him) did most of the shooting after the muddled production drove away the other directors and most importantly Peter Sellers.  Uneven, sure, but there are bright moments in the film too. For me, the absolute highlight is Burt Bacharach's music, including the great theme and \\"The Look of Love.\\"  Still, the this version of Casino Royale is fun and a document of the time.  It's not erased by the more recent remake, but stands in contrast to the typical Bond films.  Interestingly, after Casino Royale,  the Bond films, especially with Roger Moore, took a less serious approach, and were almost self-parody.  But Casino Royale is a real parody.

B000PC6A3E|4.0|\\"What the hell are you!?\\". \\"I'm Batman.\\"<br /><br />Batman Begins is the reboot of the Batman movie franchise. The film brings the decades of comics into reality, showing the famous Gotham City with a dark atmosphere, a twisted place where life thrives. The film may linger between action sequences but it provides a slow, understanding of Wayne's struggle dealing with his parent's death, fighting for his city and the innocent people that are trapped in by evil, tying it together with a brilliant cast and strong feel of realism.<br /><br />Liam Neeson serves well as Wayne's mentor and equal in terms of intelligence, teaching him the skills he'll use which will strongly influence himself as Batman. Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne in as much onscreen time as the Dark Knight himself, something previous films lacked, making the Wayne character real & emotional, showing Wayne must perform as an egotistic, selfish, spoiled rich individual to space himself from the crime fighter.<br /><br />Alfred provides a great supporting role as more than a butler, portrayed as a close family friend, with comedic one lines. Michael Caine brings certain elegance to the role, provided great heat in whatever scene he appears. Jim Gordon, like Alfred, has an expanded role in this reboot. Gary Oldman, know normally showcasing villains, shows struggles as a good cop in a department of corruption. Cillian Murphy finally brings the Scarecrow to life, doubling as the scary villain & controlling Dr. Crane of the famous Arkham Asylum.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan directs, showcasing Gotham as dark metropolis, a large city that struggles for survival with or without the aid of a hero. David S. Goyer pens a good origin story, incorporating people, places and things from the comic source material while letting the audience get attached to the characters.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray shows a nice clear picture of the dark Gotham, providing clear audio for dialogue and classical set soundtrack. Extras are plentiful but basic, mainly contains features of making scenes and costumes. The disc itself loads the movie right away; other features must be accessed through the popup menu. Unlike Batman media of the past Begins brings all the comic goodness into reality, making a smart, enjoyable movie for Batman fans and non fans alike.<br /><br />Last Words: A-. The Blu-Ray provides a great casted movie, story wise and picture wise.entiful but basic, mainly contains features of making scenes and costumes.

0345803485|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a sexy romance. FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a very fun addicting relaxing game to play it reminds me a lot of the Sims which are good games and it also is like tiny village which is also a very fun game to play too.
034580404X|5.0|Aside from the grammatical errors, these were three of the most intriguing books I have read in a very long time. I usually don't read such sexually explicit books, but the mystery of each character's makeup and the ultimate love story was just amazing. I just finished all 3 books, and I wish there were 3 more to continue the story. However, since there is no further continuation, I am about to start over and read them again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great tool. It is easy to use and easy to see. I really like it's smooth and quick operating capability.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Best in class for this type of app. Not necessary to buy and download the font pack that it recommends.
B005RAO0GS|1.0|I really used to like this band. But then this album came out and its soo creepy and dark like the singer is possessed or something.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|rock solid thus far. I have it paired with an Asus motherboard, stock sink, super silent fanless power supply[[ASIN:B0040N31C2 Seasonic 460W 80 Plus Gold Fanless ATX12V/EPS12V Power Supply - X-460/SS-460FL]] and the system is running great. Asus automatically overclocked it to 4.1Ghz. Zero issues in 1 month.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it but it should be easier to earn coins. I think that it is to hard to get the coins
B007RI56NY|4.0|Some say they are going commercial but I don't see it that way. I loved Private Nation, that was where I fell in love with Train. From track 1 and beyond it was played over and over...few \\"albums\\" get that ranking from me anymore. I find that each of their songs are so different from the next. Playing for the masses has been what some say but that statement seems silly because I don't see some people truly loving the way they jump from here to there, but I find it fascinating. I just love it!! Yes, I love the popular tunes, but I also appreciate the ones that never got air time. I enjoy that I feel the music whether that feeling is joy or sorrow, they can make me feel it...and that is remarkable these days.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is one of the most coolest games I have played and it is fun.I love this game and I think everyone should play it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game - good for hand/eye.  Interface is decent on the Kindle but sometimes it doesn't respond properly.  Will try adjusting the sensitivity setting.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Loved this story when I was a wee lad and love the latest rendition. Definate plus to my personal collection.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|My stepdaughter loves playing with this app on her kindle fire. It works very well. Only wish it had the ability to save it as a picture.
0345803493|4.0|After reading all the reviews I was a little skeptical of the book but I ended up loving it! Characters remind me very much of Bella and Edward but I read somewhere the author started off writing Twilight fan fictions. Christian is a very dark, somber character, I constantly had to remind myself that he was human and not supernatural. And Ana is a very quiet timid character. Its unlike any book I have ever read before. Can't wait to start the next book!
B0086700CM|1.0|It took andriod/amazon took about six MONTHES longer to get temple than apple did and anyways I got sick of this game after one week of playing it on my iphone !!!!AMAZON $%#@ YOU
B002M9WW30|5.0|Fast shipping got it in only a couple of days, I love the Rocky movies and instead of buying each on seperate at a higher price this was perfect for what I was looking for.
