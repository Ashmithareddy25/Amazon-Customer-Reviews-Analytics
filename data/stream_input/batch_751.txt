1586210912|5.0|I read Rich Dad Poor Dad (including Cashflow Quadrant) over three years ago. Then, I had a start-up business I was running. It was small and challenging, but promising. After reading the books, in addition to the business, I started what rich dad would advise: building my asset column as an investor. I got deeply involved investing in (and trading) shares and currencies; and unconsciously, started lagging in my start-up.    As I was listening to the audiobooks a few days ago, I re-assessed my goal toward financial freedom. I realized that I had succeeded as much as failed. I had succeeded with my gradual move into the \\"Investor\\" quadrant. But, I had not succeeded in moving my business from the \\"self-employed\\" quadrant into the \\"business-owner\\" quadrant. I had failed in creating a system. As a result, running the business as self-employed was taking its toll and even reducing potential cash-flow into my asset column.    Reading Rich Dad Poor Dad (and Cashflow Quadrant) three years ago positively altered my financial path. Listening to it three years later retraced my steps where I had derailed, and entrenched them where I was on course. It's not enough to read or listen to it once. It is a guide that MUST be consulted at every phase of one's financial journey.

B000JLSM00|4.0|This is a great movie. However this movie has a lot of age on it (1956) so the acting, like in all movies of this time, is simply carried out in a different approach. Once you get passed this you can really appreciate the movie.    What really blows you away, is the picture quality of this BD...absolutely beautiful!! Hard to believe it debuted 52 years ago.

0143038419|1.0|This is pap. Because it is a selection by one member of our book group I felt forced to read beyond 40 pages which is my upper limit for quiting a book. The writer is self-serving, whiney, superficial and has the nerve to call this, in effect, a spiritual search. You don't need to travel to find compassion which she seems to be in short shrift of, to see the world as a complex place which she seems to miss since she is always and only looking through her eyes, and to be celebate for a year which she seems to think is lusting with eyes, taste, and imagination but not in actual fact which makes her more spiritual. Run from this self-serving monologue.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I recently bought this box set on Amazon for an amazing price. I am a huge fan of the Blade Runner movie. This box set has 5 different versions of the movie and all 5 have a distintly different take on the film. This is an excellent buy for fans of the movie. You will not be disappointed
B000W4HJ44|5.0|If you like the music of the 1960s and you enjoy a non-complex story of a young girl who wants to be popular and works so hard at it, you will love this movie.  John Travolta was simply tremendous as the mom.  His makeup is as great as Mrs. Doubtfire's and his humor with Christopher Walken as the straight guy who really loves his daughter and mitigates the strong influence of his \\"wife\\" make this movie totally believable.  \\"Her\\" (his) line of \\"being big in not this family's problem\\" still leaves me laughing.  Michelle Pfeiffer's character, the producer of the dance show on TV, is simply aweful.  She is a biggot, totally arogant, and has the agenda of promoting her daughter as as star to the expense of all else except her own ego.  Michelle does a superby job in her role. Queen Lativa could not have done a more outstanding job in her role as the organizer of the \\"black dancers\\" on the American Bandstand knock-off TV show when she and her group are occasionally put in front of the cameras when the white kids are given a day off.  It is a wonderful \\"rebellion movie\\" when kids defy the cultural restriction of race and untimately join together and have great fun together.  The DVD also contains a terrific movie about the production of Hairspray.  Your toe will be tapping during the entire movie.

B000092ZYX|4.0|I own 3 Radiohead albums.  This one, \\"Ok Computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\".  Stylistically I find \\"Hail To The Chief\\" to fall squarely in between these other two.  There are elements of both albums to be found here, yet \\"Hail\\" is not really like either one of them in many ways.  Overall I do not like this album as well.  The material has a lot of peaks and valleys.  When it is good it is very good, but I can find other parts of the album are almost sleep inducing.  The disc really starts out strong with the first 3 cuts \\"2+2=5\\", \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" and \\"Sail To The Moon\\", but the rest of the album tends to meander a bit too much.  I respect the fact that these guys are always pushing boundaries and it is to be expected with a band like this that some of their sonic explorations will bare fruit while others will not pay off.  Overall the album is certainly worth owning for fans of the band or modern progressive rock, but as an overall piece of music I think it is a slight let down from their best material.
B000WBZ5M0|3.0|It was worth watching but I like George Clooney and Brad Pitt but it wasn't the best movie I have ever seen. It is an Ocean's movie and kinda same ole same ole thing.

B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead are progressive rock for the new millennium.  Old school prog rock fans may not want to admit it, but what this band does is every bit a groundbreaking as their counterparts back in the 70's.  Thom York's voice may take a bit of getting used to, and instrumentally they are not flashy, but these guys make challenging music that begs for a serious listen.  \\"Ok Computer\\" is probably their best album, and although it is not really commercial at all it did receive a significant amount of attention from radio which considering the material here is encouraging.  The music is a mix of electronic, alternative, and progressive rock.  The band (and especially this album) seems to get lumped in with Pink Floyd a lot and I can see the comparison.  Raidohead really does not sound that much like Floyd, but more like what Floyd might sound like had they formed in the 90's instead of the 60's.  The album is a concept piece that about human's alienation from society that flows together as a cohesive whole.  You will get much more out of it listening to it as an entire album than as individual tracks.  The bottom line is I really enjoy this album and it is nice to see people getting behind something that is truly an alternative to most of the crap heard on the radio today.
B000TFINY6|5.0|The third season of Lost on Blu-ray looks absolutely amazing, and the show isn't too bad either.  The episodes flow and mesh together much better than in the second season.  Some of the darker scenes seemed to have quite a bit of noise to the image, but this is a minor gripe and may be partially attributed to my television. (Samsung LNT5265F).  The extras are also plentiful and much better than the other two seasons.  All and all, a very good buy from a very good site.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|I believe this must be the worst adaptation ever made of \\"Persuasion.\\"  (I know of no competition for the distinction.)  I give it one star because it is not possible to award none.  It is as though scriptwriter Simon Burke knew and worked from an exceedingly abridged version of the novel.  He turned Austen's characters into sticks.  Her carefully depicted relationships among them and the equally careful mechanics of her plot aren't here.  For example, Captains Harville and Benwick are reduced to ciphers and their part in Austen's central consideration of whether men or women are faithful longer is obliterated, and her use of a pivotal discussion of the subject as a means to bring Anne and Wentworth together is absent.  Again, what Mrs. Smith has to tell Anne about William Elliot must be a mystery to anyone who doesn't know the novel.  In fact, her role in this version is so marginal that it would have been better to cut it altogether since her only significance in the story (as opposed to helping to show an aspect of Anne's character, which is also pretty much missing) is what she has to tell about Elliot.  Further, Burke either knows nothing or chooses to ignore the social mores of the time, most flagrantly in the concluding sequence of Anne chasing Wentworth through the streets of Bath, which is utterly preposterous.  Finally, Wentworth could not buy Kellynch as a wedding present for Anne; the estate is entailed and could not be sold by Sir Walter.       Given the script and the hole-in-the-corner production, it may not be fair to judge the cast too much, but what we get is not very good.  Sally Hawkins's Anne certainly does not \\"bloom,\\" and she doesn't show behavior that makes the viewer accept her as always the best person to deal with a situation.  Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Wentworth mostly pouts.  Neither he nor Peter Wight as Admiral Croft looks as though he'd ever been to sea in so much as a rowboat.  (In fact, the whole naval background of the novel ismostly ignored.)  Julia Davis as Anne's supposedly \\"beautiful\\" older (by only two years) sister looks (and behaves) more like a middle-aged stepmother.  Tobias Menzies has nothing of the oily deviousness of William Elliot.  The only cast member who really looks the part is Sarah Buckland as Nurse Rooke, but she is used here only as set decoration rather than an important source of information for Anne.  Anthony Head is a passable Sir Walter Elliot.       There seems to be no 100% satisfactory adaptation of \\"Persuasion\\" available.  The two contenders are an adaptation by Julian Mitchell from Granada TV in 1971 and one by Nick Dear from  the BBC and WGBH in 1995.  The Mitchell comprises five 60-minute episodes and, therefore, includes much more detail from the novel.  The Dear has a much stronger cast and production.  Its 104-minute running time is a far better adaptation of the original than the new Burke although it runs only 11 minutes longer.  The Dear also has Anne doing several things that would not have been possible at the time, but they are much less egregious than in the Burke.  I suggest you get both -- the Mitchell (for completeness) and the Dear (for the best production) and leave the Burke to sink from sight as quickly as possible.

B00004XONN|5.0|After the massive success of their big breakthrough album \\"Ok Computer\\" one might expect Radiohead to sit back and try to capitalize on it's success with a clone album.  Instead the band gets even more experimental with \\"Kid A\\".  They drop much of the guitar out of the mix and instead focus even more on electronic music.  The result is another winner that is a treat to listen to on a good stereo system or especially with headphones.  From it's opening line \\"today I woke up sucking on a lemon\\", to it's closing notes the album is another testament to modern intelligent progressive rock.  The band even ad a horn section to the mix in songs like \\"A National Anthem\\" to mix it up even further.  Although \\"OK Computer\\" remains the band's masterpiece I like this one almost as well.  It is another step forward in the evolution of Radiohead.

B00009V7P8|5.0|This stunning Damien Rice offering is by turns imperfect, soulish, quirky, self-absorbed, and fantastic.<br /><br />Rice's persuasive voice is complemented with uncommon tact by gorgeous female accompaniment. Though it never ceases to be a Damien Rice album, Lisa Hannigan and her friends are so good that they play a solid supporting role without which Rice would not be what he is. Almost the same can be said of the understated by skillful acoustic guitar that encircles Rice's voice throughout `O''s tenspot of tracks.<br /><br />One cannot escape the notion that there was some enjoying of wine as this album was perceived and executed and that it is best enjoyed beside a bottle of something red. The image, at the least, gets at the tone and substance of his artistry and the soft-ish reflection that his songs embody.<br /><br />Among the album's many fine tracks, one deserves special mention: `Can't Take My Eyes Off of You' is an exquisite restatement of an old tune, masterfully accomplished in the way that remakes too often are not.<br /><br />This album came to this reviewer from his son as a Christmas gift. I was unfamiliar with Damien Rice. On the strengths of this album, that will change.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Part of the reason of The Lord of the Rings movies success is due to the awesome score that Howard Shore has so magnificently created. A trully brilliant piece of art that pulls you into the world of Middle-Earth and keeps you there. You seldom hear genius any more, but this soundtrack is a stunning reminder that it still exists. The music raises its tempo gracefully with its drums without falling. It uses the choir and Celtic influences brilliantly. Each track fits the next like a hand in the glove. The music screams its power to submerse you in the magic of the Lord of the Rings. It gives you the chance to feel like you really were there buried under the mountain resting for eternity. It makes you feel the sadness of the elves, great and eternal beings. It shows the strength of men and the power of fellowship. It successfully creates a mood for the Hobbits and their Shire. Its power will not be lost on an artistic mind. Not many soundtracks have the power to force your mind into a dreaming, yet realistic world. This score really is something. Something that can last the test of time. Something that stands a head above the rest. It and the rest of the musical trilogy are trully the greatest score of them all.
B000W4KT64|1.0|The best part of this movie is that it's eventually over!  I was very excited when I found out about the remake.  I thought it would be a fantastic twist to see a great story turned into a musical.  Then, I watched it. John Travolta does a fantastic Sly Stallone impersonation; he doesn't utter one audible word trying to replicate the character Divine made legendary.  First, pull an all-star cast together and none of them get to show their own personalities (rather just \\"mimic\\" the orignal cast). Next, make nonsense out of the story line just to add a lot of PAINFUL musical numbers that are vaguely remeniscent of the 1960's.  Finally, take the serious racial issues made clear in the original version and just making shock value.  The result is disaster.      If you like this movie, I suggest you rent or buy the original version - you'll be plesantly surpised.  If you haven't bought this movie, don't waste your money.  If  I could rate this with a \\"negative star\\" I would.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Those who ask me about this film usually regret it by the time I'm done, being shortly overwhelmed by effusive praise; unless I warn them ahead of time to request the short version.  :-/  The best part about this film (and there are many excellent parts which create a stunning whole) is that it's TRUE.  These people existed, these ideals and moral imperatives existed, this battle was actually fought, and was actually won.  The success of the endeavor is what brings the tears to your eyes.  Cinematically it's gorgeous.  The acting is solid all the way through with many familiar faces (if you keep up with A&E/BBC).  The music is excellently styled to be a support to the storytelling and not a detractor.  As far as content goes, I felt the film makers did a terrific job handling hard material.  Everything is tasteful, but you get the idea.  Honestly what is said is more horrifying than what is seen.  But that's the whole point.  People needed to know, then as now, that atrocities were being committed.  I particularly appreciate the fact that this film shows the birth of the \\"people\\" movement.  It was the people of Britain that rose up in indignation, signed petitions and, ultimately, dictated to Parliament.  That had never been done before, and we must remember that we can still avail ourselves of that privilege.  Besides, we have more than twenty-thousand ghosts to deal with.  In our culture of death on demand, the tally is passed 40 million.  And that's just unborn children.

B000W9EOEC|5.0|Recorded live(obviously) over two nights in the duo's hometown of Paris, France. Daft Punk deliver an mind melting slice of Techno heaven.     the mixes featured on this album are nothing short of stunning. the atmosphere of the night is captured just about as well as it can be on a live record.     Alive 2007 is the perfect CD to put on before you go out as this will get you in the mood for a party.     on a side note, Daft Punk were on the bill for a music festival I was at this summer, and I decided not to watch them, that is on my list of regrets.

It took about the first 150 pages or so, and then something clicked and I couldn't put it down. Normally I'm a fast reader, but this took me a week and a half of evenings. As for the after effects, there was something about this book...consider it a mental laxative. I think RAW would see the truth and humor of that.

B000YAFJYS|4.0|Marjane Satrapi presents the first part of her autobiographical series, based on the graphic novel of the same name. For those of you who haven't read the book, this movie has little in the way of plot - well, that's true of most people's lives. Instead, the fascination comes from the movie's sense of reality. Marji starts as a precocious and sometimes scary little girl of six or so, and matures into her early twenties as we watch. She gives some idea of what a child sees in the blast rubble that used to be a neighbor's house (and what used to be the neighbor). When she attends school, we see her as the permanent outsider, among but never truly of her peers' society. Then, when she returns to her family in Teheran, she brings her European sensibility into a nation teetering on the edge of repressive theocracy. She has become a stranger in her own country and family, and maybe in her own life.<br /><br />A few things leap out at a Western viewer. One might be Marjane's intense political awareness, from a very early age. It makes sense, though. She's a grand-daughter very few generations away from someone who ruled Iran, then was overthrown a handful of overthrows ago. In a nation where clan feuds recall events hundreds of years back, that puts her practically on the front line, even as a child. Her family name, Satrapi, long ago entered the English language as \\"satrap,\\" a mid-eastern ruler. No wonder she went to sleep with bedtime stories of her uncle's imprisonment and torture.<br /><br />The other striking feature of this movie is its stark visual style. People are simple line drawings, with blocky black or white patches for clothing. Backgrounds generally resemble ink wash on a rough-surfaced watercolor paper. Color doesn't exist until the very last moment - perhaps a foreshadowing of a sequel to come, more than an actual part of this movie's narrative. The simplicity won't appeal to everyone. As much as I like animation and graphic novels, I have mixed feelings about it. Still, I can't imagine this plain, stark story being told in any visual idiom less plain and stark than the movie's. Somehow, it all blends perfectly into a coming of age story that leaves triteness behind in the political prisons or urban battlefields of Marjane's growing-up years.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release.I can't imagine this plain, stark story being told in any visual idiom less plain and stark than the movie's.

I went to Best Buy right away to see if the CD there with the extra tracks was cheaper or a good price in general. It was on sale. . . total cost 12.99.....Two more cents for two extra tracks....Bought it. Ran right home....mind you this is only a couple hours after I placed my order and Amazon now says I can't cancel my order....Poo.

1582701709|5.0|The Secret has changed my life.  Place your order in the universe and just wait for the outcome.  You get what you want if you truly believe you can have it.  Life is wonderful... you can't afford not to read and live this book.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This set is a must-have for any serious fan of the movie.  It has the original version released in theatres, with Harrison Ford's \\"Mickey Spillane\\"-type voiceover to help the less than attentive viewers keep track.  It also has the director's cut without the voiceovers that has been prevalent in recent years; it has additional footage with Decker (and the audience) questioning his own origins.  And an additional cut I will leave for you to discover.    And all the way through there is the beautiful, bleak but plausible future and Vangelis' haunting score.  Buy this, and enjoy
B00005K3OT|5.0|Interesting romantic film dealing with unsavory aspects of human nature while maintaining a positive feel - a rare thing that!  This is a \\"feel good\\" movie that I would recomment highly.  So highly that this was purchased as a gift!
B000687M48|5.0|Awesome DVD.  If you like Evanescence, you are going to love this concert video.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is my favorite series on TV.  It is only obvious that I should own the DVD sets from every season.  The series is great, not the norm for network TV.  As far as supernatural phenomenon, it takes events to a whole new twisted level with two good-looking and amusing brothers to escort you.  Just a break from the ho-hum.
0790729350|4.0|when  I received this product it was scratched on side 2.<br />This was NOT supposed to be a used item...returning it would mean a huge headache, so I kept it.<br />Other than that the music/artist and concert goers brought me back to 1969.<br />I only wish my parents were hippies and I could have gone. I was 10 and would've loved and did love rock music in 1969.<br />If only some of those musicians what have made it through without losing their life. What a different world music would've been.
B000056NX5|5.0|I am so glad i purchased this for my husband. We have the vhs version, but as we have discovered, The DVD versions seem to be so much clearer, and as far as sound, WOW!. Awesome. The extras are great and full of information we had no idea about. And Glenn Carter can hit notes that leave alot of singers in the dust. As does the rest of the cast. I am so glad this came out on DVD.
0385486804|3.0|This book wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Krakauer did a great job researching and digging up facts about the main character, but I thought there was a level of bias and opinion that did not need to be interjected into the book. The story itself is fascinating enough to make it worth the read. Is it worth buying? I think you'd be better off going to the library.
140130916X|5.0|After losing my partner I was not sure about seeing the movie so decided to read the book first.  Pleasantly surprised.  Couldn't put the book down.  Have ordered all the other books from this author!
B000NIVJHM|5.0|As far as i can say, This edition being on DVD, Is by far the best. The audio rocks. I can actually hear full conversations and birds i never knew were in the background and no lines and scrating going through it. The extra Dvd  with the bonus features are wonderful. And wow the auditions are fantastic. As you can tell i love it and so does my husband. All in all this is great. I am so glad we got it.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is the best thing I've ever seen, thank's to sir David Attenborough.  Thank's also to amazone US to ship this to europe, because here nobody sell it, because no one know that there is no zonning for this Blu-ray.  French subtitles are often wrong but it doesn't matter.
0060899190|4.0|Fast delivery, nice transaction.  Only thing was the last page of book was torn.
B000R8YC3G|5.0|Wonderful gory parody of zombie classics mixed with British humour that is sure to entertain.
0765350386|4.0|I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who has discovered and devoured Brandon Sanderson of late - I'm an avid Robert Jordan fan (RIP) and with the news that Sanderson was going to complete the final Wheel of Time novel I knew I had to \\"get to know\\" the author.     Suffice it to say.. I am pleased with the choice.
B000W1V7KE|2.0|The quality of the HD on the disc that I got was no better than the DVD copy on the other side.  I really can't tell the difference. Really disappointing.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Radiohead is one of those bands that comes up with something different and new with each album they create. There are few musicians talented enough to do this. The new album, \\"In Rainbows\\" is very beautiful in the saddest way. Anyone who appreciates music should give it a listen.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|I have always been a die hard TNG fan, so I was very happy to buy the entire series.  I was disappointed when it arrived, and the 3 green plastic cartridges that hold the dvds were chipped. This was caused by vibrations during shipping.  Since there was nothing inserted between the cartridges, they moved around during shipping.  Many of the dvds had come loose from the plastic holder that holds them in place through the hole in the dvd. Still, no dvds were damaged or scratched because of the casing flaw.    The basic design of the packaging is brilliant in its space saving.  It just needs to be reworked to be more suitable for shipping.    Other than that, what a show! Wow!
1428156585|4.0|This first-hand narrative, read by the author, describes her early childhood in Somalia, her ritualistic genital mutilation, her treatment as a lesser being than males, her arranged marriage and finally her escape to freedom. Ayn Kirsi Ali became a member of Dutch parliament, but after she participated in making a film documentary critical of Islam's treatment of women,  a Fatwah was issued calling for her death.  The producer of the movie, a Dutch national, was murdered in the street by a muslim fanatic.  This book sets forth in passionate detail Kirsi Ali's journey.  It is fascinating, and once I got through the first disc, read in Ali's unusual but pleasant accent, I was thoroughly hooked.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is definately a must for sci-fi and Blade Runner fans, five versions of the film, the Final cut is remastered perfectly and includes a dolby True HD lossless audio.  This is a classic collectors item and it should be in your library of blu rays.  Picture is stunning on the final cut, for an old film this looks amazing and you can see why they said it was way ahead of its time when it was originally released in 1982.  For the price of around £25 import to the uk, its well worth it.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|If you are a Superman/Christopher Reeve fan, you should see this version of the movie.  I can't say it was better than the theatrical release, but it was certainly interesting to see some of the scenes not used in the theatrical film, and some that should have been left in.  I am sure with the glut of 3 hour plus movies in recent history, that if this film had been released now, it would have been much longer.  The extended prison scenes with Ned Beatty and the later scenes with Valerie Perrine and Gene Hackman were funny; and the scenes with Marlon Brando and Reeve make the \\"Smallville\\" TV show make more sense, with the interplay between   Jor-El and Clark.  My biggest complaint was the way the dvd was packaged and shipped by Amazon.  The dvd case was cracked and missing the whole corner due to transit damage.  Thankfully, the disc itself was intact and played without incident.
B0001IN080|4.0|The CD is containing very nice songs , great performence, however the DVD part is almost only biography talk. I have purchased it for the DVD, I thought it is going to be a nice concert, that dissapointed me. I am listning to the CD in my car and it is great.
B00005MP58|5.0|The BBC did the definitive adaptation of this wonderful Jane Austin novel.  The cast and locations are brilliant.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Amazing movies, great aerial shots and mostly unique material.<br />Great to watch for the whole family.<br /><br />And of course the voice of David Attenborough is perfect.<br /><br />One to have!
0525950079|3.0|Not strictly a continuation of Pillars of the Earth, but written about the time following that story. Many of the characters were one dimensional, either all good or all evil. Rather melodramatic (a new crisis every minute) but it held my interest. I enjoyed reading about the England of the 12th century.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|We owe Kenny and family/friends a special thanks for doing this. BUY-IT, it's a treasure to own in every way. Fantastic view into the lives & great music of the REAL Bluesman we have left.
B000PA0V68|3.0|On the whole, I don't like abridged books because I usually find, when I get to read an unabridged version, that the parts cut out have the kind of details I enjoy reading.  I've had this for many years and I saved it for one reason:  the illustrations.  Most of them are very nice and worth having even if one has a complete copy of the books contained in it.  I've read THE STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE and THE NINETY-AND-NINE only once (in my copy of this volume), but I read the others many times when I was young.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|The third season of Stargate Atlantis felt a bit uneven to me, but it's still very good. Several pivotal events occur in Season 3, so it's fairly essential to the overall series.     I'm always very impressed with the special effects and how they're used on the show. Space battles are three-dimensional and very beautifully rendered. This is an excellent series for surround sound systems. There's an excellent balance of SFX to standard filming.     The cast is solid and while character development isn't one of the best features of action-adventure sci-fi in general, there's enough here to allow us to connect with the characters.
B000002KOQ|2.0|In all fairness, I've made it a point over the years to listen to EVERY album that Joni Mitchell has released, comparing it to the work of whoever her current peers were at that time. After over 40 years, I can say in all honesty the following statements:    1. Her voice was/is AWFUL in all but the first two albums(\\"Song To A Seagull\\", \\"Clouds\\")and it's gotten successively WORSE with each new release, thanks to age and misuse. Oh, and her smoking three packs of cigarettes a day didn't help either.    2. Her songs are lacking in humor, whimsy, charm and imagination by and large-starting from her third album on forward. A perfect example:have a listen to \\"Willy\\". If it DOESN'T make you gag then you'd better go straight to your doctor and have your gag reflex checked out! Poor Graham Nash! This song is SOOO BAD I can quite believe it just might have provided the impetus to END that love affair altogether!    Her songs therein are so self-indulgent, overly serious and limited in their scope of the world around us that I honestly can't imagine why ANYONE would consult Joni's musical vision in order to obtain an ACCURATE overview of a time period and the notable individuals therein.     This album in particular brings to full realization all of those artistic weak points of Joni's mentioned above. Her songs in this album are truly specious in their depictions of that highly creative and original time period of culture and music. Joni's associations with the many fascinating denizens of Topanga Canyon was severely LIMITED to   only the rich and priviledged elite, save for a walk down Venice's famed boadwalk to have a peek at it's street performers(\\"For Free\\"). Her limited associations and experiences within that particular scene are all too evident in this album to anyone who truly WAS there and experienced it first-hand.    For folks who want a REAL, fully-realized vision and overview of that culture within \\"The Canyon\\" I suggest you check out the many fine albums of FRANK ZAPPA, and the excellent, highly underrated work of THE GTO's in particular. You can also get some truly inspiring and evocative  glimpses into that culture's TRUE visionaries by reading the poems of JIM MORRISON written at that time:they will truly ROCK YOUR WORLD!    To complete your experience of that time and culture, do check out  the groundbreaking work Jim was creating with THE DOORS, as well as the superlative body of work done by ARTHUR LEE & LOVE, and that of an  absolutely seminal singer/songwriter who-although lauded highly by industry insiders and virtually every notable Rock artist I have ever met-is virtually forgotten today by the general public:SEAN BONNIWELL.    As for folks who just want to put on an album of high-quality Folk and Folk-Rock music and be mesmerized by a female voice that really DOES  deliver the goods, take a tip I got from Bob Dylan:  Listen to JOAN BAEZ.    Here was a female Folk singer who actually DID reach a lofty height of technical and artistic SHEER BRILLIANCE in her performances that lesser singers like Mitchell and Collins only aimed for then and today. As the old saying goes:Accept no substitutes, demand the ORIGINAL & THE BEST!
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot is special.  It's a film that manages to delight and inspire without treacly cliche and obvious sentimental drivel.  Creativity, individuality, art and personal drive must battle it out against tradition, family expectations, homophobia and economics.  A triumph.
B000BCE918|5.0|This 3-disc boxset contains all three Jurassic Park movies. This is probably the last time they will be released together before an HD-DVD or BluRay release, so if you haven't gotten them yet, this is the perfect time to. At a price of about one of the movies individually, you can own them all.    Content on the DVD's are the same as the original releases.
B000XCZGV8|4.0|Most people missed this unique gem from one of cinema's great visionary directors.  David Fincher arguably delivers his most mature film in this fascinating and beautiful crime drama about obsession.  One of the top films of 2007.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|If you liked the first two moives, you will love this one also. Very entertaining. You know the drill, the movies are very similar.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This has become my new flash of choice.  I love its compact size and durable build.  It performs flawlessly in TTL with my D300, giving me great results bounced or direct.  The only downside is that you can't use this as a remote flash.  That's fine for me, because I use the SB800 for that.
B000002534|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites.  I have actually purchased this CD at least 5 times.  That is exactly how great I feel it is.  I'm sure you will enjoy this cd, as much or more, as I do.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Exactly what I wanted and expected.  It came in a very timely manner.  It was in great shape just as explained in the details.  If you are ready to get LOST now is the time.  Its easy to catch up with the seasons no commercials no waiting a week.  Check it out you will be addicted!!!!!!
B000A2IPPK|5.0|This is a classic movie for the whole family. It should be in every video fan's collection. I bought this DVD to replace my VHS tape which has been enjoyed for many years by myself and my children who are now grown. I will pass the VHS tape along to my grandchildren.
0124297854|5.0|A very good compendium of organic reactions with nice color coded mechanisms. If you are in the organic chemistry field you should have this book.
B000W4HJ44|3.0|Great cast of actors wasted their time on this \\"want to be a hit\\" movie.  They tried...but it just didn't make the grade.  I guess the time for good musical comedy or Hollywood spectactulars has passed.  Even John Travolta couldn't save this one.
0300108834|5.0|I bought this book, based on other reviews, with very little knowledge about history.  The is the PERFECT book to learn about history.  I'm not a big reader of books besides computer manuals, but now I'm intrigued enough to dive a little deeper into the past.  When I got the book, I was going to take it one chapter at a time, but I couldn't put it down.  It's an easy read.  A lot of wars have been fought, lives sacrificed, people persecuted for their religion, and........well, you'll just have to read the book to find out.  : )
B000A6T262|5.0|This is among the best deals in the DVD universe. Most people either love Star Trek or hate it. If you love it, this is simply a must own. I think I paid 80 bucks for it. That's 8 bucks per 2-disc Special Edition--what other box sets offer so much for so little? The bonus features are all excellent, and there are a lot of them: interviews with cast members, making of vignettes, alternate/deleted scenes, special effects how-to's, etc. As soon as this box-set came out, I wanted it, and I'm so glad I finally anted up. My girlfriend has even gotten into the films.
B000YKFJ66|2.0|This movie died at the end. When you see that Nicholas Cage had seen the last 30 minutes of the movie in a vision, the movie died quickly.
B0000844I8|5.0|I really enjoyed this dvd since I am an avid Space Channel geek.  I have watched the series forever, and when I found the dvd at Amazon I was delighted.  It was so easy to order it and it arrived in a timely fashion.  I could not find the movie any other place.  Thank you for great service!
B000WQ9UA8|2.0|I'm a big Britney fan. And this review has nothing to do with the drama she's been causing lately. With that said I must say that this album doesn't even merit the description \\"Ear Candy\\". It's barely even music!  1st of all this is completelly computerized. You could get a 4 year old and a computer and make something just as good, if not better.  2nd If your buying this song because of how good Gimme More was (as I did) you will be sorely dissapointed. Nothing, may I repeat NOTHING, on this Album is as good.  3rd this is obviously only an album to be bounced at the Strip Clubs, the only reason you sould consider buying this album is if you are 1. Wasted 2. A DJ or 3. Hate yourself.
B000059RL3|5.0|I like every song on this album/It mellows me out and listen to the word it has a lot to say
0156027321|4.0|Just a quick note on this book; It is a really good story. Good for teenagers and adults and my favorite part of the book is the first couple of chapters. Although the rest of it was just as good, I really loved reading the beginning. I tend to like true-life stuff more than anything and I really loved that about the beginning of this book. It turns into what I call a fantasy after a while, but it's still very good. It's captivating.<br /><br />4 stars because I would have liked to have known more! The ending goes too fast for me.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is not your average novelist.  Delivering stunning descriptions and emotions in \\"The Kite Runner\\", Hosseini continues sharing his amazing insights in \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\".  Not many men can write women well - Hosseini is a natural at it.<br /><br />The book revolves around two women, very different from each other - one a bastard daughter of a wealthy businessman and a psychologically unstable maid, the other a well-cared for daughter of a middle class Kabul family.  While the Soviets destroy Afghanistan and civil was ensues, the two fundamentally different women's destinies draw them to each other, until they become members of the same family, due to unfortunate circumstances.  At first enemies, the two women bond through their common suffering at the hands of the man made powerful by the Taliban's Shari'a law.<br /><br />Almost impossible to put down, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" allows us to look at some of the most secluded creatures on earth - Afghan women under Taliban.  Hopeful and depressing, revealing and shocking, emotional and educational, the novel will definitely not leave you indifferent.  Highly recommended.
B00005JPUN|3.0|God forbid Hollywood can come up with an original story.  This remake was pretty lame.  Glad I didn't pay for it.  Rented it at video store.
B00005JPTI|4.0|Will Smith is Lieutenant Colonel Dr Neville, a Manhattan dweller who is working on a cure for a cure-for-cancer-gone-awry virus that infected the globe shortly after outbreak.  Neville is immune to both the airborne and contact strains of the virus.  Having ended up with just his dog, Sam, Neville loses touch with social skills and mores, becoming a lonely (and exceptionally buff and good looking) man who talks to mannequins.<br /><br />Excellent acting by Smith (as always), great screenplay and computer generation for the most part, \\"I Am Legend\\" simply flows and differs from typical films of the genre in that it is elegant and classy.  The zombies that the virus created are over-the-top for this film, and the ending came too fast, as if the director suddenly got bored and decided he'd had enough.  Be that as it may, this is one of the better horror movies I have seen in a while, and Will Smith is always a pleasure to watch.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Wonderful movie of my favorite period book.  Have watched it over and over.  Highly recommend.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|You know why you want to own the DVD collection. You hope to be able to view the LOST series from the beginning and solve the mystery before anyone else.  What you may find especially interesting, is one of the Bonus Features that shows \\"a day in the making of LOST\\". It is a condensed version of what takes place each 14-hour day from the standpoint of all the departments involved.   A truly mindboggling amount of planning and organization is involved. Fascinating to watch. Enjoy!
6305907145|2.0|Did not like the story.  Quality is good and color excellent.  Just not a good story.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The husband may scoff, and no, it does not seem like the most sturdy thing ever made, but I cannot stop smiling whenever I use this.  I'm not too sure about getting refills and such, or if it would even be truly worth it to bother.  That's not really the point though, is it? Now, if you'll excuse me, it's late at night and I have a lot of cabinets to put up...
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This was an amazing season!  There were so many mysteries.  No sooner was one solved than another was created.  Action packed to the very last.  The pitch for Season 4 is included in this set - and it would have been a great one.  I can't believe the show was cancelled.  Buy all three seasons and enjoy every last second you can.  I have yet to meet someone who didn't love this show.  I will miss it.
0143113100|5.0|The news of the plasticity of the brain is an exciting discovery for those challenged by paralysis,memory loss,learning disabilities,a stroke, an aging brain etc.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This product does all that it claims.  I LOVE it.  I did my whole house the day I got it.
0440238609|5.0|In less than 2 weeks time, (1st book took me one week, 2nd book took me 8 hours, and the 3rd took me about the same or less) I read this series and loved how it made me feel and think.  It doesnt finish very strong or dramatically, but its shocking, dramatic, and trilling the entire way through.  I wasnt a complete fan of the Mulefa, but everything else was awesome.
B000026OW3|5.0|Perhaps no other pianist is so indelibly linked to one composer's music than Artur Rubinstein is to the works of Chopin. One might think of Glenn Gould & Bach, but even the renowned Canadian virtuoso's recordings of JSB are not held in such high esteem as Rubinstein's Chopin catalog. Rubinstein has such an affinity for this music,and performs the works with such a master's touch, that the listener immediately developes an especially affectionate bond with this marvellous 11-cd set from RCA Victor.These performances are some of the absolutely great treasures in the history of recorded music. They have such a wide appeal that they instantly become a must have for your cd library, made all the more tempting by the super-bargain price offered on this re-mastered box set.<br />Highly recommended & definitely not to be missed!
0385340559|5.0|This is my first Lee Child book, but it definitely will not be the last. The characters were clearly drawn, the action was riveting and the plot took plausible but unexpected twists. This was the best book I've come across in a long while.
B000ZN8036|3.0|I very much liked the book Into the Wild, but somehow the movie misses what the book captured, it shows a very naive young man who acts very immature and insecure. I disliked how Chris was always shown running around and jumping off of ledges, overall it just reminded me of how a child acts. Also the way he acted around the hippie guy and also the Hal Holbrook character was very submissive and childlike. Chris was twenty five years old around these times it just really set me off the whole movie. I was really expecting to see Chris put his arms out like wings when he was running down the beach, and make an airplane noise. I really think that this movie could have been much better if Chris was presented in the right light. The book made him seem edgier rougher. For instance when the guy giving him a ride to the stampede gave him a ride ,asked if he had a hunting license, he said he did not need the F@$*ing government telling him to eat or not. Overall nice scenery somehow misses the character of a misunderstood man, comes up with an immature crybaby.
B0009UC810|5.0|A classic movie, Great music.  Probably the wildest car chase in a movie.  Very quick delivery too.  I ordered another item as well, but returned it with no hassle at all.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Wonderful and fresh.  Her voice is so clean and sharp, you can really feel the emotion in her lyrics.  Not the typical beat driven pop hash that the record producers are trying to force feed the \\"YOUNG\\" public.
0307120007|5.0|I got this book for a friend of mine who is also becoming a grandmother.  My grandchildren LOVE it.
1400049628|5.0|I loved this book.  Makes me want to start preparing haha, and if zombies ever roam the streets you'd definately want to have this book with you.
B000YPUFA6|4.0|As I am a recent purchaser of Blu-ray and Hi-Def television, let me first say that Blue-ray Hi-def is a very distinct improvement over regular DVD. Resident Evil is, in fact, my first purchase of a Blu-ray disc. Visually exciting and colorful (for a horror movie), this film has intense action which showcases the athletic abilities of Milla Jovovich, however much they may be enhanced by CGI effects. Jovovich brings a sense of focused power to the roll, combined with a sensitivity that makes the character very intriguing.  The visual clarity of Blue-ray, coupled with a sharpness that makes viewing an almost 3-Dimensional experience, gives the viewer a feeling of virtual participation in the movie. Stunningly realistic CGI effects, and well directed action sequences make this a very entertaining film. The plot has progressed nicely from the first two films.  Even if there is not another sequel, one can see where the resolution to this series is headed.  All in all, a very satisfying horror film experience, with just the right amounts of scare and gore without becoming tedious and boring. Recommended for buffs of apocalyptic horror.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|This product is well worth it. Many go for the Sennheiser HD280s, but I prefer these because the sound reproduction is perfect. Many if not all recording studios use these. I'm serious.
1400079179|5.0|[[ASIN:1595072160 The Angel Hunter]]<br />Anyone who finds this book offensive to their Christian faith has missed the brilliance of the entire novel. Robert Langdon admits when he was a boy-drowning in a well-that is was Jesus who came and gave him the strength to tread water all night until he was found. It was in this moment of intense need and desperation that faith empowered Robert. Why does anything else need to be said or any other prose critiqued concerning the credibility of Dan Brown as a writer or a man of faith? The strongest case that he makes, through the experience of his character, is missed by the naysayers and so called faithful.  Read the book for the subtle and deep value Dan Brown puts on faith, not dogma, not theocracy, and not belief systems that tumble when challenged with logic.  Jesus:  mortal or divine, myth or man, was there when young Robert needed him. That's all any of us need isn't it?
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Graduation is, by far, Kanye's best album. Each song has a good to great beat and the lyrics go with the song. One might be thinking of course the lyrics would, but some artists forget this is a vital part to songs. My recommendation would be to buy the album because every song is great. It is really hard finding an album this good.
0452289963|5.0|[[ASIN:1595072160 The Angel Hunter]]<br />I have been reading Eckhart and listening to him for years.  For the people who \\"don't get him\\" don't worry. You have to be ready for what he is teaching. Not everyone is and that is not only fine, it's healthy.  This book builds on his past work and is, at its core, an uplifting dissertation on the unlimited potential of humanity. Believe me, the gentle embracing of the moment, of what is, is not only the best spiritual practice, it's the only spiritual practice that has EVER made me experience the one true source I like to call the cauldron of creation.
B000NVIXDW|1.0|I am so sorry I wasted my money on this album.  His lisp is so bad I cringed every time I anticipated an \\"s\\".  The song remakes are terrible.  The music is annyoing.  If you feel you must buy this album, I suggest borrowing it from the library or a friend before you do.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|Big fan of the original 3, can't wait until this one. This will be the first  I'll get to see in theaters.
0375423966|5.0|I loved every minute reading this book. Being a comic or graphic novel, whichever one prefers, I was both invested in the life of Marjane Satrapi as well as the illustrations. The drawings really brought the whole story to life with her incredible enthusiasm of how the expressions on the faces really matched what was being said. The story of her life is so compellingly told that one is caught up in her passions and pains.<br /><br />I just loved it! I laughed with her. I cried with her. I cheered her on! She is a woman with a unique voice, both in her experiences of standing up for herself by being straightforward and blunt (and quite rational in her reasoning), but also in her own narrative. It is swiftly told, but not leaving it too general or to overlook any of the details. Being a Westerner and having little knowledge of Persian history, it was actually a very welcome introduction to what has happened in the Middle East. She is roughly my age so I identified with her and the time period she grew up in (despite the social climates being so different).<br /><br />Satrapi tells the story of things from her point of view. What I did enjoy about it was that she was fond of her own country, but also recognized its own shortcomings. Her fears were real and she stood up to them when she felt it most necessary. She challenged authority at every corner. And, if you ask me, she won!<br /><br />But I think what also moved me was that is was told in a graphic narrative. The illustrations, as I said, were spot on. I think her style of art supports her story and helps relate the happenings much better than if were just a book. To me it made the book more enjoyable and humorous.<br /><br />It has just been released as a movie and I am excited to see the film as it matches the style of book perfectly. I don't see anyone who reads even the first 20 pages would be able to stop. I am glad someone suggested the books for me to read as I now want to buy a copy for myself.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This is one of the best music-themed movies ever created, delving into the Blues mythos and featuring great music.  Any fan of blues (specifically blues guitar) will love this movie with it's classic story and awesome music.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This was a great movie and if you saw it in the theaters Blu-ray is a great way to watch it at home. The Action is great there are some good features. For me it was a good way to start off my Blu-ray DVD collection. I think this is one of those Blu-ray discs that makes a bigger impact than just the regular DVD.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I downloaded this album and it has become my favorite play on my Ipod. The entire album is really good. I saw them in concert last week at a very small intimate venue and they were awesome!!!
0312370830|4.0|July 1942 marked a dark period in the history of France where thousands of Jewish families were rounded up and forcibly kept in the Velodrome d'Hiver. They were then sent off to transit camps in France such as Drancy, before being packed off to Auschwitz, a Nazi death camp. What is so unnerving about this whole incident is that the rounding up and mobilisation of Jews for deportation was done by the French authorities.<br /><br />Based upon this seldom mentioned, little known piece of French history, author Tatiana de Rosnay has crafted a well-written novel that alternates between the past in 1942, and the present. The past centers around a 10 year old Jewish girl Sarah Strazynski who is forced to go to the Velodrome d'Hiver with her mother and father, innocently leaving behind a 4 year old brother Michel locked in a secret cupboard with the assurance that she would return to let him out when it was safe.<br /><br />The present revolves around writer Julia Jarmond, a transplanted American who is married to a frenchman and finds herself being consumed by the story of the Vel d'Hiv incident. As she digs deeper, she uncovers dark secrets surrounding her husband's family which are connected to the deportations of Jews from France. As the truth emerges, the author deftly handles the question of guilt caused by supressed secrets and how the truth can sometimes not only bring about pain and disrupt the regularity of life, yet also have the ability to heal and move forwards into the future.<br /><br />The method employed by the author, which alternates between the past [1942] and the present is an effective tool for it ties both periods together and brings the story to a satisfying conclusion. I do confess though that I found the story of the past much more dramatic and interesting than the one which deals with Julia in the present. On the whole  though, it was an engrossing read and I would recommend it, especially to those interested in the genre. I'd also recommend the following books which deal with the Holocaust and France:<br />[[ASIN:0803299141 The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews]]by Susan Zuccoti (non-fiction)<br />[[ASIN:088146225X One Step Ahead of Hitler: A Jewish Child's Journey Through France]]by Fred Gross(memoir)<br />[[ASIN:0198207069 France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)]]by Julian Jackson (non-fiction and more for those already familiar with the history of the period)<br /><br />There is also a movie adaptation of the novel starring Kristin Scott-Thomas, [[ASIN:B006BQI1V2 Sarah's Key]]the Holocaust and France:   [[ASIN:0803299141 The Holocaust, the French, and the Jews]]by Susan Zuccoti (non-fiction)  [[ASIN:088146225X One Step Ahead of Hitler: A Jewish Child's Journey Through France]]by Fred Gross(memoir)  [[ASIN:0198207069 France: The Dark Years, 1940-1944 (Modern World)]]by Julian Jackson (non-fiction and more for those already familiar with the history of the period)  There is also a movie adaptation of the novel starring Kristin Scott-Thomas, [[ASIN:B006BQI1V2 Sarah's Key]]
B00005OAIE|5.0|For most great artists, the debut is a monkey you can't get off your back. It's not that it's a bad album, just not up to the standards of their later and greater work. John Mayer himself considers this album and Heavier Things more of a mix-tape, a time in his career when he had to break out and say look at me, here's my best. There's no clear theme, just the best of what he had at the time. He also looks back on his early work as too much him, not about the music, a time where he just sang constantly, and wouldn't let the music speak for itself. The change is most evident in \\"83,\\" a song about the joy of childhood and a longing to go back to that time. An excellent theme that everybody has felt, and he brings it out amazingly well. However, if he had written the song today, it would have been even better. So the last minute or so when he longs for his lunchbox would probably be axed in favor of the music itself.<br /><br />So taking the album as/is, and not comparing it to his later work, the album is an amazing little pop album. Another interesting this is the lack of electric guitar, and heavy use of acoustic instead. This is evident in the opening part of \\"No Such Thing,\\" which is great opener to the album, and to an amazing career. Electric guitar still pops up in songs like \\"Neon\\" \\"Love Song For No One\\" and \\"Back To You.\\" Wonderland also has an amazing electric solo in the middle of it.<br /><br />\\"My Stupid Mouth\\" has the simplistic theme of talking too much, and getting yourself in trouble. Pretty simple, but still a good song. What's most surprising is that the theme carries into \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" when Mayer sings, \\"I'm never speaking again.\\" Which is what he says in the previous song. From just hearing the song on the radio, you'd never know this, but when you listen to the album, you pick up on the mastery of Mayer's work.<br /><br />With all of this amazing music, it's hard to pick favorites, but two tracks stand out on a whole other level from the rest of the songs. \\"St. Patrick's Day\\" is an amazing song that has a mood beaming with love and hope. The song is an instant classic, and could fit right into a hundred movies. \\"Why Georgia\\" on the other hand is on a whole different level because of its lyrics. A song about the quarter-life crisis is both as relevant as it is good. And when the chorus arrives, something unexplainable happens. Is it genius? Maybe... Mayer has also said he loves playing the song, because it's then he knows he's not the only one asking these questions, when you have a whole crowd full of people singing, \\"Am I living it right?\\" There's something there, and this album relates to people on a whole other level.<br /><br />Overall, while not as impressive as Continuum, it's still an amazing album, and the start of the best artist of our time. An instant classic that's great on so many levels, it's hard to count. Mayer does not deserve the title of a \\"Dave Matthews Clone,\\" that's a downright insult to the amazing genius that takes place on this album.\\"St. Patrick's Day\\" is an amazing song that has a mood beaming with love and hope.

B000UX6THK|5.0|Après tant d' années d' attente ! Ne comptant plus sur MK2 pour son coffret... J' ai enfin reçu mon \\"St Graal\\" !!! C' est le bonheur absolu, que dire de plus, pas de gadget, l' essentiel est là,rien ne manque, c' est bien l' édition définitive. Un seul regrèt : l' absence d' une piste audio FR 5.1. Mais bon, restons puristes jusqu' au bout. Je reprends une part de cherry pie et retourne devant mon écran. Un must have.
B000WMEAKC|3.0|The cd is okay, I bought it because I liked the song I kept hearing on the radio - \\"Apologize\\" and it has both versions on the cd.  I have listened to the cd in it's entirety, and can't really get into much of the other songs.
B000K15VSA|5.0|J' attendais ce coffret depuis des lustres ! Enfin arrivé ! Malette en vulgaire plastique, la miniature de l' engin est de piètre qualité. Pour le reste, c' est le top ! Enfin toutes les versions en un coffret + les inédits. Conclusion : obligatoire pour les fans ! Must have !

Everything went well, it got here in the predicted date, dvd in great conditions...<br />It's worth it!
B000RZIGVS|3.0|The packaging could have been better.  Some of the DVD cases were either cracked or chipped.  Good prices should not equal substandard packaging.
0930289234|4.0|This graphic novel was the first I have read in a long time.<br />I was introduced to the title from some casual friends on a message board.<br />The writing in this book is amazing and captivating. The characters are vibrant and believable (even if it is about superheroes!).<br />The subtext and the social commentaries found within ring with eerie harmony with what is happening today with current global struggles and corporate involvment in our daily lives.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wanted a though provoking graphic novel. Just don't blame me when you read it in two days.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I know it's a bit late to purchases the whole series, but it is still the best tv show ever! Seeing the 6 of them for 10 yrs is surely amazing.  I live in Hong Kong, and I can't find this product anywhere, so I ordered it on Amazon. The product is deliveried very quickly although i chose standard shipping. Besides, if I buy it season by season in Hong Kong, it costs twice as much! So bravo Amazon!  The packaging is okay, but dividing 10 season in 6 cases is kind of weird. Anyways, i still like to put on an episode every night before i go to bed. I don't think I can ever get over friends :)
0471702188|5.0|This is it.....do not need additional book info on Valuations. Only practical experience can add to the respective work.    I work in the M&A field and use the books goodies every day.    Best Regards  André Rafnsson
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Having recently returned from a magnificent two weeks in the villages of Provence, my husband and I were eager to see this offering by Ridley Scott.  We had modest expectations for the plot and cast, since the reviews hadn't been kind. From beginning to end we were transported back to the lush vineyards, the picturesque hillside towns & markets and the wonderful people of Provence!  We'd have preferred seeing Colin Firth or Hugh Grant in the Russell Crowe role, but Marion Cotillard was dazzling.  This DVD will be a treasured part of our home collection.
B00006JKON|5.0|Most Tull albums, the ones beforehand and afterward, are doused with flute. Not saying that's a bad thing, but there are a lot more instruments on this earth. Who better than Jethro Tull to play them.     Ian Anderson is one of the most influential and talented stageman there ever was. On Warchild, he just further his talent. Trading the sound of the flute for the saxophone. While the band trades in their instrument too. On \\"Queen and Country\\", John Evans trades in the piano for, none other than, the accordian, while a full on orchestra, arranged by David Palmer, plays in the background. On \\"Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day\\", the whole band switches around. In fact, later on in \\"Bursting Out\\", Ian Anderson says that it is an \\"assortment of each other  borrowed and unpaid for instruments\\". There is Martin Barre on marimba, John Evans on accordian (once again), John Glascock on 6-string electric, and Barrimore Barlow on glockenspeil. As for Mr. Anderson, 6-string acoustic.    Warchild has the shorter song structure too. The last 2 albums (Thick As A Brick and A Passion Play) were one long song, both last over 40 minutes. Warchild longest song is at the 5 minute mark.     Well, either ways,great album, go get it, I'm sick of writng.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|All I can really say is that this series is just AMAZING!! I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. My brother and I had been searching for this DVD for a while and began watching it immediately once we finally got our hands on it. We didn't stop, and now we are patiently waiting for the 3rd season to air on TV. If you already find the synopsis to the series intriguing, you will NOT be disappointed!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|enough is written about this disc-set.  I think it's a gem but it could have been better with the diaries on it even thought they weren't filmed in HD.    I gave my regular DvD set to a friend of mine. I think they should play these discs in schools all the time to give people a better view of how beaqutifull this earth is we are trying to rape & kill every day.    ScuBart
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I saw this adaptation a few weeks ago on PBS in the USA, and I was very impressed by it. The casting for the two leads was so complimentary, each achieving a sense of the loss of a great love, and the chance for fulfillment eight years later. They were of the appropriate ages to match Jane Austen's lead characters.    I taped the film, but it appeared very grainy, so I decided to order the DVD which arrived today. What a contrast and a delight. The colors, costumes and sets are wonderful. Also, I was able to view the entire production which includes several scenes which greatly enhanced the understanding of the story and the passing of time between the various episodes.    Particularly I enjoyed the clear delineation between the attitudes of Anne's family and that of the Musgroves regarding to social status. Fredericks' anguish over being continually degraded at every encounter with the snobby sisters and father of Anne were very apparent. It all made the story seem more real; the reason for all the sorrows and disappointments stemming from Anne's family's social status and their overbearing sense of entitlement and superiority.    In the end, I breathed a sigh of relief for the lovers finally together at last.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|Nice stuff, Blade Runner in HD is AMAZING.    Fast Delivery, Thanks amazon.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The communist system could not sustain itself based upon the people's will.  As a result, the Communists had to take efforts needed to subdue the population and stop them from being, well, human.  This German film is an excellent illustration of why the state should be involved in few roles in society -- and, for the most part, should stay out of people's lives.  This is a timely movie, especially at a time period when American politicians such as Clinton and Obama are talking about involving the state in our healthcare.  I encourage their supporters to watch this film and realize what heavy state involvement in the economy ultimately entails.
0143038419|5.0|I really enjoyed the book . I recommend to to all women of any age, it really opens your eyes!
B000W4KT64|5.0|Grat Movie. Very entertaining. This movie is fun to watch from beginning to end. John Travolta is spectacular as Tracy's mother.
B000002GJH|3.0|This album is a classic for those who enjoy grunge music, or the \\"Seattle sound\\". A wonderful combination between two of its greatest bands.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|It's amazing how some people can transform music into magic. Not only does Eddie Vedder in Pearl Jam with his divine voice, but also has done it here in this perfect e sweet album. A must-have for anyone who enjoys good and quality music.
B000FA57N0|5.0|Excellent writing, well acted, and great picture. I bought this just to expose friends to the Movie (& TV program), and everyone has liked it so far.
0375847227|5.0|There's no such thing as a good or bad book folks, just books. You either like it, or you don't. I absolutely loved this collection of these books. They are fun, exciting and overall probably the best adventure story for youngsters or old. If you're \\"offended\\" by subject matter, any subject matter, not just what's in this story ... Do yourself a favor, and don't read it. Don't judge until you read it, and have some knowledge about just what you're talking about. Pullman allows one to suspend him/herself and experience something unique. I feel this storyline is the last masterpiece of the twentieth century. EXCELLENT WORK PHIL!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This movie \\"The Bourne Ultimatum, is a very good film filled with a lot  of action and a good plot. And a fine job done by Matt Damon.  It's a film well worth the watch.

B000VR824S|5.0|This has got to be one of the best live recodings I have heard. Every performance was great. A collection of some of the best guitar players of all time and some new and up coming greats too! Jeff Beck's young bass player is outstanding and destined for great things.
0452289963|2.0|...So I only browsed through this book. It is a pseudo-philosophical babble. My inner world,  my outer world. If people are old, then the inner world growths and outer world is less significant. Old people are savvy. Young people don't know the treasure they have within. Death is hidden in our western society. Other cultures admit decay and enjoy more life. A Zen master who accepts any false accusation without any denial, because he's in state of harmony with his inner world. And so forth and and so-on.<br /><br />The book can be shortened to two pages, perhaps.<br /><br />I am curious to read the Power of Now. I assume the author  had a success for a reason. But the inspiration dried out in this A New Earth book. Some writers are of the one book type
0739481320|5.0|Well written and an excellent explanation of the basis for an agnostic position.      I would even recommend it to my religious friends, not to try to \\"convert\\" them but to help them understand the thoughts of other folks with a spiritual orientation but not traditionally religious.
0143034901|5.0|This quickly became one of my all time favorite books. I seriously recommend it to everyone and hear positive things about it all the time. If you have the chance, please pick this book up. You won't be disappointed!
B000022TSF|5.0|This was a very well done movie with an engaging plot, that despite its length never seemed to drag on.  I'd certainly recommend it.
159562015X|4.0|The book acturately identified my strengths through the   web site questionnaire.   But it only listed the top five strengths  and the remaining 29 strength categories were not ranked.  It would have been helpful to know the bottom five.  But of course  the theme of the book is to ignore your weakness and focus on   strengths and so I think the book provides what he promises.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|My sister told me about the Swivel Sweeper, she said it was the best, so I thought I'd try it.  I have a small house, 800 square feet, that is all hardwood flooring.  The two of us own four cats and a dog, and I am forever sweeping.  The Swivel Sweeper is very easy, quick, not nearly as loud as a vacuum cleaner, light, and lays flat so it can get under beds.  The tray that holds all the debris is small, and I have to empty it once half way through the cleaning, but I don't consider that an inconvenience.  I also use it to sweep the furniture.    How well it works on carpet, I don't know.  I imagine it would work ok on low pile types, but I believe it is meant for flooring, and it works great.  I highly recommend this Sweeper.
B000002LFL|4.0|Hard to believe it's been 20 years since the release of this album, which came out after the band disbanded and just before Morrissey ventured out on his own.    This is not a \\"must have\\" but showcases some of the Smiths' best work (albeit mostly from The Queen is Dead).    Recording quality is average.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|I'll start by saying that I am not a huge fan of Dustin Hoffman or Bill Murray but don't miss this movie! It's a great commentary and spoof of soaps and acting classes and actors as well.  A really lovely romantic under-current and story to go along with Dustin's she/he role.  I love how he grows and learns about himself and the opposite sex by becoming Dorothy.  It's such a wonderful film on so many levels!    Yes, it's crushing that the DVD doesn't have tons of cool extra features, but since my VHS copy is worn thin, it's still nice to have!    Get it, it's a super movie!
0811729117|4.0|It is a good book that is a little heavy on rhetoric and a little light on historical content. If you are looking for a battle history, this is not it. Still there is enough content here to interest the casual reader.
B000WCDI64|5.0|Geee-I think I wore the grooves out of the dvd. As a musician,  this is one of the best recordings on dvd of one of the tightest  bands in music.If you spiced out Ms. Winehouse, the band alone  would be worth the dvd. Her voice, on the other hand, is  one of the greatest amalgams of hip hop, dinah washington, and motown  .You can hear all the influences, but unlike so many, she comes out  with her own awkward, unusually beautiful style.  IMO- Just one of the most soulful, and original female  singers to come by perhaps since janis joplin.10 stars if was able.
B00005MP58|5.0|I gave this version of Pride & Prejudice as a gift to a family and they loved it. It got there quick and in good shape although used, it was in good condition and at an excellent price.

B000VBJEEG|5.0|Kids will love this film, but adults will love it even more, especially if they are at all interested in cooking.  The extra material interviewing Thomas Keller and the director simultaneously is the best extra credit feature we have seen in any DVD.  See that first, then watch the video, and you will dismiss the ploy of cooking rodents and settle in to enjoy the sentiments and motivation of a true chef de cuisine.

0765350386|5.0|I'd been searching for another book series to read after Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, but hadn't been able to really find a good one.  After hearing about Brandon Sanderson taking over the writing of the last book of the Wheel of Time series I decided to check out some of his other books.  This was a really great book,  I could hardly put it down.  The magic system was very unique as everyone else has said.  There are plenty of plot twists and turns to keep you in suspense until the end.  Its too bad this series is only a trilogy.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie was great.  It told a nice fun, interesting story that kept me almost more interested then my daughter.  I was skeptical about this movie considering it was about rats and cooking. But it turned out to be another great family friendly movie.  It's especially good for very young children. There are no scary scenes, or over the top evil characters, nor is there an abundance of violence.  They kept this movie fun, fresh and innocent all at once. Bravo.
B00006AL1G|5.0|I saw this movie once and I knew I had to own it. It is a very clear and sequenced movie about the art of Hip Hop and turntables.  I love this culture. I think anyone and everyone can enjoy the catchy beats and styled rhythms that make this movie more fascinating.  It has a good flow as well, it is not a quick watch but after you see it a couple times through, I will play it in the background because of the music. It was well produced and that is why I say Well Done.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|The DVD came in time and in perfect shape. It's amazing to see the various places on earth beautifully filmed in HD and narrated by David Attenborough.<br /> This was the best price on the net.
B00005JPTI|5.0|I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN I WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE, ALL I DID KNOW IS THAT IT ALONG THE SAME LINES AS THE MOVIE WITH VINCENT PRICE. NOW THAT IS A CLASSIC. I ENJOYED THE MOVIE VERY MUCH. WILL SMITH DID A FANTASTIC JOB. HE IS A FANTASTIC ACTOR. WELL DONE MR. SMITH.
B000E33W1W|5.0|This is a great movie that I loved watching when I was a kid.  This is definitely one of the best movies from the 80's - even of all time.  I would recommend getting the double feature instead of this version since it is only $2 more and you get this movie and the sequel.  While the sequel isn't as fabulous as the original, it is still entertaining.    I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh!
0321544080|5.0|In a world filled with digi-cams behind every latte cup and legions of enthusiasts who upload their latest masterpieces to Flickr every night, `The Moment It Clicks' is a huge blast of fresh air.

Every spread in the book is a mini-course, both technically and aesthetically, on the creation of an amazing photograph.<br /><br />More importantly, `The Moment It Clicks' reaches well beyond the genre of how-to books. It's a book on what its like to BE a photographer.

If you are an armchair enthusiast who reads more than he shoots, you'll be entertained with Joe's stories from the front lines. If you are a student contemplating a life in our profession, you'll gain more insights from this book than from any teacher (unless, of course, you're lucky enough to get into one of Joe's workshops). If you are a professional, set aside your cynicism and buy the book. Joe's candid stories will re-kindle your creative fire and help bolster your courage in this challenging market.<br /><br />Many books, magazines, and DVDs can teach you how to compose, light and expose.

Yet, having the right gear and knowing how to turn it on does not make you a good photographer any more than having the right golf clubs will get you into the PGA Tour. But reading the right book, this book, will give you wisdom well beyond your years. It certainly did for me.

1577314808|5.0|[[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]]  A wonderful book which I'm reading very slowly. If you are interested in gaining enlightenment, this is the book for you. It is easy to understand, but you really need to read it slowly to let the principles sink into your consciousness.

Place your \\"bloks\\" (some of the shapes will remind you of Tetris) touching only a corner of your color and try to get rid of all your \\"bloks\\". Wait - you are \\"bloked\\" by your opponent and have to search for available corners. Where do you fit that tricky W shaped piece? Nowhere? Better luck next time.
B000W10AEI|4.0|If you buy one get one free Amazon will put the value of both Blu-rays on the customs declaration ($39.90 rather than $19.95), meaning you will get hit with a Customs fee and handling charge. This came to £12.26 for me and Amazon basically said tough.    This charge was more than one of the films on their own meaning this is no bargin for non US citizens.
1401300529|5.0|David Halberstam did his research on this one. Very interesting reading about the politics of the 1950's Korean War and how things really haven't changed that much today. The book verified other sources I've read about McCarther and his Staff as being prima dona's.
1591841666|5.0|Set Godin says what you may have been needing to hear for quite a while.  He doesn't beat around the bush, either.  In plain, but meaningful language, Godin gives us counter-intuitive wisdom concerning the management of our own lives--business, personal, whichever.  When is it right--and smart--to quit and when should we persevere?  Oh, why wasn't Godin writing decades ago?
B000OVLNII|5.0|This book is the first non-fiction history book I have read that should be classified as a real 'page-turner.' You won't want to put it down. Ms. Goodwin adeptly weaves the multiple personalities of the Lincoln cabinet together to give the reader incredible insight into the very complex challenges faced by the courageous men and women who saved the United States of America from disaster.  A must read for anyone interested in American history.  The book notes and bibliography in the back are exhaustive.  Two thumbs way up!!
B000YDOOU0|4.0|Metheny, McBride and Sanchez have created a sound completely of themselves. While it touches on many things from blues to rock to folk to new age and straight ahead there still remains the unique sound these three create. As a trio they are much greater than the sum of their parts. And those parts are indeed formidible. Each selection is richly textured and Metheny uses sounds new to his recordings on the R&R influenced \\"The Red One\\" which is reminiscent of \\"Roots of Coincidence\\". Metheny, McBride and Sanchez are probably some of the most advanced and technically proficient musicians in this genre today and that is reflected on this recording. There are times when there is too much information to digest and I found myself wanting to hear some chords and harmony but hey, that's just me. I am sure as I listen more I will hear more and the nuance will begin to show.  It was refreshing to hear some blues on a Metheny release and, as always, his skills are light years ahead of most. On the technical side, the recording itself seemed rather quiet, I had to turn it up higher than most of my CDs in order to get the same sonic response. Perhaps a remaster opportunity?
0805047905|5.0|by far the best book out there. my daughter loved this book after the first time reading it to her. within a couple weeks she was reading it to us from memorization. it's been a great learning tool. i highly recommend this book to every parent out there. especially those who have 2 or 3 year olds. love it!

0060094273|5.0|One of the classic baby books.  It has stood the test of time, and been beloved by infants and toddlers for over 50 years.  There is a simplicity and comfort that soothes little ones before bedtime.    Reading it creates a wonderful bond between parents and children.     This board book is packaged with baby socks and makes a thoughtful gift to new babies.
B00009ATIX|3.0|As a sci-fi, techie, shrink-shrunk piece of eye-candy, I guess this movie holds up well, but other than that...well, ho-hum.  I gave the movie a second viewing, thinking maybe I missed something the first time around; but no, it was the same 'love outlasts death so why not kill yourself to be with your lost love instead of being lonely' message wrapped up in an off-world experience.  Kudos to all of the principle actors (Clooney, McElhone, Davis and Davies) for at least 'sticking with the script' and to the set designers as well, but I'll pass on spending more than the rental price for this one.

B000VNMMRA|4.0|All our favorite action stars from the 90's seem to be coming back to blow stuff up. What's the deal with that? Who really gives a damn? This is an action packed movie start to finish. You'll appreciate Bruce Willis' character. He's got a few one liners that mesh with his general curmudgeon, yet likable gruff persona. That guy from the Mac commercials is a nice supporting character; he's weak and scrawny. They play off each other well.<br /><br />Kudos Brucey boy this is a good one.

B000YIGNKE|3.0|Not only was Anne Eliot running all over Bath totally out of character and unnecessary to the story, the fairy tale ending of Wentworth bringing her back to her childhood estate was totally impossible.  He could not have afforded to buy it or maintain it on what he would have made in the war. And the character in the book would have been happy in a much smaller place.     I've seen this a few times. Although the 1995 Amanda Root version is much better, this has some charms. They had to compress parts of the plot to fit the 90 minutes.  That I could have accepted if the ending had been true. There was no reason to make Anne run through the streets ! That detracts from the entire production.     Sally Hawkins gave a sensative portrayal, but the Anne of the book was stronger.
0380789035|5.0|I have a lot to thank to Neil Gaiman.  He helped to introduce my fiance and I back in college, even though we were strangers.  And he wrote this book.  It's a wonderfully imaginative and original story.  You really sort of want to know more more more about the supporting characters.  This book made me laugh a lot, but it's also fairly serious.  It'll make you look around at your coworkers and the people on the bus a little differently.  And maybe Gaiman will help you find your true love, like he did for me.
6305907145|1.0|This is not the book. The only thing that this shares with the book is its' title. Total dissapointment! Get the BBC version if you don't want to read the book. But you are missing out on a timeless classic.

B00005JPXY|5.0|I find it a very appropriate time period to release a film such as Cloverfield, a movie that documents that self-preservation is now less instinctive than ensuring the survival and safety of a loved. And to me the reason bring this up is because of these disaster-ridden times in a post-911 world, terror could rear its' ugly head at any given moment and it wouldn't matter your social, financial or even status of power at that point; all that would matter is what matters most to you. Here in Cloverfield the concept of a gigantic alien (or to those who love to debate `aliens') may seem far removed from anything that could happen in reality but the scenario played out is indeed plausible.    The story of Cloverfield is rather simple we are introduced to Rob (Michael Stahl-David) is a twenty-something hot shot corporate who is off to the shores of Japan to start a new career path. The first 15 minutes are documented with Rob holding the camera then passing it off to his older brother Jason (Mike Vogel). Eventually Jason meets HUD played by T.J. Miller (notice the clever name as in Heads Up Display) who they pass the camera off to. Jason tells HUD to hold the camera and have everyone give testimonials about what their thoughts are about Rob leaving overseas. Eventually after making his rounds in the party HUD goes outside after Rob is pissed off about hearing that his ex-girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman) brought over another guy. After HUD and Jason sit down and consult Rob about his girl troubles we hear a loud explosion and for 5 minutes of suspended time seem to be in a New York 9/11 all over again. What could have possibly did this? Eventually Rob, HUD and Jason get stuck with Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) and Jason's girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas).    What really drives me to feel Cloverfield is how it isn't told in a similar fashion as most movies of its' kind are. Instead of the main characters who have connections with authorities such as the military and eventually alluniformly come together to neutralize the problem (or as in this case the monster at hand). Instead these are normal everyday people they are helpless and all they could possibly do is just try to survive. It goes back to that thing that the importance of protecting those close to us is greatly magnified in a situation like this. So Rob with all 4 of his friends begin running with everyone else to escape only for Rob to get a voicemail on his cell phone from Beth who says she is not ok. I give props to truly great usage of sound and editing, this beloved brainchild has been woven together to truly create a great sense of hysteria and pandemonium. When the military first make their way and HUD is holding the camera in hand all he can do is watch Rob, Marlena and Lily from afar as bullets fire loudly in the air. Call it horror for a modern-day Youtube generation but there is no denying that the way the film was shot will cause indefinite polarity between views. For some, the Blair Witch Project style camera is a work of sheer art making this movie that much more realistic since we only get to see what's on the camera. Then there are those who will feel a great deal of discomfort and nausea in which there have been reports of people leaving the movie early due to wanting to vomit or dizziness. I fall more into the first category and truly feel the cinematography couldn't have been expressed as well without delving into this type of medium.    Not being able to see everything in perfect scope is perhaps what I find most endearing about Cloverfield. You never get a good shots of the monster as it's a je ne sais quoi (difficult object to define) monstrous deviation. We never hear of its' orgin or why all this happened. Was it something harvesting and manifesting its life under water surviving off of Slushos' ingredients? Or was this something the government made? Oh wait I know it came from space? There you go Cloverfield is shrouded in so much mystery and don't even getme started on the ending. Which in itself could leave some scratching their head thinking what the hell just happened in the last 84 minutes. That my friends is what I like most about this movie, it's attempt at taking the shackles off and breaking conventionalism. It could have spoon-fed us every detail and end the appropriate Hollywood fashion but that would make it nothing more than a doppelganger of every other monster affair.    Granted Cloverfield isn't perfect, it's a rather short film and I couldn't help but wonder if there was more than one monster...the one that HUD captures in the end on his camera is a lot shorter than the one tearing down the walls of NYC. Regardless though the movie casted more unknown actors who don't act or say the most appropriate lines because they are regular individuals reacting to a situation such as this...just imagine if Tom Cruise or Johnny Depp were running wild in the streets of Manhattan (you would get War of the Worlds). Great special effects, shaky camera that some will love and some will hate, a excellent sense of mystery and never truly finding out what is going on coupled with top notch sound make Cloverfield a real treat in an otherwise bland January when most movie goers don't have much to look for. It all must have done something to most movie goers and many critics and movie aficionados are still trying to recap what they just saw.     For more of my reviews visit [...]
B000002JAX|5.0|I love this CD so much that it hasn't been out of my CD player since I purchased it.  If you are a fan of Madeleine Peyroux you won't be disappointed.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|This is a melancoly, but disappointing ending to one of the greatest series of all time. Couldn't they have said goodbye properly? There is just too much left to be answered. Anyone say-reunion show?
B000O176Q6|5.0|If you are pondering on buying this movie because of its age and you don't think the digital video will transfer good, fear no longer. This movie looks great. It looks like it was made 90's instead of the 70's. This is a must buy for the Kung Fu or Bruce Lee fans out their.
0810994739|5.0|Excellent book.  My son loved the first one and we had to get the second one.  Almost like Captain Underpants but more clean cut.  I enjoyed reading it with my son.  If you have a kid who doesn't like to read this could get them interested.  My son is nine.  Can't wait for the third one to come out.  Read it with your child and enjoy a laugh and time together.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I have over 20 Blu-Ray movies and this is the best looking movie I own. Some people complain about the grittiness of this movie but I saw it at the theater (twice) and it had the same look. But to me the Blu-Ray version looks even better than in the movies. This is a must own for any who owns a Blu-Ray player.

B00004W50T|5.0|[[ASIN:B0001GAW4W Music from Big Pink]]    Great detail of music on this CD.
B000R7GKQE|4.0|I hadn't watched Supernatural when it debuted on the CW, but happened to catch an episode at someone's house.  It looked good, so I decided to buy Season 1 when I found it at a great price.  I quickly was hooked, and when I'd finished watching Season 1, I hopped onto Amazon and ordered Season 2.  I have to say, I think it was even better than the first season.  A lot of series suffer in their sophomore season, but not so with Supernatural.  Their series mythology was even more compelling, and woven successfully into their \\"regular\\" episodes; episodes that weren't necessarily crucial to advancing the season arc.  I love both of the brothers, their interplay, and the poignancy and sorrow of their tremendous family loss in the destruction of evil.  Great series!  If you like suspense, and don't mind some horror mixed in, you will really enjoy Supernatural Season 2.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|[[ASIN:B00063EMJ6 Greatest Hits]]  Excellent remastering of Neil Youngs music!!!  I hear detail I have not heard before.
B00104W8T6|5.0|The \\"Juno\\" soundtrack is one of those soundtracks (like \\"Garden State\\") which is the perfect companion to the film and stands great on its own. Despite having a mix of newer and older acts, there's a sense of cohesion to it. After seeing the movie - which was wonderful and deserves an Oscar - I decided I wanted to get this CD because I loved the music so much too. It was nice to see the soundtrack even ordered the songs so that the song which played during the movie's opening was first and the song sung at the end of the movie was last. Many of the songs are fun and you can sing along to (and sometimes get stuck in your head). Hearing \\"A Well Respected Man\\" again reminded me just how good the Kinks were. The tracks by Kimya Dawson and the Moldy Peaches are good enough to make you want to go out and sample their CDs too. \\"Anyone Else But You\\" seems to stick with me the most and having both the Moldy Peaches version and the version from the movie with the actors is a treat. Besides that song, there are no other excerpts from the movie, so even if you haven't seen the movie you can appreciate the soundtrack.
B000PFU7OO|3.0|There are a few very good songs, but the overall feel of the album is rather depressing. Enjoyed the movie much more.
0743298039|4.0|For a first-time author, this book was actually quite good. You can tell research was done and time was taken with this book. Its a very strange sort of ghost story and is certainly more than meets the eye. Its unconventional and it works. I really got a sense of who the characters were and what was going on. Its all very mysterious, though not alot of action really occurs, which is fine. It's all in the story, or stories, as you'll find out if you read this. It is a quick read, not because its short, which it is, but because you'll be so enthralled, you won't want to put it down. I look forward to whatever the author writes next, and I do hope that she does.

B00005JLPK|5.0|Salma Hayek does a wonderful acting job portraying Frida.  Her accident arouses sympathy, and her life and art are fascinating to watch as it unfolds.
B00005JPTI|4.0|Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the last remaining human in New York City, where he works on a cure for the disease that has decimated the human race, turning most of the survivors into rage-filled creatures that cannot endure sunlight.  There is much to enjoy here.  An empty NYC slowly being reclaimed by nature is perfectly evoked, and Smith is excellent as the lonely man trying to hang on to his life and his sanity long enough to achieve his goal.      The early sections of the film are the best.  Director Francis Lawrence and writers Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman establish the mutated survivors as a truly terrifying, unstoppable presence, most notably in a frightening sequence in which Neville enters their lair to look for his dog.  However, they lose their sense of menace in direct proportion to the amount of screen time they get, no doubt due to the fact that they are realized through CGI rather than practical make-up effects.  This is a rather large flaw in a film that gets so many other things right.  I was not disappointed in the finale, as so many other reviewers were, but perhaps this is because I have not yet read the Richard Matheson source material.
0783225725|4.0|This is a classic Eastwood film. If you're a fan of others such as Hang 'Em High, or the Man with No Name trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad and The Ugly), then this is a good one for you.
0375714669|4.0|Persepolis 1 was definately more funny and dramatic than this followup novel.  This book seemed dark and brooding.  I also found it harder to identify with the main character.  It almost as if she hestitates from fully constructing her most profound difficulties and the storyline talkes over.  Still a good book though I'd repurchase it in a HEARTBEAT!
B0006VYG62|5.0|Sylvia Plath's story--both in real life, and in this work of \\"fiction\\"--is undeniably sad.  I purchased this book after, by chance, catching the last 15 minutes of the movie [[ASIN:B00005JMJD Sylvia]] on tele (which piqued my interest in her story).  I instantly fell in love with the mood of this book.  Sylvia's style as an author is undeniable.<br /><br />I am tempted to compare the main character of this story (which is, in fact, a not-so-\\"fictionalized\\" autobiographical account of Sylvia's entry into young adulthood)to J.D. Salinger's Holden Caulfield (of [[ASIN:0316769177 The Catcher in the Rye]], for those not familiar).  However, that might be a bit oversimplistic.  When you consider the social climate and its implications for women in the era of this book, you may find it all the more compelling that the main character behaves as she does. I won't give too much away, but I will say that Plath does a remarkable job of creating a character for whom her readers will likely experience many conflicting impressions and feelings.<br /><br />You will likely walk away from this book feeling frustrated and curious.  Go with it!  I highly recommend [[ASIN:0971059829 Sylvia Plath: Method and Madness: A Biography]] as subsequent reading.  Why?  Because only after reading Sylvia's biography can you realize how very much of 'The Bell Jar' was based in reality--and that, in turn, will solidify whatever feelings it evoked in you.  I found myself turning back to 'The Bell Jar' constantly just to note the similarities as I read that biography. At the end of both, I cannot deny that although Sylvia's life and story was very different than my own (and that, as a person, she was someone I probably would not have felt *warm and fuzzy* toward in 'real life'), I walked away from both books feeling somehow sorrowfully connected to her and her tragic life--which undoubtedly ended much too soon.

B0002OXVDW|5.0|What more can you ask for, all the great stars with their movies plus the interviews with them, this has to be the best Trilogy release of all time stars like Fred Astaire, Ann Miller and Ann Sothern, I have sat and watched these dics several times already.  Maybe I'm getting old but they never make great movies like this anymore, anyone thinking of buying this set if you do then you won't be dissapointed it's 5 star rated
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This is the absolute best of the \\"Bourne\\" videos.  From start to finish, the action is non-stop.    I recommend this movie to all.
B000M5AJQ8|4.0|This is a re-make of a Chinese multi part movie, although they forced everything into 1 move ( whereas the Asian original was several parts ) I thought this movie was still pretty good. With the HD the movie just looks that much better, the clarity in each scene is amazing.

B000OCY7JE|5.0|It is a five-start movie and I promptly purchased Susanne Beir's previous release \\"Brothers\\", which also is a five-star movie right after I saw this film. I prefer movies with a good humanistic storyline rahter than the razzmatazz sort that my homeland--USA, Hollywood--produces.  The story begins in India where a Swedish gentleman redeems himself running an orphanage in India that is in dire need of finincial help. It comes from a  fellow countrymen billionaire who would like to check his character and plans before he will afford a very ripe gift. The story continues into a twist of lost loves, integrity and pride, and the true meaning of kinship.   I recommend this movie and others by this director. I only wish Hollywood would invest some of it mighty wealth towards meaningful movies such as this, that every one in the audience could question their own intentions and values and possibly redeem your life.
0786856297|5.0|thanks to my friend tubby for turning me onto this series. he is 12 and let me read his copy over christmas. i had to have it and was glad to find it in hardback here as i intend to read it over and over.
B00000AOUD|5.0|This album was produced in 1972, but is still current as far as political events go. The music simply enhances the poem that was actually written by a young boy for a competition. Substitute 'Dumb as Dirt' for Thick as a Brick to understand it easier as an American. I consider this a classic that rivals The Who's 'Tommy!'
032147404X|5.0|Using this book should immediately improve the photography of beginners and intermediates. It's organized around specific instructions telling how to handle most commonplace photo situations. The writing is clear and free of technical jargon. The colorful illustrations are large and detailed enough to be quite helpful. The indexing and organization make information easy to find.     Reviewers who objected to the book because of supposedly heavy handed and unfunny attempts at humor must have been in truly sour moods when they wrote. Digital photography isn't exactly a laugh riot, but the author's attempts to lighten things up are unobjectionable and don't get in the way of clarity and effectiveness.    Highly recommended.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Jaws  DVD<br /><br />Roy Scheider plays the police chief of Amity Island, a resort town somewhere in New England, which is being terrorized by a Great White Shark (GWS).<br /><br />We were just sitting on the beach drinking beer and smoking pot when someone decided to go skinny dipping in the ocean.  Bad idea!<br /><br />The excellent music composed by John Williams will always make me think of JAWS.<br /><br />The police chief, played by Roy Scheider is suspicious that it is a GWS but the mayor, of course doesn't want to believe him until it conclusive, which it is fairly soon.  The police chief wants to close the beaches, but that would costs too much in economic terms so he is vetoed.<br /><br />All-in-all an enjoyable movie, but not right before you go on vacation at the beach.<br /><br />Throughout the movie the GWS is anthropomorphized so that we / the movie makers give him almost human intelligence.<br /><br />Not recommended for anyone who wants to swim in the ocean.  For me it's swimming pools from now on, Baby.<br /><br />Gunner  February, 2008
0525950079|3.0|This book, although very adult in nature, seems written for a high-school audience or the non-reader. The vocabulary (except for the occasional ecclesiastical reference) is facile, as if aimed for a lower common denominator.<br /><br />I echo the sentiments of other reviewers that it's essentially a resetting of Pillars Of The Earth...the charms of living in an era of muck and filth, of primal sex and human enslavement, wears thin in this book, when viewed through the lens of the first.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|This movie is one of the best of the Bond series and rivals any of the action with a brain movies in recent years.  I liked that he was sneakier and gave M a lot of trouble.  Too bad he killed off (indirectly) all the good looking women, and wrecked the Aston Matin before he got to drive it much.      There were seemingly fewer times that challenged my level of suspension of disbelief than in previous Bond flicks. Perhaps the stunt men are getting better, or the CG is more seamless?      I enjoyed the blu-ray features regarding the stunts, etc.      I am still really upset about that Aston Martin...      Cheers
B000P12LWY|5.0|This is a fantastic series!  Finally a series that focuses on other aspect of Henry 8th besides his wives.  The acting  is superb, Costuming fantasic great music and scenery ,
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|This cd is fabulous. I love all the songs. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore have great voices. The movie is also terrific. Pleasure to watch.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I loved this and watch it often.    A movie that has good over evil and pretty over ugly.  It is a feel good movie
B000BKJ78K|5.0|I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.  IT'S EVEN BETTER, WITH LARGE SCREEN TV AND SURROUND SOUND. FOR STAR WARS FANS, A MUST HAVE.
B000VSBX34|5.0|This DVD is a 10 being the best, the soundtracks sound great turn on your entertainment system and enjoy the Beatles are at their best the movie is still just as funny as when i seen it when i was 11 years old
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Wow! This is definitly worth waiting for. All three of the complete recordings are a treat for the senses. The music tells the story and draws you into this amazing world of middle earth. The acompanying booklet is informative and the packaging is beautiful.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is the best edition you'd ever get. I prefer the Original Release  (also know as the International Cut, voice-over version, uncut version, or the Criterion Edition), because I like the idea that Deckard is certaintly human, and hence I find his romance with Rachel more intense and dramatic, since he has to struggle internally with the idea of falling in love with somebody/something he used to think of as a disposable machine; besides I must admit I like the voice-over, despite it was nailed by the executives at the end of the production, and that Harrison Ford was forced to did it, but it was the version that I first saw, and fell in love with. But if you like any other version (the main and most \\"polished\\" one is the Final Cut, which is similar to the 1992 Director's Cut), here you'll find 5 of them (there are actually seven). Definitely the most weird of them all, is the workprint version, since is the one that was shown in test previews. I think it's great that Ridley Scott decided to release all these versions so you could pick the one you like the most, instead of forcing everyone to stick to one version. Scott himself makes a small introduction before the beginning of each movie, describing the main aspects of each one.
B000YENUI6|3.0|This is an interesting study of morals and customs. The acting is outstanding by many of the actors. Viggo Mortensen deserves his award nominations for this role. I found the sex scenes and the the bath house fight gratuitous. The movie would have been better without them.
1582701709|5.0|This book is one of those rare gems that can be used daily as a way to inspire enlightened thought.  I simply pick it up each day and read whatever page I happen to open to.  It allows me to focus on a few thoughts enabling me to engage in deeper introspective thought about myself and those I come in contact with.  A great book to give as a gift to stimulate friends and family.
0061544493|1.0|DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!  This book is pure GARBAGE!  This is the worst book on the market!  Just another \\"celebrity\\" expounding on their views of fashion - or at least what they consider to be fashion.  Okay - so she's a Spice Girl and married to David Beckham, but more importantly she won't be caught dead without her high heels!! (OMG!)  384 pages later, I was literally bored to tears.  She likes to wear sexy underwear for herself (okay, what woman doesn't!) and she LOVES wearing blue jeans (again, what woman doesn't!).  Give me a break!  If I lived in England, this book would be a great help, but since half the stores she frequents are not in the United States - we're all out of luck and I guess, not in style.  I give this book \\"1 stiletto\\" - for lack of substance and no real fashion advice.  Ladies, unless your some pre pubescent tween and a fan of the Spice Girls, don't bother with this book.
0307388840|2.0|Many reviewers don't seem to get what McEwan is doing here. The first, tightly written first section (highly praised by most reviewers) is McEwan writing. The rest (roundly criticized by many) is satire. It is Briony writing in the overblown style we are warned to expect in the first section. The trick McEwan has to pull-off is to make Briony's writing sufficiently readable to drag the reader through to the final denouement. In my view his attempt at satire fails. It is too over the top and too long!
B000WMFZMY|5.0|Charlton Heston stars as Spain's legendary EL CID in an absolutely spectacular and stunning film. It's a prime example of days long gone in Hollywood when films could be a true event. The scenery and costumes are beautiful. Hollywood stopped making films of this statue decades ago. Watching EL CID is a step in time through Hollywood movie history.  A young Sophia Loren is gorgeous. The film is a visual delight and a must for a movie buff.
0802130208|5.0|I have never met another person who has read the book and not loved it. When I was about ten years old, my mom was in the bookstore and couldn't decide on anything so I showed her this knowing nothing about it but liking the name and the cover. Quickly it spread through my family and finally to every generation. The imagination that went into this book is so unique and funny, and some may say tragic. Yet, though it is widely known that Toole died (suicide) w/out attempting to publish this, I cannot help but believe that this book had to be a grand triumph for Toole, if even a triumph through the acknowledgment of living a ridiculous life in a ridiculous world. (I am not referring to his suicide incidentally) And no insult to Toole, but only the grand finale that so many people come to and after which  they resign to higher freedom with less answers. Anyway, there is no need to analyze this. There's really nothing I can say other than that you might find more humor in this book than you thought the world could hold. As long as you've picked up a single work of fiction and enjoyed it, I'd say this is a safe bet. The ultra-literate don't hype this up like other books but can't deny it's brilliance and those just looking for good character development and a good story will be hard pressed to find anything better (maybe ever). I hope you buy C.O.D.'s and convince others to read it. FINAL POINT: if there was ever a book not to be apprehensive about buying, this is it. That is, unless you've got some really serious hangups regarding civil rights. There are hardly any particulars in life that one can count on for joy. Joy is usually unexpected. Yet, almost without deviation, this book brings joy to everyone who reads it. R.I.P. John Kennedy Toole.     I'll recommend another book that is also fun only because the author has passed on and wrote enough books that not too many people take him seriously. The book I'll mention is pretty hilarious. In one chapter (the one that you're expecting to be the most boring) I almost threw up laughing:    [[ASIN:1400079608 Leave It to Psmith]]
B0009UC81A|5.0|It's a classic. Funny, good action, good music and just a good time. You'll end up watching this over and over. Good for our collection.

0143038419|5.0|At moments Gilbert is able to stand outside herself and be an objective observer, and is not the least bit afraid to call herself out on what she sees.  In one particularly revealing sequence, a complete stranger describes her as 'young and beautiful' and she suddenly realizes that SHE had a story about herself that called her 'old and divorced,' and that in fact SHE made up that story herself!  She created that story and then believed it to be true until a stranger offered the idea that that story was, in fact, inaccurate/irrelevant.  She had the lovely insight to say to herself - wow, I am the one who created that idea, and now that doesn't have to be my story about myself anymore.    This is a very beautiful book about a personal path to enlightenment.  Two of my favorite books which also feature stories about discovering enlightenment in the modern world are \\"[[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]]\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  If you enjoy \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" you will totally enjoy these two awesome books also.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|Compared to the minimal version available in other countries this is far better. You get all the versions of the film released to date plus all of the extras. As an added bonus the discs are not region coded so you'd be better off ordering this version than buying the over priced European one!
B00004U2G4|5.0|It is hard to understand why Jeff Beck could never find a way to be part of a group that could really make the payday. Post Yardbirds it seems that this guy moved from project to project and never really found bandmates with which he could develop into a cohesive unit. His guitar work has always been inovative and intense. I personally feel that he is by far a more inventive guitarist than Clapton or most certainly than Jimmy Page who basically ripped off a ton of Beck's licks and called them his own. Truth really showed promise when it came out. I remember my buddies and I holding the 1st Zeppelin album and Truth next to each other debating which we preferred. Truth won out everytime, but of course Rod Stewart blew our minds as well. This Jeff Beck group just faded away and you always heard how hard Beck was to work with and that is why nothing ever lasted. Years later comes Blow by Blow ushering in a new phase of Jazz fusion, and once again Beck is breaking ground. Truth is a landmark album and certainly one that is a must have if for nothing other than hearing a young Rod Stewart busting out with possibly the classiest sounding rock guitarist that has ever played.
B000093BDX|5.0|Take a walk down memory lane!  This CD has the best collection of Beach Boys hits around.  I compared it with all the other releases and felt this was the best compilation.      The sound was very good also. VERY ENJOYABLE!

B000XA5K4I|5.0|Okay, I'm a fan of Clive Owen and was pretty entertained by the cheesy gun battles in this movie.  Although many scenes were far fetched, the movie, in general, was action packed and kept my attention. There were humerous/sarcastic dialogs as well.  Overall, I think you'd be satified with this movie.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Shipped fast with no problems. Cheaper than buying on i-tunes-- and it is a great CD.
1596680296|5.0|got this book at the library and had to have it.  I had a desire to knit some socks (it's winter-don't ask) and found other books very hard to understand.  this book has very clear instructions, large illustrations for the hard parts, and instructions for all different types of yarn so you can experiment.  p.s. the socks turned out great - making pair #3.!
B000WCBMA8|5.0|I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed. Each song is unique and is good in its own way. My favorites are \\"Tick Tick Boom,\\" and \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.\\", which I've seen people start dancing to when played.

B000784WMW|5.0|What more can be said about this exquisite 1983 adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\".  Having worn out my VHS tape, I'm profoundly greatful to now have the beautiful DVD which will wear out soon, as well, for viewing it so frequently!  I am in awe of Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Rochester - his diction, his command of the written word, his inflection, his chemistry with Ms. Clarke, his brooding yet loving commitment to the character,his masculinity and his handsomeness. The entire production was magical - the setting, the actors and the trueness to Ms. Bronte's masterpiece. Mr. Dalton was and remains one of my favorite actors.  I only wish we see more of him here in the U.S. including stage, movies and television. I give this lasting treasure 5 stars+.  It is a treat for every age group and will remain, in my experience, the most beautiful production of such a unequivocal \\"masterpiece\\".  I recently purchased the 2006 version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson - it was well done and was lighter and brighter and wonderfully updated as to sensual scenes. Both were a release from today's world and takes one back to a simpler time filled with dignity, reserve, ettiquete and true love.  Enjoy your viewing.

1582701709|1.0|(I listened to the audiobook read by the author).<br />If you ignore all the supporting comments from the so-called \\"scientists\\" and all the invalid points that are made throughout the whole book, you can pretty much summarize this book in 2 words: Think positive.<br />And well, that's no news.<br /><br />Lousy book, and completely illogical most of the time.<br />\\"Think it, and it will happen to you.\\"<br />Yeah, right!<br /><br />There is no mention at all of that \\"you\\" person having to work for it a little/a lot.<br />Sit on the couch and wait for it, it'll come, really (I wish sarcasm came through better in typing.)<br /><br />If only life was that easy!<br /><br />Not to mention the part where it says: \\"if something bad happens, you caused it happen\\".<br />So very wrong!<br /><br />Drunk driver slams into your car, and then it's your fault he chose to drive drunk?<br />Someone gets seriously ill - it's his/her own fault?<br /><br />Kind of like \\" if you ignore your problems long enough, surely they'll all disappear on their own\\".<br />But where someone stands in the middle of the road with their eyes closed muttering \\"I see no flames\\" I think it's a lot wiser to call the fire department when your house is about to burn down.<br /><br />I am convinced positive thinking is good for a person, but you're much better off taking a little action to get your life in order, than to sit and read/listen to any of this \\"Secret\\" yada-yada.<br /><br />To quote another brilliant 'scientist' ;) \\"What's the secret, they're all morons?\\"

1594481717|4.0|In Pinks book \\"A Whole New Mind, Why Right-brainers will Rule the future\\" he talks about how as our society grown people will need to be more creative or as he calls it a more right-brained instead of being more logical or more left-brained. Pink explains that as our society has grown from the industrial age to the information age our society has over used logical thinking to advance ourselves into the next age. Pink says this change in the American society to a more right brained culture has resulted from three things. One of the reasons is that our society have had all of its basic needs fulfilled and that we actually have an abundance of what our society needs to survive. The second reason is that many jobs are being shipped overseas, this will not affect the US as much as pink says. When industrial jobs began to ship overseas people thought that the US would hit a recession but yet the US prospered and the unemployment rate did not rise to extremely high values. The third reason that is given is that computers can perform many of the functions that humans used to do only faster causing a loss of jobs, but what pink forgets to realize is that to keep those machines running humans must repair them constantly which means that the people that lost their jobs to the machines get them back repairing the machines that took their jobs.Pink says that to get in to this new age people will need to implement six changes into their lives. Some of the changes pink mentions are very hard to implement and some may not be possible. These six changes are design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning. The first change, design, is implemented by changes in the school where Design is implemented into every subject much like some special charter schools. The problem I see with this is that Pink takes the few schools to represent all the children in the U.S. so implementing this into all schools may have a lot of kids unable to do the work to pass. The second change, story, is implemented by explaining everything in stories. I agree here with Pink in that more of what is said to people as just fact can be better understood as a story. Symphony is one of the emotions where we try to put together all the pieces what may seem to be unrelated fields. As strange as this may seem this has always been done and if you need examples from today's world just look at any freshmen engineering design project. Empathy is the emotion for feeling for someone else. This emotion has always depended upon the way a person has grown up and depends mostly on the parent teachings. Play is something that really needs to be increased in the workplace, as the adage goes \\"a happy worker is a productive worker,\\" meaning that if a person is happy at work they are generally a harder worker at that workplace. Having meaning in life and work is actually related to the above adage, if a worker is given a task that is important and has meaning than that worker will generally work had on that task whereas if a worker is given a pointless task and there is no meaning and the worker knows it then, the worker will not put his/her full effort into that particular task.
B00005JPLW|5.0|300 is an amazing conversion of a graphic novel to the screen. In these days of corporate control & marketing, it is amazing that Frank miller's incredible work has made it to the screen in such a faithful version.<br />Although amazingly violent for a main-stream movie, it is required viewing for all film fans, and I'm sure will also be used as training material in film schools all over the world (every frame is a work of art). The extras disk will tell you all you need to know about this great film.

B000W8OM5Y|4.0|I was very disappointed with the initial release of Braveheart, my Number 1 Favorite (Co-favorite with Dances with Wolves) film of all time. There were dirt specks, hairs and other particles on the print. It was obviously not cleaned before production printing. Now we have, not only a clean, pristine print, but commentary from Mel and new features. Surprisingly, Mel knows less about some of his co-stars than I do. He refers to Michael Byrne as John Byrne and doesn't mention the names of others, but this makes little difference as we now have a great copy of a truly great film. I highly recommend it.

0800141660|5.0|Followed the book quite well.  Outstanding acting.  Great cast.  First time I had really watched Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson in action.  Truly fine actresses.  The screenplay by Emma Thompson well deserved the Oscar.  Consider it one of the best of Jane Austen's work.  Another great Ang Lee works.
140120306X|4.0|Don't approach The Black Dossier as LOEG3. It's not. It's more of a primer for the new series Century, a history of the League up to the 1950s, and a broad overview of the alternative history in which it's set, and the characters that inhabit that world. It's filled with treats for the attentive fan, but for the casual reader it will come across as infuriatingly, willfully obtuse. It makes great demands on you. To make the most of it, you will need to have the kind of encyclopedic knowledge of comics and pulp fiction that Moore and O'Neill have. Or, try Jess Nevin's annotations at [...] Very useful. I recommend reading the book once through, then again with his notes. I guarantee you'll pick up twice as much background detail.   To summarise; enormous fun and a beautiful object. But very much an incidental volume to the series.

0375701427|5.0|This is a very well written novel.  It is also very difficult to read.  It isn't happy!  It really visits the seamy side of life and is emotionally difficult.  As a parent, you know that only by the Grace of God this did not happen to you.  It explores the depths of parental love and the exasperation of raising a child in a difficult time.  Roth more than deserved the Pulitzer for this novel, and you will be richer for reading it, but it won't be easy.
1401211909|4.0|This was a very well written book.  It was a little odd at times, but very entertaining.  I have to admit that the movie was better though.  Go see the movie after reading this book.  You will love it!

B000O75F7C|4.0|Had never heard these guys before.  Good tunes with interesting lyrics.  Musically, I would say sonically they have elements similar to Genesis, Marillion, Dream Theater, even Filter.  Ashes is a great tune, as is the title track.  Lyrics address the social isolation faced by youth and foisted upon us all by technology and the evolution of society.  Weakest track is the last one.  Overall an interesting and moving CD.

B000TKW3E2|5.0|Let me preface with this is my first review ever.    I watched the movie a couple of weeks ago and the first time I saw it, I sort of emotionally floated through it not exactly sure where it was going (I guess I should have read the novel first). After the denouement ending revealed the plot twist, I had to watch it again, this time understanding the symbolisms and subtle hints given in the movie. During my second viewing, I went through an entire tissue box with emotions. Especially during the scene at the Cafe. I have now watched the movie four times (yes it is that good).    Now, on to the soundtrack, I listened to the soundtrack a few days later and discovered that a large part of the emotion comes not only from the movie, but from the haunting score.  If you have seen the movie, don't be surprised if you uncontrollably start tearing-up while listening to several of the songs. It is so hypnotic that it will stop you from what you are doing and visually pull you back to the movie (almost like in the film \\"Somewhere in Time\\").  I have listened to the soundtrack at least 20-30s times already and it will probably stay in my CD player until after the Oscars.  If you have not seen the movie, listening to the soundtrack will surely compel you to do so.
0451169514|5.0|This is my favorite book by Stephen King and one of my favorite books period. The detailing and masterful storytelling are marvelous. It's very long but I didn't get bored while reading it. It took me two weeks to read the first time. If you like Stephen King and you let your imagination run free enough to believe read this book! The movie sucked but the book is great
B000HT3PPG|4.0|This product contains both an original black and white and a colorized copy of the original Miracle on 34th Street.  Personally I feel that colorization is a major travistry but..  The black and white original is the cleanest, clearest copy of this classic that I have seen in years.  The original cast is so good that there have been several remakes all of which were a waste of time.  This is the definitive copy of a timeless story.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This is an excellent compilation of all the efforts to date to make this film complete.  The interviews and commentaries are very well done.  Personally, I still like the original release because of the Harrison Ford voiceovers - it think this really adds an important dimension to the story.  For me, the ideal film still does NOT exist - that would be the Final Cut PLUS the addition of the Harrison Ford voiceovers.  THAT would be a very complete package that I would be happy with.
B00005JPXY|5.0|This movie is only part of another movie and if you put it into relation to the other pieces - sequel in 2009 (as stated on IMDB), the many related web sites and the facebook sites of the characters - this is a brilliant concept.   The movie itself, is only one part of the whole show. If you look it at as a stand-alone product, it may deserve 3 stars but if you take the concept and the things to come into account, it gets 5 from me.  JJ Abrams is following his very successful LOST scheme - open endings, mysteries, hints. And he just re-invented the monster movie genre which I thought was dead. What could have come after dozens of Godzilla, The Thing, The Blob and so on movies? It was over.  However, he made a refreshing start, entertaining the audience, making people curious for more.   I see this movie as a - usually - small part of a monster movie. Remember the lost video footage found by the military at the beginning of this kind of movies? Not showing too much but giving you a glimpse of the monster.  Well, that is this film in my understanding. But not only a short clip, it is nearly a full movie, but still parts are missing.  What did I learn from this story? I know now a part of the story - only a part. But I want to know the whole story. What will I do? Watch the sequel. Meanwhile I check all the hidden sites and hints in the Internet.  Brilliant marketing concept and instead that somebody holds a sign right in my face reading in big red letters 'BUY THIS', I have to get involved, do something on my own to find the clues to satisfy my curiosity.  Wow, this is brilliant marketing and very entertaining too.  Coming back to the movie itself, the story has been told several times but not in this way and that makes it original plus the things to come and the bread crumbs in the Internet.   Also the movie is pretty close to reality and is told logical. I couldn't find any major plot holes. The actors are very believable in their roles and the props and FX were just so well done, that I was completely in the movie.   Therefore a 5 star rating from me - besides the shaky camera, but this is part of the plan and stirs the discussion.   I can also recommend to read the FAQ for the movie on IMDB - very interesting.

B000WMFZMY|5.0|Great Movie!!!  I saw El Cid when I was a kid and just loved it! I became a real Charlton Heston fan around this time.  Two years ago I bought a DVD of El Cid and the reviews were horrible, but I just had to have the movie. They were right...it was like a terrible video transfer and had Chinese writing all over it.  That should have been my first clue!  The new one released last week was beautifully remastered in stunning color and clearity.  The 5.1 stereo sound makes it truly a pleasure to watch and listen to.  I highly recommend this movie to all classic movie buffs like myself.  I am so glad that I finally had a chance to add this to my collection.  I only wish they would produce more older classic movies like this, in such great condition and make them as enjoyable to watch as this great old movie!!!!
B000B8QEYC|2.0|The REAL reason this album sucks is becuase she's singing in English. Not being able to make-up what the songs are about each time you listen & having to concentrate on the meaning just ruined the entire experience for me.

B000XA5K48|3.0|All in all, a fun movie to watch. An action movie that ends up falling into blatant hilarity in many a place. The only downside that I could find is that the directors insisted on injecting seriousness where it was not needed. People should have seen this movie for what it was - a glorified Hott Fuzz with a better star (Clive Owen).
B0002F6AH0|5.0|What a superb collection!  This should be required viewing for every student of American History.
0740748475|5.0|Wow :) Those comics are so fun ! And here in France, buying the entire collection would have been very, very expensive (about 16 euro per book, and there are 12 of them !). This original collection only costed me 75 euro, and it was there in about 10 days :)     You know what ? I'm happy...
0440237688|5.0|This is a great book for making teens think. I had both my teens read it and then we discussed it in a teen group, the discussions were great. I even recommend it for adults that haven't read it.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I missed out... well hopefully some place will play in on the big screen again I hope.  Just finished with the netflix rental and jumped on here to purchase.  Great songs, great interpretations, great, great, great... loved Mr. Kite and Happyness is a warm gun.  Why oh why did I not see this in theaters... $#*&@()!(*&#!!!!!!!!!!  Its a toss up as to which will be played more often now... Hard Days Night or Across the Univers.
B000FA57US|5.0|The spooky atmosphere makes these films. I recommend this Film to anyone. My favourite movies are pts 1-5. Pt 1 - 3 brings me back to my youth and the DVD transfers are fine, if you are after something intelligent, this is not for you, for the films are a fun and entertaining session of good-looking horny teens getting slashed. Not great but what the hell its all popcorn stuff anyway. If anyone is interested in Halloween collectables, email taylor5821@hotmail.com
B000077VPU|3.0|I was very excited to find this for sale on Amazon, and ordered a copy for myself and my sister, who also loves this show. However, we were very disappointed to find that it is incomplete. Lacking on this DVD are the many fabulous songs by Extreme. Cherone delivers such a spirited tribute on the original copy, and there is only a small sampling of his rousing appearance. I would love to find a copy of the concert in its entirety. Liat Faver

B000000I0H|5.0|Mike Oldfield's pinnacle of musical expression.  Period.  Deliberately paced, superbly orchestrated, brilliantly performed, and powerfully passionate.  Mike Oldfield reached new heights on this album, and I remember being blown away when it came out - I nearly wore out the 4 sides of the double LP (and drove my college roomates crazy doing so).  To this day, I listen to the entire album nonstop, as it deserves.  The Song To Hiawatha part, with Maddy Prior, is especially ethereal, and the finale is spine-tingling.  Brilliant!!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|One of the best new Sci fi movies in years. Excellent casting, score and mood make for the feel of a 30's universal horror film. the entire concept of flying to the environs of the sun is unique. Much more than special effects.    highly recommended.
0307277887|4.0|Easy, enjoyable read. Serial killer story with a twist. Not always believable but that didn't detract from the enjoyment. Details of how the characters talk and think very similar to the TV show but some characters play different roles in the show. A good book to read between heavier reading.
B0002KVULG|5.0|A very stylish rendition of the Count Dracula story adapted from the stage production starring Frank Langella. He brings a sense of mystery and sensuality to the part that I feel has always been missing, and turned it from just a horror tale into a love story. Very atmospheric, beautifully costumed and interesting on multiple levels.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Loved this one! My grandchildren watched it every day for a week and still ask to see it when they come over. Very pleased with the service and the dvd
B0010V4TZU|2.0|These guys will tour and make a lot of money.  Then everyone will roll over in bed one morning and realize those critics were wrong about their new darlings.  Hopefully it only takes one album for that realization.  Save your bucks and buy Stephen Malkmus' new album, or at least go see him tour.  That is sensible behavior.  Those Vampire Weekend youtube videos were just painful to watch, bright sweaters, collars everywhere, boat shoes, uggh.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Cant say I miss Creed anymore. These guys rock and both of their CD's are very good.
0553213105|5.0|This book speaks to every romantic.  It's written beautifully in the classic language that every man and woman speaks while in the throes of the mating game.  I read this book at least yearly to remind myself of not only the gloriously beautiful fluent English language and wit of Miss Bennett, but the always refreshing humility, which this book's title fails to mention.  It is truly a beautiful piece of romantic literature.  The sensual / sexual tension between Miss Bennett and Mr. Darcy is something I never tire of.

B0011HOEY4|4.0|\\"American gangster\\" is a zealous and well detailed chronicle about the slow spark of a cold blooded gangster, whose chess player mind and terrible childhood makes of him a ruthless boss.<br /><br />On the other hand we will have an ethical agent whose bullet proof honesty simply is out of range respect the 75% of his colleagues in the anti drugs office.<br /><br />In fact, Scott makes a breakthrough respect the previous fast paced thrillers of the genre to focus in the interiorities of this unknown citizen who builds a true empire of his illegal business thanks to his contacts in Bangkok.<br /><br />Evidently, you will realize there are previous traces of similar films like \\" Serpico\\", \\" French connection \\", \\"Prince of the city\\" and a smooth breeze of \\" The Godfather I \\" .<br /><br />The fine performances of Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe are by far, the main pillars of this absorbing and overlong movie.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Excellent purchase.  I consider this the best HD movie release to date.  Has many extremely sharp and clear images of animals across the world.  The picture quality puts you into a slight coma in your living room.  It is one of those shows where as soon as you look, you have to keep looking until the episodes done.  I have watched each episode several times, now I play it when company comes over to show off the HD skills.  The only dissapointing part is that Sigourney Weaver doesn't narrate it like on the Discovery Series.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I figured that if Timbaland signed them then they must be worth listening to. i was right!!!! their album sounds exactly like i thought it would and that's a good thing. i was afraid that Timbo would put his signature sound on them but he let them do their thing and it worked. i love the whole album. i just pop it in and let it play. after hearing the original version of apologize, i understand why Tim did a remix. don't get me wrong i love the original version but Timbo's version is definitely more top 40 sounding and it gives them the exposure they deserve. seriously ppl. check it out and you wont be disappointed.
B00102FELM|5.0|Truly is the Scorpions at their most power DVD concert performance..twice better than Live in Vienna and 3 times better than the Crazy World tour DVD.. 26 songs covered here from their classic era until the unbreakable album and the best thing is also perform together with former members Uli Jon Roth, Herman Rarebell and Michael Schenker! Wonder why former bassist Francis Bulcholz is not there...anyhow Live At Wacken 2006 DVD is a must for Scorpions fans and Classic Metal fans alike....
B000N6TYLW|4.0|The Gilmore \\"girls\\" of Season 7 are full-grown women, with all the complications of life that this entails.  While things changed during this season, and you can sense it over the first seven to eight episodes, things finally seem to settle in to give you the full range of these characters we've all come to love.  As I watched the final episode, I felt content.  In a way, I felt as though there was more to come for both Rory and Lorelai, but they were all good things.  I guess you could say that even with things hanging a little, you knew these characters were just beginning a new chapter in their lives as well, and I was ready to wish them good luck!  If you love previous seasons, you'll get into these sooner or later and feel part of Stars Hollow and the Gilmore lives once again.
B000ZINGIK|4.0|It is quite difficult for me to review something like this because there are so many different tastes out there and someone will always disagree, it's only natural. However, I'll try to judge this objectively.    First, in order to purchase this album, you must ask yourself: what kind of metal are you mostly into? The melodic heavy power speed one? Or the cleaner, slower, more sophisticated, more progressive one?   If your answer is the former, you will like Avantasia's \\"Metal Opera\\" Parts 1 and 2 more than this record. Those are darker in their moods, the guitar work is more memorable (and the melodies are as well), and they have a signature power metal \\"uplifting\\" feeling  to them. If, however, your answer is the latter, you might really dig this one. It has crystal clear production, more versatile styles songs, without or with little 'typical power metal' stamps on the melodies, and tempos are generally slower.  I am torn somewhere in the middle of these two. First, I didn't feel it was everything I hoped for in this record. But on the second and third spins I started really getting into the mood of it and started digging it more and more.     Some definite highlights for me were: \\"Devil in the Belfty\\", \\"Another Angel Down\\", and \\"I Don't Believe in Your Love\\". Tobias' voice is superb on all songs and the guitar riffs are nice and heavy. I found myself wishing for a few more (or longer) solos at times...but I am a solo junkie, so that might be a subjective perception. What I did not like very much were some of the slower tracks this time around: \\"What kind of Love\\" and \\"Lost In Space\\" in particular. Maybe, again, that is because of the lack of any kind of a solo. Also, the title track seems very dragged out in the last 3-4 minutes of the song, almost like Tobias just \\"wanted\\" it to feel epic and tried too hard.     So there you have it in a nutshell. I hope you can find this review useful in deciding whether you want to purchase this record or not. I personally give it a very solid 4 stars, there were many very talented musicians on this one. Good job, Tobias!
0800141660|5.0|My wife loves it....Hugh Grant in typecast role as a softspoken impassionate gentlemen and Emma Thompson is great.  Alan Rickman is not a bad guy either which was a shock . I was expecting him and Bruce Willis to duke it out at any moment...but Bruce is not in this and this movie has nothing to do with die hard...but you get my point.  Rickman plays a distant gentleman which is an easy transition for a typecast bad guy.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I believe the general consensus towards this movie is very divisive.   I've read very favourable reviews, as well as reviews which were harsh, to the point of making ad hominen attacks on the director.   For myself, I was absolutely impressed by the movie on my first viewing about a year ago.  I decided to get the DVD and watch it a second time, thinking that my views on the movie might change.   They did not.  I still consider the movie to be brilliant, revelatory and thought-provoking.
0143058525|5.0|One of the most fascinating books I've ever read (listened to).  Worth every cent. It has changed my perspective on life and given me confidence and self-worth.  I'm really excited about focusing on my meditation practices.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I had watched this many many months ago and I've always wanted to own the DVD but unfortunately you can't buy in stores in Singapore.       The image and sound quality is excellent and although there are a bunch of interesting but not very substantive extras, I was a litle dissapointed there was no commentary.   I did enjoy the commentary by Lee and his partner in crime Schamus for 'Crouching Tiger' so I was looking forward to something like that.  I guess the commentary only appears in the 'Deluxe' edition.    Having said that, you can't go wrong with this movie.   Its a classic and is timeless.  I think history will judge it very favourably.
B000040OBS|5.0|This is were this whole industrial thing started. The absolutely brilliant mix of rockabilly-groove with ice-cold machinery.  If you'r in to industrial music, like Ministry, Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson, or Synth/EBM this is an absolute nescesity in your record collection!!!
B000003EQE|5.0|When I was in college in the mid-50s, we used to go in to Los Angeles to hear Jasha Heifetz in recital.  We called him \\"The Iron Man\\" somewhat in derision, both for his playing style and for his rigid stance on stage while playing.  While in awe of his technique, we preferred the gentler, more \\"romantic\\" playing of David Oistrakh and Arthur Grumiaux and such.<br /><br />But as I grew out of my teenage romantic fixation, and as my own playing frustrated and disappointed me more and more, I learned to appreciate the heart and skill Heifetz put into his work.  This recording represents the \\"summa,\\" I believe, of Heifetz' life work on the instrument.  I think he is the only violinist who ever fully understood this score.  And nowhere in violin literature is his absolute tonal precision in higher position attacks and in rapid double stops more essential to the musical outcome.<br /><br />Recently a music professional recommended the Oistrakh to me as \\"the best Sibelius ever,\\" and on that comment I decided to give it another hearing, but I found it disappointing in several respects.  Among other things, I was distressed by Oistrakh's sloppy upper position attacks, often having to slide onto the pitch after first hitting the string a tad too low or too high, not to mention his generally sloppy pitch in the faster sections, and his tendency to play the piece as if he thought he were doing something by Brahms--often playing a light bow up near the finger board when he should have been pressing down closer to the bridge.  (See my review of that recording at the Amazon Sibelius/Oistrakh listing).<br /><br />Aside from Heifetz' technical skill, I am deeply moved by the assertive vigor of his approach and by the dark brooding intensity he brings to the work.  Where Oistrakh plays as if strolling on a warm moonlit evening around a quiet lake, Heifetz plays as under dark clouds threatening a storm.  The Chicago Symphony, under the direction of Walter Hendl, plays in perfect concert with the solo, as an equal partner, so that together they produce an organic unity of wonderful effect.<br /><br />I have not listened to every extant recording of the Sibelius concerto, but this one stands high above every other I have heard.  In comparison with Heifetz the others sound weak and indecisive, if not outright ignorant of the intent of the work.  After Sibelius it was no longer possible to write a serious \\"Romantic\\" violin concerto, though many have tried.  After Heifetz it is not possible to play this work in the romantic manner, though many continue to try.<br /><br />About the program: This disk also contains the Prokofiev No. 2 and the Glazunov. I have never liked very much anything by Prokofiev. He too often sounds to me like Erik Satie with an earache. This work is a prime example of his urgently discordant nonsense. In spite of Heifetz' best efforts, it does not reach me. The Glazunov is a milder piece, not a lot of depth, but pleasingly melodic in many places, except the fourth movement is almost as bad as the Prokofiev.<br /><br />Update Nov., 2014:  This evening I undertook, after long reluctance, to hear the entire CD through without stopping.  My reaction to the Prokofiev was that this horrid piece of pseudo music entirely spoils the effect of the wonderful Sibelius -- unfortunately coming right after a short pause.  The opening solo theme is bearable, but it soon degenerates into raucous nonsense, wading endlessly through incongruous variations.  The first ninety seconds of the second movement present a nice violin melody -- unfortunately over a plunk-plunk accompaniment of mismatched chords.  It then moves into a series of episodes which sound for all the world like excerpts from a set of practice exercises.  The third movement starts off brashly incoherent and gets worse as it moves along.  I'm sure there are people who like this kind of stuff, aber ohne mich.<br /><br />The Glazunov is much better.  Rather shallow and juvenile in places, no match for the Sibelius, but quite passable in context.<br /><br />My suggestion:  Take the Sibelius for what it is -- arguably the greatest performance of a great piece of music -- and stop the music when that piece is finished.text.

B000WCBPOG|4.0|Why are the Beatles debatibly the 'Greatest Band of All Time?' A great many things can be said about them. Through out their career they release such a diverse group of records each new release was like hearing them for the first time. No matter how many times a greatest hits or a re-issue or a re-mixed cd of their songs was released. We flocked to the store to get what was there. Their latest creation this time around is not exactly their own. That is the Across the Universe soundtrack.<br /><br />Almost never is a soundtrack better than its' own film. This 31 track cd is Beatles music in a whole new light. The cast sings almost all of the tracks and beleive me I never new Evan Rachel Wood or Selma Hayak for that matter could even sing! There are also famous musician that give a little help such as Bono with 'I Am The Walrus' and 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' Joe Cocker with 'Come Together'. And of course probably the most original song in the pack 'Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite' as advertised by Eddie Izzard.<br /><br />That brings me to why this cd is an honorary Beatles record worthy of your collection. Each song though you know all the words and all the music each song is an original depiction that flows with the story and the mood the film as it progressed. The only thing that really upset me was the fact that the instrumental version of 'A Day In The Life' that was played my Martain Luther McCoy is not on any soundtrack. Still it is an incredible listen from start to finish it is pretty much what saved the movie itself and like the rest of your Beatles albums you'll listen to this one many times as well.
B00005U2LM|5.0|First off ..im tired of dudes being like MAN its not 36 chambers ..come on kids hahah... why you want the same LP over & over....listen to this with FRESH EARS...the beats are DOPE!!!!! the words ARE DOPE!!!! so its a DOPE!!! LP!! .. only two tracks that I dont personal FEEL 100% \\"Dashing\\" & \\"Chrome Wheels\\" ..but the beats are the only thing that bugg me...the lyrics are on point!!!... this is a CLASSIC HIP HOP ALBUM!!!!
B000ZLFALI|3.0|As a huge Beatles fan since the age of 5 seeing the trailer for this movie was a very big thing. Not that many people have the audacity to bring the Musical to the big screen anymore, especially if the story is not based on a broadway musical. 'Acorss The Universe' is the story of an English bloke named Jude (from Liverpool no surprise) heading to America in the 60s to find his estranged father. No sooner that he get there he is swept up into the whole revolution that was America at that time. A wild and fun loving guy named Max and his sheltered younger sister Lucy guide him through this crazy time through travel, drugs, politics and of course song.<br /><br />While the movie was creative and being a Beatles fan it is something to see, I felt that the movie was just a little overhyped. I felt there were plenty of unanswered questions due to plot holes. There wasn't enough character development. While the story was very well thought out I felt that the movie was more focused on the music leaving the plot very shallow. Yes it is true that the point of the movie was for the songs to tell the story, as a person that loves film I just don't like that concept. I like to get involved and think about the stories, not just get lost in a visual specticle. Still, the linking of Beatles knowledge and 1960's pop culture references was pretty much what kept me interested in sticking around from start to finish.<br /><br />Did I hate this movie...no I found it origional and entertaining. I loved the guest appreaences of faces like Bono and Eddie Izzard. I loved the refernces to alot of secondary Beatles songs. I just feel that it was a story that could have been developed so much more if the movie was not focused on the songs. I have seen many musicals in my days. 'The Music Man', 'The Sound Of Music' and oh hell 'South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut'. They are had songs driving the movie, but at the same time a fantastic story that made you love it when the credits rolled. Still any Beatles fan out there should take the time to see 'Across The Universe'. You will be glad you did.n out there should take the time to see 'Across The Universe'. You will be glad you did.
B000002KDS|5.0|For the real Alice Cooper fans that have not been pacified by the few commercial tracks Alice Cooper produced, \\"Killer\\" is definitely worth a buy.  In my opinion Killer is clearly the best work turned out by Alice Cooper.  Tracks like \\"You Drive Me Nervous\\" and \\"Under My Wheels\\" are a shot of pure rock-n-roll.  The title track \\"Killer\\" is a melodic death march reminding us of the great stage theatrics Alice Cooper performed.  \\"Dead Babies\\" is not for the squeamish, but it tells a powerful story.  And \\"Halo Of Flies\\" is an absolute masterpiece rivaling some of the most powerful overtures.  This is real good stuff, you won't be disappointed.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|the vistas and animals are breath taking.  Never a dull moment for the first 4 dvds.  This is the best nature series I have seen, and I believe I have seen almost all the Richard Attenborough films and National Geographic ones too.  The last dvd feels like an attempt to preach, and tends to be a little pedantic and boring; when the worthy message of preservation is clearly conveyed.

B000Q66PXE|5.0|it has excellent technical production quality (cast, costume, script, sets, choreography, etc). highly recommended for all adults, except the squeamish and those on a moral straitjacket.  Weaves historical fact with soap drama to tell an intriguing story of ancient Rome and thereby shows the differences and similarities of life then and now.  This series has brought to life and explained more about ancient Rome than any textbook or movie I have previously seen. it manages to combine history, sex,  violence, eye candy, drama, intrigue and politics into a series that we will not see the likes of again anytime soon.
B000OCXM68|5.0|Imagine how surprised I was to find out how great this album is--easy listening--songs I love and had forgotten about..It has turned into a favorite...
B00005JPUN|3.0|Ok, most bad reviews here are justified. Did we need another remake? For sure not. But on the other hand, a really strong story at the core of the script proves nearly unkillable.<br />And I want to place on record my objection to the Kidman bashing: I think she does a very good job and makes the movie watchable despite all efforts to the contrary, she certainly helps safe the suspense, which is not totally out. (Hope nobody noticed that I am the chairman of the Kidman fanclub in Morning Land.)<br />One objection to the script: the story is 50 years old, the efforts to place it at the turn of the century have given us some nice anachronisms. There is a Czechoslovakian Ambassador in the story, at the same time that the Irak war and the Darfur crisis are issues. Of course one can't expect a Hollywood script writer to keep up with all the political changes in Europe...
0439882826|5.0|This is the best pop up book I have ever seen.  I was a little skeptical about buying it, but it is far better than I ever expected.  It will not disappoint.  My 7 yr old loves it and said he was like a rock star when he brought it in for show and tell.  It is visually entertaining for all ages.
1416523359|3.0|As far as King goes, this isn't his worst, and this isn't his best. It was engaging (I finished it within a few days), but I am beginning to find his dives into the working mind of the writer a bit tiresome. The little oddities between Lisey and Scott felt a little affected to me, although I did like how King linked Scott's fear of eating fruit at night to his death. Okay. An engaging read, but nothing earth-shaking.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This movie is awesome!  I had to have it as soon as it hit HD.  The sound is great, the visuals are outstanding, and the battle scenes are a must see.  Overall, it is one of my favorite Blu-ray purchases.

B000NY17J6|5.0|I was watching a U tube video about Linda Ronstadt, and wondered if I could get a CD of hers. I went to my favorite site, Amazon, and typed it in.  Up popped all her old records, now on CD. I had gotten rid of my record collection years ago, because we live in an RV now and don't have the room.  I was excited about finding a collection of her best hits. I didn't need all 8 records again, just my favorite ones. They were all here on this one long playing CD!! Life is good, when you can put on a CD and relive those 60s, 70s and your youth!! Now, I want to find the Monkees. Oh joy!
B000FVRACK|5.0|Rubinstein's technique and use of himself is simply astonishing, especially at the age he was at this performance! I think he continually improved throughout his life. The interview with him included on the disk was delightful and had interesting information about the pieces.     If you like the Grieg piano concerto, this is a very fine performance. I don't necessarily agree with all of the maestro's and conductor's choices of expressions, but these disagreements are few so the performance was still quite moving. The Saint Saens piano concerto is also quite moving. The difference of the sound-milieus of the  metropolitan Parisian and the Bergen native can be distinctly heard.    The sound was excellent and the way the cameras were set, one feels as if in a small audience sitting right at the sweet spot. So good work on this. There are times that the cameramen missed opportunities to reveal the maestro's handiwork at challenging passages, but overall the choreography of the camera angles is satisfying.    Definitely worth the buy, especially if you are looking for a master technique to emulate.
B000002PCS|5.0|I have always had an affinity with the movie, and the soundtrack is just as moving..
B000008GEF|4.0|Though some of the lyrics are a bit preachy, I like most of them. The guitar work and compositions are great. I especially enjoy \\"Be Here Now\\" (acoustic + piano + ... ), the poignant harmonics for \\"The Day The World Gets 'Round\\", the flanged guitar in \\"That is All\\", the horn section in \\"The Lord Loves The One ...\\" and the slide guitar on the vitriolic \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\".<br /><br />The lyrics have a definite Hindu/Hare Krishna tilt, which is fine by me. In \\"The Lord Loves ...\\" he attempts to skewer politicians by saying they're \\"acting like big girls\\" but frankly big girls tend to be much more mature than the politicians he would have been pointing at, so I found this a little derogatory in some sense, I hope he didn't think of it that way (most religions still tend to think of women as a lower social caste), but times have moved on.<br /><br />If you like George's playing and his general philosophical bent, you'll love this album. I enjoy every single song, and come back to the songs mentioned above frequently still, after 30+ years of listening to it!
B000V86OKG|5.0|Just when I thought it couldn't get any better the second season was even better than the first! Unbelievable!
B000NDMRCS|1.0|Unless you really enjoy extreme weather footage/effects, this movie is not worth it. really cheesy plot, acting was \\"ok,\\", and I must say some of the effects were cool - but that's about it. A waste of time if you are looking for a good, fun, entertaining movie. I got bored, and I'm not the type to get bored.
0446577391|3.0|The Camel Club has become a recurring theme with this writer and while this book ties together some loose ends as to the identity and the past of \\"Oliver Stone\\" it does it in a fast paced and sometimes wildly implausabile yarn.    Baldacci has picked up the John Patterson habit of the \\"short chapter.\\" It didn't start in this book, but I would say he is begining to really get the hang of it. Ninety Nine chapters in a three hundred eighty seven page book gives you a lot of scene changes. All the loose ends from the other Camel Club novels are tied up.Some quite conveniently, some painfully but quite thoroughly.     I note that many reviewers here have liked the book to the tune of five stars. I find it easily lacking what I believe that standard to be. My biggest problem was the way in which he resolved all of the issues. To my mind it required what Coleridge once termed, \\"a willing suspension of disbelief.\\"     The Camel Club - RIP.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien series is one of those rare movies that I can enjoy time after time.  This set is a great collection.  It's inexpensive, chock full of extras, and comes in cool packaging.  A great buy for anyone who loves the films, Sigourney Weaver, or Sci-Fi.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|2007's \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\" picks up the story of Queen Elizabeth in 1585.  The young and uncertain woman who became Queen in \\"Elizabeth\\" is now the mature and confident icon of her people.  Cate Blanchett reprises her role as Elizabeth.<br /><br />Director Shekhar Kapur sets three plot threads in motion at the beginning of \\"The Golden Age.\\"  The first is Elizabeth's life at court, as she manages her counselors, a simmering rivalry between Protestants and Catholics, and proposals of marriage from a variety of foreign suitors. The lonely Elizabeth dotes on young \\"Bess\\" Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish), a young, attractive and trusted lady in waiting.  Enter Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), handsome swashbuckling seadog and explorer, who widens Elizabeth's horizons with tales of a new world and bewitches her heart with his charm.<br /><br />The second thread is the plotting of disgruntled Catholics against the Protestant Elizabeth.  Elizabeth's aging spymaster Walsingham (nicely reprised by Geoffrey Rush) seeks to guard her against assassination.  Her Catholic cousin and rival Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), is imprisoned in England but schemes with English and Spanish agents against Elizabeth.<br /><br />The third thread is the threat posed by Philip II, King of Spain.  As defender of the Catholic faith, Philip intends to depose Elizabeth and is gathering a mighty naval armada and army for that purpose.<br /><br />These three plot threads are linked, sometimes in surprising ways, and they will come together to threaten Elizabeth's hold on the throne.  The savage interrogation of an arrested Catholic plotter uncovers the Spanish threat to England, while driving Bess Throckmorton into the arms of Walter Raleigh.  A failed plot against Elizabeth's life ensnares Mary Stuart, leaving Elizabeth with an agonizing choice of punishment.  Philip's armada enters the English Channel and Elizabeth must rally England's tiny navy and army to face an invasion.<br /><br />Ultimately, this becomes too many moving parts to manage gracefully.  Director Kapur handles the triangle between Elizabeth, Raleigh, and Bess Throckmorton with delicate precision to a reasonably satisfying conclusion.  However, he chooses to interpret Mary Stuart's involvement in an assassination plot to suggest that the whole was a scheme of Philip to justify going to war (a more common interpretation is that the canny Walsingham gave Mary Stuart enough rope to hang herself).  The battle with the Spanish Armada is a series of melodramatic visuals laden with religious overtones that must have been close to incomprensible to American audiences unfamiliar with English history.  Philip, in real life an outstanding chief executive of a far-flung empire, is reduced to caricature as a gnome-like fanatic muttering threats in candle-lit royal chapels.<br /><br />\\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age\\" is a visually stunning treat, taking full advantage of lavish sets and costumes to present a sense of place and time.  The underlying theme of the original \\"Elizabeth\\" movie is reinforced with a vengeance, as Elizabeth must sacrifice her personal desires to rule and safeguard England as an iconic mother figure.  A strong cast helps carry the day.  This movie is recommended as solid entertainment to fans of costume drama and period pieces.ing parts to manage gracefully.

B0002XNT0I|5.0|Philadelphia starring Tom Hanks is a powerful movie from beginning to end. I have seen this film many times and I am still moved by the plot and incredible acting especially by Hanks. His performance was a turning point in his career, this film brought him back from his short hiatus. Denzel Washington also stars as Hank's lawyer and even though Washington's character can be superficial at times, he is able to show the many different aspects of a person not familiar with AIDS or homosexuality. If you want a deep and profound film about love, forgiveness, and the strength to stand up for injustice then Philadelphia is the film for you. Enjoy!
160024131X|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much. It gives you a perspective on the war in Afghanistan that you never hear about. Would recommend it for anyone who wants to know more about wha tis going on over there or for anyone looking for a good 'adventure' book.
B000HEYVD6|2.0|I had a tough time keeping all of the characters straight when I first started to read the book. Thought that some of the story lines were a little far fetched and somewhat boring. I kept wondering when the book would come together, there seemed to be 3 different plots going on. It's an okay book, not great, I almost gave up on reading it, only reason I kept on going was because I wanted to get my money's worth and atleast finish the book.
0061122416|5.0|this book is great.  a simple story on the outside yet a wonderful philosophical view about destiny
B000127LW2|5.0|Great series. Pretty cheesy, but fun to watch. Not a huge star trek fan. I only got into it because I got sick and watched way too much tv and they re ran voyager pretty often. I enjoy it. Pretty safe for non-trekkies.
0440238609|5.0|Enclosed in a colorful box - the cover of the book, The Golden Compass - this is an excellent way to purchase the complete His Dark Materials Trilogy.<br /><br />The slightly-oversized paperbacks provide ample room for a highly-readable font. With the focus on the release of the movie - The Golden Compass - it is a bit surprising that the book only has one movie photo, but that does not detract from an attractive box-set of three classic fantasy novels from Philip Pullman.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I ordered 3 of these DVD's.  I received them in a timely fashion.  This is a must see movie for anyone who wants to know just how corrupt our government is when it comes to matters related to health care in this country.

0439882826|5.0|My son is a huge Star Wars fan and when he saw this book his eyes lit up.  He loves it.  It is a really cool book and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Star Wars. It does take up a lot of room on a shelf because it is so thick but it has to be for all the pop-ups.  There is a lot of detail in it too.
0743277457|5.0|A friend recommend this book.<br /><br />I asked why. He said \\"just get it\\"<br /><br />Just what I need, another book on how to learn.<br /><br />But wait. It's so much more. I got sucked in to the story of a kid playing chess and switching to martial arts.. weird combo.<br /><br />Then the secrets comes through. Doesn't matter which sport you play, what game to conquer, EVERY skill can be mastered better when you look at it this way.<br /><br />Did I explain this well?  Maybe not.. Take my friend's advice..just get the book
B000GTJT0M|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I bought the HD-DVD because it was a movie big on effects and liked it alot. Very uniquie video effects. Very good acting. HD-DVD special features are good and worth watching unlike most extras in HD-DVDs. This movie is in the Comic Book genre and because of that story is corny and unbelievable. HD-DVD renders the uniquie video effects beautifully. Fun to watch. Not a movie for serious souls
B00125WAWS|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and was mesmerized.  Although debate has undergone a metamorphis since 1935, it is still a great film.  Of course, it helps to know something about debate, or at least have a rudimentary knowledge of it.  There are many types of debate, but it probably closely resembles the Lincoln-Douglas format, although it uses two debaters in the competition, which resembles policy debate.  They are not debating policy, but a topic, and though most of the debate takes place in a small Texas black college against the prestigious Harvard Debate team, it is a great film.  Denzil Washington and oscar winner Whitaker are incredible.  I have long been a fan of Denzil who has piled up several oscars himself, I was fascinated by Whitaker who seems to be able to stretch hmself as an actor.  If you haven't seen this movie, you need to rush out and see it.    Merl McBee
B000A7DVR2|4.0|I like this movie a lot. It has some good stars in it (John Goodman, John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, Jeff Briges) and has the two best directors in the world (Joel and Ethan Coen) This is a cult classic for a reason, its great! The story is over the top (which is a good thing if you like that sort of thing) It's a good movie to watch over and over again and still get joy out of it, which is why I bought it on DVD. Overall I give The Big Lebowski 4/5. Get it if you like the Coen brothers or if you like weird comedys.
061891868X|5.0|Each decade since the 60s, the leading researchers in advance physics have stepped away from their work just long enough to give us a \\"quick-and-dirty\\" status report on the latest developments in their field.<br /><br />George Gamow (One, Two, Three infinity) did it at the beginning of the 60s; Gary Zukav (Wu Li Masters) did it at the end of the 70s; Heinz Pagels (Perfect Symmetry) did it at the end of the 80s; Timonthy Ferris (The Whole Shebang) did it at the end of the 90s; and now Lee Smolin's (The trouble with Physics) is doing the same for the current decade.<br /><br />Never was this ride more difficult, nor clearer nor more exhilarating than as is demonstrated in the present volume. Professor Smolin takes us on a wild but sober ride across the landscape of current research in particle physics. For those of us who are frustrated physicists but whose brains are too ossified, or who no longer can read and understand the dizzying math in the technical journals, this summary is a welcomed contribution. In this panoramic view just slightly above the heads of what a layman can understand, Smolin invites us into his lab to meet his colleagues and his, and their theories.<br /><br />Being a born maverick, skeptic and purest, all rolled into one, the view we get is not the normal ride of a \\"true believer\\" trying to peddle the latest \\"new theoretical fad,\\" but that of a skeptic: grazing, browsing, and sampling, but in search of the \\"finest wares in the physics shop.\\" Professor Smolin makes no bones about, nor does he mind us knowing, that he is from the \\"old school,\\" where theories are forced to intersect with, and then be confronted by experimental results or else they are not accepted or respected as theories at all. As a \\"born-again\\" traditionalist, he is perfectly suited to give us an enjoyable guided tour.<br /><br />The tour is a panoramic view of the quest for the unification of Quantum and Relativity theories into a general theory of everything (GUT), a quest, like that preceding both Relativity and Quantum Mechanics at the turn of the last Century, has again been described as the final frontier of physics: the integration of all the forces in nature to be brought together into one nice tidy theoretical coda. This quest has become the Holy Grail of the physical sciences and of Cosmology.<br /><br />Exhibit 1 of this pursuit is the heavily touted \\"String Theory,\\" and its progeny Super symmetry and Super string Theory, which all hit the stage with a bang, but since, as Professor Smolin so carefully demonstrates, have all run into heavy weather indeed, and which have, for the most part, now been forced to \\"cool their heels\\" and take a seat on the sidelines of traditional experimental developments.<br /><br />A major part of \\"the trouble with physics\\" is what can only be called the \\"Kaluza-Klein cu de sac,\\" or better yet the \\"Kaluza-Klein runaway train to nowhere.\\"<br /><br />Without giving away the plot of the book, the Kaluza-Klein formula proved to be a mathematically easier way to reinvent Relativity, by expanding the physics to several new dimensions.  \\"On paper\\" the Kaluza-Klein derivations looked as good as Einstein's original formulation, provided of course that one is willing to overlook a few of its not so minor \\"fatal side effects,\\" such as having to \\"roll-up' or \\"curl\\" the unwanted and untidy extra dimensions, and being willing to forego confrontations with normal experimental results.<br /><br />I agreed with Professor Smolin even before I read his book: \\"Curling up\\" (or hiding) unwanted dimensions, is no way to do good physics. Yet, this unholy technique became the template that catapulted a whole generation of physicists into prominence in the world of 21st Century physics. Smolin himself admits having rode that train part way down the track until, that is, he saw the train wreck just over the horizon about to happen. When he saw it, he ever-so-discretely dismounted, leaving his \\"research budget fat and tenuredcolleagues\\" to endure the impending crash all by themselves. Now that he is on the safe side of the shore, where respectable experimental physics is still being done, the train is slowing down, even as it nears impact.<br /><br />There does not seem to be any possibility of rescue in sight. Five stars!
B00008G9JO|5.0|This is a Hot CD!! It was my first introduction to Tull, and it is my favorite Tull cd to date. It would be on my top 10 list of cd's to be stranded on an island with.    The music and lyrics are beautiful and puts me into a place that I can visit over and over again with a smile on my face.    Ian Anderson is brilliant as usual.     All Tull's albums are epic in my opinion., and HH is no exception to this rule!    For those of you that appreciate music,whether it's Folk, Rock, or whatever, this is a buyer! Guaranteed .
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I am 50+ but this movie is as good as I have seen in a long time. A simple story told in a genuine way. Good pop music in a good indie venue.  My friend, who knows music comparatively critically better than I do, says that Hansen here is a sell-out rich musician. This is still a great movie. I think stories told well, like Rogers & Hammerstein told with music and lyrics genuinely shared have at least as great value as anything BOLD and ALTERNATIVE as plain as heard here. Really great without the pretense that may follow from the purity from true critics as the genuine critical nod from better informed ears as my friend John. This movie rings true to me.
B000GH2YL0|5.0|Barbarians at the Gate is a classic of the business book genre, and with the private equity boom we have seen in the last couple of years, it is still as relevant as it was when it came twenty years ago. It is the story or some extremely unlikable rich people brought low by equally unsavory, but much smarter rich people, and it gives you an inside feel for the major wall street deal like no other book can.    Barbarians at the Gate is the story of an attempt to take RJR Nabisco private, and then the series of take over attempts that were instigated by the original privatization plan. Johnson, the CEO of RJR, comes off as pompous, full of himself, and not very smart. He's like a frat boy who makes it by glad handing people and buying rounds of drinks. Kravis, of legendary private equity firm KKR, comes off like a financier god. Brilliant, pushy, and beyond your puny human morals. Guess who gets the company in the end.    A must read for anyone interested in modern Wall Street.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|It has lots of big logical holes. For example in one scene, Colin Farrel and Jamie Foxx were searched by bodyguards of the gang leader. Yet, a couple of minutes later, Colin was able to threaten the leader with a grenade in his hand! How could he hide it from the bodyguard? It's impossible.    There's no chemical between Colin and Li Gong. Their sex scenes are emotionless.     I never cared for any characters from the begininng to the end. The action scenes were boring.     This is a good example of a bad movie that was made of a lousy script plus good actors and actress.
B0007M22TI|5.0|If you like the soothing sound of Irish music, this concert is definitely for you. If you want pop music or something more upbeat, then look somewhere else. Celtic woman is a talented group of Irish singers who sing a selection of pop, new age and traditional Irish songs in this concert. They are classically trained, immensely talented and sing beautifully. My two favorite songs are Send me a song and Nella Fantasia.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|I just don't understand why Robbie Williams can't break into American music.  Maybe most of us over here just can't get used to the British sound.  I, being different from everyone else my whole life, discovered his music in 1999, when he had the moderately successful US hit \\"Angels\\", and was on MTV for a few stints.  Then after I bought that CD, he dropped from America.  Being 14 years old at the time, I had limited access to his music because much of it must be purchased online, so I sort of drifted from his music until I got into college and got iTunes, and fell in love with the music again with this album.      To me, Williams' previous efforts had been lacking something since \\"The Ego Has Landed\\".  Don't get me wrong, I love all of his music, but \\"Sing When You're Winning\\" and \\"Escapology\\" had just lacked something for me.  \\"Intensive Care\\" spoke to me: the songs were different, one can tell that an immense effort was put into this album.  Williams went with a different songwriting partner on this one.  The songs are gritter, harsher, less polished.  The lyrics are true to heart and well written.  It sort of has an American feel, probably because most of the songs were written while Williams spent time in America.    My personal 3 favorites on the album:    -\\"Ghosts\\", with a strong piano and vocal intro, with brash lyrics so one doesn't forget who they're listening to (\\"Here I stand victorious, the only man who made you come...\\")  -\\"Your Gay Friend\\", an upbeat song about a not-so-happy subject, from what I interpret, an affair that is covered up by claiming that the man in the affair is the woman's gay friend (\\"Hey lord, forgive us if we're wrong, and make sure that he never hears this song...\\").  -\\"Sin Sin Sin\\", a song, appropriately by Williams, mostly about attempting to have a sexual encounter with no strings attached \\"Just relax, it's what Jesus would do, we're made in his image baby, let's ride this thing through...\\").    Once again, Williams proves thathe can tackle just about any style of music with this grittier album.  And he is successful with a change again.  He really can do no wrong.
1594489505|5.0|While many have compared this piece as a melodramatic, soap opera-esque, dubious story-line; I have to adamantly disagree.  Regardless if one act or many of these acts of brutality exists in the Middle East as depicted in this novel, that is enough for me to take a step back and acknowledge how very, very lucky I am to be able to just \\"be\\" in the U.S.  For anyone who dares to state that we should just leave the Middle East alone, and not interefere with their political affairs--I will personally buy them this book for their reading pleasure.  Unfortunately, many political contructs of this region is fused with an unilateral approach to religion and culture, which inadvertently ceases any type of cultural progression--especially with the treatment of women.  Hopefully, as Afghanistan and Iraq's political and economic agenda westernizes,  it will bring forth culture and religious relaxation which will infiltrate neighboring Islamic extremist lands such as Iran, as opposed to such staunch, literal religious interpretations, and of course, improved treatment of women.    As I was reading, there were countless times I had felt suffocated by these horrible acts of terror and violence directed towards these two women (protagonists).  I kept thinking to myself, what if this was me?What would I do?  I cannot even imagine life like this; I would revolt this ungodly oppression and perhaps be murdered for irreverence.      Also, I would reccommend this book to young adults, the generation of 'entitlement.'  Young people are incredibly oblivious to how good they have it in the country, and this excellent work of fiction teaches many lessons of how life was for women, how it still is in many places, and how it could be if the people in a democratic nation didn't win the homeland-birth-lottery.    A Thousand Splendid Suns was one of the best books I have read of all time.  I am forever grateful for my freedom as a woman: mother, wife, and daughter, which historically, I have ALWAYS taken for granted--I never knew anything different, I have never read anything quite like this before.  Because of this book, I plan to devote some time and energy for women's rights in the Middle East.  A beautiful book, Mr. Hosseini.

B000WTSWTK|5.0|My girl Xtina bought it home with this DVD. It's an awesome concert - much different from her Stripped tour and better in my opinion. There are different set changes which range from a Jook Joint to a Circus. Also love the costumes on Xtina. Here's the setlist  1. Intro (Back To Basics) - the same intro from the BTB album  2. Ain't No Other Man - awesome performance  3. Back In The Day  4. Understand - my favorite song from the album and the vocals are excellent.  5. Come On Over (Jazz Version) - I like the performance. However, I prefer the radio version of COO than this one.  6. Slow Down Baby  7. Still Dirrty/Can't Hold Us Down - Xtina's still got the nasty in her. Very sexy performance  8. Interlude - I Got Trouble - a very raunchy video of Xtina at her nastiest. It seems like you're watching a porno.  9. Makes Me Wanna Pray - how ironic is that? after the raunchy video of Trouble she bursts onto singing MMWP. Great performance though  10. What A Girl Wants (Reggae Version) - Liked it! At first, I was wondering why she would sing a reggae version of this song, but after hearing it, I enjoyed it.  11. Oh Mother - Wow. A very disturbing video in the background as Xtina sings her heart out.   12. Enter The Circus/Welcome - this is where the stage becomes the set of a circus. Really cool performance by Xtina and her dancers.  13. Dirrty - one of my favorite performances from the show. She's singing on a carousel horse while her female dancers are swinging from poles attached to the stage. A man's fantasy :)  14. Candyman - a hot performance  15. Nasty Naughty Boy - she pulls a guy out of the audience, straps him up, and sings her song with her dancers. Very hot  16. Hurt - another one of my favorite songs from her album. the set changes into a night set which is very interesting.  17. Lady Marmalade - she sings the full version!! Great and hot!  18. Interlude - Thank You - a video of her song Thank You including her fans from around the world.  19. Beautiful - Greatof course.   20. Fighter - the final peformance.   An awesome tour. If anyone likes the Stripped Tour, they will definitely love this tour. She went Back To Basics to where it all began. Go Xtina.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|This movie had serious problems and a horrible ending yet I enjoyed it. Despite the flaws, it was truly an innovative and unique movie going experience.<br /><br />The sun is dying out and a spaceship is sent to try to save it. The crew knows that it is probably a one way trip and that a previous attempt failed. There is a hierarchy on the crew as to who is more important...the more integral they were to the mission, the more their life was worth. Because they were heading towards the sun, the crew were exposed to an unusual proximity to the orb. The risk and dangerous gazing at the sun became compareable to getting \\"high\\".<br /><br />I found the premise fascinating, the visuals were very unique and characters engaging.<br /><br />Then, at the end, the movie makes no sense and turns into a \\"slasher\\" film. It went from such an intelligent and fresh approach to a very anti-climactic and illogical ending...I mean the ending really stunk!<br /><br />This movie is not for everybody however, if you are into serious sci-fi or arty flicks, then this is a very worthwhile movie.

0385495323|5.0|As a mathematician in the early 1970s, I saw many advertisements recruiting mathematicians for the CIA. I knew that it had to do with cryptography and number theory but it was all very mysterious and since I never got a job with them I didn't see precisely how the disciplines fit together. As Singh describes the discover of the RSA coding system it all becomes very clear.<br />The story he tells is particularly interesting because it starts with the ancient Romans and the decoding of the conspiracy messages of Mary Queen of Scots in Elizabethian England.<br /><br />Singh also wrote an very interesting account in layman's terms of the discoveries that led to the proof of Fermat's last theorem. That skill is also demonstrated in this book where the key concepts of cryptgraphy are discussed as they were developed through history. The uses of cryptography in World War I and World War II are brought out. We learn of the men in England at Bletchley Park who were able to decypher the German Enigma Machine and play a major role in the latter success of the allies. The gain of information from the U boats enabled the Americans to transport supplies and soldiers to Europe to fight the war. The U boats were very successful at destroying American ships prior to the breaking of the code.<br /><br />It is interesting that after the war the academic community in the United States solved the problem of key passing for computer networks and developed the RSA code. These discovery were developed earlier and independently in England at their secret agency the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) based on the unheralded ideas of James Ellis. Their work was kept secret until the late 1990s when their achievements were finally brought to light.<br /><br />The book also discusses the archaeological work on the Rosetta Stone and Linear B. This work uncovered the meaning of the hieroglyphics and showed that the Minoans language was a form of Greek. The techniques were very much akin to deciphering code.<br /><br />Also of interest is the Navajo code talkers who used their language as an unbreakable code during the war in the Pacific in World War II.<br /><br />Recent developments and conjectures about future breakthroughs are discussed in the last few chapters. The book provides very useful information about other books and interesting web sites including one that allows you to download Zimmerman's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) which provides RSA level security.Also of interest is the Navajo code talkers who used their language as an unbreakable code during the war in the Pacific in World War II.

B000067FP8|4.0|I liked Gremlins better than Gremlins 2, but my grandsons liked this one just as much as the first one.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  It has a clear and plain story with a rich and subtle subtext.  It owes a great deal of its ultimate success to, primarily, Michael C. Hall, who is positively mesmerizing (I mean that) as Dexter, the kind-hearted, fair-minded, friendly serial killer.<br /><br />As the series progresses, you get to know more about him as he is taken on a journey of self-discovery (not as pleasant as it sounds) and the season builds skillfully to an ultimate climax that you will probably never forget.<br /><br />This series works with a \\"reality\\" of the people around Dexter (his sister, co-workers, girlfriend, etc.) and his \\"normal guy\\" facade, and then there is the whole twisted, tortured inner Dexter with all his thoughts, memories, and his real self, not filtered for the general public.  It's a story within a story, within a murder mystery, set in the present and past events.  You have to see it to believe it.<br /><br />Some of the peripheral characters are a bit awkward (compared to Michael C. Hall, I think everyone looks that way) but it really doesn't take away from the superiority of this series to nearly everything else.  If you haven't seen this, rush out and get it, watch it on TV, or whatever.  You'll be hooked after one episode.<br /><br />This is fresh, insightful, thoughtful, twisted, and brilliantly acted.  Recommended without reservations.
B000002KOQ|5.0|I love this album.  Joni Mitchell was such a high-spirited sensitive optimistic gal at this point in her life.  Too bad she ran into US.  But she's still a great.  For Free, Willy, Big Yellow Taxi & Woodstock are my favorites.  This and Clouds are my favorite JM albums though I've only heard a couple others.
032147404X|3.0|I am fairly new to digital photograpy, and although the book offers some useful tips, it was not what I expected. Most of the tips offered in the book, I have found just browsing the internet. More details of the tricks the pros use would have been more helpful.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|If you have not seen this movie yet, this is a no-brainer purchase if you have even the slightest interest in historical films set in WWII.    The picture and sound of this HD-DVD are superb. I would rank it just below top-tier titles such as King Kong, Transformers and Corpse Bride.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Good flick, entertaining for adults as well as children.  The animation is top notch.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|I knew the album was going to be good when I bought it, I just didn't know how good.  The vocals throughout the whole album are amazing and the guitars rock.  It is hard to pick a favorite track since all of them are near perfection, but I would lean towards The Scarecrow as my favorite.

Gasp, it's like teh controversial. Except not really. Americans want to persist in their delusions of grandeur for a little while longer, and that means not sharing hero status with !China!, of all countries.    2. The plot hangs together but it doesn't quite hang together if you know what I'm saying. I had no problems following the plot or the moral of the story, but as for that making logical sense...well, that isn't really a requirement of movies these days (or like, ever), now is it?    3. The moral of the story is that a few ideological nutcases are ruining things for everyone else. Just how this plays out...well, you'll have to watch. But in my opinion, this movie is a direct commentary on the neo-conservative and anti-science movements. Seeing as I'm one of those crazy, evolution believin' cabalists, I had no problem with this. Obviously. But it might not be everyone's cup o' tea.    4. All this said, it is an aesthetically gorgeous movie that, for me, was quite  reminiscent at least visually of cult classics like \\"Solaris\\" and \\"Event Horizon.\\" I thought setting it in 2057 was cool and the tech wasn't so advanced as to be unbelievable. I'd be interested in seeing more sci-fi efforts from this director, Danny Boyle, whose credits include \\"28 Days Later\\" and \\"Trainspotting.\\"
0307277887|1.0|First of all, I confess to having read only the first chapter. It was recommended by a librarian whom I repect. While the author appears to be an original thinker, I cannot see any reason to waste my time on such material when there are other books more worthy of my attention. Call me a snob, but this sort of writing, to say nothing of the subject and its hero, is beyond my capacity to enjoy on any level.<br /><br />What really gob-smacked me was a \\"collector\\" hardback for $225 (as I recall).<br /><br />Nancy Eckert
B0000A118M|5.0|I will not waste time and space here repeating what has already been said.<br /><br />All I will say is that when I hear the first notes of Aknowledgement, it affects me in a visceral way. I feel shivers throughout my body, and a sense of refreshment not unlike reaching the surface of the water, and filling my lungs with air moments before I drown. The light of dawn breaking over the horizon after a dark and frightening night. The embrace of a loved one after a long and torturous seperation.<br /><br />Halfway through, I'm weeping cool tears of joy. I can't help it.<br /><br />As brilliant as it is, this is not merely an artistic performance. It is a prayer; a human soul addressing himself to the Creator. And a sharing of the intensly personal reaction that soul recieves as an answer in the form of a glimpse of Oneness.<br /><br />This album is one of the greatest musical treasures of the 20th century. I thank Allah for the music of John Coltrane.<br /><br />By the way; it may interest the reader to know that Coltrane's original liner notes quite similar to the English translation of Surat-ul Fatiha; the first chapter of the Qur'an.
B00005JLCI|5.0|The is the best version of 'Hamlet' on DVD. Kenneth Branagh (also directing) is brilliant as the Prince and the whole production is sumptuously filmed in 70mm. It's a stellar cast and the whole play is brought alive gloriously and unforgettably. Richard Briers, Derek Jacobi, Charlton Heston and Kate Winslet all give superb performances. Don't be put off by the length of the production (around 4 hours) because this is so good that time simply flies by. You are drawn into the action and Branagh's genius is to make the play accessible to all. He has done the Bard a wonderful service with this film and it's great to see this released on DVD at last. I can't recommend this highly enough - even if Shakespeare is not really your thing, you will love this. It's a great film of a great play.
B000002LAB|5.0|The first time I heard the first chord of the title track slashing its way through the air, I stopped in mid sentence and listened. For me it seemed to fill in a lot of missing pieces of a vast musical puzzle. A great many possibilities were opened.<br /><br />The point of this recording is not to compare it to what Miles had done before it. The obvious continuity of Miles' style notwithstanding, the album itself was a bold experiment in imposing his musical ideas upon the environment wherein \\"jazz\\" ideas should not be able to survive. Yet Miles and Miller pulled it off.<br /><br />To my ears, and taste, more than anything, it is the vibe of the album, the musical mood, that most appeals to me. Perhaps its effect on me is too personal for me to be 100% objective about it. But the music succeeds in all manner of ways. It is a great accomplishment.
0937381888|5.0|John Palmer has put together a very instructive and informative book for both the novice, like me, and those who are expanding their brewing techniques. The chapters are divided nicely, so for example, if you are wanting to find more info about Mashing, the chapters concerning all grain mashing are arranged to take you from start to finish. At times their is so much information to absorb, but Palmer does give charts and helpful pictures to show what he is describing. I have kept his book handy for each of my batches, a good first book for the beginner.
B000GGSM7G|4.0|I hadn't listened to THE TOP in over 15 years, but I've recently found myself digging back into the 80's New Romantic/Goth/New Wave discs from my youth and when I found out that the 2nd Disc FINALLY included the great unreleased and often bootlegged ARIEL from that time period, I swiped up a copy.  If you never heard the song before, it was basically a blueprint for Just One Kiss, a b-side that ended up on the great 1983 singles comp Japanese Whispers, when it was still in print.  But Ariel was better.  the chorus of \\"never grow old\\" rings nothing short of a muddy middle-aged mantra which I've been unable to shake from my head, so this was indeed a reason to swoop down and grab some OLD SCHOOL Cure re-issues (1982-1984 being a a great psychedelic period for Mr. Smith).    This is a great album, better than I remembered it.  I know I'm at odds with most people here, but I find this way more listenable than the remaster of Pornography I just purchased as well.  Rather than dwell in a Martin Hannett-period echo chamber of drones (if I want to hear this, anything from Factory from that period does it infinitely better), this recording finds Bob alone with very little band input, tripping his stones off.  There's some hope and humanity here.  It's still dark, but the walls are paisley and I likey.    The b-side disc is rough, but it's archivally important, fascinating and fascinating EXCEPT Bob remixed Ariel.  it's slower and he must have been embarassed by the lyrics, which is the only reason I can see for him adding ridiculous amounts of reverb all over it.  It sounds like mud, the track is also slower than I remember it.  I pulled out my cd-r burn of demos and I am correct in this.  Seek it out, if you don't already have it.    That being said, the 2nd disc is a great alternative Top and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the transition between their dark era and Head on the Door, or to Siouxsie fans, as this was Bob's \\"night project\\" while recording  Hyaenaduring the day.  Fueling the sessions was a mix of cocaine, alcohol and mushrooms that nearly destroyed RS and creatively annihilated Lol Tolhurst forever (he contributed melody to Caterpillar and three others during these sessions but probably didn't play on any of them).   If you're like me and love the sound of an artist's mind fragmented by psychosis all over slabs of vinyl (Syd Barrett, Ian Curtis, Skip Spence, Lou Reed, Peter Hammill, et al) then this is your Cure.

B000FVE3A2|5.0|The standard 8926 is listed in Invicta's 2008 catalog as having a 43mm diameter and this 3044 is listed as having a 47mm diameter crown, which doesn't seem like much difference, just 4mm.  Well, the 4mm makes a huge difference. The images in Invicta's catalog don't come close to showing how big the face of this watch is, compared to the standard 8926. Also with the bigger face, the luminous hour markers are bigger than those on the 8926, making the face brighter and easier to read in the dark. The bracelet is scaled bigger too, compared to the bracelet on the 8926, 22mm vs 20mm. The hinge on the bracelet is a precision made hinge instead of the stamped sheet hinge of the 8926.  The exhibition case back, as on the 8926, is a nice touch for us automatic watch fans. The watch has a diving helmet on the face and band. The Invicta name is prominent on the face, side of the case and clasp. The scalloped edge bezel similar to an Omega. It is a pretty watch on it's own, styled much like classic Swiss diving watches.  The automatic movement, especially with the viewing window on the back of the case, is for us old school automatic watch enthusiasts.  Being an automatic it will not keep time as precise as a quartz watch.  I have found mine to be one minute per week fast, which is acceptable for an automatic for me.   I was looking for an automatic diver with a big easy to read face, classic styling, reasonably priced, this works for me.
0312117337|5.0|I have used Osho Tarot for a couple years now.  I am always amazed how right on each one is.  I use tarot to communicate with my higher, expanded self.  Things come up in life, and the me that is limited by space and time does not always know fully what I need to know.  My higher self always does, and so I approach the cards as a medium of connecting with this self.  I love these cards because they are about living, not about predicting.  I use other cards, but these by far are the best.

B000AP04MO|4.0|I saw this movie when it first came out as I was a huge fan of both Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney.  I remember loving it and was happy to find the DVD on the shelf of my local library this week.  It's interesting to me to see how I react to films that I loved long ago.  Some hold up in my mind, some surpass my memories and some disappoint.  I'm sorry that this film falls into the latter category.    It's still wonderful in its way---one of the last of the genre of romance films starring big named actors, set in glamourous locals....often in the south of France.  I enjoyed them all.  This rather combines the best of those films with the realistic seriousness that became popular soon after.  This isn't just a \\"boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, fall out of love and fall back in love\\" story.  We see the details which are painfully familiar to almost anyone who has ever been in love.      Still we get the lush scenery of bucolic France while it was still the perfect setting for any love affair.  The music by Henry Mancini brings back the whole feeling of the time.  So there is plenty of pleasure for eye and ear.  Hepburn is sensationally beautiful and wears all of the costumes of the 12 year period the film spans with great style.  It's fun just to see what she's going to wear next.  We see the variety of modes of transportation, starting with Hepburn and her choir in an old VW bus, and Finney on the back of a tractor, and progressing through a series of cars as their prosperity increases.  There are scenes on the Mediterranean and in sumptuous villas, charming little hotels and luxurious bigger hotels.  It's a terrific travelog cum story.    The story has its ups and downs like any marriage and it's a good thing that it is played out against such a gorgeous background and stars such attractive people, because it is a little wearing, frankly.  He is selfish, she is selfish.  He pays more attention to his work than his family.  She nags him.  He has an affair.She has an affair -- the common stuff you can read about in any Ann Landers column.  But these are movie stars and we are supposed to care about them.  I was impressed by all the surface beauty back in '67; today I forgot about these characters five minutes after the show was over.  There's a lot of talent involved but I think the movie's value is of a charming, colorful period piece.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|A great film for anyone of any age...so long as you're a kid at heart. Sure, it's a bit cheesy, but the music is fun and catchy and you'll be wanting to learn the dance moves the first time you see it.

B0007R4TAS|3.0|As much as I am pleased I finally found George C. Scott's version of this novel/movie, I am so unhappy with the quality of editing and the horrendous film quality of this DVD!  I find it hard to believe someone released it as it is!  I saw the original version on TV years ago.  I have never been able to forget it!  The acting is first class, the music is to die for, (I have the LP for the sound track).  But, after years of searching for a DVD of this TV movie, I was horror struck at how dark the scenes were, and how poor the audio was.  It looks like someone has made multiple copies of it over and over so now you have little viewing quality left and then decided to sell it in this DVD form.  Luckily, Scott and York still give brilliant performances in spite of how the DVD was produced.  The movie's music theme still haunts me decades after first hearing it!

B000HT386M|5.0|My wife and I loved this movie.  Yes, it does share similarities with It's a wonderful life but so what.  Click stands on it's own.  You get to experience a lifetime's share of ups and downs, joys and regrets, and it makes you think about your own life long after you've shut off the DVD player.  If I had to say anything negative about the movie, it is in my opinion that it was marketed all wrong.  Adam Sandler has a reputation for silly fun movies.  This movie had a deeper touch.  In some ways it was like MASH was on tv - it made you laugh and sometimes tear up.  Sandler was at his best here.  The name of the movie and the marketing promoted this movie as a silly movie, which it can be at times, but what I loved the most were the serious moments, his relationship with his wife his children,and his father (Henry Winkler).  Christopher Walken was perfectly cast and adds just the right tones where needed.  The plot was funny and moving all at once.  And I can never listen to the song Linger again without thinking about this movie.  I think more people would have given this a more positive review if the movie had been marketed differently.  I would not change a thing about the cast, story or film in any way.  It was a perfect experience and I have rarely said that about any movie.

0937381888|5.0|I recently got the bug to start brewing my own beer and thought I should read up on the subject before I got too involved.  This book came pretty highly recomended, both on line and by brewers I know.  The book covers everything to basic sanitation to the more complex all grain brewing and all points in between.  There is enough technical and scientific information so you know why you are doing what you are doing, but not so much that it all goes over your head.  If you like the Food Network's \\"Good Eats\\" with Alton Brown, you'll like this book too.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|\\"David Gilmour\\" stands head and shoulders above either of Gilmour's other solo CDs. Throughout the set list, Gilmour is in consistently fine form, and shows off his chops not only on guitar and vocals but also as a surprisingly competent piano player. Strong songs focus both Gilmour's singing and instrumental prowess, and this disc collects most of his strongest solo material. Most of this album can easily hold its own against much of Pink Floyd's output, and it's by far the best of any of Gilmour's attempts at solo success. When I bought this CD I listened to it at least once nightly for over two weeks and not once did I skip through the songs. That is how good this CD is. There are no big-name guest stars here and no gimmicks - only Gilmour with some very capable support on drums and bass.    There are no bonus tracks. Given that Gilmour is a perfectionist, that isn't surprising. I, for one, would rather hear a strong album the way that it was originally intended rather than dilute it with needless outtakes or demos. If Gilmour doesn't want them here, he has his reasons and I respect them.    Listening to this CD, I had a new appreciation for just how fine a craftsman David Gilmour can be. Everyone recognizes his gifts as a lead guitarist, but he's also a solid songwriter and his arranging skills are sublime. Try this CD, and you might find yourself glad that \\"There's No Way Out Of Here!\\"
B00005JPUN|3.0|This version of Jack Finney's book [[ASIN:0684852586 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]] had some promise, but ultimately missed the opportunity.  Apparently the studio didn't like the cut director Oliver Hirschbiegel delivered. My suspicion is that the original film, which was completed in 2006, was probably more coherent. The Wachowski brothers were hired for massive rewriting and James McTeigue directed the new scenes. The result is a film that takes an unexpected turn for the worse.<br /><br />What's new in this rendition is that the victims of the alien virus aren't replaced by duplicates. Instead, the virus just acts within their own bodies, changing them so that they act as one organism-- we're talking a slightly nicer version of the borg from Star Trek. The idea of a more benevolent invader would have been a fresh interesting take and was where this movie was headed before the hack job. It would have been more insidiously delightful to explore the cost benefit analysis of succumbing to the invasion. No more wars, cruelty, and poverty on one side, while the stripping of a lot of what makes us human on the other-- also the collective vs. the individual. This probably would have come closer to Don Siegel's communist cold war scare overtones in the original movie [[ASIN:0782009980 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]].<br /><br />Instead the movie moves to more action sequences of fighting against a overtly hostile threat. This is where the original idea gets abandoned and the movie loses its way.<br /><br />All of the actors put in decent performances here including an admirable job by Nicole Kidman in the lead role, Daniel Craig as her love interest (an excellent new James Bond by the way), a very good cameo from Veronica Cartwright (in the 1978 remake [[ASIN:0790742462 Body Snatchers]]), Jeremy Northam as the somewhat creepy ex-husband, and Jeffrey Wright as the scientist.<br /><br /> I think the studio should take the blame for dooming a film that had some potential. It's still an enjoyable watch and worth a rental, especially for alien invasion enthusiasts.  I don't think I've ever seen a more equally distributed range of opinion by reviewers (from one to five stars). Where it all tallies out is about where I'd put it... 3 stars.<br /><br />P.S.  Although lesser known than [[ASIN:0684852586 Invasion of the Body Snatchers]], Jack Finney wrote a couple of great books on time travel ([[ASIN:0684818442 From Time to Time]] and [[ASIN:0684801051 Time and Again]]) as well as several short stories.

0385312083|5.0|This is a beautifully printed and bound edition of Kurt Vonnegut's masterpiece, with a nice second introduction written on the 25th anniversary of the original publication.      I often give young teenagers this book as a coming-of-age or b'nai mitzvah present, and this edition presents it as a worthy keepsake.    Regarding the text of the book; I'm sure better reviews have been written than I could ever write.  I'll just point out that Vonnegut was likely the most articulate of the 200 or so people who witnessed the firebombing of Dresden as closely as he did.  I think he became a writer partly out of a sense of obligation to bear witness to the event.  It took him what, 25 years, to get the book out of his mind and onto paper?    It must have been quite a relief.
B000O77QD8|5.0|Clint Eastwood, in my eyes will forever be considered the greatest contributor to American Cinema and this is one of the reasons why. He is not only a great actor but he is a spectacular Director, of course not forgetting Million Dollar Baby & The Unforgiven are just 2 movies that he can add his name to which will forever cement his prestigious image.<br /><br />Flags of our Fathers tells the true story of 6 soldiers who became immortalised by just one picture of the American flag being raised on Mount Suribachi of the Island of Iwo Jima. The battle for Iwo Jima has long been considered one of the biggest battles that the Americans faced during WWII, and this is something that Eastwood displays to us in the epic film. Of the 6 men in the photograph only 3 survived the battle to be brought home and welcolmed as heroes. These men were Ira Hayes (Adam Beach), Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) and John \\"Doc\\" Bradley (Ryan Phillipe).<br /><br />The photograph became monumental in the eyes of the American people and it quickly became a symbol of hope for a country that was in crippling debt and seemed to be losing the war. The American people weren't told the truth about the flag raising, the raising itself wasn't the first. There was a flag raised before the one in the photograph but was ordered to be taken down and replaced as it was seen as too small to be seen from nearby landing beaches. Because of this picture the 3 living soldiers gained a new found celebrity and they each handled it in their own particular way. Hayes was lead on from the start and simply kept his opinions and dreads to himself, while drinking away his sorrows. Gagnon simply enjoyed the new found fame and took it in his stride, and even to some extent tried to prolonge his celebrity image. Bradley simply voiced his opinions and had a sense of guilt that he shouldn't allow the soldiers who raised the original flag to be forgotten. He simply had to obey the orders of his superiors and continue with the farce that they were the first men to take Mount Suribachi and they were the first to raise the American Flag.<br /><br />I adored this film but as much as it pains me to say it, it does have its flaws which as an objective reviewer I have to address. The battle scenes are simply first class and something as to which Eastwood truly excels himself as they are something beyond epic. The alternate scenes however which place the 3 main soldiers at home handling their own particular troubles seem a bit too try hard and that, I felt took a lot away from a film that had so much potential. An example of it being a bit too try hard was how Eastwood portrayed Hayes becoming the depressed drunk. Although this may have been a true representation, I felt Eastwood was simply trying to make us cry and that is something that shouldn't be forced upon people. Good character direction and true character representation is something that can make us feel sad for a persons downfall, however people can also pick up on something that simply seemed to be trying to make us sad.<br /><br />Although it had its flaws this was still a very entertaining and epic film that I found to be quite enjoyable. This also has a good edge to it with the alternative film Letters from Iwo Jima which tells the Japanese side of the story also Directed by Eastwood. Letters from Iwo Jima is certainly the better of the two but Flags of our Fathers is still a very good film in its own right.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any film lover as even with its flaws it has something to offer everybody.re the first men to take Mount Suribachi and they were the first to raise the American Flag.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|I grew up in the sixties and witnessed all the key events depicted in Across The Universe.

I've read reviews which are critical and I agree that the movie does not always blend its' various elements seamlessly.  I can understand why the film may not work for those who did not live through the era and can't identify with it.  Still, it has a lot to offer, especially the really unique interpretations of the Beatles' songs which in some cases are performed with greater depth of feeling than the originals.
B000002H1T|5.0|YOU MIGHT THINK it's awesome,but I do know it's awesome! I'll flashback to early 1984,seeing the video for YMT frequently on MTV. This young,pretty woman finding The Cars' frontman Ric Ocasek everywhere she is! The concept for the video is indeed silly. Now,I'll flashforward to July 27,1984. I saw the premiere of the DRIVE video,featuring Ocasek's future wife supermodel Paulina Porizkova who later became famous for co-starring with Tom Selleck in the Warner Bros. drama HER ALIBI. Now-deceased Benjamin Orr took the lead on the Ocasek composition DRIVE. That is the only adult contemporary hit on this album. Sometime in between,I saw MAGIC where Ocasek stands atop an open swimming pool with clear glass or fiberglass hidden inside the pool. He is surrounded by a huge crowd. All the aforementioned tracks later appeared on the 1985 follow-up THE CARS' GREATEST HITS. The cassette and CD version of TCGH also contained this album's title track. The other songs are very good.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|It's a typical introspective album. Gone are days of Ten and Vs. Simply because everything changed... the music scene, the world... for both the bad and (somewhat) good.  This is not the album that will instantly grab you (some tunes will), but it's a grower... a heavy grower. Brilliant tunes, the quality music that was almost forgotten in this hip-pop junk. But not entirely, thanks to PJ!!!    This is one of their best and certainly one of their classics!
B000VWYNOG|5.0|This is a great collection of Van Morrison's hits. Both my husband and I are huge fans and even my three children know his music and they love the cd.
034544678X|5.0|This book is one of the best on dog training and understanding canine behavior.  It was recommended to me by a canine behavior expert and also by a trainer in the Whole Dog Journal.
0385333846|5.0|A friend of mine refused to read this book because she thought it was a glorification of slaughterhouses.  I don't know where she got this impression, but once I assured her (and promised to give her $250 if she was right) she read the book and declared that her life was changed. She disappeared and I haven't seen her in ten years, so I can't be any more specific about precisely what about the book changed her life.   Anyhow, this book is not about slaughterhouses, per se.  I think that any prospective reader should know that.  Of course, a slaughterhouse (specifically, number 5) does figure into the narrative, but no cows actually get slaughtered.  Come to think of it, this book deals with themes a bit more disturbing than cows getting slaughtered:  war, death, man's inhumanity, etc.  I have also translated this book into French, mostly for my own enjoyment.  It's titled Abbatoire Cinq.    I recommmend this book, and I hope that you, whoever is reading this review, will buy or borrow it, and spend an afternoon or two reading it.  It's really quite good.
B000W4HFY8|5.0|fantastic music  after so many years, it still creates a powerful mood and feeling, nevertheless maybe only for true fanatics
015626224X|4.0|Since this book was shelved in the travel section of my local bookstore, I assumed that it was a travel guide to the cities of Paris and London written by one of the most famous writers of the 20th century.  I didn't look at it until I got off the airplane in Heathrow, and I had to buy another guide in London (which, thanks to the exchange rate, was quite expensive).  I read the book anyway and discovered that I quite liked it.  It's description of poverty is unsparing, and should serve as a reminder to those who want to scale back the welfare state.  I recommend it as an outstanding work of literature, but not, alas, as a travel guide.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|consider the source material that this dip Julie had. She made this terrible, shallow insipid piece of dreck that insults the Beatles and the sixties. some people named Jude and Prudence and Lucy so they could sing Dear Prudence after she comes in the bathroom window. god it's worse than Xanadu. i've been waiting all my life to see the worst movie ever made and now I have. It's amazingly bad.
078322737X|4.0|Seen today it's hard to believe that the George Lucas who made the sharply observed American Graffiti is the same George Lucas who gave us Jar-Jar Binks. You can certainly see the seeds of that galaxy far, far away in this ensemble piece about a night a long time ago in a small town not so far, far away, but it's still got an original trilogy vibe. It could almost be the Tattoine Years, with Ron Howard an embryonic Luke Skywalker, Paul Le Mat Han Solo, Richard Dreyfuss C3PO, Charles Martin Smith R2D2, Bo Hopkins Chewbacca, Wolfman Jack Obi Wan Kenobi and Harrison Ford Greedo. Thankfully there's no Jar-Jar this time out (well, maybe Mackenzie Phillips), but there's a lot of time spent cruising Mos Eisley in landspeeders. In its day its huge profits certainly led to as many ripoffs as Star Wars, but none managed to tap into it's surprisingly edgy indie, almost nouvelle vague vibe without pushing the darkness or exploitation elements too far. At times it's almost like a Californian version of Fellini's Il Vitelloni.     The key to the film's success is its understanding of what it's like to be stuck in a small town yet also afraid to leave it at that point in life when you're suddenly aware of the real threat of failure in life. So, instead of dealing with any of the big issues on the back of their mind, its various characters distract themselves with trivia, the film to-ing and fro-ing between them as the night gradually turns into day, all linked by the simple but brilliant device of having all the characters have the same radio station on in the background with Wolfman Jack as a half-heard Greek Chorus, binding the stories together like the Force - okay, enough with the Star Wars analogies already. Paul Le Mat, the one who didn't get a sitcom, directorial career or Thighmaster infomercial deal out of it, gets the best of the script as the doomed boy racer facing up to the fact that he's strictly small town, although there's enough left over to give everyone in the cast their moment in the sun.     The DVD features a fine feature length documentary reuniting most of the key players (though it conveniently ignores the film's now-forgotten sequel), production notes and trailer.
0743486285|5.0|This is a book that you can not put down! Nikki Sixx's diaries from Christmas 1986 to Christmas 1987 are a window into the life of one of the most notorious rock stars of the 80's. It reveals not only his abuse of heroin and many other drugs, but also his paranoia and depression due to his disturbing childhood. A must read for anyone interested in Motley Crue, drug abuse, or the antics of a rock star.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I love the show, wish there was more than the few episodes on it (most tv seasons feature 22 episodes, this one has only half that).    It would have been nice to have more bloopers in the 'extras'.    Only problem--the packaging is made up of a puffed starch (very ecologically 'green' of them, thanks!) but the section with the disk 3 hole won't lock into the disk at all, so it's perpetually floating.  Makes for a booby trap every time I want to open the folded holder since disk 3 is always loose and ready to fall out.
1594489505|3.0|Although not as impresive as this author's first novel, the book is very worthwhile. It is well written,the subject is exoric and interesting. If one expects an unusual novel - stay away. But it is a good and wortwhile read, time well spent. A contribution to a subject few writers handle well - a bok about women, written by a man.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I don't have a whole lot to add to whats already been said but here goes.    The box set is still the standard for all other DVD sets to follow.  The remastering of both sound and picture on all of the DVD makes these movies look and sound amazing.  The box itself is a work of art and contains all 9 discs in one jacket with amazing artwork.    The special features and bonus materials are well above par and it's certainly evident that FOX went all out to making this boxset a homerun.      Overall this product is a 5 out of 5 from me and I would highly recommend the set to anyone.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|I had no idea that this would turn out to be one of the most listened music cds in my collection. I have over 5000 33rpm, 1000 78rpm and hundreds of CDs. My wife and I think this recording is an incredible musical experience in folk, ethnic, bluegrass, and New Orleans Jazz. Bruce Springsteen has found one of the best bands I have ever heard in any music style mixing ethnic, New Orleans Jazz, folk country, bluegrass, as well as just plain great music. I can't say one song is disappointing and must say that it's hard to pick a favorite though Mrs McGrath seems to go through my head as well as Eyes on The Prize, and Froggie. Can't rate this CD any higher in my humble opinion.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|A must buy for all Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis fans,You will love the extras.
B000VSBX34|5.0|\\"Help!\\" is indispensable. Somebody (you know who you are) ought to swing for keeping it off the DVD market for the last couple of years. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" gets all the praise from the critics, and it is, to be sure, a wonderful movie; but \\"Help!\\" is the one I watch when I just want to kick back and indulge in unalloyed enjoyment. Plus it has better songs.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|After seeing the first film (Elizabeth), I expected much more from this film, and was disappointed.  The action is abrupt to the point of jarring, and there are too many scenes where Blanchett just stands in a costume while the camera whirls around her.  The photography and sets are excellent, but not enough to carry this pretentious and poorly executed flick.  I'm sorry I wasted the money to rent it.
0060935464|5.0|Most of the time, I get really pumped about reading books. And most of the time, I get so frustrated and don't finish them. That, however, was not the case with this book!!        Usually, my decription of \\"great\\" literature means a bunch of long words scrambled together into a sentence leaving the reader to meditate a REALLY long time and figure out what it means. I was SO excited to find out that this book wasn't like that!! This book was so much fun to read because I didn't have to stop and think every two seconds!        The characters in the book are so...real. Atticus reminds me SO much of my Dad in the sense that he will think things out, and when threatened, he doesn't get all worked up. I actually got a kick out of the story being from Scout's point of view. The world is a completely different place in an eight-year-olds eyes, and that's what made so much of a difference in the way this book was written. So, I say, give it a read!! It's worth the time.
B000K15VSA|5.0|5 thumbs up all the way.  Amazing box set and of course the final cut for classic version for Blade Runner.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|It is a fun show.  I don't mind pulling this out every few months and watching it again.  If you like good SciFi you will like this show and also especially the sister show SG1.  Good purchase.
B0000648WZ|5.0|I love this movie, I'ts terrific and really entertaining. great special effects, good cast, great fighting scenes and lots, lots of bugs, what more can I ask?  8D<br /><br />my English is terrible and I barely can understand to somebody who talks to me slowly. so, I love when a movie has Spanish subtitles like this one. I couldn't remember if has Spanish track but I don't care, the original voices rocks so as Dina Meyer, she is just soo pretty, and so hot. I love look her in uniform and with big guns.  =D<br /><br />I recommend this movie to any alien killing fan, is in the style of ID4 but more centered in ground combat. any fan of Starcraft and Warhammer 40k like me will enjoy it. if you don't get it yet, you will simply lost one of the greatest movies of military sci-fi ever.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|As the name \\"Greatest Hits\\" suggests, this CD contains all the best songs of The Dolls.  It's an amazing buy!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I almost wet my pants when I saw this movie, very funny, very sarcastic, and great special effects for a puppet movie. Great thing is that has Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />Like South Park, you must have lots of general culture to enjoy some of the jokes, but in general everybody can laugh for hours with this movie. has the best sex scene that I see ever, and were puppets for God sake.<br /><br />Don't cheat yourself, is a puppet movie but is not a movie for kids, in fact, has lots of black humor and jokes with double sense, definitely not a children movie.
0744547814|5.0|My family absolutely LOVES THIS Book.  It has a very catchy phrase, that is easy to memorize, the drawings are very cute and my children are absolutely IN LOVE with this book.  We act this book out as we read it, to the point of running in a covering up our heads in the covers, like they do at the end.  My 4 year old spends hours looking at it.  It is one of his favorites.
0070511136|5.0|If [[ASIN:0786303158 Solution Selling: Creating Buyers in Difficult Selling Markets]] is the comprehensive guide to selling intangible, complex solutions, then SPIN Selling is the comprehensive guide to asking customers questions to find our what mattered to them most.<br /><br />SPIN Selling is definitely NOT the first book that guides sales people in the art of asking questions, but it's definitely the one that puts it in the most elegant way.<br /><br />That said, it will be a mistake to assume that SPIN Selling is the cure-all for asking customers.  [[ASIN:0471670510 The Science of Influence: How to Get Anyone to Say \\"Yes\\" in 8 Minutes or Less!]] will be a good companion to better understand the human psyche.
0761119752|5.0|Loved this book.  But don't recommend reading it before bed time because it is going to make you want to get up and dance around the room and sing the P J song.  I dreamed of singing this song while the kids are getting into their PJs.  It is yet to happen.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|For Nikon cameras that don't have a built-in flash, or for when you need more power than the built-in provides, this may be just the thing you need.    Pro: spares the camera's battery, sits closer to the axis of the lens than the SB-600 or 800, functions with Nikon's Creative Lighting System (CLS), head swivels vertically for up to 90 degrees for bounce flash, uses only two AA cells, lack of controls makes life simple wherever simple is OK for what you need to do, relatively inexpensive, adds little weight to the camera.    Con: No on-flash control to reduce or enhance output, manual output control (as distinct from flash compensation control) is possible only with a few camera models, cannot function as a wireless commander unit, does not provide light to assist auto focus.    However, for many purposes this unit is very useful.
B000P12LWY|4.0|History comes alive in The Tudors.  Superbly well acted and beautifully filmed, season one of this series is well paced and directed.  Strong storytelling leaves one wishing to travel back in time to really get to know the true King Henry VIII and compare notes.  Warning, however, this series is definitely for adults only-with explicit sex scenes.  I get the sense that Showtime instructed the producers to include at least one gratuitous sex scene per episode.  But, how can one mind when it's Jonathan Rhys Meyers on screen.  Definitely enjoyable overall.
B000YENUI6|4.0|This is an intense, bloody, violent, credible (mostly) movie about the Russian Mafia in London.<br /><br />It is graphic and cold and unnerving. It certainly makes you wonder what the personnel are really like when you go into a forign food restaurant.<br /><br />There is not much to add to the plethora of reviews which have been published here but I wanted to say how much I feel that the movie lacks real credibility. From my perspective, the notion of an embedded agent inside the closed ranks of a mafia organisation is certainly believable.<br /><br />Indeed, as I write this review, the second agent close to the leader of Sinn Fein has just been exposed as such and is currently in hiding for fear of his life after many years of infiltration without detection.<br /><br />Here, however, the hero(?) such that he is, takes risks of being caught by taking uncharacteristic interventions of help. The likelihood of these being detected must be high given the obsessive secretive nature of the beast yet they pass unnoticed. It is this lack of credibility which detracts from this movie and justifies only a four star rating.<br /><br />Otherwise, this intense and graphic film is well worth watching.
0618918248|5.0|I highly recommend this book to believers and non believers alike.  It is a must read for anyone with a brain.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This was the best movie of 2006. It is the story of [my and] man men's lives who have a dream and persist through all types of adversity and hardship to realize it. Against all odds (a poor black man) and hitting the bottom of the bottom (homeless and raising a son), Will Smith's character does not give up and through sheer will power, ascends to a peak many of us more able will never attain (stockbroker for a major Wall Street firm).    If you have an entrepreneur in your family, buy this DVD, don't rent it. It will give them courage and hope in their darkest hours. One note of caution however: DO NOT BUY THE BOOK. Unfortunately, it turns out, nothing in the movie actually happened.
B0002SVW3O|5.0|I was introduced to Sigur Ros backwards.  I heard all their latest albums first and finally got my way back to the original release.  This album sounds nothing like the other ones, it is a real jem -their best in my opinion.  A organic mixture of sounds that spark emotion; I loved every second of it.  If you like experimental music this is your ticket!<br /><br />-d
B000OLGCI4|5.0|We just love the Jungle Book DVD.  It is full of fun songs and just a great story.
B000PQJZDM|5.0|There can be no doubt, Leonard Cohen notwithstanding (of whom I'm an avid fan going back to the late 60's) that Cold fact is simply the best album of it's type EVER produced. My copy of Sussex SXBS700 (dist by Buddah) is still in (almost) pristine condition, and I look forward to getting my hands on the \\"gizmo\\" that can tfr it from my Systemdek II with Glanz cartridge onto digital, so I can preserve this masterpiece in it's (near)original vinyl condition.  To all those new-found Rodriguez devotees,..welcome... I'm only too happy to share with you what I've had the priveledge to enjoy for nearly 40 years.
0765357151|3.0|The book does show what the reader is looking for but rather short in a way.  Though the auothr did not intend for a motion picture  to book thing,  I think the book was rather more detail but still a  bit short.  Then also  The other stories not dealing with the title only  what the author wrote , should be more clear
6305882592|5.0|I've been watching this movie for 20 years and it always delivers. I showed it to my 16 year old niece for the first time last month and she's still talking about it. If you haven't seen it, watch it, and if you have watch it again.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|The \\"Final Cut\\" is not one of the best Pink Floyd albums and following \\"The Wall\\" is probably just the starting reason. Add to it that it's Roger Waters last with the group and you can probably foresee that the band's turmoil further added to why many people don't give this record the accolades it may deserve. The record is standard Floyd with those dreamy strings accompanying songs such as the title track which is probably the second best to the powerful punch of Gilmour's  \\"Not Now John\\" in my mind. My favorite though is the Waters \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" which is a fitting end track to the album's full view of the world (particularly England) post World War II. Therefore, I would suggest to someone considering to buy it that if you're not a person into Floyd (meaning you don't own any Floyd CD's, cassettes, or albums --if you're old enough to remember those) and you only appreciate songs you've heard on the radio from \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side\\" etc.., then please listen to some tracks before purchasing. I had the immense pleasure of buying this cassette when it originally came out. Lastly, I love the use of gunfire and screaming voices in agony that were used to add and blend so well with the music and lyrics and I had to hear the reproduction on CD which is why I purchased. For those who do like Floyd the production on this album to me is immaculate -- as just alluded.
B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|A little bulky, but otherwise an excellent product. Eventually, I'll need more of them. Price was good and shipping was fast.
0974869449|5.0|These cards are nicely made and provide great study material.  I've taken them to Japan twice and studied them on the flights, trains, and so on, alternating with the JLPT vocab lists.  If you get into a habit of spending five to ten minutes a day with them, you'll eventually pick up a ton of kanji.  It's about the consistency rather than spending a lot of time in each session with them, so try to find a way to work them into your routine.  Supposedly if you make your own flashcards you'll retain the info better, but that's a major time investment so I don't know if it will pay off in the long run; this probably depends on what type of learner you are.  The JLPT level indicators were a big step forward in the recent edition, which shows how the folks at White Rabbit really put a lot of thought into their products.
B0009TRRN0|5.0|Great movie with lot's and lot's of perfect cuts to main arteries!! This is the U.S. adaptation of the Japanese Kozure Okami of which I own a few episodes of (original Japanese versions). I must say that although I appreciate hearing the Japanese and having the unaltered story line of the originals, I like the \\"Shogun Assassin\\" version  better if for nothing else, the music!! Also, even though it's dubbed-over into English, the synchronization of English and mouth movements is surprising well done! Great samurai flick!!!!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|All us girts imagine ourselves in love with Mr. Darcy P&P.  Well fall in love all over again with this leading man. Excellent period drama this gives you a great overall view of life in England during the industrial age.  Great stuff highly recommended for anyone with a love of all things historical.  Girl from the south meets boy from the north with a domineering mother and and a flipperty sister.  The two leading characters have to overcome there North South divide and resolve their issues, of which there are a quite a few. Murder, illicit lovers and family bereavement to name but a few.  My Auntie is now a huge fan also.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Wonderful family film.  It's hard, at times, to find something we all enjoy.  Many of the films that my kids like, dad and mom find incredibly boring or poorly acted/written/directed.  Matilda was something that we all loved.  I'm not sure how true it was to the book as I have only heard bits and pieces of it on an audio version that we borrowed from the library.  I'm not sure why some people thought it was so dark.  The treatment of children that other reviewers complained about was in such a comical manner- it made all my children laugh.  The comedy was entertaining & the warm and fuzzy ending made me smile & cry.      Family of six :  ages 2-43, all of us enjoyed it immensely.
3795753384|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for so that I can have my own copy to use for our performance.  Thank you.
B000FIMG68|5.0|One of the best Series to air on \\"Regular T.V.\\"!  Not your normal stuck on a desert Isle.  Very Sci-Fi. I have the 1st 3 seasons and they are all awesome & you just have to see what's going to happen next!
B00001OH7M|5.0|Space Oddity is probably my favorite David Bowie album.  I guess for most people, this album only shows signs of what Bowie would soon become in the future- a creative, glammy songwriting genius.    For me however, it shows a really melodic and exciting side of Bowie that we've never really had again.  It's mellow without the spooky edge, which is really exciting to me.    I love the entire second half of the album.  Every single song on the second half reminds me of either the Nashville Skyline-era of Bob Dylan, or the classic period of the Moody Blues with all the pretty orchestrations and flutes.  The songwriting is top notch as well.  The lyrics are definitely some of Bowie's most interesting, and I'm curious what some of the songs are even about.    The first half is quite fascinating as well.  We all know the mysterious title song, with its eerie countdown in the beginning, and the floating-in-outer space atmosphere.  A classic.    \\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\" features a very sad vocal melody in the beginning, and a nice unexpected harmonica jam a few minutes later.  It's a shame \\"Don't Sit Down\\" is so short, because that melody certainty had the potential to carry on for a few more minutes.      I don't understand how so many people think \\"Cygnet Committee\\" sounds like a Bob Dylan rip-off.  To me, it sounds more like something from Van Morrison's Astral Weeks.  I love the way the song continues to build into different themes and emotions.  \\"Janine\\" is brilliant.  It's a pop song that sounds like -and I'm honestly not joking- Italian country pop (if such a thing exists!)  That guitar playing is really splendid on this track and reminds me of CCR or the Band.  \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" is bizarre in the quiet Midwest country fair-like build-up and the \\"Hey Jude\\" like chorus that keeps repeating over and over.      Overall, the vocal melodies on this album really grab me every time.  A masterpiece that more people should consider purchasing and placing on the same level as other Bowie classics such as Hunky Dory and Aladdin Sane.  Really solid songwriting overall.
0440237688|5.0|One of those rare children's books, like the Golden Compass, which can inspire obsession in grown-ups as well. I'm 43 and couldn't put it down. I ran right out and bought all the other books by Lois Lowry, but this is still the best.
075640407X|5.0|You know a book is engaging when you when you forget to let the dog out, show up to work sleep deprived and all day try to figure out how to get out early so you can get home to read more of the story. I don't need to go through what makes this a unique and worthy piece of art in which your invested time will be well spent as there are hundreds of review on Amazon most of which give the book 5 stars. Like every wonderful piece of art there will be some expecting something different or disappointed because the author has a different writing style than their favorites. The strength of the character development provides a sense of profound familiarity and a genuine level of concern for the well being of the participants as they work their way through a fantastically complete new world.<br /><br />Being a seasoned veteran to the fantasy book world I have come to love and somewhat expect most books to be more of the same. With this jaded perspective I decided to grab this book as I strolled through my local B&N (sorry Amazon) mainly because it was an autographed copy and the author is from WI like me. To say I was surprised would be an understatement. I have never been moved enough to review a book before this one. My only complaint after reading through this book is that I have another year to wait for the next installment.  Welcome to my short list of favorite authors Patrick Rothfuss!
B0011Z5IUK|5.0|...love or listen to Led Zeppelin 1-4, if you like Rock music?    This album is the Rosetta Stone of rock.  I don't know that I can \\"review\\" Led Zeppelin II.  It's like doing a book review of the Bible.    I give it 5 stars, what the hay.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|This movie has a decent premise, excellent special effects, an average acting.  Speaking for myself, this equals a three-star review.  If you like, [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] or [[ASIN:B0000VCZK2 Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)]], or[[ASIN:0780626966 The Nightmare on Elm Street Collection]].  You have a chance of liking this movie.  However, I thought the last 20 minutes was bad, or should I say, cheesy.  This film is not brilliant, what it is is an updated version of 2001 with a slightly different plot, and putting today's technology to use.  So, that's where you get the better special effects.
0140120416|5.0|This is a great book to learn russian from the ground up.  Every lesson is comprehensive in its theme and there are exercises at the end of each chapter and solutions in the back.  There are also consolidated grammar tables in the appendix for quick lookup and a 1500 word vocabulary.  I bought 6 russian language course books on Amazon and this one is by far the best.
B0000A4GAK|5.0|Derek Trucks has proven that there is still room for improvement on the creative platform. He and is super talented band are the best I've heard in a long time. These boys use the full musical palette of colour...it aint just BLUE!!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie takes great acting, great story, and great music and combines it into one to movie masterpiece. It is along the lines of a musical but not as traditional as previous ones such as Rent. You find yourself forgetting that it is a big part of the movie because the songs fit so well with the scene. They did a great job covering Beatles songs. This is a Drama/Romance/Musical I would recommend. If you are a fan of any of those genres you shouldn't be disappointed.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This is an excellent, highly entertaining film. It has a smartly written script that is humorous and never lags; excellent sequencing and editing to keep the viewer fully engaged; exceptional acting from Helen Mirren, James Cromwell, and Michael Sheen; and an underlying theme of adaptive leadership that is superbly and seamlessly integrated into the narrative. It is the theme of adaptive leadership, exhibited first by Tony Blair and later by Queen Elisabeth, on which I would like to comment.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story here of the tragic death of Princess Diana, the outpouring of public grief, and the failure of reaction on the part of the Windsors.  What is not as well known is the story behind the action where Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister, was able to gradually move Queen Elisabeth to comprehend the public mood and to respond to that mood appropriately. Both characters display the adaptive leadership and necessary flexibility to survive and move the public agenda forward. Blair fully grasps the situation as well as the need to apply just enough pressure to the Queen so that she grows and doesn't retreat.  Michael Sheen is super as Tony Blair, using intelligent charm and strategic wit to move the queen to recognition of the gravity of the issues and to take action by showing empathy with the grief of the English people. James Cromwell is excellent as Prince Phillip, sometimes playing the role of the Queen's alter-ego or id with his displays of disgust and indignation. At other times he reveals the isolated and insulated existence of the Windsors that separated them from normal existence. I would recommend this film to be viewed and analyzed in a class on adaptive leadership.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|Good movie, had more of a plot than the previous two and the violence wasn't too gruesome.  Just wish more depth was done on the relationship between Milla's character and Oded Fehr's character
B0013ND30W|5.0|I cannot think of a more deserving Disney animated classic than SLEEPING BEAUTY to be the FIRST to be released on a platinum edition BLU-RAY disc.  Owning the two-disc DVD edition, and seeing the splendid already restored negative in that release, I can only imagine the magnificent quality of the 1080p picture and 7 channel Dolby soundtrack. This is one of Disney's most ambitious and yet underestimated film, in my opinion the best of the animated classics. I cannot wait until October 7th to see this on my home theatre screen. Hurry Disney!!!
B000056TKD|4.0|Besides their pop associations with outer space, The Planets and Also Sprach Zarathustra have escaped the orbit of classical music to become hits with crossover listeners. The other reviews here seem to emanate from fanboys -- at least that might account for the supercharged enthusiasm over Steinberg's preformances. I lived through the dismal Leinsdorf era into the abbreviated Steinberg one. He was hired to rebuild a demoralized group of musicians. I don't think the job was fully completed. The BSO sounds reckless and blatant in both performances, pouring out loud, coarse sounds that became mroe refined udner Ozawa when he arrived (leaving aside his other, less happy influences on the orchestra).<br /><br />The main attraction may well be DG's marvelous sonics, which really are of demonstration quality. The visceral impact of a large orchestra in full cry is captured in exciting fashion. But Steinberg bulls his way through The Planets, ignoring opportunities for nuance. The two best movements are the terrifying Mars and seductive Venus, but by the time we arrive at Jupiter, Steinberg's go-for-broke approach is yielding short-term rewards.  The same is true of Zarathustra. Where other conductors try to find gold among the dross, Steinberg is blatant and coarse, in no way equalling Karajan, Kempe, Tennstedt, and Reiner, all of whom lead performances full of genuine feeling, not mere flash.<br /><br />I can't hope to win any approval for these views of a CD that fans root for as avidly as they do the Red Sox, but perhaps a few newcomers will learn what they're actually in for.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Initially I stayed away from this film because of the subject matter. A child's disappearance is not a pleasant subject even when it is a backdrop for a great detective thriller. I am sorry I was reluctant. This film is one of the best films made in the last year. Ben Affleck directs a film every bit as masterful as Sean Penn's MYSTIC RIVER. The story takes place in a small community in Massachusetts.  Ben's brother, Casey plays the role of a young private detective, Patrick Kenzie, who is asked by the aunt of a child, gone missing, to aid the police in the search of her three year old niece. Kenzie's partner, Angela Gennaro, is ably portrayed by actress Michelle Monaghan. The search for the child is pretty straight forward; however, by the end of the film it becomes obvious that nothing is as it appears. Like the film CHINATOWN of some years ago this story has a lot going on under the surface. There are some tough moral dilemmas faced by the detective couple the resolution of which will give the viewer a lot to ponder. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, two of America's finest actors add substance to the story. Don't miss this film!
6305907145|4.0|this is still a movie worth watching! While not following Austen's original storyline exactly, the film takes a few liberties that ultimately end up working.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The conclusion of a grand trilogy. Matt Damon outdoes himself in this movie with more solid acting than the previous two.  The creation of Jason Bourne is revealed.
0385504209|3.0|A well written, well developed thriller.  I just wish my fellow reviewers weren't so taken with Dan Brown's lies dealing with history & religion - he clearly did it to garner attention and sell books.  Revisionist history - Ugh.  BUT, if you can park that aside, it's the type of read that will eat your weekend up.
B0010ZR160|4.0|Well, some directors are also born pretty.  Now we know, the previously actor known as Ben Affleck is a gifted director to watch in the future.  It is true that the little snipets of low-class Bostonians are tossed around like a sledgehammer, but I found everyone of those informative even on a sociological level.  There is also one action scene that is very well shot (in a house).  The suppossed mystery is easy to solve once the half point of the movie is reached, but the moral question proposed is still relevant (and by the way, the movie does takes sides, because even with doubts, its heroe does). (I give this film 3 and half stars.  I give only in rare occassions more than 4 stars, so this means it is good, watch it).
B0002OXVDW|5.0|I purchased this for my neice and she LOVED it.  I watched it as well and it is just a fun compilation.
B00000IP3S|5.0|I had only heard clips before buying this album....this is second only to \\"Nightfall In Middle Earth\\" which came out shortly after.  These guys have been a mainstay in the thrash/speed metal genre for many years now.  They have truly risen the bar with acoustic/orchestral arrangements along with operatic vocal harmonies that compliment the higher energy sections (piercing melodic dual guitar harmonies and strumming patterns) which inspire the listener to envision adventures in times long past, and fierce devotion to something other than themselves.  Anyone who is into speed/thrash metal should own this album along with nightfall.  According to its genre, this is a five star album for sure.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|This is not the easiest film to watch, mainly because you know it's based on real events.  I appreciated how Spielberg was even handed in presenting the story, he showed the horror of the events in Munich in 1972, but also showed you that everything is not always black and white, this film deals in very gray areas.  I thought the acting was top notch, especially the lady who played Golda Meir and the lady that played Bana's mother, she was very powerful; she was only in a few scenes, but I was mesmerized by her.  This movie is quite long, but does not feel that way, frankly their is alot of things that have to be explained.  Bana makes his character very human, he makes mistakes and he is conflicted in the end over what he is doing, this eats at him like a cancer and his paranoia is very believable at the end.  I thought the last scene where, Bana asked Rush if he will come break bread with him, and old jewish custom, and Rush declines; and he does this right after speaking to what Israel means and what it means to be a Jew; I think that sums up to Bana what he has given up and for what.  Good film, highly recommended.
0143038419|1.0|i had heard so much about this book and got on a waiting list at the library to get it.  i was to have the book back in seven days as it was a \\"waiting list\\" item.  i became so disinterested with the book, that it took me over two weeks to finish it and get it back to the library.  i had to make myself finish it.  i thought it would be an inspirational book about healing after a divorce and finding your purpose in life, but  it's no more than the author's preoccupation with sex. thus, the book is just some sexual odessey through italy, indonesia and bali.  it's crude at times, and for me was a disappointment. the author goes into such detail on some pages, i had to take a break and put the book down. it became so boring.  i, in all honesty, would not recommend it to any of my friends or family.  i wonder at times how the hype can get so huge on a book like this.  how does it start?
0810994739|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this light read. This book will get you giggling as you remember your middle school years through the eyes of Gregory and his family/friends. After reading the first book, Diary of a Wimpy Kid ,I gave it to my nephew who is in 4th grade. He LOVED it and couldn't wait to read this second book. He is now writing his very own book of experiences in a cartoon format. He told me to tell everyone that these books have introduced him to how fun reading can be and he cannot wait for the next book. Buy it, you will love it.

B00000HYXB|5.0|One of the most unique metal albums ever produced.  Creates a new genre almost stemming from speed/power metal - I call it \\"Minstrel Metal\\"    Beautifully composed and executed.  If you are a fan of any kind of metal or the works of J.R.R. Tolkien you must buy this album!
B000BTJDGC|5.0|Best possession movie ever made but very sad it's a true story! If your someone who don't believe in the after life, this story of what happend to Emily Rose will deffenetly make you start thinking!
B000TGCR3I|3.0|but it wasn't enormously captivating. it has a good story and good visuals. the amazon review is accurate (for your information), if you have or have not read it. it is worth watching, but it did not thrill me. *shrug*
0452289963|5.0|Executive summary: read this book. I believe A New Earth rises above The Power of Now, and that's no small feat. I once described The Power of Now as \\"enlightenment in a book\\" -- that is, until I read Tolle's New Earth. I bought this book on a whim as I passed the Powell Books sale table at Portland International Airport -- a fact I was reminded of as I walked past Powell's exactly one year later, and was still carrying the book with me! Indeed, I've kept this book in my backpack for \\"anytime\\" reading since Christmas '06, resulting in the evolution of my consciousness and the weathering of my paperback.<br /><br />While I am not as optimistic as Tolle regarding the speed of our collective evolution to a new level of consciousness, I gained a stronger sense of how ego directly relates to my betterment, to my so-called spiritual connection. In fact, at the very core of religion, spirituality, twelve-step programs, et al, I wholeheartedly believe one would find \\"ego deflation\\" to be a fundamental constituent.<br /><br />After reading many books about enlightenment, Buddhism, spirituality, and even recovery over the years (for recovery from addiction/alcoholism has served as the impetus of my long search), it is a real relief to see enlightenment framed in such pragmatic fashion. In many books enlightenment is characterized as a rather unclear, imponderable, telescopic eventuality of sorts; so I find it refreshing that enlightenment is described not as a virtual anachronism but as a presently attainable state.<br /><br />The Power of Now is not a firm prerequisite for New Earth as I initially presumed. New Earth's subject matter is certainly akin or even identical to that of Power of Now, but the writing and organization of New Earth actually make for a superior read, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />I would encourage you to read Eckhart Tolle's essay The One Thing (available as free PDF here on Amazon) if you remain ambivalent about reading New Earth. Sure, the essay is basically a sales pitch, but it's -- well, at least it's a spiritual sales pitch.t's -- well, at least it's a spiritual sales pitch.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|The story:  In the crappy apopcalyptic 2027 world, people have become sterile.  For an unexplained reason, a young British woman has become pregnant.  The evil government wants her.  The revolutionaries want her.  The lead hero must get her to the safety of *** THE HUMAN PROJECT *** tah-dahhh (this film's version of GreenPeace and a utopian haven in an otherwise wasted world).  They enter a Warsaw Ghettoish concentration camp from hell and he actually asks his contact, \\"Can you get us a boat?\\" (Pahleeze. They would have had a better chance of getting off of Gilligan's island).  Do they get their boat and make it to the Human Project????!!  I'll have to leave you hanging there.<br /><br />I could hear enough of the dialogue past the heavy British accent and muted sound work, to know that it was uninspired.  Fairly good effects work on visually creating the dirty Mad Max world, but it was not as exciting as it was depressing.<br /><br />There is a lot of political correctness in the film, which I surmise as why many lemmings have jumped on the praise bandwagon.  I'll submit that there is a reason why this was not a box-office hit . . . it sucks.<br /><br />Actually, my wife had ordered this from NetFlix.  I don't hate her for it, but I've done her the favor of advising her to go ahead and send it back (she hasn't seen it yet).
B00005JPXY|3.0|I really was hoping for a more classic monster film not unlike the godzilla films but with a newer twist. well I got part of that deal. the cgi monster scenes and building destruction were all done very well and quite realistic. However, the camera jerking around about every 15 seconds truly does seem to dizzy you a bit. (this was the directors idea to make it seem as if amature filmographers were filming this. the effect is realistic but still annoying) which bothered me and the sound can get almost Nerve grating with the background talking at the party to the screaming. then there is truly a lack of a story other then as of you were watching someones turned in film of a monster attack on new york without having ben edited by the news station. although there are some highlights to this film such as watching a tank and military with bazookas etc running around new york (considering 9/11 was surprised to see a tank!) also as I stated before some of the city destruction scenes were stunningly done and very realistic. also the critter itself was a really new type of monster that you really would want to run from very quickly. and the little ones were just so spider like and nasty as to truly make sure if the big one didn't make you run those should. not these kids though. the main character (who's unfortunate going away party this was) absolutely HAS to get to his EX-Girlfriend to save her from this beastie that has demolished a good part of new york. that's a little much for me. this film was done in a very annoying \\"Blair witch project\\" style with jerky camera motions (if you get motion sick bring drammamine) and while was done way better, can not garner more then 3 stars from me because the sound and annoying video just killed a good 2 stars off this one for me.<br /><br />CGI: excellent special effects 5 stars.<br /><br />Video quality: 1 star horribly annoying jerking motions throughout the film (too add realism but still...) 2 stars could have been done realistic without being a complete nooblet to filming. my cousins kids can do better.<br /><br />Sound: Horrible in most of the beginning and towards the end cannot hear the people too well due to the background chatter and noise (again for realism and it makes it seem real but about as amusing as watching a poorly filmed home video) 1 star<br /><br />acting and Overall: acting was ok about what you would expect from most of the kids (with the daft exception of the guy and his ex.) and the film while really superbly done in some spots has so many flaws I cannot give more then 3 stars to a film that finally had the potential to be a masterpiece.<br /><br />buy it here and see for yourself!<br />&lt;link will be inserted when available><br />[[ASIN:B00005JPXY Cloverfield]]complete nooblet to filming. my cousins kids can do better.

0316067598|2.0|I guess people who's interested in this book is not looking for literature values here. I would not comment on that aspect as well. The authors did a job sufficient enough of delivering the story.    More pages were used on describing the story teller's journey made him a NAVY seal. The second half of the book is supposed to be the real stuff about the operation. But, it wasn't a convincing story. Either the author was not allowed to tell all the truth because of certain reasons, or the operation was actually poorly planned and executed with many bad judgment calls, if not incompetence. A few easy things to pick out:    4 special force soldiers in enemy territory can walk into 3 goat herders with scores of goats without noticing?  Killing innocent civilians is the only option? How about tie them up?  Only call for reinforcement after been shot at by 100 enemy soldiers for half an hour and half of the team has been decimated? Hard to believe.     This story has the quality of the script of a cheesy Hollywood war movie, with bloated up heroism and less substance.
B000003TBP|4.0|Long considered pioneering white-boy, fusion-funkster-extraordinaire Beck's masterpiece, Odelay may in fact be the greatest summation of this man's dirty pop, distinctly reeling in his dance, rock, funk and experimental sides in the most cohesive and accessible disc of his career to that date by far. Some selections might have grown a tad tiresome over the decade, lacking the truly scuzzy heart of another masterpiece of his, the previous lo-fi odyssey Mellow Gold, or the production wit of Midnight Vultures...but in the end captures this influential modern artist at his commercial and creative crossroad best.
0307120007|5.0|This was wanted as a shower gift and a special for the mother to be. Great book.
1569242739|5.0|This is the cutest and most well put together recipe book I have yet to encounter. Who can go wrong with cupcakes? Well, a few people can technically...but who can go wrong with VEGAN cupcakes? No one!!! This book has several great vegan cupcake recipes with great photography and informative and fun recipes. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I didn't think Radiohead could surpass OK Computer or the Bends, but they have with this one.  Beginning to end, the most complete Radiohead ever. From the high-intensity rock of 'Bodysnachers,' to the beautifully complex melody of 'All I need,\\" Radiohead has solidified it's place as one of the best bands ever.
0767805712|5.0|I bought this movie to show my class of lower level bio kids, generally kids who are checked out of school.  Some of the details had to be reviewed that they didn't quite understand, but they understood the movie overall.  Even better, the discussion we had after the movie was AMAZING.  They really were able to relate the movie well to modern issues and many were able to uncover the layers of symbolism and imagery in the film.  There were more than a few comments that caused me to respond \\"I hadn't even thought about that!\\"  This was a much better vehicle for thinking about ethical issues realted to technology than any article I could have found.  We are also relating parts of the movie to our new unit on genetics, something I hadn't even anticipated would happen.  Overall, I would highly recommend this film for other bio teachers to use during their DNA units.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|Voises from heaven, a homerun. Great as a gift for someone special or for car, home and work.
B000P0I4O4|4.0|I thought this was a very good action film.  Reminded me of CLIFFHANGER or DIEHARD in the woods. It had what I want out of an action movie-clever lines, quirky characters, plucky hero, interesting bad guys and good action scenes.  I don't mind formula if it is done well and this was.  I thought some of the plot twists were interesting.  My wife even liked it.  Not sure what the negative reviewers were looking for.  I thought it was a very entertaining film.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|This is such a great album.  It's pop perfection!  \\"Gimme More\\" was her comeback hit, charting all the way to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100.  it's a fun pop song that gets your attention with it's great beats.  \\"Piece of Me\\", although faring worse on the charts than \\"Gimme More\\" is another great pop song.  If you liked those to radio singles you'll like the rest of the album which pretty much keeps to the same formula of dance pop.  It is definately a new sound from Britney but the old Britney is somewhere hidden amongst the trance inspired tracks of this album.  I wish it was nominated for grammys this year but unfortunately Britney failed to make the cut (her rival Christina was nominated again this year!).  My favorite track is \\"Heaven On Earth.\\"  It has a great heavenly feel to it.  Overall this is a great album. I highly reccomend it!
006054094X|2.0|To call this book \\"unrestrained speculation\\" as some academic reviewers have is far too polite.  Avoid.

B000VR824S|5.0|Purchased [[ASIN:B000VR824S Eric Clapton: Crossroads Guitar Festival 2007]]after renting it from Netflix.  I LOVE THIS CONCERT!  I had never heard of John McLaughlin nor Jeff Beck, but after seeing and hearing this concert I fell in love with these performers.  This concert opened up a whole new world of music that I wasn't much into.  I'm finding myself playing this concert and certain performances over and over and I just can't get tired of it.  All the performances were mind blowing.  I have enjoyed many of Eric Claptons DVD concerts, but this one everyone should see.  John Mayer, Doyle Bramhall II performances stood out.  I was not a real big fan of John Mayer, but after this concert I now appreciate this talented young performer! His rendition of \\"Gravity\\" put his name on my list of important music artists. Buy this DVD and also the 2004 concert.  I saw the 2007 first, but both are totally awesome performances.  I'm going to buy more John McLaughlin and Jeff Beck music and DVD.  I want to see hear where they started and how they got to the 2007 Eric Clapton Guitar Festival.  If you buy this DVD you won't be disappointed.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|my sister is a big fan of musicals, and this was one she just had to have. If you are into musicals, definitely see this one.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I saw this production at the Met in 02/07 and was impressed, the best performance I have ever seen.  And the video is even better, you get close ups of facial expressions, Hvorostovsky and Fleming are, in addition to their voices, superb actors.  This role is Dmitri's, no one else could compare.  The two have a chemistry.  Ramon Vargas is also superb.  EXCELLANT!

B0000931LJ|5.0|An excellent album from start to finish. Definitely Marc Bolan's masterpiece.  Be aware that the album does not include bonus tracks as listed on Amazon. It's the album with the 11 songs we know and love. Rhino's remastered CD version does include extra tracks and an interview. The album is pressed on 180 gram vinyl.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I have to be careful how I review this movie, because I am absolutely enamored with it.  I bought the DVD from Amazon the very day that it came out, and if I'm not careful I'm going to hype it up too much.    Really, though, for a lover of sci-fi it was a fantastic piece of work.  From the writer of Tesseract and 28 Days Later comes something better than both of those.  And, speaking as an engineer, a whole lot of what you will see in this movie is entirely scientifically accurate, too (except maybe the travelling to the center of the sun part -- hey, sometimes you have to get a little imaginative).  The psychology and development of the characters was great, in my opinion.  Through both suspense and action, it will keep you on the edge of your seat.    It's just too bad not everyone had a chance to see this in theaters, because the cinematography is yet another thing to rave about; they've engineered some stunning images here.  I saw this for the first time while visiting family in Boston, and I almost cried when I came back home and tried to take all my friends to go see it and found out it wasn't showing anywhere in New Orleans!
B000LXHK2C|5.0|I never heard of A Good Year... until I was surfing through my TIVO movie choices under the letter \\"A\\" and decided to record it.

I especially adored the end credits, and hearing the song \\"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny, Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\\" sung in French while watching stills from the movie. This was a real HOOT!!  I have purchased the movie for my own, and wholeheartly recommed it to all!

B000TUXL2A|5.0|Mark Knopfler's latest offering is an amazing collection. The usual guitar riffs that are his signatures are all here. What amazes me is the amazing depth of this album. The piece \\"Heart full of holes\\" always tugs at my heart. While this album sounds more British than his previous couple of albums, it is definitely one of his more mature works. All the songs are great, but there are a couple that really stand out: \\"Heart full of Holes\\", and \\"Secondary Waltz\\" come to mind right away. Cheers Mark, and thanks a million!
0618918248|5.0|2/8/08<br /><br />Amazon Book Review by Donald A. Collins, a free lance writer living in Washington, DC<br /><br />TITLE: The God Delusion: A handbook for lifting our religion disease<br /><br />TEXT:  Having read several of his books, when Richard Dawkins, on his American book tour for his latest book , \\"The God Delusion\\" arrived at Politics and Prose, an independent bookseller in NW Washington, DC, I eagerly attended his lecture there and had him sign a copy of his book.  His talk was enthusiastically embraced by the overflow crowd, many of whom confessed to leaving various faiths for atheism.<br /><br />As I prepare to enter my 78th year, I find numerous obituaries of people who didn't make that milestone and feel sublimely lucky to have done so in relatively good health.<br /><br />Philosophers of every stripe have enjoyed giving counsel on how to prepare for death.  Books are rife and varied, so one has enough choices.  In fact even if you started reading these tracts early in life you likely wouldn't cover them all.  One major source of such advice of course is the world's plethora of religions. These diverse sects stress \\"Getting right with God\\".  So I went to my search engine using that phrase and WOW, the list was long and detailed.  One fella named James Petzold has been at it since he was 22 in 1972, when his girl friend rejected him. Hey, that's when he got serious, no screwing around with eternity which he describes in a turgid litany of his path to Jesus and God. Happy ending?  You betcha: His group, \\"Precious Testimonies is supported financially by those God directs to sow into this ministry. We ask each person reading this to please ask God on an on-going basis if He would have you sow a financial gift to this evangelistic outreach of His - trust that He will clearly communicate His will to you in the matter - then simply be obedient. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about the current financial needs of this outreach, or any other questions you may have. For convenience, you can simply click on the secure Pay Pal donate button below if you want to donate by credit card. Otherwise, you can send your precious gift to: Precious Testimonies, P.O. Box 516, Jenison, MI 49429.<br /><br />Well, folks, to each his own. If the psycho babble of the religious fantasy mongers pleases you, then stop reading this right now and certainly don't buy Dawkins' book as it will frighten you..<br /><br />For many years I have been \\"unchurched\\" although when, as a widower, I remarried 14 years ago my bride and I were delighted to call upon a clergyman relative from each of our families to bless our union. These two are wonderful people, each with a sincere and abiding faith in their religion, whose moral compasses come not from their religious beliefs but from the intrinsic goodness of some humans as compared with the intrinsic evil in others.  Moral codes come not from religion but from the transactional experience of human evolution, despite the claims of the faithful.<br /><br />I have been a practicing atheist for years.  Just what are the standard religious options?  As Oxford Don and Darwinian exponent, Dawkins writes in \\"The God Delusion\\", \\"A theist believes in a supernatural intelligence who, in addition to his main work of creating the universe in the first place, is still around to oversee and influence the subsequent fate of his initial creation.... He answers prayers, forgives or punishes sins; intervenes in the world by performing miracles; frets about good and bad deeds, and knows when we do them (or even think about doing them).  A deist, too, believes in a supernatural intelligence, but one whose activities were confined to setting up the laws that govern the universe in the first place. Pantheists don't believe in a supernatural God at all, but use the world God as a non supernatural synonym for nature, or for the Universe, or for the lawfulness that governs its workings. ....Pantheism is sexedup atheism.  Deism is watered down theism.\\"<br /><br />I evolved from being a \\"reverent agnostic\\" as I became aware of these various standard gradations of belief.  So where is agnosticism?

B000VR824S|4.0|It's worth the price if only to see the outstanding performances featuring Derek Trucks. He is all over the place on this DVD. How a young guy like him developed such amazing chops is. well, unworldly.    Jeff Beck's performance is nothing short of awe inspiring. Many of the world's finest guitarists consider Beck the master. Watch this and you will know why. And who is that young gal playing bass? She matches Beck note for note - not an easy task for any player, let alone someone who appears to be little more than a teen, maybe a young adult.    And then there is Steve Winwood. He is always a pleasure to watch and listen to. He hits it off well playing the Blind Faith material with Clapton, but he really shines on perhaps his greatest work - Dear Mr. Fantasy.    That brings us to Clapton. Much credit goes to the man for assembling such a great group of players to support a worthy cause. Unfortunately, his performances come up a bit short. It seemed like he was trying very hard, maybe too hard to keep up with the young guns in his band,((Trucks blows him away every time they play a number together). Maybe it's just over-exposure. There is no denying that he is one of the guitar greats, but he is starting to sound stale. Maybe it's just because rock and blues are great, but limited forms of music. There is only so far that Clapton or anyone can stretch it. Compare Jeff Beck's performance to anything Clapton does on this DVD and you will understand what I am saying.    Overall, a good DVD, certainly worth owning. Unfortunately, I find my self hitting the skip button on the remote a little too often.
B0002KPIQY|4.0|Ang gets her kit off again for some great filming. A touching tale about how drugs can realy F#@*% up the lives of those fame favours. Glad I found it, it was worth the search.
1931382794|3.0|This is a fine book and tells some cool thing about bicycle powermeters. It introduces some usefull concepts, like the normalized power, TSS. You´ll understand some capabilities of the limit-less tool called powermeter. It shows how to use an powermeter beyond the ordinary. You´ll learn some nice stuff.    But the author doesn´t give away their gold. It looks like their real secret - the training sessions - are kept away. They begin to show some exercise sessions for some kind of purpose, but they don´t show you a lot. I felt like they were writing an teaser, not the full movie.     They also tell a lot about the Cycling Peaks software, which is good, but not all that great. I prefer to combine the Cycling Peaks with the original SRM or Powertap softwares to get the most juice.    They tried to keep this book from being an big ad and they pretty much accomplished that. I didn´t get angry, nor got crazy to go buy their software after reading the book.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Saw the play with family and friends. When I saw the CD and price, I thought we could share it and use the music to remind us of various scenes.
B000MGVCFY|5.0|Is it possible that with the three different mixes available on these SACD hybrids that certain folks are listening and reviewing the wrong versions?  The 16bit CD version is most likely the one to be neglected in mastering on these re-releases- as the main focus was the Super Audio 24/96 and the Quad (surround) mixes 4.0. The 16bit CD version was included just so it could be marketed as playable on a wide variety of systems. To hear the supposed ultimate stereo version you must have an SA player hooked up properly. I get the impression that the 16 bit CD version was treated to the aweful maximum loudness routine without much attention to its skewing of the delicate moodies mix. Whereas the SA 24/96 version was left to it's natural state. I must admit that with all the repetitous liner notes... one would expect that they would tell their devoted audience of fans who have bought these records several times over, what the process was that presents us with these new versions. What a glaring omission and quite honestly insulting! This is a very confusing time to be a music consumer... the manufactures seem to want us to be in the dark as they are chasing money making scheams over truly caring for these archives. Big business gets us again.. excuse my cynic ... sometimes he's out of control! Quality control was lax on these releases and it was an easy way to make money without having to actually remix these albums from scatch into 5.1 surround (spending hundreds of thousands of dollars)... Hmmm... Let's just use the old Quad tapes! That's suspect right there. I suppose if the surround format continues to grow, they plan on re-releasing it again finally remixed for surround and not an easy and cheap quad left over. Sometimes I wish I could figure out a way to watch over this so it's done for the fans who buy it and not the execs and management who profit from it. I love the Moody Blues but I am disappointed in this low budget attempt at throwing us scraps. Even the coverart quality looks second hand. Somebody in the Moodies camp must care!!! ...STEP UP my friend!!!! It is like spraying windex on the mona lisa to clean it up? Cut it out!!!!

0307237702|5.0|This is a very enlightening book.    Obama is a fine orator and writes intelligently.   He goes back to the roots of the Democratic form of Government in America and feels that the Constitution has drifted away from the principles therein.  America would be lucky to have him as a President.
1564029654|5.0|Owl Babies is an enchanting book which my six year old Daughter first discovered when we borrowed it from our local library.  It conveys perfectly, the fact that it is normal to worry about things, but that everything usually works out in the end - if you just have hope!    I was unable to obtain this book in the UK as it is now out of publication, however I was delighted when I discovered that it could be bought from the US.  The only difference in the UK & US version is the use of 'Mummy' in our version & 'Mommy' in the US version - this of course does absolutely nothing to spoil our enjoyment of this excellent book.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|This Anthology is worth every penny you spend on it. I grew up listening to the Police and every song imaginable from their early days to the days before the band broke apart are included in this 2 disc compilation.<br />If you can't go see them on tour right now, buy this cd....and if you CAN go see them on tour right now, I hate you...and buy this cd!  :)  ;)<br />p.s. I love you Sting. Nobody really plays bass like you. (ha ha)
1400082773|5.0|Barack Obama is an excellent and fascinating writer who brings alive the many varied elements of his early life and his experience of them as a human being.  The book is as unique as Mr. Obama's truly unique early circumstances and life.  This is the first place to go in any assessment of this man as a growing political force and to discover something about  how he can be expected to approach and solve problems in the national arena.  It is also a book that gives genuine insight into some of the internal issues that multiracial children in our society face and the struggle for identity.  However, this book describes the struggle of all young people everywhere, regardless of race or class, to discover and establish identity, find a path in life that is meaningful and relevant to one's experience and come to terms with both the good and the bad in one's family and history.  The book is somewhat incomplete in that it ends at such an early age and the coming to terms and attempts at brutal self-honesty are not as complete at this age as they may be later.
1878424505|5.0|This book is just a pleasure to read and is done before you know it.  Although you will find yourself pausing in introspection often.  If you are looking for some clarity in your life and a little spirituality this is the book for you.     There are four main portions to this book. If you are enjoying this book, after getting through the first two sections I recommend buying the companion book.  Its literally called the Four Agreements Companion book.

B000062XFG|3.0|I love Star Trek OK? That being said, this is the season where Next Gen really took off, starting with The Child, Contagion, the profound Measure of A Man, and culminating with Elementary Dear Data, the monumental Q Who?, and the exciting Peak Performance. Excellent writing almost across the board, excellent acting and superb chemistry between the actors. Can't beat it for Television. And they did all this for a mere 1.5 million per episode. Realize that this is upwards of 267 Million dollars for the Next Gen franchise. That is a huge investment, and in that context, 62.00$ is not too bad for 19 hours of enjoyment!     The one issue I have is Paramount's DVD quality control. If you order a set, FIRST THING YOU DO AFTER YOU UNPACK THIS YEAR'S SET IS INSPECT THE UNDERSIDE OF EACH DISK FOR SCRATCHES OR DEFECTS!! A must! One small flaw and you get skips, or freezes. Major scratches and your disk will come to a grinding halt and will lock up. Usually at the worst possible time, at a critical moment in your favorite show. For this kind of money, you don't need that. Now for the good stuff...    In my collection, you will find Season Three, Season Four, and Season Two, the best, most consistent quality oriented, thoughtful scripts, screenplays and compelling acting in my opinion, however, I had to go through multiple sets of Year 2 because there was at least one major flaw (I mean big ones) on the underbelly (laser burned side) of at least one disk in every set of Year 2 I owned.     Year two premiered the development of Riker's great Sir Walter Raleigh beard, and the debut of Ten Forward, THE place to go to blow off steam or just relax and be human, and have fun. While I thought a few of the first year's shows were indicative of potential, Year Two was when that potential began to be tapped. In Season Two, Troi's accent was not quite so pretentious, Riker became more of a real, vibrant, Machiavellian character, with a great humour, quick wit, and less of a stiff cartoon character. Picard really found his voice, and Beverly took off a year (and thereby, somehow, became a great actress) while she was away having her baby. Worf became a more handsome and believable Klingon, and everything just moved ahead by leaps and bounds. Dr. Pulaski was great in Elementary Dear Data and she sparkled in Peak Performance. This was just great fun, with some powerful philosophy thrown in for good measure, in typical Star Trekian fashion. Top quality entertainment.     Next Gen. really took off in year two. You might notice three or more decibels of additional bridge and engineering sub-bass and engine noise in year two's shows. Your higher powered subwoofer will confirm this. This also added to the moxy and the gravitas of the second (and subsequent) seasons, and added together, they spelled success in capital letters! No other Trek show had this unique idea.     Next Gen was destined for a big splash, and year two, the Second Season, was when it really began to coalesce. The crew became THE Crew. This season cemented the chemistry that made all seven years of Next Gen possible.     No Trek collection would be complete without The Second Season of Next Gen.

B000W9DSVW|5.0|These movies are always fun to watch, and acting and production value is of course top-notch.  Even if you don't like the story, they are all amazing looking movies (perfect lighting, perfect camera angles, etc.), so if you want something that looks good to show of your new HDTV these are definitely the way to go.  Other good movies that look especially amazing on nicer screens are computer animated movies, like the Pixar films.
0790729644|5.0|FIRST, I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT MY ORDER WAS RECEIVED WITHNIN THE SPECIFIED TIME AND IN GOOD SHAPE. I HAVED ALWAYS LIKED THIS MOVIE BUT ONLY RECENTLY DECIDED TO ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION. IT HAS A GREAT STORY ABOUT A BAD MAN WHO TURNS GOOD. BUT, WHEN AN OPPORTUNITY COMES TO MAKE MONEY TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HIS CHILDREN, HE TAKES IT. EVEN THOUGH HE DONE SOMETHING BAD IT TURNS OUT GOOD IN THE END.
B000VBJEEG|1.0|Shame on Pixar.  This is not Pixar quality.  The animation is good of course. But for me, I just couldnt get past all the rats all over the food... UGH!!!!  The story line was boring.  I know that kitchen reality shows are all the rage now. (LOVE GORDON RAMSAY!!!) But this I could have done without.  This movie was just dumb.  Dont bother.  AND AGAIN, EEEWWWW RATS !!  Even though it was a cartoon, I kinda wanted them all to get snapped in Rat Traps.  MMMWWWAAA HA HA HA HA.
B0000AUHPG|2.0|Please don't get me wrong...I was raised on westerns, love the genre and saw most of Leone's spaghetti westerns by the time I was fifteen, but what is going on in this film?  I don't mean the plot; it is twisted but somehow makes sense. How in the world did good guy Fonda get cast as such a reprobate character?  My mind struggled to accept him as an assassin the entire film. The scene in which he forces himself on the Cardinale character, Jill, is revolting.<br />Speaking of which, how did the director feel that such a gorgeous woman as Cardinale would fit the part?  I can almost accept her as the denizen of a New Orleans brothal but in the Old West, such a person would not have existed. And don't try to excuse this as a Hollywood film fantasy.  Leone missed the boat on that bit of casting. The final scene when she serves drinks to the railway crew is as ludicrous as the outfit she is almost wearing.<br />Bronson's character was a surprising relief.  His performance is solid and he is immensely believable as a man thirsty for vengeance.  The harmonica theme while effective, becomes hacky by the end of the film, however.  One problem I did have was the scene between him and Jill in the stable. Why did he have to rip the lace out of her bodice and otherwise manhandle her?  Dominance?  The scene is jarringly out of place and serves no purpose other than to highlight Cardinale's \\"assets.\\"<br /><br />The cinematography as well as the soundtrack are the real standouts in this film.  I mean, Monument Valley AND Morricone?  Who could resist?<br />If you are a western film, Leone, or Bronson fan, you will enjoy this film. If not, save yourself a few hours and skip it.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|This Is the Ultimate package for any OC Fan who just loved the show and anything got to do with it!  The only bad thing was that it took a while for the order to arrive however i live in Australia, so thats maybe why.  Apart from that, It has every episode on DVD in a specially packaged box/booklet for the collector. Plenty of Pictures and episode descriptions and interviews etc inside the booklet.   Highly Recommend it!
B00006WKSZ|3.0|It's not a bad album at all... but it's not as good as I hoped it would be. But there is something that I must say, there are some true classics here that should be featured in whatever Greatest Hits packages they put together, and they haven't. It's a good album to get if you're interested in the Uli Roth era (great guitarist, by the way!)
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|It seems that in \\"special\\" releases, Columbia and Paramount really trail behind Warner Bros., which is why I hesitated somewhat from upgrading my barebones \\"Tootsie\\" DVD to this 25th Anniversary Edition. The first extras that I looked at were the deleted scenes; there are quite a few short ones here, none of which really deserved to be inserted. Some are mildly amusing, some shouldn't have even been shot in the first place. OK, one extra down, two to go. Next I looked at Dustin Hoffman's \\"screen test.\\" Source material are original betamax tapes of Dustin first doing the Dorothy Michaels character. Although theses tests are very short, they are extremely relevatory into the talents of Hoffman. Between the time he filmed these initial test and the time that his final character was put on film, Hoffman transitioned from a bad drag queen into a believable female. Truly incredible to compare the two performances which are roughly 3 years apart. 2nd extra down, last one to go: \\"The Making Of\\" documentary. I had no expectations of this whatsoever; expecting a 20 minute assortment of clips and a little narration, instead, we are treated to about an hour and a half of indepth interviews and insight into the creation of this comedy classic. There are current interviews from Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Terri Garr, and Sydney Pollack. The only major player missing is Murray, but it doesn't detract from the documentary. We learn that this movie is one of those amazing occurrances where the right creative team comes together; Hoffman is a difficult to control idea-man who definitely needs to be steered and somewhat restrained. As the Director, Pollack supplied this excellent guidance, and rather than play the movie for bawdy laughter, he went for honesty and truth. Elaine May also apparently gave the film its momentum and helped build all of the intertwined stories that lead to the exciting conclusion of the live Soap Opera reveal at the climax. Bill Murray and Terri Garr gave many classic improv moments, and Jessica Lange gives a very sweet and honest \\"straight\\" performance. In the interviews, Dabney Coleman tells how nobody ever laughed on the set; it was the editing of Pollack that made all the humor work, and when looking at the movie after hearing this, it is obvious to see the truth in his statement. This documentary all has many behind-the-scenes clips and confrontations between Pollack and Hoffman, who pushed the director to try every possible route and questioned everything about the movie. Large gripe - why couldn't the theatrical trailer have been put on here? It was on the barebones previous release...surely it could have fit on this DVD, too.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the plot, here it is: Michael Dorsey is a talented but exasperating NYC actor (much like Hoffman apparently) who nobody wants to work with; he drives up budgets and is difficult to work with. Desperate for money, he disguises himself as a woman to win a role on a soap opera. After he gets the role, he must keep it a secret from his girlfriend (Terri Garr), his costar Julie (Jessica Lange) with whom he has fallen for, and from Julie's dad (Charles Durning) who has fallen for him, thinking he is a woman. The longer it continues, the harder it is to keep juggling his life and secrets, and Michael must figure out a solution.<br /><br />The film itself looks good for its age in this widescreen 2:40:1 transfer in English 5.0. It is a little surprising that there's no commentary track, however, the documentary covers so much it really isn't all that necessary.

1881273156|5.0|This book as alot of useful information. It is definately what everyone has been talking about.
0694003611|5.0|A perfect bedtime read, with a rhyme that becomes familiar.    When younger it was one of my daughter's favorites's, later on she began to follow what is being said in the pages and then memorizing it and \\"reading\\" along.    The first time you hear your child say \\"Goodnight\\" to something that is in the book, your heart will melt,  It really is just too cute.
B000V6586Y|2.0|it's cute, catchy, but not what Gwen's capable of. I'd like to see more... just more.
B0000046KM|1.0|There is only one word for this CD - - -DELICIOUS ! ! ! ! Went back and bought two more for friends.  They agreed with me.  ENJOY
159562015X|1.0|A vague mish-mash of self help nostrums that could be found in any of a dozen self help books or an astrological reading. What makes Rath very clever (and I have a grudging admiration for any really good con artist) is that he encourages readers to 'share' with friends. Who have to buy a new book, since the 'code' enclosed with each book is valid for only a single 'reading'. . . excuse me, \\"analysis\\".  This guy's going to make a mint. I wonder if he's going to sell franchises?
B00130UFY2|3.0|I'm sure this is a great movie, unfortunately I couldn't watch more than a few seconds without getting motion sickness!  This is the second movie in a few months that I have downloaded which had some kind of encoding issue or something similar.  Every time the camera moves quickly, the screen blurs slightly and it creates a really unviewable movie.  Anyone else seen this issue with Unbox movies d/l to TIVO boxes?
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I never got to see any of the second season so I was buying this with the chance of being dissatisfied. Welp, guess what I wasn't! This season was better than the first season. I am so glad that I got it and I got total enjoyment out of watching every disc. I didn't want them to be over. The one thing I didn't like was Dean bargining his soul but that is part of the show. I have to say I love this show and I say this with caution because evey time I really like a show the Ex's of the shows decide for some stupid reason to take the show off the air:Dresden Files,Dark Angel,Fiefly,Stargate SG-1 and there is more. I know you understand. So as far as I can say about \\"Supernatural Season 2\\" is buy it and enjoy.
B00114RKT8|5.0|Have no clue why this fine film did not do better at the cinema.  The acting, story line and music was brilliant.  Is a film I will return to watch over and over.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I bought Dexter only because it sounded like something that I might like, well, to my suprise I couldn't stop watching it! I was not disappointed in any of the disc's. I am sure Showtime knows they have a hit on their hands. There is humor and drama mixed very well. The fact that blood death and murder is what the storylines are usually centered arouned it is done so that it isn't gross but maybe you need to rent it before buying it. I just have a weird flavor for shows like Dexter. I hope it stays on Showtime for more seasons to come.
B000ZOW96Y|2.0|Don't waste the time to watch this film.  Old tricks and lame acting make this film a complete dud.

B000IDGDPA|5.0|Got to love a period English film.  The sights and story are lovely.  Acting is also top drawer.  Will see this film agian
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|Believable? No.  A little ridiculous?  Yes.  Entertaining?  Very!     First of all, we're talking about a basic premise in which we, the audience, are asked to beleive that the devil himself signed drawings in a series of \\"ancient manuscripts\\".  And that these 400 year-old manuscripts are in pristine condition, looking like they've never even been opened (or photocopied or had cigarette ash dropped on them by former owners, etc).  A suspension of disbelief is absolutely necessary!    There's the 'guardian angel' or 'guardian devil' should we say, in the mysterious 'woman' who keeps appearing to help him out of various difficulties and who finally leads him to reach 'the ninth gate'.    I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The pacing was steady and suspenseful.  The filming was obviously the work of a master.  I loved that we got to 'go to Europe' for the second half of the movie.  The ending was the only problem for me.  I hear people debating both ways - cop-out or stroke of genius?  I'm bound to think the former is more accurate.  However, if we are to beleive that the sudden fade to white is a sudden bringing of the audience into the consciousness of Johny Depp as he enters the ninth gate... well..  It still seems to me like he just couldn't think of any better way to end it.  After all, the movie's been promising to 'raise the devil' for almost two hours and finally we are left with this?  I was a bit let down, whether I should or shouldn't have been.  Still, maybe that was the best way to end it.  On the other hand, Johny could have walked into that building in the last scene and saw George Bush standing there and that would have been a perfect ending!
B000059GEH|5.0|A \\"must-see\\" if you like Monroe in a comedy situation.. Monroe plays a wonderfully ditzy model in this movie with Lauren Bacall as the lead and Betty Grable a solid co-star. They don't make them like this anymore.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I love the original Dr. Who and I was skeptical, but the new series is modern, well written, excellently acted and captivating even if you've never seen an episode of the original. Christopher Eccleston is a fanatistic Doctor and very sexy. Billie Piper's acting will surprise you. They're a great team (along with very tight screen writing) making a fabulous action adventure, love story throughout the season. The humour is dry and quick, but unmistakably, \\"the doctor\\".
B000PC8AFU|5.0|A wonderful addition to any SRV collection. A good mix of old and timeless jam sessions with the greatest minds of electric blues. Definitely a must have for any serious SRV fan.
B000EXZI1O|4.0|If one were to assess musical artists in the Pop music era, one may not be off-base by saying that the Bee Gees are one of the Top 10 acts of all time.   The Bee Gees established themselves as pop stars in the late 1960s; reinvented themselves in the 1970s as pioneers for the \\"Disco Era\\"; became acclaimed songwriters for some of pop's biggest acts in the 1980s; and then successfully made a comeback in the 1990s.    It was the 1975 album \\"Main Course\\" that would be the album where the Bee Gees would reinvent themselves.   \\"Main Course\\" would include a large use of synthesizers that would be key in spearheading the Bee Gees foray into the \\"Disco Era\\".  While \\"Main Course\\" might be criticized because of being Disco, one cannot deny that the Bee Gees were innovators back in 1975.    Following \\"Main Course\\", they would journey into the world of Disco, and ultimately the Bee Gees would reach the their highest heights with their participation on the 1977 \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" soundtrack.  It was that landmark album that cemented the Bee Gees as a Hall of Fame band and made them synonymous with the Disco era.  Following \\"Saturday Night Fever\\",  the Bee Gees faced the challenge of following up the success of that landmark album.   With the release of 1979's \\"Spirits Having Flown\\", the Bee Gees would move things in a different direction, but at the same time not be afraid to refine their sound.    Looking at the Bee Gees, I look at the group has covering three phases.   \\"Early Bee Gees\\" covers the period from the inception of the group through 1973's \\"Life in a Tin Can\\" album.  This period would have the Bee Gees characterized as pop artists/pop balladeers.  In 1974, with the release of \\"Mr. Natural\\" would begin the \\"Disco Era\\" phase as the Bee Gees would introduce an R&B and Disco influence - as well as Barry Gibb's trademark falsetto.   The \\"Disco Era\\" phase would run from 1974's \\"Mr. Natural\\" album through 1981's \\"Living Eyes\\" album.   This would be the most commerciallysuccessful period for the band and would include their \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" material.    When Disco went into decline, the Bee Gees would go into commercial decline.  They would take some time off and focus on songwriting, and then in 1987 when they would launch their comeback.   Beginning with 1987's \\"E.S.P.\\" album, the Bee Gees would return to a more traditional sound becoming adult-contemporary artists.    The signs of this adult-contemporary sound started to show with the release of \\"Spirits Having Flown\\".  However, because this was released shortly after \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" as well as showcases Barry's Falsetto, I classify this as the \\"Disco Era\\".    Throughout their careers, Barry and Robin Gibb have often shared the lead vocals for the band.   As Barry began to develop his falsetto sound,  he began to assume more of the lion's share of the lead vocals.  On \\"Spirits Having Flown\\", it is clearly Barry who dominates the lead vocals.  As for the instrumentals, the Bee Gees continue the orchestral, R&B, and funk influences found on \\"Children of the World\\".   They also continue the use of horns, but this time bring in some of the best horn players in the business -  James Pankow, Walter Parazaider and Lee Loughnane from the band Chicago.    Here is a track by track review of this collection:    \\"Tragedy\\":  While not as heavy a Disco sound as found on \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", this song contains all of the electricity of the Bee Gees Disco Era work.  The Bee Gees make use of sound effects simulating an \\"explosion\\" toward the end of the sound..Ultimately, it is Barry's falsetto that helps bring out this intensity making for an all-time classic sound.    \\"Too Much Heaven\\":   This song slows things down to more of a ballad pace.  While on the prior track, Barry's falsetto helps exemplify the electricity of that fast-paced song, this time the falsetto helps exemplify the softness of the ballad.  The Chicago horns section also plays a key role in the orchestral qualities.    \\"Love You Inside Out\\": Classic track and one of the band's best.   This song employs a both a funk influence and a orchestral-like sound.  Once again it's Barry's falsetto that comes to the top as I think it as good as it gets on this track.    \\"Reaching Out\\":  Another softer sound.   Barry has more trademark falsetto and does a good job building it up toward the end of the track.    \\"Spirits (Having Flown)\\": A worthy-title track and a very underrated song by the band. I like the acoustic-sounding guitar on this song.   Definitely not a Disco track, but still an outstanding track.  Barry does a great job with the falsetto on the chorus.  Also a nice use of flutes.    \\"Search, Find\\":  While Barry's falsetto is alive and well, this time it is the Chicago horns that really help this track stand out.    \\"Stop (Think Again)\\":  Barry opens this track with a near a cappella falsetto.  The Chicago horns and the use of the keyboards will later supplement this song with an R&B feel.    \\"Living Together\\": The Chicago horns once again come through in top-notch fashion as they open this song.   Barry's falsetto doesn't lose any momentum - however this time Robin comes through with some spot-on vocals.    \\"I'm Satisfied\\":  Not the strongest track, but not a bad one.  More of Barry's falsetto and more Chicago horns.  Once again the use of the flute is employed.    \\"Until\\": No horns on this song as basically Barry's voice is showcased (with some falsetto at the end).   His voice compliments some very nice harp-like sounds.    This is the remastered album.  The liner notes did not include any lyrics, but they did include the musician credits.  Overall, this collection showcases how the Bee Gees go \\"beyond Disco\\" with the orchestral sound and using Barry Gibb's falsetto perfectly.  Highly recommended.
B0002XH9Z4|4.0|There is only one bad thing that I can say about this box set and that it wasn't hand delivered by Michael himself!    All your favourites are here plus some gems that you didn't know you were missing. The booklet is great and although the DVD element has been released  on it's own it's still a winner in my eyes.    It comes in an impressive fold-out case that towers above any neighbouring CD's or DVD's you have displayed.    Do yourself a favour and get your hands on it. Show your friends and feel even better about what you scored...    Gonz    Sydney, Australia
B00005221M|4.0|Ok, so the story does digress from the book.  I don't care.  Three guys in great shape running through the wilderness, good story, great romance.  Romance that wasn't in your face graphic, but sublte, implied.  Just like the John Wayne movies.  I love this movie.  I saw it in the theater, wore out my copy on video and I especially enjoy this version on DVD. This story is that good.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I remember going to a party a long time ago when the host gathered everyone into the family room to watch a video.  He told us you just have to see this.  It was the first episode of Fawlty Towers I ever saw.  I was hooked.  John Cleese is simply the funniest comedian EVER.  It's too bad they only made 12 of these.  Think of this as the Black Knight from Holy Grail versus his batty wife, hotel guests, and hotel staff in a rural hotel setting.  Hilarious from start to end, it's just the best comedy ever produced. \\"OH! It's my fault, is it?\\"
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I didn't see this movie when it was released, I first saw it in 2007.  I paid attention to the critics. Wrong move.<br />Remember how boring Homer was when you studied it in high school? Add the right actors, the special effects and one of the greatest fight scenes (Achilles vs Hector)since the Ray Harryhausen Sinbad flicks and you have a great movie.  This film boasts a whose who of leading men/character actors and is a Lord of the Rings reunion.  The only reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars was Brad Pitt's crumby accent. However, his physique and fighting skills do redeem him. Get the DVD, don't settle for the edited version shown on tv.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I saw this tour live.  This is a terrific DVD showing the band at this stage of their lives.  David Gilmour is just mesmerizing with his guitar work. The special effects, once again, show why Pink Floyd has always been the best when seen in concert. Don't miss this!
0393327655|2.0|As a non-believer, I share most of the arguments made by Harris in this book. But having been brought up a catholic, the first thing that strikes me in this book is Harris' lack of knowledge about the subject he's attacking. If you wish to attack the catholic faith, you can ask a catholic about what is it they believe. For this reason, I can't take his assertions about Islam seriously either. His direct attacks on particular faiths seem more a matter of zealotry, and an indication that Mr. Harris seems to take atheism as a faith in itself. Will we be seeing a Church of Universal Atheism or the like sometime soon?    The book also shows a very ugly side of Atheism in Mr. Harris' justification of the Bush Doctrine, especially the \\"War on Terror\\". He seems to have drunk the Kool-aid: War on a tactic?. How can a rational thinker as Mr. Harris likes to present himself buy this propaganda, not much different from the religious irrationality he so fervently attacks in the book? Are we supposed to replace one faith with another one?    He twists a naturalist argument to oppose pacifism and to justify and at some moments, even applaud the use of torture. Certainly, Harris is preaching a new faith, just as intolerant as the other ones.    If you are a non-believer looking for great thinkers on the subject, you'll do better avoiding the likes of Harris and of Christopher Hitchens. Atheism does not ned to be a faith, and much less, a unified one.

B000YDOOU0|5.0|Guitarist Pat Metheny gets together with what he calls \\"two of the best people on earth\\"; drummer Antonio Sanchez and bassist Christian McBride - all three of them geniuses in their respective fields, if you ask me - for this beautiful set of 10 songs lasting just over one hour. I often find myself searching for words when reviewing any Pat Metheny project. What's there to say anyway, apart from, it's stunningly beautiful and just as good as (if not better than) I expected it to be? It is very true though, that no new musical ground is broken on this disc - hence the \\"more of the same\\" comment by a previous reviewer; a comment I tend to agree with - but that doesn't bother me much. I don't think I could ever get bored of music by Pat Metheny and the album loses no stars from me as a result.<br /><br />Metheny plays electric guitar for the most, only choosing acoustic guitar on the thinly veiled political lament \\"Is This America? (katrina 2005)\\", on which McBride takes a bow to his bass, and then again on \\"Dreaming Trees\\". He also plays his trademark guitar synth on \\"When We Were Free\\", a cover of a song that originally appeared on the Pat Metheny Group 1996 album [[ASIN:B000F8DB4Y Quartet]] and again on \\"The Red One\\", another one I've heard before on [[ASIN:B000005GWE I Can See Your House from Here]], the 1994 album Pat made with John Scofield. Sanchez and McBride make sure the covers work, in that they both actually add something new to the originals, which were pretty awesome to begin with. Kudos to them.<br /><br />The guitar/bass/drums trio format has always been my favourite of them all and this particular trio has not let me down. Pick this up if you're a Metheny fan or just interested in sampling some good jazz guitar. It's worth every penny.<br /><br />One question though, Pat: When's the next PMG album due? It's been three years already!
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Not a bad movie.  I bought this as a gift for a Sci-Fi fan.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|\\"Peerless\\" is not a word I get to use very often but I use it in reference to this band with no hesitation whatsoever. I think of a number of my favourite pop/rock bands - and no, I won't be naming them - and while it's my view that all of them are brilliant in their own way, none of them come close to what Radiohead have managed to achieve both with their music and their videos. They're totally unique and they do 'unique' excellently on this album.<br /><br />I suppose everyone's heard the story behind this particular album by now: The band walked away from their record company and what they accurately described as a \\"decaying business model\\" (Thom Yorke allegedly mouthing a few choice expletives on the way out) and decided it might be fun to release their new album on download, inviting fans to pay whatever they wanted for it. The fun quickly went out of the idea when a considerable number of fans decided they wanted to pay sod all, which though perhaps unsurprising, is a really huge shame, considering how good the album actually is. In any event, the album subsequently became available on CD - good news for download/MP3-phobics such as myself - and here we are.<br /><br />None of the songs on here immediately jumped out and grabbed me by the throat in the same way \\"Creep\\" (from [[ASIN:B000002UR7 Pablo Honey]]) or \\"Street Spirit\\" ([[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]]) or \\"Karma Police\\" ([[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]]) or \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" ([[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]]) or even the entire first half of [[ASIN:B000092ZYX Hail To The Thief]] did (I know I'm in a small minority on that one) but while the songs on here are all what I call 'slow growers', almost the entire album has grown on me - and in a big way. This is a big improvement on previous albums, where I often find myself reaching for the fast forward button (except, maybe for \\"Kid A\\").<br /><br />Overall favourites include: \\"15 Step\\" (almost jazzy in its delivery); \\"Nude\\" (simply dreamy); \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\" (makes me want to dance); \\"All I Need\\" (I love the way the piano kicks in around the middle there); \\"Faust Arp\\" (acoustic guitar and strings - pure heaven); \\"House of Cards\\" (as naked a love song as I've ever heard); \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" (nice choice for lead single; a great introduction to the album and the closest thing to 'typical' Radiohead on here).<br /><br />The only tracks I'm still struggling with are \\"Bodysnatchers\\" and \\"Videotape\\" but I have no doubt I'll get them in the long run.<br /><br />And I haven't even mentioned the lyrics yet.<br /><br />So what do I have here? Major chords? Feel good numbers? More than two accessible tunes on the same album? The total lack of songs that could accompany or even induce a major depression? The dudes have outdone themselves IMHO, for real. It's Radiohead but not as I knew them. So much less existential angst. But it's all good.<br /><br />So if you're looking for some great (if unusual) music that will force you to pay attention and make you think, look no further. Get this.ant to dance); \\"All I Need\\" (I love the way the piano kicks in around the middle there); \\"Faust Arp\\" (acoustic guitar and strings - pure heaven); \\"House of Cards\\" (as naked a love song as I've ever heard); \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" (nice choice for lead single; a great introduction to the album and the closest thing to 'typical' Radiohead on here).

B000WTBMBK|4.0|I'm not a big listener of dubstep or anything close to it, and I only got this because of its wide critical acclaim.  I wasn't disappointed, because as far as minimalist dance music you can't actually dance to goes, it's pretty enjoyable.  The best thing about the album is the atmosphere.  It's definitely meant to be listened to with headphones or in a car.  Simple beats and well placed bass make up the backbone, while sparse but gripping, haunting ambient elements creep in and wrap the tunes into a sometimes off-putting, sometimes comforting cocoon.  There are a lot of vocal elements, but they're all played with in some way, changed in pitch, interrupted, distorted, so that the normally beautiful singing turns into something different that only enhances the strangeness of the music.    There's a good flow to the album.  Most tracks sound similar, but different enough to distinguish them while listening.  It may be difficult to remember which one is which, but while it's playing through, every song has some unique element or hook that will make you think \\"Oh yeah, that's in this song.  I like it.\\"  Variety isn't exactly the record's strength, although someone more into the style might see more to it, and it doesn't have to be.  It's definitely not something I'd recommend individual songs from, it really should be listened to all the way through.  Some of my favorite songs are \\"Archangel\\" for its vocal melody, \\"Etched Headplate\\" for the dissonance of the bass with the rest of the beat, \\"Shell of Light\\" for its relatively uplifting nature, \\"Homeless\\" for its awesomeness, but really every track has something making it worth listening too.  Check it out if only for something different.

1594489505|5.0|I finished this book in three days and when I closed the cover I wept.  I have not read a story this tragic and so richly desparate in decades. I marvel over a male author's ability to capture the essence of female life in any culture but to have depicted the lives of these Muslim women so vividly and having endeared you to them so readily is a wonder.  I would recommend this book to anyone but be warned that your feelings about life in America will take on new meaning.  My tears upon the close of the book are attributed to overwhelming feelings of self-sacrifice, love for another human being and joy at the grace we are given each day.
B000V1Y43W|4.0|This was my first Blu-ray movie. I bought it because I read it was one of the best showcases of the technology and damn were they right! The digital transfer is top-notch, the picture is crystal clear and the sound is great (too bad I don't own a FullHD set nor a sound system that supports uncompressed sound signals).I must add that unlike 'Ratatouille' the movie plays just fine in an European Blu-ray disc player (I'm from Europe).  The bad? The product info is wrong, this edition doesn't feature French nor Spanish subtitles, so Amazon should update the product specs. It must've been a last minute decision as the distributor had to include an additional cardboard insert (over the original cover) with updated technical info that does reflect the lack of these features.  Must buy!

B00008NRL8|4.0|This is great Tango dance music. I first heard a cut of it when our ballroom dance teacher used it . It was what I call a techno Tango number titled: Santa Maria(del Buen Ayre). If that doesn't put passion to your Tango as you dance with your partner, then nothing will. I had to have it and have never regretted it. Great music!
0061142026|5.0|THIS MOVIE, THOUGH IT'D SEEM A \\"REGULAR\\" FAIRY TALE, MANAGES TO PRODUCE A FRESH PLOT WITH ENOUGH TWISTS TO KEEP YOU WONDERING UNTIL THE VERY END.

B00007KWHG|4.0|After seeing the stage musical Jersey Boys, I had to have their greatest hits CD! The music has more significance than a nostalgia ride for this child of the early 1960's.

0194001067|3.0|Hi :    Good CD companion, specially the \\"Wordfinder\\". A very negative point is that the wheel mouse doesn't scroll the screen down (I am using windows vista)    The word \\"stinging\\" is not present both in the printed and CD version of the dictionary.    I was using Longman LDOCE dictionary before and my motivation to buy Oxford was the \\"Wordfinder\\" CD feature, but I think the printed version of Longman is much better than the Oxford one.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|All I have to say is, Wow!  Great digital remaster transfer.  I'm pretty sure I've already done a review for the film years ago, but I'll just comment on the special edition picture quality itself.    The colors are richer and deeper, dark and light variations are more pronounced, and the picture looks crisper.  Also less artifacts...Great for people like me who still have Standard Definition TV's and DVD Players.    Over the course of 2 weeks, I watched the original presentation 3 times, and the new special edition 3 times as a reference.    Oh yeah, the sound is just as good as before too.
0307388840|1.0|If you would like to be mesmerized by flowery and lengthy prose than this book may be for you. But for most of us this book is a complete waste of time. The uneventful and dull plot only serves as a medium for lengthy descriptions of scenes and circumstances. Just about everything about this book is unbelievable and unrealistic. For this book to have worked, it should have had 4 times as many pages, where the writer could have created some interesting story lines.  I wish I had not fallen for the hype...
B000ZLFALI|5.0|After watching this movie a couple of times and checking out the five documentaries on the supplementary disc, I'm more in love with it than ever. Discovering the Beatles was an important event in my childhood, and now rediscovering the substance of the songs through Julie Taymor's eyes confirms their importance to me as world-class composers. The shock of discovery and rediscovery is everywhere in this film, partially due to the perfect casting. Taymor has picked neophytes and non-actors for key roles; Evan Rachel Wood as Lucy is the only recognizable star (aside from cameos by musical legends like Bono and Joe Cocker). These young people are able to imagine the Sixties and the revolutionary spirit of that period from an age and a point of view where that revolution indeed seems possible. Across the Universe is no musty acid trip down nostalgia lane, but a tightly-conceived musical drama in which the Beatles' classic songs are wedded to an internally-consistent storyline; Taymor does the nearly unthinkable trick of making us believe the songs were written to be sung by these characters. Taymor's background in fine arts, Balinese puppetry, dance and drama infuses every frame with a startling originality--to take just one example, the scene in which American soldiers trample Vietnamese palm trees, wearing only underwear and hoisting on their shoulders the Statue of Liberty as \\"I Want You/She's So Heavy\\" plays on the soundtrack...it's enough to take your breath away. At a time when technical wizardry can manifest almost any visual the mind can imagine, it's refreshing to be reminded that it's the concept, not just the dizzying eye candy, that's most important. This is a movie that will endure.
0719062683|5.0|This book was a supplemental text for my Graduate level Critical Theory class, and I thank my prof for that every time I open it up.  Barry's writing is incredibly accessible -- even inviting, and,at times, humorous.  He breaks down most of the major theorists' important and influential works into their key points (which are often buried under obtuse and circular language in the works themselves) and (briefly) applies them to well-known pieces of literature to show how theory is \\"done\\".  Even for those of us who are \\"into\\" theory, writers like Derrida, Spivak, and Lacan can be intimidating; Barry helps the reader get beyond that and deep into the core of critical theory. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to broaden their understanding of literary theory, and I definitely recommend it new students who find themselves overwhelmed or intimidated by theory.

B000793EG6|3.0|I'm a fan of The Byrds, but overall I'm not very impressed with this record. Elements of it are cheesy / lacking the depth present in their other releases. There are a good tracks, but much of it is unremarkable. Crosby is part of the band at this point in time, which is good, but I still find it lacking. My favorite tracks are Thoughts and Words, Why, and Girl With No Name.<br /><br />Over time, I've come gain a bit more respect for this record, so I've revised this review to reflect that. However, I still am not overly impressed by it.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I've seen all of Michael Moore's movies and I've read all of his books but none have touched me in the way that Sicko has.  First off, I want to say that I am so thankful that I'm Canadian.  I could not imagine getting sick in the US and not being able to pay for my healthcare or fight with an insurance company in what seems like a lose-lose battle.<br />I work in the Emergency Department of a hospital, actually I work in the ER at one of the hospitals featured in the movie.  This movie actually brought me to tears when I saw how people were treated and forced to make decisions they shouldn't have to make.<br />It was disturbing to see a 79 year old man who is forced to work just so he can pay for medication for both himself and his wife.  Or the man who accidentally cut off two of his fingers and had to make a decision which finger to save because he couldn't afford both.  People shouldn't have to make those kinds of decisions.  Care \\"doesn't depend on your premiums, it depends on your needs,\\" the film reports. You don't have to check your health security at the door, or mortgage your future when at your most sick and vulnerable.  I can only hope this movie wakes some people up, especially those flag waving people who keep on repeating slogans like \\"greatest country in the world\\" etc.  You can demand for universal health care, and you can vote for it.
B000NMZFKK|4.0|\\"Legends of the Fall\\" is a movie that I saw years ago, when it first came out, and I still remember it and still consider it one of the best movies I've ever seen. Brad Pitt is at his very best, as are all the actors in the film, and the story is so interesting that there is no way you'll want to miss a minute of it.  It is outstanding in all ways and doesn't disappoint in any way. I highly recommend it.
B00030590I|3.0|Hero is a visually impressive production on a grand scale. The cinematography and visual effects are worth watching for themselves, as are exquisitely choreographed fight scenes (including many flying dance moves). The plot is for the most part effective (comprising three different versions of the same events) but lacks the emotional depth of \\"Crouching Tiger.\\" But by far the worst element of the film is its feebly disguised Chinese propaganda, in which a tyrant is allowed to go on conquering because his destruction and war on neighbouring provinces ultimately unites China into \\"one land,\\" i.e. the good of the many outway the good of the few. This is little more than a weak justification for China's contemporary geopolitical designs and sours an otherwise entertaining flick.
B000A2H812|4.0|They are Feisty, have a Zest for life and have blended different kinds of music into one big original sound. Their lyrics are not too shabby, not shabby at all. Have to say that I am very happy knowing this band and own two of their albums, this one and I forgot the name for the one they released after. Both very good purchases. They are original and that counts for a lot of my respect. When they get going is a brilliant display of talent. These guys are the real deal, worth every dollar. Highly entertaining and their message is one that screams: Enjoy Life, Enjoy Music and it will all work out for the better. 4 shinning stars for Gogol Bordello /Gypsy Punks Underdog World Strike!

B0002OXVDW|5.0|I bought this DVD set after seeing some of these segments on cable.  It is fascinating to hear the background of the performers who are now legendary talents and to see them performing very early in their careers.  If you like vintage Hollywood musicals and the silver screen stars that made them, this is a must-see set.
B00005JOHC|5.0|When you compare this decades' comedy smash hit Two and a half Men with the sexually themed 70's comedy Three's Company which was a funny show in it's heyday. Two and a half Men has the most creative and funniest comedy script that I have heard in a long long time. The actors and actresses in the show are hilarious and every one of them has their own unique sense of humor so it is hard to pick a favorite character from the show. You will no doubt encounter hours of laughter from this 1st season and the laughs are just as funny when replayed again and again. I highly recommend this DVD set.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is a must have for Blade Runner Fans. Great documentaries! Collector case is cool! Ridley Scott's final cut is very well done.
B00005JKQ6|5.0|I saw this movie as a young teenager in the mid 70's.  I only saw it once, and it has stuck with me for 30+ years.  The ending left me scratching my head - but it conveyed the meaning quite clearly.  Nothing was as it seemed - much time had passed - and the world as Burt Lancaster's character - was no more.  See it for yourself in order to understand why the majority of people that have reviewed this film think so highly of it!  I rate this movie - 5 stars!  Kudos to Mr. Lancaster!!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Great show... but life got in the way of viewing... cheerfully went to Amazon to find the DVD so that I could finish viewing the series... and was dismayed to find that it isn't offered.  Come on AMC!
B00003CXXS|4.0|I liked the action and the new animals. At points, you didn't know what to expect next. I would recommend it to anyone who has seen Jurassic Park or Lost World
B000OVLBGC|5.0|The Lives of Others is a really interesting story of the lives of artists who dared to dream of freedom, love and happiness under the fascism that existed in East Germany during the 80s. The story follows the life of the Stasi's (their Secret Police) best intel guy. He's charged with finding some damning evidence to destroy a writer, who's wife is sought by a party big-wig.     Little does our hero know that during the course of his mission he will find himself identifying with those he is charged to destroy. He reads their books, listens to their music, and follows the love that they share. Throughout it all he gains several opportunities to complete his mission, but he finds himself unable to. He cares about these people, and the climax at the end demonstrates his commitment to his conscience.     Overall its a powerful film, stunningly emotional, and very real. It harkens a dark future for those of us in the United States, as well as Britain - where surveillence of the populace has become the norm. Warrantless Wiretapping, Secret Courts and Concentration camps have become 'necessary' in the 'war on terror'. All these items and countless others - have the classic sign of fascism, and this film may give us an idea what our future holds if we don't Wake Up.
074356619X|5.0|After years of study, I find The Secret to be one of the best messages I've ever read. It breaks down the stratigies to a better life and gives the reader a sense of total empowerment. You really can control EVERYTHING in your life. You really can have the life you've only dreamed of. The Secret shares the secret to how to make it happen NOW.
B00008PW3O|5.0|I love this album - just love it. Five years after its release, I find myself motivated to write this review.<br /><br />As detailed in the excellent Destiny Rules dvd, this was originally intended to be a double album, but to keep prices down, Lindsey Buckingham agreed to pare it down (just a little - as the final product is 18 songs and over 70 minutes long) to a single disc. The deluxe edition has a couple other excellent studio songs and two well-done live versions of songs from the album.<br /><br />Though there was a long gap between the last time Buckingham recorded with Nicks, Fleetwood, and Mac, the musicians were hardly idle, working on other projects. Nicks was the most prolific in her solo career, but Buckingham's Out of the Cradle made up for in quality what his solo career lacked in quantity.<br /><br />Say You Will is often criticized for being a Buckingham solo album mixed together with a Stevie Nicks solo album, and it's a valid point. Much of the cd was, in fact, recorded before Nicks was brought into the fold, making it a Fleetwood Mac affair rather than a Buckingham solo album, but (despite Christine McVie not wanting to participate) the Fleetwood Mac-ness really comes through on Stevie's contributions. No matter how good her solo work has been, from the brilliant early stuff on Bella Donna to the excellent Trouble in Shangri-La, the fact remains: No one can play with her like Buckingham, Fleetwood, and Mac. They know how to add muscle to her tunes when it's needed, or to gently back her on her quieter numbers. Just listen to that guitar part on Destiny Rules. Or the beautiful music of Goodbye Baby. Really amazing stuff. And, for her part, simply adding her backing vocals to songs like Miranda and Bleed to Love Her elevate them in a way that no other singer could.<br /><br />What's great about this cd is that it's Fleetwood Mac, but it's modern. It's not a rehashing of any of their albums. The only thing this album has in common with Tusk is length. It doesn't sound like their inspired 70s work, or have the gloss of their 80s albums. The members of the band weren't some oldies act trying to recapture a little of that old feeling. Instead, they made a vital, endlessly interesting album that hasn't been out of my regular rotation in the five years I've had it.inspired 70s work, or have the gloss of their 80s albums.

0066620996|5.0|This book was so good that my company made it required reading for the entire management team. The case studies they provided were fantastic. What I appreciated most, is that it provided SPECIFICS for taking our company to the next level -- not just a bunch of philosophy!
0307383415|5.0|This book provides an unvarnished view into Barack Obama the person. The book is as inspiring as the man. Read about history in the making.
B00030590I|4.0|The cinematography in this film is breathtaking. The fight scenes are spectacular in that \\"people are flying around the room\\" sort of way. The plot twists are unexpected and interesting. Fans of movies like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and House of Flying Daggers would enjoy this film.
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|This is an amazing album, not as great as \\"the phantom agony\\", but I like the direction that the band has taken. The growls are excellent and gives Epica what they want, to stay away from the commercial bands and pseudo gothic bands like evanescence. Mark Jansen said this is the path Epica will follow no matter if people like it or not, for me its ok because the growls mixed with Simone's voice makes the music faraway from evanescence music style that is becoming more and more popular and boring.
B000WZAE0Y|4.0|I wouldn't say that this is the best movie ever, but that isn't the point. Stardust is meant to make you feel good after you watch it, and it is very successful in this endeavor. This movie has pretty much everything- air pirates, magic, sword fights, love, witches, and many other wonderful things. This movie is for everyone. Also, coincidentally, many members of the cast of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels appear in this film.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Being a big Peter Pan fan (I saw it in the theater when it was first released back in 1952) and love this DVD.  Great clean up and restoration of the film yet, plus lots of goodies.  Great DVD and worth every penny for the Peter Pan Fan.
B0002V7O3I|4.0|This movie feeds the kid in all of us.  It's interesting watching Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix (what a loss) as young boys.  Both of my kids watched this when they were young boys.  My youngest, who's 24, asked for this for Christmas.  It's one of his all time favorites.      You can see the director's (Joe Dante) hand in the movie when the aliens make an appearance.  The movie could have really fallen apart at that point, but he really brings out their campy personalities (the aliens).  His direction made the movie fun.
0439882826|5.0|This pop up book is truly a work of magic.  Star Wars has never been seen like this.  A huge book over a foot thick, filled with many pop ups along with one big one for each page you turn.  And the fun thing is at the end.  The light sabers for Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker actually are made of plastic tubes that light up when you open the two smaller pop ups on the last page.  And the battery compartment is on the back cover and you can replace the batteries.  One of the best pop up books EVER!!!  If you love Pop Up Books, Star Wars and really neat surprises, then this is the book for you.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This box set is great! Also the customer service is second to none!  Because I had a problem with the delivery,and this was sorted out very quickly.  Really pleased.
B000002UZ1|4.0|I have been a Beatles fan since I was born. Unfortunately, I wasn't around when the Beatles where @ their peak but this album is a good introduction to their music. I am collecting all their album now but the Beatles Collection from 1967-1970 just made me appreciate them even more.
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin is probably the best cartoon movie ever made.  It is the story of a young man who tries to win the hand of an Arabian princess with the help of a genie.  There are conflicts with an evil vizier who tries to gain the genie's power and destroy Aladdin.  Action packed, fast paced, many twists and turns in the plot, fantastic animation (the old fashion kind), great music, romance, and humor.  Great characters.  Even like the villains.  In short, this movie has it all.  And strangely, this movie has more heart than the vast majority of so-called Romanic movies.  As an adult, I hate to admit it, but this is among my favorite movies.  It also makes a great gift for children.
0393061310|5.0|I was a geography major in college and I cannot understand why this was not a required read. I have such a better understanding of global development. This really alters the way you think about advanced civilazations versus those who that not developed. It is not the most captivating book, but it is a brillant read. You will come away enlightened.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I am an older reviewer who grew up with 50's,60's music(the best ever !).  I think this young group has a remarkably fresh yet to me an old sound too,  that takes me back to several groups.  I hear a little Kinks sound here which really draws me in.    Love em..just bought the cd or as I still like to say album.
B000056N8X|3.0|I first saw \\"Highlander: Endgame\\" when it released to theaters in the late summer of 2000.  The truth is I really was not impressed.  I thought 'the sanctuary' was a stupid idea and the movie, overall, was just a glorified episode from the television series.  Not to mention the whole 'power of two to beat one' angle -- could we have come up with a better reason to ice Conner MacLeod? If you remember the episode \\"Methos\\" from Highlander: the series, Methos offers his head to Duncan so he would have the strength to defeat Kalas -- sound familiar?  And if I remember correctly, the original release of Endgame ended with Duncan standing over Conner's grave then 'roll the credits'.  A new and very slightly improved ending is on the DVD.<br />Well, here we are nearly eight years later.  For some reason, their is a resurgence of my interest in the Highlander series.  I purchased a couple of the series volumes on DVD and, in addition, purchased Endgame just to see if I still felt the same way about it after all these years.  After viewing it again, I must say my opinion has changed.  While I do still think the storyline was weak for a theatrical release, it at least made sense.  Highlander: Endgame seemed to appeal to old and new audiences of the franchise by getting back to the basics: sword fights, beheadings, the quickening!  The movie also found away to rehash everything about the immortals' way of life.  This was a good strategy to capture the interests of new audiences who are not familiar with the Highlander mythology.  I still don't like the reasoning behind Conner MacLeod's death, but I do like the way the scene was presented.  If I was to change one thing, I would rather have Conner make an honest effort to kill his protege rather than he simply force Duncan to take his head.  That way this fight would've actually meant something beyond 'I'm tired of being immortal, but if you won't put me out of my misery, I will just have to make you.'<br />Now on to Jacob Kell. Not as impressive as the Kurgan.  Way more impressive than General Katana and the sorcerer Kane.  There's nothing really special about him accept he breaks all the rules.  All of them.  Even the one about holy ground.  There were some villians from the TV series that I found more interesting than Kell (Roland Cantos and Antonius Kalas to name a couple).<br />I give it three stars for holding my attention.  There was some good action from Kell's henchmen and some witty dialogue.  I'll admit it, I enjoyed it.  There, I said it.Not as impressive as the Kurgan.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Great pics and a good set to have. However the blu ray version does not have Disc 5 containing extras
0385333846|4.0|This book is just plain weird.  The main character is \\"unstuck\\" in time and lives events out-of-order.  There's an alien abduction, and he's taken to live in one of their zoos.  And there is no traditional conclusion, so we never get a nice wrapped-up story line.    However, Slaughterhouse-Five is laugh-out-loud funny in parts, such as when we get to hear an interpretation of the Bible by an alien researcher.  And for being a great work of literature, there's plenty of profanity, crude humor, sexual innuendo, and violence (death and detailed discussions of torture).    Overall, an entertaining read worth checking out.
B00049QQHI|4.0|THIS FILM WAS SHOWN TO PEOPLE IN EARLY RECOVERY.  THEY THOUGHT IT WAS REALISTIC AND GAVE A VERY GOOD SCENARIO OF RESULTS.
B000X3VN46|5.0|This is a brilliant album by any standard. I thoroughly enjoyed this album. Even AC's Poison is good considering a lot of other singers just did a repeat. This is a class act given the fact that this is an actual official first from Tarja. As her first solo, I could only sing praises for her. A much better album than NW's DPP.
0374280967|5.0|I gave Alan Bennett's Uncommon Reader to many friends at Christmastime. It is perfect for someone who wants a laugh and also knows a lot about modern fiction. The premise is that our present Queen of England Elizabeth II suddenly becomes an avid reader, and the consequences are hilarious. Prince Phillip, in all his incomprehension, has the funniest one-liners, but there are also scenes with nonplussed political heads of government and a memorable scene of a contemporary phobia.<br />  It's her famously unruly corgi dogs which originally get the Queen involved with books. \\"It's the dogs' fault,\\" she admits. The portrait of the Queen seems very possible, her misunderstandings realistic, her power very real. The surprise ending fulfills this book's unlikely premise.<br />  I highly recommend it. We need humor today. -- Olive Mullet
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Many have summarized the story, so I won't do that here. I thought this was a great read, a real page turner, and my heart was breaking at what happened (and not doubt is still happening) to women under the Taliban.  My only complaint, and this is a small one, is that it got a little preachy at the end.  The story itself gets the point across about the issues of what people are dealing with under these circumstances. There is no reason to be preachy.  But this is a small thing in comparison to how great the book is overall.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|one of the best movies of pixar....i see this movie in spanish...because i am MEXICANA....it was so funny..and the history have a good menssage of reflection..the sound in english and in spanish is awesome...i see this in 5.1 surround sound. the quality picture is one of the best in the market run this film in 1080p is a candy eye. u cant go wrong selecting this picture.
B00104W8T6|5.0|Juno is sure to be welcomed as a classic movie that sits on everyones dvd self at home. A fantastic movie.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|What a sick concept but compelling nonetheless. The movie's plot (backpackers looking for adventure) is a pretext for absolutely disgusting torture scenes. But you can't turn away as the film takes you on a journey into a nightmarish world of depravity.
0740748475|5.0|This complete Calvin and Hobbes collection is a boon for all who watched the depiction of an imaginative little boy's fantasies unfold.  Many of the former little boys who stumbled upon the strip, whether in the newspapers or in the periodic small collections, treasured it because Watterson got us right, if weird, just about every time.  Many of our own kids, taught right, learned to treasure Calvin and Hobbes, just as much.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I own all three and this one is the best for the reasons Ridley Scott explains at the beginning.  I suggest watching it and /or the others several times before watching the documentary.  You want the magic deep inside you before they show you how they pulled it off.  The story of how they made this incredible gem is amazing, as well as the techniques and human ingenuity, drive and dedication that was necessary to create Ridley Scott and Phillip Dick's world.  This movie is not just for the sci-fi crowd. An intelligent performance by Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer along with a very strong supporting cast makes this an experience you won't forget.
B00000612G|4.0|This album is so good, its an album that make you feel good at the end of a stressful day, open a bottle of wine and listen to this album and it will make the days hassel go away.  This album shows off richie's vocal range that bon jovi hasn't seen, richie proves that he is more than a back up singer. The feeling in this album is awersome and sometimes you feel like he is singing right to you, there is a lot of passion in some of the song like \\"fallen from graceland\\". This album is like Richie telling you a story from the first song on the album \\"made in America\\" to the last song \\"undiscovered soul\\", at the end of the album you feel like you have learn't a little bit about him that you might not have known before. open your heart, your mind and your ears, who knows he just might change your view on music.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Akira is frequently cited as the best Magna of all time. This is probably due to the barrage on the senses that lasts for well over 60 minutes in the second half of the movie which is a non-stop smash down of Neo-Tokyo done in the style of the day of reckoning.<br /><br />The story revolves around the mysterious Akira, which gives people special powers so dangerous that they can basically nuke buildings by thought alone.<br /><br />The film takes place in Neo-Tokyo where the government is using the military to shutdown a revolution that is taking place of the streets. Biker gangs cause chaos and are involved in constant reprisals. One gang of teens finds themselves becoming embroiled in a conspiracy involving a scientific experiment of a magnitude that threatens civilization as we know it.<br /><br />Not everybody is a fan of Akira the first time round but some of this movie's most ardent supporters found themselves suddenly taken aback by it only after subsequent viewings. Akira grows on you, and over the decades remains a classic example of how Manga changed all action movies forever.<br /><br />Akira is up there with the likes of Vampire Hunter D, Ninja Scroll and Ghost in a Shell, so if you are looking for the best of the best Manga, or even just outrageously good mayhem, then Akira is a must see.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is an amazing album.  All the songs have been separated down to the basic recorded tracks and digitally redone by George Martin (the original producer) and his son Giles (also a producer).  Additionally, many of the songs have been combined or had pieces of songs/demos added to the backgrounds with added segue ways between most of the songs.  What you get is a new Beatles experience that technically sounds fantastic.  These people who wrote bad reviews of this album just want the same old Beatles that you can get on the original albums.  If that is what you want, then buy the original albums & compilations.  If you want to hear the Beatles sounding technically clearer than ever before with slight differences here and there to spice things up, then buy this album.
B000026C1Q|4.0|Great album, but had to spend $2 shipping to discover this is NOT part of the new remaster series that the first 10 Alan Parsons albums have been going through.  The remaster of this album is currently scheduled for June '08.
B00004W221|3.0|Rudy (Special Edition)     Rudy was an inspiring movie based upon a true story that is an example of determination and perserverence.  Truly a classic.     However, I truly believe that this wonderful story fell from a perfect 10 to a lower number due to some of the phrases that defame the God who made life and accomplishment possible.
B000IONJH4|4.0|Frank Herbert's Dune series is a lot more than the origianl story for 1984 David Lynch film. 2-hour theatrical version is a nice starting point if you are not that deep sci-fi fans. Now you can have the extended version or 3-volume TV movie version with different cast of characters.<br /><br />What the movie connoisseirs must not overlook in this film is not the basic line of story which cannot be complete but the artworks, music and excellent works of acting done by the super British actors. TOTO also did the brilliant score music adding some rock vibe to the background music when the sandworms move. Artworks also are stellar blending well with modern gadget and classic European decor. Sting as an actor did brilliant acting and the last duel scene is a must-see part.<br /><br />Verdict: An entertaining adaptation of Frank Herbert's huge saga.<br />Rating: 88 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Casual movie fans, TOTO and Sting fans.
B00000IQW5|5.0|If Steven Spielberg has produced/directed a bettter group of actors & actresess - I haven't seen it. Richard Dryfues - Holly Hunter - John Goodman, What the heck? Magnificent! Even Brad Johnson has an Oscar winning performance.Time will be kind to this production - a classic!
B000N6TYLW|4.0|Thank you Amazon lam in Australia and i received my purchase in a quick and speed method it was at my home in less than 10day again thank you
B000005YZM|5.0|Man, this is probably my favorite album of all time. Wonderfully psychadelic (trust me!) and the music is so harmonious with lasting melodies. This album influenced many bands (all the way to Superdrag!) and i believe it will inspire you as well. IT'S THE BOMB!
B0000AOWNA|5.0|I just finished watching this DVD performance of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits musicians on their tour in 1993. No, I didn't purchase the DVD for $116 plus change as I am not a millionaire.  I watched it on Netflix.  I hope to be able to purchase this DVD as it is a priceless reminder of superb musical skill, and yes it is true there were a few favorites left out such as Sultans of Swing, but the intensity of the perfomances were remarkable.  If you can afford it buy it.  It's a classic.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|You've heard it before and I guess your gona hear it again. Things pick in this 3rd season in a big and nice way. I rarely watch TV anymore so it's DVD seasons for me. Simply put, each year it gets better and better.    I'm a Stargate fan from the word go regardless. Be it SG-1 or Atlantis, if your a fan of the gates and you want sci-fi, then this season is a no brainer. I've seen nit picking on characters, what they coulda, shoulda, have been, have done, or have said and I respect this, it's opinion. I know I could not create better, and I have never looked at a character in this series and said, \\" now thats a dumb move, or what an idiot, as I do for many other movies or programs. That in itself is a fairly large compliment to the shows writers.    I can't wait for the 4th season! (on dvd!!!!)
B000VBJEFK|4.0|The movie is pretty good and the soundtrack is great. Typical Disneyfare. My 10 year old enjoyed it thoroughly.
0143038419|1.0|When I opened this book, I identified immediately and felt comforted. Then she got into the Bush bashing and it ruined the whole thing for me. I didn't finish the book and I felt really bad about it. I can only say -\\"shut up and write.\\" I'm not interested in your political opinions.
B000QEILLK|4.0|This may be as much a rant as a review......Are you people out of your mind? This is a treasure of a band.They have as much claim to the continued growth and resurgence of Progressive Rock as anyone.All I read is this could be better or that one doesn't hold my interest.                                                                                                                I won't analyze or \\"overanalyze\\" the individual songs on this set. Suffice to say that there is plenty of great stuff here. For anyone new to this band, there is enough to pique your interest for further research into their massive output of work.I am aware that everyone is a critic these days, but give me a break! These guys make some incredible music and will continue to so. LONG LIVE THE FLOWER KINGS!!!!!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you have an HD ready TV, you can discover the possibilities of your TV with this documental. Is a great experience to enjoy. It has marvellous images. You can imagine you stay in that enviromental really.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|If you like the sound of a pistol then you should not miss that movie which has excellent 7.1 DTS sound and superior HD picture quality...and BE CAREFULL......!...US made has Region A code that means you cannot play it on any kind of European BR players...
B00006CXSS|5.0|There's not much more that needs to be said.  Hold this up to other celebrated war movies: Patton, Paths of Glory, A Walk in the Sun, Twelve O'Clock High, Bridge on the RIver Kwai, The Longest Day, Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Battleground, the list goes on.  I greatly admire all of those movies, and do not intend to diminish them in any sense.      While arguably Band of Brothers may not be considered a \\"movie\\" since it is a series of smaller, great movies, perhaps it is better described as the best depiction of war on film ever produced.  I don't think that's overdoing it.      Without the experience of making Saving Private Ryan, a great war movie (in sections) in its own right, the Speilberg/Hanks team could not have perfected their vision manifest in Band of Brothers.  Acting, dialogue, direction, cinematography, interview footage, music -- particularly the music -- are all excellent and intertwined to near perfection.
630469654X|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since I was little.  Great story, Great Acting, a little dated, but still enjoyable
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I watched all the seasons non-stop, disc after disc, I was mad, happy, sad, and so tense I almost threw-up, this is a non-stop thrill ride, you get so into all the characters, the acting so freakin' convincing!! You will never regret your choice to buy this box! It is the best thing I have ever watched!!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Catan is a very fun and addicting game. This version is great, easy to setup. However the instruction booklet doesn't do a very good job on telling you exactly how to proceed with setup, or gameplay.  For instance, what happens when a 7 is rolled, and you have more than 7 cards in your hand, and how a player proceeds to steal a resource from another.    The toughest part is finding people to play who have never played, and getting them to make it past all the initial rules, and understanding of gameplay.    Overall, this game sells itself, and thankfully, xbox live's version of this has made it a national game phenomenon.
1416960953|4.0|This book was extremley missleading , we have the orignal Aurther Spiderwick's field guide to the fantastical world around you which is FANTASTIC! but this says it is the movie 'tie -in edition' so I thought it would have picture etc relating to the movie , but the cover is different and the book inside is exactly the same as the origin,which is a wonderful book so if you havent already got it ,its great ,but  dont be mistaken like me and expect a different book and end up with 2 the same and a dissappointed child
159562015X|4.0|The best part of this book was the ability to take the Clifton Strengthsfinder.  It is a very good assessment to help you make yourself and your coworkers more productive.  It also helps you understand the people you work with a little better.  If you read Now, Discover Your Strengths, I would pass on Strengthsfinder 2.0.  It seemed to be very similar.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Having lived through the Beatlemania pandemic...and surviving, I waited with baited breath for this movie's release.  I enjoyed it all alone at first; then took my granddaughter and her friends to see it.  I was absolutely amazed at how Julie Taymor incorporated all the aspects of that turbulent time into one film: the idealistic innocence of the Lennon-McCartney lyrics that became synonymous with young love; the evolution of more acrimonious slurs at government and society in general that paralleled the thoughts of enlightened youth; and the yearning desire to \\"tune in, turn on and drop out\\" with mind-expanding drugs.  Some pure Hippies formed their own \\"mini\\" societies by establishing communues where everyone lived together, worked together, played together and ate and slept together...almost an Amish type of separation from the popular culture, although it grew perversely out of control (Bono as \\"Dr. Robert\\").  Other factions of the movement literally moved around, much like Jude, on a quest to find a father, a better life, the land of milk and honey.  The 60's was an era where it was still safe to hitchhike across the country, crashing whereever you found space, and moving on when the impulse hit you, much like Kerouac and Ginsberg.  Sometimes it was your fate to feel the sting of Cupid's arrow and take root.  Beatles music was the soundtrack for the era, (nothing fabricated there) and I love the way Ms. Taymor incorporated real life drama with almost ridiculous humor, (the scene where the soldiers are carrying Lady Liberty to the tune of \\"She's So Heavy\\").  But such were the times: a mixture of the harsh realities of war (young men offered up on a skewer for an unknown objective); and the idealistic innocence of youth(s) not ready to die before they've really lived, and resorting to mind-expanding drugs that would sometimes take you to \\"Strawberry Fields\\" where you would lay in the grass and watch the sky (\\"Because\\").  But sometimes they would take you to the other end of the spectrum where the atrocities of war were rightly exaggerated in your mind(\\"Helter Skelter\\").<br /><br />This movie is very effective in conveying the somewhat romantic/existential connection a generation had with the ever-evolving music and lyrics of the Beatles; and how their music was the backdrop for all of us, growing up together, and trying to make sense of our co-existence. I hope it will find its way to the video shelves of every American home, alongside \\"Grease\\" (50's), \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" (war games) and \\"The Big Chill\\" (60's kids all grown up and alive with dead dreams).<br /><br />Although there were some aspects of the film that I found to be a bit sappy, like the tongue-in-cheek remark about Prudence coming in through the bathroom window; and the attempt to cram too many icons of the era into one storyline (Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix prototypes), those scenes and characters were believable enough to hold the attention of the younger audience.<br /><br />My granddaughter and her friends did not fully understand the intensity with which I related to this film; but they loved the storyline and the music. Alas, Beatlemania lives on; but in this era of yet another war, we can only hope that the mantra of \\"All You Need is Love\\" will be nurtured in our hearts and carried to the four corners of the earth, \\"Across the Universe.\\"ther end of the spectrum where the atrocities of war were rightly exaggerated in your mind(\\"Helter Skelter\\").

Some of the catchiest tunes that I have ever heard, probably a little inappropriate in some, but you can hardly find a CD or movie without language these days unless you want to go pure Gospel and Religious.

If I only liked the track Still of The Night this disc would still be worth it but Sykes slashes and burns throughout the disc. And his guitar tone is monster! And I say this as a drummer, not a guitar player, that's how impressive Sykes is. You wanna hear some fierce guitar work then this CD is the real deal. Air guitar alert!!<br />[...]
0486211045|5.0|If your a Bridgeman fan or just want to learn how to draw anatomy this book is worth the price. I have been drawing longer than I can remeber but just recently decided I wanted to improve my art skills mainly my ability to draw the human body. So I started buying art books on human anatomy and this by far is my favorite one and heres why, its at a comfortable size so you can easily take it with you, it has close to 500 illustrations, and his style is helpful to me most when I'm drawing from memory. For its price I highly recommend it.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|If you want a high quality financial calculator I doubt you can do any better than this one. Admittedly I am an HP calculator fan from long ago. RPN is more logical and fewer keystrokes than an algebraic calculator. This calculator also includes a vey good quality manual with lots of solved examples of how to use the various functions. Admittedly I'll likely not solve a problem involving 80 cash flows on a calculator (but use a spreedsheet) but I use it for quick time value of money type of stuff. I works great.     One sign of our times, I have an HP 11C scientific calculator from the early 80s. The 12C is the financial version of the same calculator. The original was made is USA. This one, recently manufactured, is made in China.
B001041JLE|5.0|This album is outstanding and genius (as always).  The deluxe edition has such crystal clear photographs with a gold cd and dvd.  Michael even writes a little somethin' to the fans.  Now I can watch Thriller on my tv anytime of day and love it even more.  Thanks Michael, one day I know I will get to meet you, if not, then only in my dreams (and on the deluxe edition cover).  YOU ROCK MY WORLD and anyone who says different can just BEAT IT!!
B000BT97AO|5.0|This is a magnificent movie-- for those who are fans of Jim Henson (ie Labyrinth, Dark Crystal) you will not be disappointed.  The visual effects are dazzling, and much more up-to-date than other classic Henson films.  The only reason I suggest a little hesitation to viewers is that the plot is not so one-tracked as the others.  Although you will be drawn in by this movie, it doesn't suggest in the first ten minutes or so what the plot is about; if that doesn't deter your interest, then 100% I say go for it! :)
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|After seeing both versions of Kingdom of Heaven (Original and director's cut) I have to agree - the difference is like night and day.  The original felt incomplete.  The director's cut version that I just purchased is FAR superior (and not just because it's significantly longer - by about 50 minutes).  It tells a much more complete story, fleshing out more of the characterizations.  Deleted scenes include an additional 30 minutes not used in either version, so you can see what an epic vision Ridley Scott had in mind.  It's truly sad that so many people didn't understand this movie.  Everyone's entitled to their opinion of course, but many didn't give it a chance either.  Take a look at this version and see!
B000FC13Y0|2.0|This starts off really well. The first half is light and intriguing, opening lots of possibilities of great story lines in the second half. However, the second half reads as though Gaiman gets bored with his characters and has something else he'd rather be doing. He flies through the journey, alluding to adventures his characters have had along the way without taking us there.<br />  For example, he write the following: \\"In the town of Simcock-Under-Hill, Tristan and Yvaine had an encounter with a goblin press-gang that might have ended unhapily, with Tristan spending the rest of his life fighting the goblins' endless wars beneath the earth, had it not been for Yvaine's quick thinking and her sharp tongue....\\" This is the first he has mentioned of Simcock-Under-Hill, goblin's, goblin press-gangs, goblins' endless wars beneath the earth, and Yvaine's sharp tongue. This could be a great idea, but if it is not going to be a part of the story, why bother putting it in at all?<br />  For this book to be as good as it could have been, Gaiman needed to spend much more time on it and it should have been at least a trilogy.
B00000F169|5.0|I know that this movie isn't for everybody, but I knew, after my first viewing, that if I could find a man who found this movie to be as funny as I did, that we would be a perfect match (and I did, and it is!). Whenever I hear those magic words, \\"It it time to feed the alien,\\" I immediately begin to laugh because I know that I am about to be thoroughly entertained with what, I believe, is the funniest five-minutes in movie history!  I don't normally enjoy movie \\"spoofs,\\" but this movie does it with what I describe as subtle absurdity, rather than slapstick, and it works!  Comedy sci-fi is quite rare, and fans of Red Dwarf, I believe, will find this movie to be an irresistable rare find.
B000UBMZ4S|2.0|This 5 disc package could have been a 2 disc package. The making of Blade Runner and the HD movie. The other discs don't add much to the value.
1400082773|5.0|I truly believe this is one of the best books I have ever read, and re-read and re-read again.  No other book has ever touched my heart or moved me as DREAMS FROM MY FATHER did.   I recommend this book to everyone and have given countless copies as gifts and replaced my own copy several times because when I loaned it out, it failed to return.    Obama is a wonderful writer.  He is so painfully honest, so innocent in his writing that the book made me weep.   He opens his soul so completely and with so much vulnerability that I doubt he could have had political aspirations to the level of the Presidency when he wrote the book.
B000YDOOU0|5.0|I don't regard this CD as a ho hum effort at all. I think the writing and musicianship are top notch. People who think the music lacks inspiration may be expecting something more akin to the Lyle Mays collaborations. These recordings are more layered and more lushly produced. They are also more commercial. I am just as satisfied with the straight ahead trio music on Day Trip. If your taste runs toward bop this CD is the ticket.

B0010V4TSW|5.0|This is by all means a fantastic album. If this is your first encounter with Primal Fear you will find power- heavy metal of the best quality from a band that has constantly been making superior records.<br />For the experienced fans in the ranks of Primal Fear this is as good as every other fear release. It is definitely one step ahead in the course that commenced through \\"Devil's Ground\\" (2004) and continued with \\"Seven Seals\\" (2005). Primal Fear progress by adding orchestral instruments in parts and female guest vocals by \\"Epica\\" lead singer Simone Simons. However, by playing the album one will come to understand that above all, this is a faithful reproduction of the established high- octane, razor-sharp Primal Fear style. You might not even notice the orchestral fills when hearing this album for the first time.<br /><br />Even the British press had to acknowledge the superiority of this release; Specifically \\"Power Play\\" magazine (issue 92) gives this item a 10/10, commenting \\"put simply, this is brilliant\\". In other words, it does not get any better than this, a perfect record and as you might know, one doesn't expect to come across this rating very often when it comes to British journalists.<br /><br />\\"Classic rock\\" magazine (issue 112) which does not specialise in power/heavy metal marked this album with 7/10 commenting \\"(Primal fear have) gone mano a mano with Helloween with their fiercely technical, exuberantly overblown epics\\"<br /><br />Finally the album reached number 60 at the German charts, number 67 on the Swedish charts and number 10 on the Japanese charts(Burrn). You will not regret investing on this remarkable album.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|Tobias Sammet's Avantasia Parts 1 and 2 are considered to be two of the best power metal releases to ever be.  The over-the-top cast and story combined with superb musicianship and Sammett's own humor are endearing and to some overshadow Sammett's work with Edguy.  The fans of both releases are fiercely loyal and most would have been content with a Metal Opera Part III.  Instead, Tobi decided to do something different but still under the Avantasia banner.  The third album does indeed tell a story and utilizes many talented vocalists but is decidedly different.  Some would say Avantasia is weakened in this form, but I will attempt to argue it is just as good and perhaps better.    I must first say I love the two previous Avantasia albums.  The first album's closer \\"The Tower\\" and the second's opener \\"The Seven Angels\\" are two of the best power metal songs I've ever heard.  Still, I felt there was nothing left to really explore there.  Sure a third Avantasia that simply continued the story established in the first two would have probably entertained me but I imagine it would have been unable to achieve the same impact as the first two.    This new album is a more varied take.  The first two contained their share of power ballads, but this one definitely has a slower tempo throughout.  There are some hard-hitting and fast songs such as \\"Another Angel Down\\" and \\"The Devil in the Belfry\\" (and rest assured, both are spectacular) but the album is generally slower.    I'm actually going to stop here with the comparisons as this incarnation of Avantasia is just different and not intended to sound like the previous ones.  Ultimately, this album has a lot of personality and is arranged masterfully to create a wonderful ride for the listener.    The opener is a hard-sounding rock song.  Surprisingly, the first lines of the album are not song by Tobi Sammet but by Roy Khan of Kamelot.  I will say both he and Jorn Lande do a great job of stealing Tobi's spotlight on some parts ofthis album as the two have great performances here (Lande appearing on the album more than any other singer not named Sammet).  The song is a great intro for the album and sets up the general theme for it.    The album's \\"epic\\" and title track \\"The Scarecrow\\" follows.  I agree with another reviewer here in that it stumbles a bit in that it sounds like Tobi forced this song to be the album's epic.  It could have easily been shorter and drags a bit at times.  That being said, I still get into the song as Tobi and Lande go back and forth at a rapid pace.    \\"Shelter From the Rain\\" includes Avantasia vet and ex-Helloween frontman Michael Kiske and will likely be one of the favorites of Avantasia fans.  It is one of the few tracks (along with \\"Another Angel Down\\" and \\"Devil in the Belfry\\") that could be called typical Avantasia.    \\"Carry Me Over\\" sounds like an early 90's alternative ballad and is very similar to Edguy's \\"Save Me\\".  It's kind of the album's guilty pleasure.  As simplistic as it sounds it gets the job done.  I prefer it to the track that follows, the slow piano-driven ballad \\"What Kind of Love.\\"  The song is basically a duet between Tobi and Amanda Somerville.  I don't find it very engaging and it's definitely the album's low point.  It isn't a bad song, it just doesn't do anything to make me want to come back.    \\"Another Angel Down\\" was released on the Lost in Space single so most have heard it already.  It was the best song on that disc, and it may be the best song on this one as well.  Just great power metal.  \\"The Toy Master\\" is a song that just oozes personality as Alice Cooper takes center stage.  I've got to believe Tobi wrote this song with Cooper in mind as the role is just perfect for him.  Alice plays the role of The Toy Master, an evil industrialist preying on the misfortunes of the lower class, tempting them to purchase his goods in a failed attempt to find happiness.  Sammet actually appears in very little of this song, just the chorus.The lyrics for this song are probably my favorite on the album as they just fit well and really bring the song to life, \\"Out in the cold/ I see water frozen in their eyes/ what a sorry sight/ I am willing to believe/ they would pay for a smile.\\"    As previously mentioned, \\"Devil in the Belfry\\" is one the faster tracks.  It contains some great guitar licks from Sascha Paeth.  I especially love the little sweep in the middle of the chorus as the song just explodes from the speakers.  \\"Cry A Little Over Me\\" is a more traditional ballad that features some nice vocal work from Sammet and Bob Catley.      \\"I Don't Believe in Your Love\\" is pretty much a straight-up rock song that has a bit of an early 90's vibe to it.  I enjoy the song's imagery and the main riff is undeniably catchy.  The closing track \\"Lost in Space\\" has probably been heard by most already and it hasn't changed from the single releases.  I will say I enjoy the song more as a closing track than an opening one and it does a good job of finishing off the album.    So basically I just gave a track-by-track rundown of the album.  That's not necessarily my preferred way of reviewing an album but I am assuming a lot of Avantasia fans who haven't heard the album yet want to know what sounds like the Avantasia they're used to, and what doesn't.  Like Edguy's latest release \\"Rocket Ride,\\" this new Avantasia album tones down the power metal in favor of more variety.  The album is more versatile than previous efforts and its biggest strength is the arrangement.  All of the tracks are in the right place and the way it starts and finishes makes me want to listen to it again.  It has a lot of great hooks that should give the album a long lifespan and keep it interesting for multiple play-throughs.  It definitely is one of those albums that needs to be listened to multiple times to be completely digested but once done I think most will come to appreciate it.  I give it 5 stars, not because it's perfect (which it isn't,\\"What Kind of Love\\" is a bit of a dud and the title track doesn't quite accomplish what it intends to) but because it really is as good as it can be.  Power metal junkies may scoff at it, but I think most rock/metal fans will find something to love in Avantasia's \\"The Scarecrow.\\"

B000J103PC|4.0|Andrea Sachs is fresh out of college and turns down Stanford Law for a career as a writer.  She's bright, perky, talented and motivated, but the only writing job she can find is second assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor-in-chief of Runway Magazine.  A million girls would kill for her job, everyone tells Andy. Andy couldn't care less about fashion, she thinks it's all nonsense, but she only plans to stay there for a year anyway.  A year working for Miranda Priestly will get her a job in any other magazine she wants.<br /><br />It's easy to see why.  Miranda Priestly, whose character may or may not have been based on the real-life editor-in-chief of Vogue, is an evil boss-from-hell who revels in pure sadism.  Between throwing her coat and purse in Andy's face every morning, belittling her lack of fashion sense, sending her on impossible errands and generally keeping her at her beck and call twenty-four hours a day, Andy's personal life and her relationship with her live-in boyfriend are both on the skids.  But just when she's about to toss in the towel, Miranda's second-in-command Nigel takes her in hand and oversees her personal makeover, and she pulls off an impossible task Miranda has set for her, earning Miranda's approval on both points.  The ugly duckling turns into a trendy swan.<br /><br />But at a considerable cost.  As Nigel tells her, you know you're doing well at work when your personal life goes down the toilet.  \\"I didn't have any choice,\\" Andy wails when her soon-to-be-ex-live-in-boyfriend accuses her of choosing Miranda over him, and when she pulls off a coup that makes Miranda decide to take her to the annual fashion show in Paris instead of the first assistant, who had been starving herself for weeks in anticipation of the event.  Only when Miranda tells her she sees a lot of herself in Andy, does Andy realize to her horror that if she stays in this job she's liable to turn into a mini-Miranda.  Is it worth it, trips to Paris and all?  That's the choice she has to make.<br /><br />The cast in this film is generally very good indeed.  Anne Hathaway makes a winning Miranda, all big eyes and fresh-faced naivete.  Stanley Tucci is excellent as Nigel, Miranda's second, who's sacrificed his personal life for the magazine he loves.  And Emily Blunt does a very good acting job as Miranda's first assistant who finds herself outdone and out-gunned, however unwillingly, by Andy herself.  But this movie belongs to Meryl Streep, whose usual mousy-blond looks were morphed into something drop-dead gorgeous, with silver-white hair that symbolizes her icy personality that nothing can thaw; one look from this woman could literally freeze hell over.  If Miranda has a weak side to her, she'll never show it.  She's harder than a block of cement and that's the reason for both her successes and her failures.  The movie isn't very profound on any level, but the message comes across: make your work your priority at the expense of your family and friends and you'll end up rich, powerful and alone.  But like any well-presented message, director David Frankel manages not to make it too obtrusive so as to spoil the fun, and \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is ultimately a fun movie.  Kick back with a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy.as to make.    The cast in this film is generally very good indeed.  Anne Hathaway makes a winning Miranda, all big eyes and fresh-faced naivete.

B000PC6Z48|5.0|I have watched this movie when I was young back in the 80s...Franco Nero is also my favourite Actor as same as Clint Eastwood. Famous Italian directors like Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Leone knows better about Wild West America. Django is one of the unique art film about a twisted atmosphere of guns, vengeange, fortune, violents at the ill feel remote-location of the West. A man who carries a coffin - a very memorable characteristic of Franco Nero as I always remember him Django rather than the story line of this movies. Nothing much special about the story but Django is part of my own favourite home movie collection! Very artistic, an Artform of the 60s Movie!
B0011FL7FA|1.0|Wow - what a concept - have a mediocre story set to brilliant songs and then have mediocre talents sing them! I cannot believe anyone even thought the idea of this film was worth spending any money on. Exciting visuals? How about lame psychedelic head-trip nonsense. Oh an underwater ballet? Now that was unique - obviously the people who came up with this were smoking some serious weed.<br /><br />I felt humiliated for Bono and Eddie Izzard. There was not even the vaguest sense of \\"the Sixties\\" about this film. It didn't feel like the sixties or look like it. The kids looked like kids nowadays only not listening to hip-hop. It was too present-day trying to be another era and it just did not work.<br /><br />And the singing was abysmal. Egregious to the material. I don't think I'll ever get Jim Sturgess's nasal whine out of my head. And Evan Rachel Wood? Dear Lord in heaven - not even an especially attractive girl who cannot act or sing to save her left nipple.(that's in the film - watch for it if you dare).<br /><br />I wasn't even born until the end of the sixties but I was insulted for my parents generation. And insulted for the Beatles. Deeply insulted. Their music is not meant to be heard like this or played around with like this.<br /><br />Utter torment. Next time I feel the need to be tortured I will just put on some Bjork and flail my own skin off a centimeter at a time.

B00003CXA2|5.0|\\"I don't remember being born, I don't remember what I got for my first birthday and I don't remember going on my first outdoor picnic ... but I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in whole wide world.\\" -- Forrest Gump<br /><br />I have to be honest with you and just say that I'm a fool for sentimental movies like this. This is actually one of my all-time favorites. I usually find myself disappearing into this movie during flu season and when I'm confined to the couch for a week suffering in pain. Watching Forrest Gump seems to make things better, sooner.<br /><br />While that might sound corny, and you might be rolling your eyes, I usually feel better every time just watching it. The truth about the success of this movie is that most people identify with it, because unless you're a sycophantic sociopath, there are many times when the majority of us feel inferior, or less than or unable to meet the demands of our life - rendering us a little blue, sad, debilitated ... take your pick. Knowing that there is someone in the world like Forrest, probably gives us the hope that you're going to be alright if you hang on and don't obsess on your flaws. Forrest Gump is a lot of different things to different people. Mostly, it just takes you out of whatever you're in and does a pretty consistent job at making you feel that much better. Even if it's just for a little while.<br /><br />I'll spare you the repetitious information regarding any technical information about the DVD or the cast, as to date there are 543 reviews on this, 397 \\"5 star\\" and 42 \\"1 star\\", and 10 pages of posts on IMDb.<br /><br />Another reviewer stated that this was an introspective look into the Baby Boomers generation, and while I've never been a fan of the Baby Boomers per se, as most of the would-be flower children that briefly took up residences in communes, would later switch-off and drift into the largest group of corporate raiders in the history of this nation. Not much of a legacy there. But the character of Forrest speaks to more than just one single generation, or even one single man or one journey. Forrest Gump is an amalgam of several people, this according to Winston Groom and the reason why so many people identify with it. While [[ASIN:0743453255 the book]] is a worthy and interesting read, the film trumps.<br /><br />\\"I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is ...\\"rrest speaks to more than just one single generation, or even one single man or one journey.

6305428352|5.0|I may be biased, being a music student in high school, but this film will strike a chord with anyone in the audience.  Perfectly true to life with the crisis of school funding and the pretentious notion that sports and math are more important to education than musical theory, this film pulls you in without hesitation.<br /><br />There are plenty of critics that interpret the quality of the film, and plenty of buyers who rated their delivery service, but I feel the need to find the middle ground.  If you want a powerful movie that you will watch more than once... and something that you can easily enjoy with the whole family, this film is for you.<br /><br />Incredibly casted and conducted, this movie is perfect for music fanatics and movie-goers alike.  One of the best of the decade, and still in my personal top-ten list.
B000669GAI|5.0|good comp of songs. If you like Pearl Jam, this is a good one to have.
B000JR0P6I|5.0|I have a theory about this group: everything they do comes down to John Frusciante. I'll admit I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to him and the group: I find One Hot Minute leaves me (dare I say it) rather cold (though \\"My Friends\\", \\"Aeroplane\\" and \\"Tearjerker\\" are several of their best songs), and I don't have much appreciation for what they put out before Frusciante signed up. But when he did? Now, that's something different. The five albums they put out with him range from good (Mother's Milk, By the Way) to great (Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Stadium Arcadium). And then there's this one, my favorite RHCP disc and the only one I'd give a full five stars to. Perhaps it could be argued that the disc suffers from a bit of a poor middle stretch - there's nothing wrong with \\"Porcelain\\", but like a real decorative porcelain vase it's pretty but shallow, \\"Easily\\" does boast an impressive vocal (\\"EVERYTHING MUST GO!\\") and chorus, but the lyrics are kind of stupid; \\"Emit Remmus\\" is a loser track no matter how you slice it, with the guitar sounding like it was put through a blender - but when the running time on an album pushes an hour you can only expect a few lesser songs. But that's all that keeps it down.<br />Now, let's talk about the good stuff. Three chart-toppers came off this album, and lemme tell you something: if I were to compile a list of my ten favorite Chili Peppers songs, they would all make the list. The best known is probably the title track, an intricate, amazingly melodic protest against sex, drugs, materialism, imperialism, and on and on. The lyrics are classic stuff, but what really makes it fly is the minimalist guitar solo, which I believe contains somewhere around forty notes (I've heard it so many times I've more or less got it memorized, see). \\"Otherside\\" is arguably my favorite Chili Peppers song ever. The chorus is heavenly, the simple riff is just perfect, that little \\"rockin'\\" bit is tremendous, and those harmonies in the coda are astounding. To top it all off, Anthony gives the vocal performance of a lifetime. \\"Scar Tissue\\" is also a competitor for my favorite - the slide guitar part is superb, and again Anthony's falsetto is excellent. The other hits are also memorable, and show the group trying on different styles they hadn't really attempted before: \\"Parallel Universe\\" is new wave, and \\"Road Trippin'\\" is a great acoustic ballad. Only the fantastic \\"Around the World\\" (and a few other album tracks) is funk-rock.<br />But there's more to it than just a few great singles. Just about everything is quite good, though nothing matches \\"Scar Tissue\\" and the rest. \\"Savior\\" comes close, a two-part track that goes from screaming rocker to gentle, bass-driven pop. I also like the ballad \\"This Velvet Glove\\", with some fine lyrics. As I said before, there isn't much funk here, but the funk's pretty good \\"Get On Top\\" may at first seem like another one of the primitive sex raps they put out back before Frusciante jumped on, but for one Anthony's vocals have matured considerably since then, and for another none of those songs featured a lyric as cool as \\"complications of a mastermind...\\". The jumpy, nervy \\"I Like Dirt\\" is a lot of fun, and the environmentalist lyrics are enjoyable if a bit stupid. \\"Purple Stain\\" is cool, with a propulsive bass line and hard-to-forget \\"We all live in Hollywood!\\" chorus. \\"Right on Time\\" isn't even two minutes long, but they pack a lot of hooks into it, and I like the ending, where John sings the title slowly while Anthony provides a much faster contrast.<br />This is one fine album, their most creative, consistent, accessible album.

B00005JLWN|4.0|I've never seen this film but want to because Christian Bale is flat out brialliant. But by reading the synopsis doesn't this seem like just a different slightly altered version of Farenheit 451?
B000I5YVDE|4.0|I'm well aware of the fact that I wrote a one-star review of this album at one time. I'm also aware that said review was a piece of crap, which explains why I deleted it. And while I will maintain that the title is pretty stupid, after giving it another listen I think it's a pretty good album.<br />First, though, the bad news. I still can't stand Liam Gallagher's sneering voice at all. To be honest, I'm not even sure why they keep him around. I know he wrote a few songs on the group's more recent albums, but I've only heard two Oasis discs in my life (go ahead, guess which two!), so it's not like I'd know any of them are any good. And here's another problem: this band doesn't have one iota of originality. Everything they do is copied from the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, Jeff Beck, Cream, The Who, and other far superior acts. Seriously, they don't have their own style. Or, at minimum, they do but it's stolen from other acts. \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" is a good example. I like the song. It's a good power ballad. But John Lennon just about wrote it for them. Not only did Noel Gallagher admit that most the lyrics were swiped from John's diaries, but the piano intro is the same thing as \\"Imagine\\". There's something wrong with that.<br />Now, with all that crap out of the way, I'd like to focus on the good stuff. As I said, I like \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\", a major hit single, but there's more. \\"Wonderwall\\" is an amazing acoustic pop tune with some subtly clever orchestration, even if the Fab Four did considerably better with a similar backdrop on \\"We Can Work it Out\\". \\"Champagne Supernova\\" is a fantastic, surprisingly tuneful drug power ballad with guitar heroics from both Noel himself and ex-Jam frontman Paul Weller, and it's my favorite song on the album too. And there are a ton of loud, foot-stomping, thundering, slightly overlong rockers: \\"Hey Now!\\", \\"Hello\\", \\"Roll with It\\", \\"Some May Say\\" and the title track. A couple weaknesses, though: the straight-up ballad \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is awkward and completely out-of-character, while the fusion of punk and music hall on \\"She's Electric\\" is as forced as it may sound. Plus, you know, what I said before.<br />This is a fun album. Not original at all, but fun. The Gallagher brothers do strike me as morons, but who cares? It's all about the music. And the music is good. But I will insist this is an overrated album, and that you could do far better with '90s rock.llad \\"Cast No Shadow\\" is awkward and completely out-of-character, while the fusion of punk and music hall on \\"She's Electric\\" is as forced as it may sound.

B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This is my second Skagen watch purchased from Amazon.  The first one has been so great for several years, it still works great and I still use it but I just wanted a new one. The price is so great for the looks and quality of this watch, that I just had to have a new one.
B000078DOI|4.0|And suddenly, magically, the Red Hot Chili Peppers became good. You know why? Four reasons: John Frusciante and Chad Smith joined the party; Flea's technique improved by leaps and bounds; and Anthony Keidis learned to actually sing rather than scream. All these elements come together on the group's first sizeable hit, the amazing antidrug funk-rocker \\"Knock Me Down\\", inspired by Slovak's recent death by overdose. Now, I'm sure not here to celebrate Slovak's death, since he was so young and had so much ahead of him at the time, and I always feel really bad inside when I learn about people dying. But he wasn't much of a guitarist, and Frusciante fits the group's style a lot better. I just wish that Slovak had left the band through less extreme measures than drug overdose, such as a firing. Regardless of that, this strikes me as the Chili Peppers' real debut album, where they really came into their own. It's true that most the funk rockers don't sound much different from your average track on, say, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. But they're much more interesting. For instance, take \\"Subway to Venus\\". Pretty mediocre song, right? Yeah, until Flea picks up the trumpet. Or take \\"Good Time Boys\\". Again, kind of a boring, uneventful song, except for that little break where everything slows down for about ten seconds. Similarly, would the concluding \\"Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky\\" be as good as it is without Frusciante's guitar playing? I doubt it. Same for \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\", though that song also has some sweet sax soloing going for it. \\"Stone Cold Bush\\" would be just a moronic sex-god funk-rocker with an irritating sex section if it weren't for Flea's quick bass solo. And there is no way the early group was capable of something as good as my favorite song on the album, \\"Taste the Pain\\", which rules for several reasons. Really, really catchy; fantastic guitar parts; and especially Flea's jazzy trumpet. Flea also does a fine job on their cover of \\"Higher Ground\\". Guess who that is playing what was originally the clavinet part? It's Flea! All Flea. Flea rules. Now the other cover (Jimi Hendrix's \\"Fire\\") is a sloppy rush job with none of the overwhelming power of Hendrix's version. I could do without it. And a couple of other songs also fall in the \\"suck bin\\", like the moronic basketball tribute \\"Magic Johnson\\"; \\"Punk Rock Classic\\", which sees the group reverting back to the Slovak sound (though the \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" quote is amusing); and the instrumental \\"Pretty Little Ditty\\", though at least that gives features the Frusciante Guitar Tone. On a whole, though, this is a huge leap over the early albums and is really worth checking out.hat is playing what was originally the clavinet part? It's Flea! All Flea. Flea rules.

B000SUKPKM|4.0|I gave it four stars because there really isn't a bad song on here. However, it could have been a definitive collection if they hadn't felt compelled to write out their prior history. I understand not wanting to dive into the pre-Boy Named Goo days (there's another CD for that anyway), but they had some genuine hits from that album that aren't seen here... like Long Way Down (also on the Twister soundtrack) and Naked. Plus, the re-recorded version of Name is a nightmare decision. Why release a greatest hit and change the song that made your career? The new version is awful, it sounds so glossy, where the appeal of the original was its raw honesty. Also, Give a Little Bit should probably be here too. Those gripes aside though, they've made some great tunes over the years and there's nothing on here that makes me want to hit skip (aside from Name of course).
B00026WU82|5.0|Bob Dylan is a frustratingly inconsistent artist. The worst albums in his catalog - and there are a lot of those - are pretty much insufferable. But if you catch Dylan on a good day, when his creative powers are at their height and his lyrics are some of the best known to man - and there are a lot of those, too - every good word you've heard about the guy suddenly turns true. This is definitely one such album, and his most famous, acclaimed work. It may not be as revolutionary as Bringing it All Back Home or as personal as Blood on the Tracks, but the lyrics here are better than on ANY other Dylan album, or any other album, period.<br />So, right. It's Dylan vs. the establishment here. And if you aren't betting on Dylan, you're betting on the wrong horse. The most fierce attack on the \\"straight\\" (in more senses than one, if you're reading between the lines) culture is on \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", a creepy, organ-driven track with Dylan's sneering at its best. And the lyrics are brilliant, as usual. Another favorite of mine is the resident classic, \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", which was later covered by everyone from Bob Marley to the Replacements to Jimi Hendrix. In other words, it's an across-the-board standard, and it just might be Dylan's signature song. It's not just the infamously nasty lyrics that make it the masterpiece it is, either (though that sure is part of it), but the melody, the triumphant organ part, and the little guitar fills, provided by Al Kooper and Mike Bloomfield, respectively. In short, it's Dylan at his peak as a songwriter, lyricist, and arranger. It's more or less as good as a song can get. Sharply contrasting this carefully arranged song are the several literally offbeat (as in, the bass and drums aren't even together) garage-rockers: \\"Tombstone Blues\\" is a propulsive, ramshackle  rant against everything, taking \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" to a new level; \\"From a Buick 6\\" is a funny blues rave-up parody with a great bass line and several great lyrics such as \\"I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead, I need a dump truck mama to unload my head\\" and various others that only Dylan could come up with. The title track is hilarious - the satirical lyrics (\\"God said to Abraham, 'Kill me a son', Abe said, 'Man, you must be puttin' me on'\\") are gutbusters, and who doesn't love that little toy police siren? \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" is more of Dylan at his finest, a witty travelogue with several sly, subtle references to prostitution, drugs, corrupt authorities, and general decadence. Let us not forget Dylan's sarcastic, satirical love song \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" either, or the gentle majesty of the straightforward blues \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\".<br />And then there's \\"Desolation Row\\", arguably the most cryptic piece in Dylan's discography. It's more than eleven minutes long, and the entirety of it is played on an acoustic guitar with Dylan calmly intoning downright apocalyptic lyrics. It's certainly an ambitious piece, namechecking Ophelia, the Phantom of the Opera, Casanova (in the same verse!), Quasimodo, Cain & Abel, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and containing more than one reference to genocide. By anyone else it would fall apart, but there's something about Dylan's presence here that makes it arguably the best song on the album. I myself haven't the faintest idea of what he's getting at here - I suspect that \\"desolation row\\" itself is an afterlife of sorts - but the words sure do sound good together, whatever they're supposed to convey.<br />In conclusion, this was probably the album that gave the name \\"Bob Dylan\\" the messianic undertone it conveys. But here's what separates Bob from his many imitators. It's clear that he wasn't even TRYING to be the voice of his generation here - if he was, he probably would've put a lot more care into producing this album and DEFINITELY would've fixed all those little mistakes the band makes that just add to how GOOD this record is - but he succeeded in it just the same. Everyone else who tries it fails. See? That's what's so good about him.eded in it just the same. Everyone else who tries it fails. See? That's what's so good about him.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie is two hours long, but I didn't notice it. A generous script allows each one of the remarkable cast--including Rupert Everett in a great cameo, Michelle Pfeiffer in a terrific role, and Robert DeNiro in a HILARIOUS role--to shine and develop their characters. A truly charming film, as well as a beautiful one.   I'm baffled as to why this wasn't a huge blockbuster--although I know that in Minneapolis, it had a short run at the arthouse. This should have been a major hit--it's far more fun and funny than the later Pirates (I did like the first one, fyi), but surely aimed at the same audience.

B0018QCXGY|5.0|Only once in a rare while are we treated to a movie so innovative and unique. It's sad to think that there will only be so many film-going experiences like Cloverfield in my life while the void is filled with more generic fare. In terms of story it is very similar to the awful 1998 clunker [[ASIN:B00164EAC8 Godzilla [Blu-ray]]], but is a world apart when it comes to execution thanks to [[ASIN:B001CT877G Under Siege 2 - Dark Territory [Blu-ray]]] scribe Matt Reeves' highly kinetic direction.<br /><br />Everyone by now knows the premise of the filming of a loft party being interrupted by the arrival of a giant monster in Manhattan, so I won't go into loads of description over that. I'm a firm believer in the fact that the camera is the eyes of the person watching the film and with Cloverfield (like [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]] before it) we are put right into the central character's shoes as he stumbles around the darkest corners of the city with his ever diminishing group of friends.<br /><br />It's been repeated a million times, but I too believe that what we DON'T see is scarier than what we do. Once you bring the monster out of the shadows all the mystery and fear evaporates. For the majority of the movie we never really get to see all of the monster, perhaps a tentacle here or a foot there, but not much of the whole thing. We do get to see a lot of the ugly parasites that cling to its body however.<br /><br />There are some brilliant and eternally memorable scenes in Cloverfield, the best being hard to nail down but I loved the idea of entering a crooked skyscraper via the deserted tower that it's leaning against. What a truly unique set-piece.<br /><br />Of course the movie is going to have it's critics and there will be plenty who are not satisfied with the ending. JJ Abrams has said that he plans to do a single sequel from another point of view, but I feel this will ruin the magic.<br /><br />In fact, JJ Abrams' marketing campaign and back-story has already tarnished the film for me a little bit. He has stated that the monster comes from the sea but I prefer to not know for certain where it comes from. I imagined it coming from outer space myself as the idea of a random creature arriving from the infinite darkness of space to far more terrifying than a monster from the limited environment of our own oceans. And the viral marketing is way out of hand. Let me put set it all straight.<br /><br />Rob Hawkins has been made vice president of a company in Japan. That company is the Slusho soft drink firm. Marlena is seen drinking plenty of Slusho at the beginning of the film. The parasites on the creature apparently eat the secret ingredient of Slusho deep in the ocean. They smelled this on her, which explains why she is the only one of the group who is bitten. The near-unnoticeable 'splash' in the water at the end of the film is part of a satellite which has fallen out of space and apparently wakes up the monster somehow.<br /><br />What a load of garbage! Is Rob Hawkins the center of the universe or something? Why is all this contrived crap revolving around him? Why they came up with this drivel instead of leaving it all unexplained is beyond me. Nevertheless, I will still be looking forward to the sequel next year.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a brilliant 1080p 1.78:1 picture with Dolby TrueHD and loads of extras.

0553582038|4.0|I see little point in reviewing this book, therefore I will go ahead and post anyway.  If you are considering reading this book, you have almost certainly read A Storm of Swords, in which case you didn't love that book as much as you should have, or you'd be reading A Feast for Crows right now instead of this review.    If you consider this book as a work of fiction aside from A Storm of Swords, it's brilliant.  Compare it against almost anything else out there NOT written by Martin.  Nothing could possibly live up to A Storm of Swords, so get over that, and be happy you've got hundereds of pages direct from Martin's hand to read here.  If you, like me, recognize Cersei as the the most fun POV to read from, you will enjoy this book.  She alone makes the time worth spending.    One honestly intended piece of advice.  Don't start this book until a month or so before the next one is due to be published.  That way, if you're disappointed with Feast, you won't have long to be so....
B00007AJGH|5.0|It's a great film for anyone who enjoyed cartoons when they were a kid. The live action works very well with the animation. I think this film is aimed towards an adult audience. Sure kids can enjoy it too. I've watched it a number of times and still enjoy it.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Loved every second of it. These three movies just go to show you that there can be a series of movies where all of them are just as good as the one before. Matt Damon was the perfect person to play this part, and this is one of those few movies I could watch over and over again.

B000NY17J6|5.0|I kept thinking about Blue Bayou by Linda Ronstadt and how much I liked it. I finally bought a best of by Linda and I am amazed at the number of great songs she has to her name. This is a gem of a CD and I recomend it to anyone. Linda has an one of those voices that you can't get enough of.  If she ever comes out to Australia I'll definately be going to see her in concert.

B000002I25|5.0|For the most part, I'm a huge fan of heavy metal, but I also enjoy lots of classic rock as well including Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple, Boston, Rush, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rolling Stones, ZZ Top, Thin Lizzy, and of course the band that I'm reviewing right now, The Doors. Led by the late great Jim Morrison, The Doors are truly one of the greatest and most legendary rock'n'roll bands of all time, and they're also one of my favorite classic rock bands as well. Their legendary 1967 self titled debut released on Elektra is truly one of the most legendary and all time best debut albums in rock, and it's also The Doors's all time best album as well. Now for a look at some of my favorite songs on this album. \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\" is a nice solid upbeat rocking opener. \\"Soul Kitchen\\" and \\"Twentienth Century Fox\\" are both great bluesy rockers that include some killer bluesy guitar solos. \\"The Crystal Ship\\" is a nice slow haunting piano driven ballad that also features some haunting melodic vocals. \\"Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)\\" is another favorite that features some really awesome keyboard licks and melodies while \\"Back Door Man\\" includes some more awesome bluesy guitar solos, and of course \\"The End\\" is a great epic 11+ minute album closer. Most importantly the crowning jewel of this classic album as well as the absolute best song on here is without question track six and the number 1 hit \\"Light My Fire\\". This was the first Doors song I ever heard in my life and it also got me into the band in the first place. That keyboard intro is just absolutely addicting, as well as those mesmerizing keyboard solos, and let's also not forget about that awesomely addicting psychedelic sounding guitar solo by Robby Krieger, and of course the ever so mesmerizing melodic vocals by Jim himself.  The musicianship on here is of course pure utterly genius. Ray Manzarek's keyboardwork on here is I mean just absolutely dominating throughout. Robby Krieger's guitar solos are very cool and addicting, and John Densmore's drumming is tight and solid throughout. And of course topping all that are the ever so amazingly menacing  yet melodic and poetic vocals courtesy of Jim Morrison. There's no doubt that Jim was truly one of the greatest singers in rock.

0307387151|1.0|I may be a minority, but I found the first couple of chapters tedious and almost unreadable, and dropped the book at that point.  It's a principle in fiction that the author should show, not tell.  All this author did was tell, tell, tell--he preferred the lazy path of Irving the Explainer.  He just wouldn't convey his story through scenes or dialogue.  Rather he wanted to tell the reader everything about Briony in long-winded narrative, instead of showing us these things by what she said, thought and did. Then he did the same thing with the older sister. Neither of these characters came alive. They could have come to life in other hands, but McEwan seems to prefer nattering on tiresomely. Why this was considered prize-winning writing is unfathomable.  In my view, it was more a series of preliminary character sketches and a long outline of a book than a real novel.  Nice that it was made into a movie, as advertising indicates there are the elements of a story here; but in a reversal of the usual situation, the film has to be much better than the book or people will walk out of it in droves.
B000B8657S|5.0|To reply with the other reviewers(who must be aboslutely insane and spoiled to find any fault worthy enough to dock this wondrous release any stars below five) there is so much here to enjoy that it far outweighs the few quibbles one may have-which are reasonable-but not to the extent to deny it the full honors it deserves. To reply to one, who suggests buying it disc by disc would be at least 800.00!!!! So this is almost 40 percent off that price. But I am sure that whoever would complain about such trivial matters as said reviewer did let him dish it out.<br />Now to the actual item. This is pure enjoyment--absolute, total, enjoyment from beginning to end. There are so many treasures here--so many items I, as a Schubert lover, had never encountered that I was provided almost a month and a half of enjoyment before I even listened to a disc more than three times.<br />I encourage those fortunate enough to afford this to listen in chronological order, one disc a day, till they are through the set. The sojourn is priceless, the treats and surprises endless.<br />I suppose it is a sign of the times that someone would  harp on a minute issue instead of allow themselves the awe of this project. Bravo Hyperion!!!!
0689865384|5.0|When I read the first paragraph, I thought this was going to be another lame teen novel. So don't judge it on the first paragraph. After that, I was instantly hooked on this post-apocalyptic novel about a world in which everyone is surgically made to be \\"pretty\\" when they are 16. The world in which all the \\"uglies\\" and \\"pretties\\" live is very well developed, with original details, innovations, and flaws. The writing is effortless and I enjoyed the characters. The novel is not exactly unpredictable; yet, I was hooked from start to end.<br /><br />If you like science fiction, I found a Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. short story called \\"Harrison Bergeron\\" that is similar in theme, except that instead of trying to raise everyone up to the standard of equality, the future world is bringing everyone down to a generic level.<br /><br />Definitely check it out!

B000N6TX22|4.0|A powerfully gripping vision, mainly in its most down-to-earth realism (hungry, illegal aliens at the gates of the few last enclaves of security).  Realism is concentrated on the logical consequences of a demographic collapse of the human race, however the political analysis of the war, waged against the inner as well as foreign terrorist-opponents, is also rather smashing. Not suitable for anyone allergic to blood, though!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|As has been described, Sicko is Michael Moore's third documentary analyzing American society.  In Sicko, Moore analyzes the healthcare industry in America and provides the viewer with a holistic view of the shortcomings of the way that our current health care industry is structured.<br /><br />We witness patient after patient suffering because they either don't have medical insurance, or their current insurance doesn't cover what is needed to cure them.  For example, there are several EMT's that were volunteers during the 9/11 attacks on NYC and since they were not official government employees, they do not qualify for medical insurance.  Now that they are sick, no HMO wants to offer them coverage because they have \\"pre-existing\\" medical conditions.  Once you find yourself suffering from an illness, it becomes nearly impossible to get insurance.  Even if you do have insurance, the odds are that you will not be able to cover enough of your expenses.  What I took out of this section of the movie is that if any of us become severely ill, odds are that you will become broke.  Even if you do have a good insurance plan that pays 80% of your bill, you are still looking at paying 20% of some very expensive bills.  For example, respiratory problems, diabetes problems, or especially cancer.<br /><br />Now, you may be thinking that at least we have the best care in the world and that there is no better method.  Well, Moore shows different countries such as Canada and England that have Universal Healthcare and they too have some of the best medical care in the world.  In fact, the United States isn't even ranked near the top in many statistical categories such as infant mortality and longevity.<br /><br />I was extremely impressed with the French medical system, which is one of the best in the world.  Under this system, you don't have to pay any money for medical care.  In fact, if you become ill in the middle of the night, you could have a doctor come to your house and check you out.  France is hardly a third world country.  In fact, seeing a country such as France tackle the Health Care Industry and make it inexpensive and even free for its citizens makes you wonder of what we could do here in America.<br /><br />Whether you agree with Michael Moore or not, Sicko is a must-see film.  It is important to learn how the Health Care Industry operates, and then formulate your own opinion on how to fix/update it.  This film definitley needs to be a part of your DVD collection.ardly a third world country.

B00003000M|5.0|My favorite track on this album is tack 11, which is a remix of Survival that stays very true to the original song.  It uses Bob Marley's complete lyrics and does not have any guest artists... the only thing they changed was the timing and the beat... it sounds dope. I recommend for those who liked the original Survival album by Bob Marley & The Wailers.     Survival was my first & favorite Bob Marley & the Wailers album.  Here are all the tracks on that album, in case you didnt know how good the songs are:    So Much Trouble in the World, Zimbabwe, Top Rankin', Babylon System, Survival, Africa Unite, One Drop, Ride Natty Ride, Ambush in the Night, and Wake Up and Live.
0439882826|5.0|I had first seen this book at Target.  The price was $30.  I was able to get it for less on Amazon even with the shipping! And of course, the book is Awesome!  My daughter will probably have it on her coffee table along with her Graceland Pop-up book!
B00102F5WK|5.0|The film itself is flawless. After spending Chinese New year stuck at home with a few dozen movies and plenty of spare time, I can say that most other films that I watched were solidly in the 2 to 3 star class, while this one has everything for it: a solid story, based on current political events, a first class cast, excellent cinematography (the No Country For Old Men crowd might get their desert pictures from here too!), and even a good copy for me.<br />And then as an add-on the odd reviews here by the political wackos. Very entertaining, if they were not so sad.<br />The subject is, as the title says, rendition, i.e. the practice of transferring suspects to other countries without proper procedure. A suspect can be anybody by accident. The plot here involves a young CIA agent in 'North Africa', who is not used to the practices, it is his first 'torture case'. He develops a conscience and acts upon it. In parallel we watch a young local couple, the daughter of the police chief, who ran away from home, with her boy friend, an art student, who is of course also something else. The story is skillfully intervowen with the interrogation of the suspect from the US.<br />Recommendable.
B00104W8T6|5.0|Juno (Original Soundtrack) *****<br /><br />A perfectly Corky soundtrack to go along with the perfectly corky film. Almost entirly acoustic with the exception of the Carpenters 'Superstar' which is covered by the fantastic Sonic Youth, and the David Bowie written classic 'All The Young Dudes' performed by Moot The Hoople.<br /><br />Full of fantastic love songs from greats like The Velvet Underground, Kimya Dawson, and Belle & Sebastian make this worth the money alone. The added 'Anyone Else But You' performed by the two stars of the movie Ellan Page and Michael Cera is a nice touch as that is how the movie itself ends.<br /><br />The soundtrack to juno is perfect whether or not you have seen the film, it is only more appreciated once the film has been seen so do yourself a favor and pick up Juno.

0618918248|5.0|In my opinion, this book represents Richard Dawkins' best work to date.    I've always been a fan of his work, but this book was of particular interest to me. Although I was raised Catholic, over the years I've come to accept certain conclusions that had been harboring within me for quite some time. Namely, that the concept of a god, and the vast array of creation myths, are all wrong and are simply widely-accepted lies. Not just with respect to Christianity, but with respect to most religions as a whole.    Perhaps that may sound harsh, but here we are living in the 21st century, basing our beliefs about life, death, and our origins in ancient texts; thousands of years old. It's simply preposterous. We as humans ought to be smarter than that.    Dawkins' book represents a clear voice of reason in the face of regions and their general failure to contribute anything truly valuable to the planet. He instills into the reader arguments that simply cannot be ignored. Even if you're an atheist, certain aspects of this book will grab your attention, and challenge your thinking.    Any way you cut it, this book is highly interesting, informative, and even comical at times if I dare say so. Dawkins occasionally throws in a bit of humor to get certain points across, and it works very well.    If you haven't read this book, make it a point to do so. 5 stars!

B000YA9R3C|4.0|\\"There will be Blood\\" is an adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel, \\"Oil\\".  In it, we see the corruption of capitalism and its bizarre relationship with religion.  Both are portrayed as two sides of the same coin.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Daniel Plainview, an obsessive oil man who brooks no opposition to his ways.  His chief protagonist is Paul Dano as Eli Sunday, an old fashioned fire and brimstone preacher.  These two are the central players in a story told against a backdrop of the California oil rush in the early twentieth century.<br /><br />A strong case can be made for Day-Lewis to win an Oscar as best actor.  He is absolutely overpowering in this film.  He is a true master.  Yet for all his hard work, the film itself can be ponderous at times.  The story sometimes dawdles with long sequences without dialogue as scenes are slowly set.  If only the film could be tightened up to some degree.  The broader panorama of the film is magnificent.<br /><br />The film's concluding scene is a highlight.  It is here that the viewer is a witness to the depth of the corruption that is only hinted at elsewhere.  Yet, this scene is also one not for the faint hearted.  It does, however, serve to neatly tie the pieces together of a vast drama.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|(1) An Inconvenient Truth is an effort by Al Gore to educate the public about the severity of the climate crisis.    (2) It weaves in events that changed his worldview, including his college education with early climate expert Roger Revelle at Harvard University, and his young son's near-fatal car accident.     (3) All through the film Gore keeps referencing back to the loss to George W. Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election. Although that is not directly significant to the subject matter being discussed in this movie, it does help in providing an air of respect for Al Gore which puts us in an acceptable mood to listen to Gore's arguments. The point is being made here that afer he lost the elections he tried to focus on other things like global warming with a greater intensity.    (4) He analyses the trend in the annual temperature and CO2 levels for the past 650,000 years in Antarctic ice core samples.     (4)Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels, flooding coastal areas and producing  millions of refugees.    (5) Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there.    (5) An Inconvenient Truth is the fourth-highest-grossing documentary film to date in the United States. Box office = $49 million. The other three are Fahrenheit 9/11, March of the Penguins and Sicko.    regards, Vikram
B000N3T0DW|4.0|\\"Volver\\" is the story of Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) and her relationships principally with the women in her life including her sister Sole (Lola Duenas), her teen daughter Paula (Yohana Cobo), what she initially believes is the memory of her mother, and her friend Augustina.<br /><br />The character of Agustina (Blanca Portillo) was my favorite. I couldn't take my eyes off this woman and her amazing performance of this traumatized, noble character bearing a terrible tale and honoring her friendships. Such expressive, sad eyes. And she loved her women. \\"It's our business.\\"<br /><br />This is a story about women; the men in the movie are either icky (Paco, Raimunda's husband) or fleetingly present.

0440241413|5.0|After much consideration of everyone's reviews and obsession, I decided to read the Shopaholic Series.  This first book was great.  It was easy to read and I found it to be very enjoyable so much that I refered this book to a friend.  I haven't read the Bridgette Jones' Diary so I can't comment if it's a total rip off of it, which I read from another review.  Quite honestly, I found the characters to be very relateable and easy to remember.  Becky was someone that everyone could relate to.  She was very human and I enjoyed seeing how she got herself in and out of trouble.  After reading this book, I was an instant fan of Sophie Kinesella.  I did read the second book of the series and you'll have to see what I thought about that.

B000FDECGA|4.0|Shogun Assassin (1980) is a remarkable movie that hasn't aged a  single day, since its release, amazingly. Starring ( the late)  Tomisaburo Wakayama, playing a samurai with the intriguing actress  Kayo Matsuo, the action unfolds in a paradoxical mix of tranquility /  love with brutality / horror.    First, Ogami the samurai begins a long trek with his 5 year old son  in a baby carriage, across rivers, forests, crop fields, and deserts  to an unknown destination, showing extraordinary endurance and  determination all that time.    Next, over the course of many miles, Ogami \\"Lone Wolf\\" has to defend  himself against wicked platoons sent to finish him off, fighting off  as well, Ninjas, on a mission to kill for which failing is not an  option, under the penalty of Hara Kiri.    The film is very stylish, the music  professional, perhaps slightly  overdoing it with the synth numbers reminiscent of \\"Safety Dance\\"  from Men Without Hats, back in 1982, apparently using the same brand  music instrument. The presentation is a great wide-screen.    The surrealism of this picture, in some ways in the tradition of  Salvador Dali, is the case, and somewhat reminsicent of  \\"The Passion  of Darkly Noon\\"- another work that contains frequent, intense horror.  The only difference are the  lethal scenes with blood packs going off  as a result of samurai hand to hand combats.    The benefit of a DVD release, is that the viewers won't have to hear  gasps, screams, shock, yelling that otherwise would apply in a public  theatre, such is the graphic nature of the special effects and the  overall \\"Mad Max\\" feel to it.    The action is apparently set circa 1300 to 1500, when gun powder  still wasn't widely used, perhaps set even earlier than that, due to  the lack of crossbows and arrows.    The actors chosen are intentionally ethnic Japanese in order to  better represent accurately the microcosm of this story to the  viewers.    The overall impact of this movie, is that it does constitute adream  of sorts, a superb surrealism taking spectators in another space and  time, with a crystal clear film to DVD transfer. The downside is that  more than 1 viewer may ahbor the graphic combat scenes. The sets are  very credible, admirably chosen from a stylish, appealing aspect.    It should be noted that the work has 3  sequels to it.

B000YENUI6|5.0|Viggo Mortensen turns in a stunning performance, perhaps the best of his career, in this thrilling tale of the \\"Russian\\" mafia in modern day London.  Mortensen plays a mob underling, ostensibly working his way up in the deadly hierarchy.  And he plays this role with a cool, controlled brilliance. Watching, we become convinced that his goals are simply that of the other ruthless gangsters: wealth and power.<br /><br />In a very telling scene, that many reviewers seem to have missed, Mortensen's character is forced to participate in the degradation of a young Eastern European woman who, like so many others these days, is forced into a state of sexual slavery by the \\"Russian\\" mob.  And, yet he remains as gentle as he can be, given the situation.  And he secrets to the poor young lady a symbol of that which separates him from his mob \\"comrades\\", a sigil of his Christian Ortodoxy.  Later, we come to understand that Mortensen's deadly game is even more hazardous than that of those with whom he works, for he is really working undercover to undermine the mob from within.<br /><br />In our review title, we noted that the movie is gory.  And it is.  But then, the story told is not exactly gentle.  While we could have done without just a bit of the bloodshed, the film is nonetheless very effective.  As an aside to this, those trained in the martial arts will appreciate the brutal knife fight, where the ancient dictum to cut, not slash, is violently validated.<br /><br />We recommend this film.  It tells a great story of faith, and quiet courage.  And of this these days, we all need very much more.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|My family loves this movie. I guess if I had to pick a favorite of all time this would be it. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are spectacular.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I posted a response to the one and only review of this film. Well, that wasn't good enough, because I left this movie so captivated by it that I was recommending it to friends right and left. To see the first review be so negative, so ethnocentric, so religiously stymied was difficult for me. So here you are, looking at a review written just because I disagree.     How American of me.    The acting was subtle and well balanced, unaffected and natural. The director seemed to understand where to put things, as directing goes, and he worked his cast very well, using the script and the players to a serious advantage so that they all produced an artistic work.     As to the story - this seems to have been written by someone who loves to study people as much as any anthropology major, and who sees the complexity in the enormous spectrum of human nature. We're all the same, but we're really not. That's the fun of Us, and that's the beauty of this film. There are some difficult moments, and if I find a fault here, it's that too much was edited out. The little tiny clues that would help the viewer to fully understand (read: not too much guessing) is only available as an extra on the DVD, and probably won't be found on the unbox version, since they don't sell anything but the movie itself. It's a pity. This film is enriched by the extras on the DVD and should be seen to fully appreciate the film (although not strictly necessary).     So please, take a chance and see this movie. If you're adventurous you'll see a great adventure and won't be disappointed, all the way to the end and further.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie is two hours long, but I didn't notice it. A generous script allows each one of the remarkable cast--including Rupert Everett in a great cameo, Michelle Pfeiffer in a terrific role, and Robert DeNiro in a HILARIOUS role--to shine and develop their characters. A truly charming film, as well as a beautiful one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
0525950079|4.0|I first read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" about 16 years ago.  I was utterly speechless. That book single-handedly turned me into Anglophile for medievel and 15th - 16th century historical fiction.  Since then I've read the book several more times, assigned it to my own book club, and it has opened the doors of English history to many more people.  I bought \\"World Without End\\" the moment it came out (but only just now read it because I was saving it as a reward for myself.)    I'm satisfied in some regards but am sadly disappointed in others.  I love the details to the time period that make me stop and ponder for a few moments, such as the account of the advent of paper in England or the description on pottage, the peasant's everyday meal.  Or the portrayals of the different houses according to the medievel residents' socio-economic positions.  And the incredibly horribly graphic descriptions of the wars and punishments the English wages against... well, nearly everyone.    I'm very disappointed in this book though.  The characters are all extremely two-dimensional.  By the hundreth page I know that Caris, Merthin and Gwenda will be \\"good\\" and wise no matter what tribulations are thrown their way.  By the time I meet Godwyn and Elfric for the first time I know that they will be weak, slimy, hypocritical and manipulative forever.  I want the characters to grow, change, expand and morph the way people really do, but they stay the same.  Although the portrayal of the 14th century in \\"World Without End\\" is beautifully and expressively realistic, the characters are superficially cartoon-like, kind of like medievel archetypes.  It's almost like a Spiderman or Batman series, where the Good Ones must triumph repeatedly against the Bad Ones.  And like cartoons, the archetypes don't die! Peripheral characters come and go with abandon.  For example, when Merthin's evil and nasty knight-brother is sentenced to die (several times in the book) for various crimes, I don't even get excited because I know that Ralph is the Bad Guy, and he won't die until the end probably, and then is some ghastly manner.    The lesbianism kind of made me laugh, because it was such a contemporary plot device.. it didn't seem to belong in the book.    Over the years, every time I reread \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and come to the end, I have the same three quick thoughts.  First I think, \\"Gosh, I'm going to miss Prior Phillip, Aliena and Jack... they're like family!\\"  Then I think, \\"Wait, they've been dead for almost a thousand years!\\"  And finally it hits me, \\"Wait!  They never really lived! They're characters in a book!\\"  That's how real the protagonists in \\"Pillars\\" are, and how much the reader grows to care for them.      So, although I'm thoroughly enchanted being taken back to the 14th century for 900+ pages (Thank you, Ken!!), I'm bored with the simplicity of the protagonists in \\"World Without End\\".    Books I recommend of this genre and time period?  \\"Katherine\\" by Anya Seton (about Katherine Swynford and John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster) and \\"Legacy\\" by Susan Kay (the best book I've ever read about Queen Elizabeth, now unfortunately out of print but easy to locate in used collections.)

0931838401|5.0|McKeowan's Guide since its first issue has been, and still is, a fantastic tome which is a must for every camera collector. I was astounded many years ago when visiting Leningrad to see that a camera vendor selling old Russian cameras from a small table on the pavement had made a full photocopy for his use! To me it is the best catalogue of cameras ever published and I will continue to buy each update as they become available.
B0012CQXLU|3.0|As noted by other reviews, the music on this album sounds a lot like hard rock of the early 1970s. If you like new music that sounds like old music, you might also like a band named The Sound Track of Our Lives. Stormy High seems to be the strongest composition on this album. I don't care much for the falsetto singing in Stay Free. Queens Will Play makes me think of Jefferson Airplane. Evil Ways sounds a bit like Black Sabbath. Bright Lights sounds a bit like Pink Floyd. Overall, there is some polish and sophistication to this music: varying rhythms, textures, melodies, tempi and emotional intensity. That polish makes it easier to stomach the trendy qualities of weak intonation and weak vocal technique.
B00013M6NK|5.0|This is the first camera I own, that uses this type battery.  My old camera used \\"AA\\" and I mean used them.  I had to keep at least 12 spare batteries ready because after a few shots the batteries were dead. Also, it is light and doesn't take much space in my camera bag, compared to 12 \\"AA\\" batteries.  So in comparison to them, this battery is great, in every feature. As compared to other batteries of the same kind, I cannot say how it compares. But for hours of shots with one battery, this is the one. Since it is still new, I don't know how long it will last. I am anxious to see, but for now, it keeps going and going, and going.

B000ZLFALI|4.0|Now  to start this is nowhere near as bad as Sgt Peppers (which i actually love because its so weird). Across the Universe is a pretty well thought out drama/musical with some very memorable scenes and takes on classic Beatles songs and the turbulance of the Sixties. In particular the acting of the Jude JoJo Max and Sadie characters are outstanding- however i found Lucy and Prudence uninspiring. Guest slots by Bono Joe Cocker and Eddy Izzard were handled well and Bono in particular steals his brief scenes. The film is long, starts rather tepid- some scenes and songs dont work, but when they do they are very effecting and i must add that there are truly some \\"pyschedelic\\" parts which are not only creative but also historically important. The songs ofcourse are arranged differently and no original Beatles music appears but in particular the Strawberry fields scene really was amazing and gives you another perspective on the song.<br />This is a musical and im no fan of musicals but there is plenty of regular drama styled moviemaking going on so dont get put off by the idea of a musical- its similiar to the recent Tim Burton Johnny Depp movie in this  regard. To sum it up its a look back on youth love and music of the sixties which in my opinion was the greatest cultural moment in our history not only musically but on almost every level from politics to fashion. Special mention of the highly visual and artistic directing must be made and if anything see it for the eye candy alone. There are scenes that were very impressive and i plan on buying the dvd to be able to watch again.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie is very cute, my teenage daughter loved it, and since Heath Ledger recently passed away, I purchased 3 movies that he starred in and that I adore.

078617286X|5.0|Ralph Cosham performs a superb reading of E. H. Gombrich's world history for children. His gentle voice and respectful tone are a perfect match for E. H. Gombrich's splendid and charming retelling of history. Gombrich never forgets who his intended readers are--children and young adults--and how he must engage them and not leave them behind. At the same time, he never patronizes his readers. A lesser reader could have spoiled author's efforts by overlaying the wrong tone or sensibility--such as, history is meant to be endued, not enjoyed; the student should be left anxious and guilt ridden, never astounded and enthralled by the best story ever told.     This is the perfect spoken book for long rides in a car or for long walks. I love every minute of it and I will hunt down other reading by Cosham.
0375842381|5.0|This post is to encourage wary religious parents to allow their children to read \\"His Dark Materials.\\"    I first read \\"His Dark Materials\\" when I was about 12 years old. I thought the first book was great, the second book all right, and the third book too long and kind of weird. I understood that the main characters killed God, and opened up the underworld, but I couldn't understand its implications - to me, Pullman had just chosen a god-like figure to be Voldemort in his story - a god-like figure which bore little resembalence to the God I learned about it Sunday School. All I saw was a great adventure story that got a little preachy towards the end.    But these are not children's books. I re-read them at the age of 20, and found to my delight that they were a richly fascited re-telling of Genesis, the implications of which only become clear after lengthy explanations in the third book. Pullman offers an interesting critique of the Christian ideals of obedience to God, restrained living and the value of eternal life against the backdrop of a richly embroidered world.     For the religious, like me, some of these conclusions are disturbing. Pullman posits that in his alternative universe, which contains higher beings like angels and God himself, humans are still the best judges of morality - a stark contrast to Christianity, Islam and other major religions.     However, the good news is parents is that your son or daughter will not be able to pick up on these themes until they are at least fifteen, and have had a decent literature class - something most kids don't have until college. I'm sure your children are bright, and excellent readers. It doesn't matter. These books are dense, and most kids simply won't be able to pick up on implications of Lyra's first kiss, or the sexual innuendo in the third book.     Instead, religious parents should let their kids read these books, and more liberal parents should give these books to their teenagers to offer them an interesting, and unusually lucid critique of religion.
B000002MU3|4.0|I remember Michael Stipe saying that if the album \\"Up\\" came out from a brand new band who the public knew nothing about people would go hog wild for it.  That's how I feel about Monster.  I think if this album existed in a vacuum, without any of R.E.M's history and context to shade people's reactions, it would be regarded as a masterpiece.  Every song has an original, exciting melody that fits surprisingly well in the gigantic swamp of guitars that frames each song (I know it's R.E.M. heresy but I believe these melodies are on par with those found on Murmur).  It's actually quite surprising Stipe's voice is so clear and up front in these songs.  That's a testament to the recording and mixing quality.  The lyrics reach a perfect crossroads of Slogans & Poetry here on Monster.  It's a beautiful album that vibrates you into bliss with distortion.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|After a 12-year absence, Bruce Willis returns as New York detective John McClane in this disappointing \\"Die Hard\\" sequel. Willis delivers the \\"yippee ki yay\\" goods, but the film lacks a strong cast, coherent scripting and the firm hand of director John McTiernan. The cyber-terrorist plot is a letdown after McClane's cat-and-mouse games with the Gruber brothers - further hindered by cartoonish action sequences and a ludicrous climax. Though slightly better than \\"Die Hard 2,\\" this fourth installment doesn't measure up to the Willis-McTiernan collaborations.
B000U7169M|2.0|The movie manages to build a pretty decent momentum till about a quarter way till the end of the film. At that point, it steers off into an insanely unrealistic, stupid plot that is less a scary thriller and more a big laughable blooper reel. Except that it isnt a blooper reel, it's actually part of the movie and is taking itself seriously (unfortunately for the view). It was nice to see AnnaSophia Robb (Because of Winn-Dixie, Bridge to Terabithia) in a movie role again - that girl has an incredibly bright cinematic future.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|EDIT: I was amazed that there were no reviews of this powerful work by Michael Moore (the reviews didn't show on my screen).  This is informative and personal and will affect every person in the US who thinks that their healthcare is adequate.<br /><br />The system is in the hands of the insurers and pharmaceutical companies, and so is your health and financial security.  The majority of bankruptcies declared last year were from medical debt after insurance paid for a portion of the bill.<br /><br />I now will tell you my personal experience over the past 12 months rather than using Moore's examples.<br /><br />(1)  A family member got a super-bug and was hospitalized after two rounds of meds ($800), but his insurance didn't begin until $1801.  Almost $3000 out-of-pocket for one illness is more than a month's salary for a lot of people.<br /><br />(2) A family member got meningitis, then had a hole in his heart repaired through an artery.  The former was on an outpatient basis (10 days of co-pays), and the total cost was in excess of $18,000, of which state employee health insurance paid 90%, leaving co-pays, meds and 10%, or $2000+ out-of-pocket for one mosquito bite.  The heart operation brought another $2500 out-of-pocket two months later.  That's $4500+, not including the cost of medications, and loss of wages - having run out of sick days by then.<br /><br />(3) Our grandchild was having seizures of undetermined origin, so a sleep lab was ordered.  The insurer rejected the hospital a block from their home (not on their approved list), and the approved one was remodeling their lab, so it would be at least a month.  They offered 70% coverage after the co-pay.  A child with seizures should not have to wait, so the parents had to pay cash up front($800) plus meds and co-pay.  Her tonsils were obstructing her breathing (up to 50 seconds at a time), so they had to drag the child across town to the approved hospital for the tonsillectomy and another 10% of the bill plus co-pay and meds.  If this is the answer, the total will be in excess of $3000 out-of-pocket - with insurance, and loss of pay since again, sick days have been used up caring for a child with seizures.<br /><br />(4) Today, a friend's baby was diagnosed with infant botulism.  To receive the meds, the insurance company must approve and pay a whopping $45,000 up front, plus a hospital stay in excess of $55,000.  Why the high cost?  Botulism meds have been recategorized as orphan drugs!  The family is hoping that the insurance company will approve the treatments and the meds will arrive in time.<br /><br />These families haven't gone under because we paid their bills.  Are you ready to shoulder these outrageous bills for your family and friends?  How long will it be before you are the one with the unexpected expense?  Will you have to delay retirement because your husband died on the operating table and insurance didn't pay for the $70,000 cost above their approved amount (this happened to a friend of ours who is still working at age 71).<br /><br />If I have scared you into thinking about this, watch Moore's interviews, then pass the DVD around.

B000YA9R3C|2.0|This film is a great character study and showcases Daniel Day Lewis' superb acting skills. If you wanted it to be anything other than that, don't waste your money.    The first dozen pages of script must have been all white because there is no dialog for the first 10 minutes. An hour later, you are beginning to wonder where this movie is going as there is no inciting incident and no story arc to hold your interest. Two hours later, the movie ends with sub-plots dangling from the theater ceiling and no redemptive theme in sight. Not a movie Americans will like (although I'll bet the French will love it).    Cinematography is rich and acting and casting very enjoyable; DDL has his hunch and limp down pat. The music however hovers between nerve jangling percussion rimshots to a screeching discordant violin torture from some Strauss etude.    All in all, a terrible waste of money, which means it will no doubt sweep the Oscars.    P.S. There is very little blood in There Will Be Blood

B000Y179KO|3.0|Longtime Eagles fans will hate this album the first few times they listen to it.  I did.  However, one song will stick out as having a traditional Eagles sound: How Long.  That should be no surprise since they performed it originally in 1972 (no joke, you can see them perform it live from 1972 on YouTube).  That song will be the hook that grabs you and keeps you listening hoping for something else worthwhile.    Unlike other Eagles albums, this one is both great and terrible simultaneously.  Roughly half the songs are great and the rest are junk regardless of how many times you listen.  The bad ones have terribly amateur high-school-bandish lyrics (sorry Timothy B Schmidt) whereas Waiting In The Weeds has mature and introspective lyrics from Don Henley.  Had they thrown out the junk filler songs, they could have published a single CD and it would be fantastic.    So you've listened to the album and it sucks except for How Long.  That one song will act as a foot in the door for the rest of the album.  Don Henley fans will grow to love songs like Too Busy Being Fabulous and Waiting In The Weeds; the latter being akin to Henley's underrated Month Of Sundays song.  Glenn Frey fans will grow to love Somebody and No More Cloudy Days.      So you've got good songs by Henley and Frey, but what about Joe Walsh?  He has many many hits from his non-Eagle days and even his Eagles songs are memorable (Pretty Maids All In A Row).  However, his songs on this album fall flat and fade towards Muzakish unimportance.  Even his attempt to be humorous falls flat in the shadow of his solo hit Life's Been Good.    The best way to enjoy this album is to condense it down to the good songs (these songs will grow on you).  Here is my suggested list:  1) Waiting in the Weeds  2) Somebody  3) No More Cloudy Days  4) Center of the Universe  5) Too Busy Being Fabulous  6) Long Road Out Of Eden (a bit slow, but I included it anyways)    7) You Are Not Alone  8) It's Your World Now  9) How LongIt's true that the entire album on average is slower than Eagles fans are used to.  It sorely lacks the rock rythms of Don Felder. His absence is noticable on tracks like Long Road Out Of Eden where he could've injected a memorable solo.  Joe Walsh does his best, but don't forget that Felder was the man behind the music on the hit Hotel California.    In the end, this album is more a collection of everybodys' solo styles; Henley and Freys' songs tend to grow on you while the Walsh and Schmidt songs fade into the background.  The best way to enjoy this album is to take the two CD's and make yourself a custom single CD with the good songs.  Maybe they'll do a little editing next time.
B000002UC5|5.0|I have this album and purchased the CD to go into my collection. This is McCartney's best with Band on the Run next to the Best.  There are a few strange songs on here, but that is what makes this so unique. Also if I remember correctly, McCartney played each instrument on this album plus vocals. In my opinion, that is \\"amazing\\".. Maybe I'm Amazed is still one of the best songs ever made.  It is \\"mood\\" music also.

B000056N8X|4.0|I've been reading some of the reviews listed here and believe that the problem lies in trying to make this movie a sequel to the first three Highlander movies. I don't see this movie that way. The first Highlander movie starring Christopher Lambert was fantastic, even if our Scottish hero did have a French accent. As most will agree, the second and third movies (with the exception of Sean Connery's reincarnation) were chaotic trash and I've decided to mentally remove them from my Highlander experience. For me, after the first movie comes the excellent series with Adrian Paul as a younger McLeod. After the series, Highlander: Endgame worked well as an additional Highlander fix for those of us who miss the series. Granted the movie played more like an extended episode of the series than it did a movie release, but I've seen that happen before. (Star Trek: Insurrection comes to mind.) While I would have liked to have seen more Methos in this movie, my only real beef with the movie was due to a storyline inconsistancy. Throughout the series it was stated that Duncan had never married. In one episode, a gypsy foretold that Duncan would never marry. And yet, here was Duncan's wife from a couple hundred years ago. That blatant a change in the back story caused me to give the movie 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and highly suggest that anyone interested in Highlander should watch them in the order I now place them. First, Highlander the movie, second, Highlander the series and third, Highlander: Endgame. I think you'll find the Highlander experience much more enjoyable this way.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show is the first show to peak my intrest since.... well... ever. Its original depiction of modern-day Vav Helsings hunting evil while searching for there father. All the evils that the brothers face have been depicted, as accuratly as possible, from historic lore and legends about them. This, I believe, is what separates this show from all the rest. The mixture of classic rock, movies, and american muscle cars also gives the show a life of its own.

B000002UAX|4.0|Unbelievable that this album was written and recorded forty years ago.  There are songs on it that are so fresh.  \\"Blackbird\\" remains one of those simplistic works of magic that can happen in a studio.  Some songs are pure rebellion and some are all about searching for whatever.  This album was created during and right after their trip to the Ashram which ended poorly - this album is such a picture of not just the Beatles history, but a picture of musical and world history.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This has become one of my favorite adaptations of any of Jane Austen's books. The script writer and producer brought out the emotions and character of Anne and Captain Wentworth very well. (The  ending is the best!) They also told the story in a easy-to-understand way. (The 1995 Amanda Root 'Persuasion' was  confusing to my entire family, since they had not read the book, and I was continually having to explain who everyone was and what was going on to them as we watched it!) We also like the actors for Anne and Captain Wentworth better. This new adaptation is my (and my family's) absolute favorite version of 'Persuasion'! :)    On more thing.. if you saw this film on PBS and found it choppy or confusing, there is a reason!  There were several scenes cut out of the movie when it was shown on TV.  Some of them are short, but a few are longer and they really help the movie flow better! Some parts that were a little unclear when we watched it on TV now make much more sense since  we saw the WHOLE film on DVD!! Especially understanding Captain Wentworth's feelings. :)
0780624890|5.0|I've been doing my own reading and retrospective on vampires over the last couple of weeks after seeing \\"I am Legend\\" with Will Smith. So I decided to go back to the iconic source. Having not read Dracula in years, I decided to read it again and began by comparing it to the contemporary (1992) movie version...Coppola's \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" starring Gary Oldman. When I initially read the story as a child, I focused more on my stereotyped \\"Dracula as performed by Bella Lugosi\\" and not Stoker's original version. Reading Stoker in the original again I was charmed by the writing style and mores of the times. It holds up well. I then watched Coppola's movie which was tarted up and sexualized for today's audience. While Oldman's over the top performance is great fun to watch, the book is so much better. And if I were Stoker, I would be turning in my grave since the movie version barely follows the book and yet is \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\".      I then dragged Blade out of my movie collection.  It is great campy fun.  The first club scene is absolutely classic and really sets the mood for the rest of the movie.  This is my favorite Wesley Snipes movie and he really delivers.  And I love Kris Kristofferson's dissipated, whiskey voiced as Blade's compadre.   The action drags a little bit in the middle, but the end is satisfying, and the bad guy really radiates \\"evil bad\\".  So you are cheering Blade to the end.  Yes, I know this is a B movie, and it has nothing to do with the iconic original dracula.  But if you love vampire movies, I recommend this highly.  It holds up well even though it it a decade old.
0394826817|3.0|Since it's difficult to get children to sit and read often, this book is a bit difficult without \\"real-life\\" situations and examples, so whenever I take my child out, I always try my best to make sure that she hears me say \\"please\\" and \\"thank-you\\" so she will learn those niceties as well as other cultural assistance that will make her a young lady throughout life even if life often doesn't accommodate.  This book will be put up until she is ready for the harder concepts of visualization, until she can put reality together with the written word, but it is a WINNER!!!
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Blade II: derivative and unoriginal compared to Blade I.

And I loved Kris Kristofferson's dissipated, whiskey voiced character as Blade's compadre.      Next I picked up Blade II.  Definitely not as original or as good as the original Blade.  Kristofferson is back and lends the same whisky voiced cynical foil to Blade, but the rest of the movie didn't grab me as much. The first scene or two were fun, but the rest of the movie was only so so.  I couldn't find the bad guy \\"or guys\\" to be as compelling.  Overall rating: \\"4\\", but it is a derivative \\"B\\" movie which I can only recommend to true Snipes fans.
0307165485|5.0|This book was one of my main teaching aids growing up; however, my child will need some time to understand Richard Scarry's concept (along with some of his other books as well) of combining several theories and objects on one page that can confuse a young or developmentally challenged child.  Not saying that it's impossible, but would take time.  I say let them get interested in colors and basic shapes first, then direct them to the pictures and start introducing them to what they are by definition.  Not only are there definitions and body parts and other concepts, but short and concise stories too if you can capture your child's interest long enough to sit still to listen to your reading and place the story with the pictures in a concept that they understand.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a classic. It's a to read book. Orson Scott Card creates a believable world and a wonderful hero. I think this book is a good read for all ages. It's a book you can read over and over again and still get something from it. It's thoughtul and deep and is a great read for teen boys too.
0307155102|5.0|This is an excellent book after the child has understood concepts of numbers, colors, shapes and is beginning to explore the world around them.  It explores the home, the market, cars, trucks, planes, and other concepts that are around them sometimes and that they see not only in person, but possibly on t.v. or talk about in school in class or with family and friends.  It also covers the parts of the body and clothing items too.  LLO'C
B00005RHGK|4.0|Trisha (Gina Phillips) and Darry (Justin Long) are a college-aged brother and sister driving home on Spring break.  Typical of that age, Darry is bringing his laundry home for his mother.  All is normal until they encounter someone with what appears to be the most severe case of road rage ever.<br /><br />Out of nowhere, a massive, paint smeared, rusted, ominous truck appears.  It even comes with the loud, obnoxious, fog horn.  In a matter of no time, it's on the kid's bumper, tailgating and honking, scaring the hell out of them.  They eventually let it get by, and the license plate is revealed: BEATNGU...foreshadowing.<br /><br />Just as their fear and worry has subsided, they run upon the same scary truck parked at an old, abandoned church.  The driver is outsie of the vehicle, and appears to be tossing bodies wrapped in bloody sheets down a large pipe of some sort.  Unfortunately for them, the person sees them and quickly jumps in the Fearmobile for the chase.  This time, however, the truck starts ramming the kids' car and scaring Darry and Trish until they run off the road.<br /><br />What follows is a tale of fear, as brother and sister go back to investigate the pipe, and uncover a grisly reality that will shock and terrify them.<br /><br />The unfortunate part of this movie is that the bad guy turns out to be a completely cheesy, winged, alien of some kind.  When it is presumed to be a mysterious, evil man, the fear is much more palpable.  But when the large human/bat/chicken thing shows itself, the tone is completely different.  And don't even get me started on the whistling - completely stupid.  After an entire movie of mystery, suspense, and genuine terror, the killer's ridiculousness acts as the cold shower to the movie's built up heat.
0385474547|5.0|This book was required reading material in a sophomore-level college literature course that I had to get the Dean's approval to take because of my Freshman status.  It was thought provoking; yet didn't drive me to the means to the end.  I understood the socio-economic breakdown as well as the fact that there was a factor of pride versus the inevitable versus the fact that no family clan that had known this honorable man would assist him in his time of need.  I found it compelling; yet similar to one of many of the Greek and other tragedies except it was written by an African-American in a very well thought-out, well written and easy to follow structured piece of literature.  The story line I did not like, but I purchased the book to always remind me that I could always have it worse.  LLO'C
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|A pratriarchal period of history is taken from the woman's perspective and strewn with magic and lore. It's a great escape novel. Enjoy.
B0006Z2KX4|4.0|There are few who come close to Cary Grant when it comes to making the great screwball comedy.  From \\"His Girl Friday\\" to \\"The Philadelphia Story\\", Grant's genius of the genre is obvious for all to see.  Here in this dvd we get great acting from a great cast and a great script also makes for an enjoyable movie that ages better than one would expect from a film that's more than 70 years old.<br /><br />The visuals are improved somewhat with the digital remastering but the audio which is in the original mono leaves much to be desired.  I found the bonus extras on the second disc to be a real plus though.  We get two documentaries on the life and legacy of Cary Grant as well as that of the director Howard Hawks.  I also found the comedy short and the cartoon entertaining as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie and this dvd is a good way to view it although it would have been better if they we able to improve the sound quality to a 5.1 surround option the way Disney did with \\"Snow White\\".
B00004SW9R|5.0|This was the doctor's first release as a solo artist. I still think it's his best work. It shimmers with gumbo and voodoo capturing the mysterious atmosphere of the \\"Big Easy,\\" New Orleans.
B000IVW25M|5.0|This is not just a dvd of the original full feature length animated movie of the 1930s but is a whole entertainment device all by itself.  In addition to the full length feature remastered both audio and visually, we get interactive games, many documentaries, radio broadcasts, a Barbara Streisand music video of a remake of \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come\\" and many \\"hidden\\" links that will provide your youngster with hours upon hours of entertainment.<br /><br />Disney has hit upon a great way to make the DVD more than just a passive medium and has fully exploited all the ways to bring out the full potential of this powerful new medium.  I just wonder how much better this would be once they get around to putting this on the Blu-ray platform!  For adults like me, I still found myself fully enjoying this DVD and especially for the well remastered visuals and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound option in addition to the old mono original.<br /><br />This Platinum Edition Series is a brilliant idea that is very well executed by Disney and it leaves me very interested in getting all the other movies in this series such as \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" as well.<br /><br />Full value for money and well worth getting for your kids.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0736063684|4.0|Good book for technique but needs to be used with knowlege of some program of selected excercises.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I already loved the cinema version, but this one, which is about 3h long is fantastic!  Much more details, there is also the story about Isabellas' son and much more of the queen itself. You also learn something about Balian's fammily. All these details give the movie much more depth.
B000TEUSJU|1.0|I bought this \\"Imperial Edition\\" of Caligula to satisfy my curiosity.  Sets:  Good.  Lighting:  Moderately good.  Direction:  Adequate.  Screenplay:  Poor.  Acting:  Good.    Personally I found this entire production to be profoundly depressing and a waste of time to view.  Also a waste of money.    I have also learned through experience that the majority of films Malcolm McDowell chooses as to appear in are/were awful, with the notable exceptions of \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"O, Lucky Man.\\"  He even admits this in his interviews.  Be warned.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|If you loved the new Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightly as a Pride & Prejudice fan then you will love this version of Persuasion. It does include some things in the movie that is not in the book and it also changes some things making them not exactly right but it's nothing really worth complaining about. Overall, it is still a really great movie and because the leading actors work so well together, it makes up for the lack of faithfulness to the book.

0321544080|5.0|When I got the book, I simply could not put it down until I finished it. This will most likely be the best book published on photography in year 2008. Let me share few of my thoughts on why.    Joe McNally is one of the most famous and most successful photojournalists of our time. He shoots all kinds of things, but he's best known for his people photography. Joe is also considered to be an outstanding teacher, and it shoes through the book.    Joe has an amazing talent of taking an individual or a group of people and capturing them in a way that you don't need any explanations. Each photo of his is an essay in itself. So if you like shooting people, for journalism, or simply for family history purposes, you will simply love just looking at the pictures presented here. In fact, the book would be worth it even if it cost 10 times of what it costs now ($32) just for the collection of images presented there. They are outstanding, and what's good, the quality of printing is very good too. And if you're not yet shooting people, this book will make you start shooting them, as there is not a subject that is more exciting.    Besides photos, Joe also presents stories behind them, including how he lit the objects and why. This kind of information is what made the book extra captivating for me. He's got a talent of telling stories in a way that you can't stop reading them. You open a page, see an image that blows your mind away, and on top of that, you get a story of how it was created, along with the guiding principle behind it, or \\"one-liner\\" that is easy to remember. He shares photography wisdom with in every section of the book, and many of his pearls will be quoted by teachers and writers on the topic of photography for years to come.    He also gets personal and shares stories of his struggles from the time he was a beginner to the present day. You'll hear details about how he once destroyed six cameras in one day, or about what image jump started his career, or about his tries to be a good parent to his children when he was away most of the time as they were growing. I am always impressed when people of his caliber talk about their mistakes and failures so openly. It also makes you take your own mistakes more easily.    In summary, through his book Joe McNally has inspired me, has made me better photographer through his own example, both in terms of technical aspects and creativity, and once again has made me want to go out and keep shooting. I was sad the book was over, but it's one of these books that I will read again and again. It is for sure as good as any book I have read on the topic of the art of photography, and you're losing out if you have not yet ordered your copy.
B000NQPZCO|5.0|This movie ranks with Godfather I and II and Goodfellas for the best Mafia flicks of all time. Fuhgeddaboudit, this movie is no fugazzi.<br />Buy this on Blu-ray and enjoy it more than ever.<br />I find myself buying my favorite DVD movies again in blu-ray format. The picture and sound are worth the upgrade; much like the advancement from VHS to DVD.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|I have been to Vegas several times, but always missed Celine's show for one reason or another.  After seeing this Blu-Ray I really am sorry that I missed such a fantastic show.  This has moved to the top of my Blu-Ray library and will definitely be the demo disc when showing off my BD player.    I encourage anyone that thinks they may like Celine or that likes a good BD to pick this one up.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|The Showtime series Dexter, an adaptation of Jeff Lindsey's Dexter series, follows close enough to the book not to disappoint the book's fans and adds enough shock and surprise to keep everyone on their toes.  The acting is devilish, and the charactors are fully developed.  I give Dexter a deffinate 5 stars!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is a great make over in color. My wife & I lovede it even more than the balck & white. You have to watch them both.
B000MG1ZGA|1.0|This is NOT the original recording.  It has been remixed.  Bad idea. I don't understand why the Doors albums were remastered in 1999, but only released in the US in that box set.  The '99 remasters sounded great.  But remixed??  I think even the average listener would be able to tell that something just doesn't sound right here.  It isn't the same classic recordings you're used to hearing.<br /><br />Now, why am I against the remixes?  Well, for one, it opens the door to reinterpretation.  I mean, why not get a whole host of remixers for the project?  You could have today's top DJs remixing classic albums from every era.  You could buy the Paul Oakenfold version of LA Woman for when you want that combination of Jim Morrison and super sexy deep club beats.  Why not just put the raw tracks on DVD audio and let the listener \\"remix\\" for themselves?  Maybe you could get some guest musicians to add tracks to the original recordings.  I mean, maybe what LA Woman really needs is a Slash guitar solo.  Or how about getting Napalm Death to add some crunchy heaviness to Roadhouse Blues?<br /><br />Do you get the point?  If you start rearranging the past, where do you stop?  And now these remixed CDs are taking the place of the original catalog, so new listeners will be hearing something totally different than what we originally heard and fell in love with.  Classics are classics for a reason.  Remastering for higher fidelity is one thing, but remixing, rearranging, and reinterpreting are quite another.
B000YPUF9W|1.0|i only rented this cause a friend told me too, and thats the last time i take my friends advice on movies.  now i didnt see the first 2 but im glad i didnt, cause this movie didnt entertain me at all.  i love zombie movies and even though there were zombies in this film it wasnt as gory as it should be and zombie films should be funny and gory. this was neither.  this should only appeal to the die hard fans of this trilogy and im praying those are few and far between
B000TGJ80I|5.0|How could you not love a 1080p picture and tons of gratuitous violence between werewolves and vampires. Seriously!! I thought this movie was going to be a joke. Next thing you know, I'm ordering the sequel. I've watched both twice. Lots of gun play; tons of violent action; the graphics are awesome, the story keeps your attention and Kate Bekinsale in vinyl. You have to be dead not to like this (pun intended).
B000R7I3LY|4.0|In a nut shell, this cd is definately music that you will enjoy. Every song is something different. My personal feeling is that I feel uplifted after listening to it. Sorry if that sounds corney, but it's a good thing when you are having a bad day. I gave it 4 stars only because there are a few songs that are kind of boring, but I would definately recommend this album.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Tim Burton movies are not exactly for everyone.  They're usually dark and bizarre films.  But Burton certainly has his own style that attracts lots of movie goers.  This is a movie for Tim Burton followers.  It may even be a good movie for those who don't normally like musicals.<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Benjamin Barker.  A man who has returned from being wrongfully imprisoned for fifteen years.  When he returns he assumes the name Sweeney Todd.  He meets a woman named Mrs. Lovett, played very well by Helen Bohnam Carter.  She tells Todd that the judge who imprisoned him poisoned and killed his wife and has taken his daughter Johanna.  Todd swears revenge on Judge Turpin (played by Alan Rickman).  In order to do that, though, he'll have to re-establish himself.  In a contest to see who can be the best barber he wins and opens up shop.  Now it's just a matter of time before the Judge is seated in his chair.  Except there are a few problems in his midst.  The first is the barber he won against.  Who knows Todd's true identity.  The second is Anthony, the man he returned with.  Anthony fancies Johanna and the judge is not too happy about that.  When Judge Turpin is within Todd's midst, Anthony ruins it all.  This causes Todd to go mad and ultimately become the Demon Barber of Fleet Street.<br /><br />Despite being based off the Stephen Sondheim production, Sweeney Todd has a lot of Tim Burton's trade packed into it.  Unusually pale characters, wild hairstyles and impressive set designs.  This is Tim Burton's sixth collaboration with Johnny Depp, and it may be the best role Depp has filled for Burton since Edward Scissorhands.  He manages to bring life to Todd's character and make him scary and malicious.  Just the same, Helen Bohnam Carter serves as the perfect companion.  Like Depp, her hair is wild and she's a misunderstood character just like Todd is.  Together on screen they're perfect.  The best part about the movie may be the singing and music itself.<br /><br />Tim Burton has been known to work with Danny Elfman when it comes to music in his films.  Since this is based off a musical, however, Burton doesn't use Danny Elfman's help and instead relies quite heavily on the source material he was given.  A lot of the music and lines comes from Sondheim's play.  Despite being a musical, however, the movie isn't drowned out in song.  There's actually a good balance of spoken dialog and musical numbers.  All the cast members can actually sing too.<br /><br />If there was anything that might ultimately turn audiences away, it would be the amount of blood featured in the movie.  Sweeney Todd definitely earns its \\"R\\" rating by easily being one of the bloodiest movies of 2007.  If you're a movie goer that has a lot of problems with blood, then Sweeney Todd is certainly not the movie for you.  Another thing that might not settle well with movie goers is learning that Mrs. Lovett puts the victims into the pies that are served to the town.  You never actually see Mrs. Lovett cook anyone, at least.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd is easily Tim Burton's best film in years.  The performances and singing are also incredible.  This is a good movie for Tim Burton fans.  This is a good movie for people who like musicals.  This is even a good movie for people who don't normally like musicals.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It is written from the perspective of 'Death' during WWII Nazi Germany.  It is one of the rare books that I actually felt moved enough to cry.  This is a wonderful book, the writing is eloquent and so descriptive that it draws you right into the book. A must read.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I was nervous that reading the books after seeing the first two seasons of Dexter would ruin the book for me. Not so.  They are done differently enough such that I was surprised with the ending.  The books take off on a very different direction.<br /><br />I'm both a fan of the show and of these books.  Very well written.<br /><br />Of course, you may find yourself disturbed that you find a serial killer more delightful that many humans, but that's just the chance you'll have to take.
B00001P4RI|5.0|The early years of Dead Can Dance were marked by a near electro sound at times, then latter the century spanning style developed through albums such as Spleen and Ideal, Aion, and Into the Labrynth.  The last, Labrynth, showcased Brendan Perry with Carnival is Over and How fortunate the man with none.  I have been a nut for anything that Perry has done, as well as Lisa Gerrard, and Perry's solo work continues the musical vein explored in Carnival is over and pushes it into an area that is strangely similar at times to Micheal Gira's Angels Of Light, though differing in subject matter and presentation. Vocaly the pieces resemble a dark Sinatra at times, introspective lyrics accompanied by synth sounding elements and basic percusion keep the experience going yet wondefully simple.  I suggest this to anyone that is a long standing DCD fan, or likes the darker, sweeter sounding timbres of Angels of Light, late Swans and even the new upcoming bands like Tear Wave and Autumn's Grey Solace as they owe a huge debt to Brendan Perry.  A great album for any collector.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the best in my collection.  In fact, I've cross-indexed this to my classical section as well, and find myself listening to it at least once a week.  The composition, arrangement and conducting are superb, and the pieces range from euphoric to sweet to thoughtful to just plain fun.<br /><br />There are quite a few subtle nuances couched within the pieces, brought out by repeated listening. But this is not to imply that listening is work -- it's pure delight.<br /><br />Every music lover will find something to love in this work.  Although obviously designed as a collection of pieces to support the film, it holds together as a complete work, independent and whole.<br /><br />Even my teenage daughter (eclectic by nature) thoroughly enjoys this.<br /><br />Compliments to the composer, arranger, conductor and orchestra on an excellent work!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|probably one of the best movies ever, dosnt matter if your a Daft Punk fan or an anime fan its still amazing
B000AP04L0|5.0|This movie is so funny. After reading some of the bad reviews, it's apparent that some reviewers have never worked in an office or just simply don't have a sense of humor or don't understand sarcasm.    A good indicator of if you'd enjoy this movie is if you agree with the following statements...  Do you like satire?  YES  Do you like sarcasm?  YES  Does the perky office person drive you crazy?  YES  Did you enjoy watching any episode of Beavis & Butthead or King of the Hill?  YES  Are you tired of your boss being a jerk?  YES    If you ever worked in an office, you'd be able to relate to this movie. But it's not something you'd want your kids to watch if they're under 14.    YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE if you want to laugh!
B000PC8AFU|3.0|What is wrong with some of these people? I don't think Stevie Ray is coming out of his grave to put out any new material. Enjoy it for what it is, material from the vault that most people haven't heard. Hendrix stuff has been coming out almost 40 years after his death. Zappa has almost 200 hours of material stashed away. The record companies suck, it's true, but this is for the hardcore fan. Stop bitching. I don't normally post but some of you guys are ridiculous.

B000U7ZTFO|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Tintin books and enjoy this animated series as well.  Originally produced in Canada (and broadcast a while back on HBO), it's a faithful rendering of the exciting and funny adventures of the boy reporter, his dog Snowy, and his friends Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, Thompson and Thomson et al.  What I especially like about the series is that they devote two episodes (40+ minutes) to each story, which really lets them capture the spirit of the books.  The rare exceptions are the one-episode stories (e.g., Red Rackham's Treasure), which feel rushed.  If you're new to Tintin, I might start with The Black Island, which is one of the earlier adventures and stands up well by itself.  Note also that this series is generally unavailable on DVD in the U.S. unless you buy it from a third-party seller (not Amazon).
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I really liked the complete series. Finally I had a chance to see all episodes. I am really sorry they didn't continue. And the bonus photos and description of all episodes is a plus.

B00005YJMX|5.0|If life is but a dream, then Herzog's re-imagining of [[ASIN:B000VUQ4HW F.W. Murnau's classic horror film]] is a splendid nightmare.  The film begins in the dreams of Lucy Harker, her mind's eye rolling over mummified corpses in a catacomb to the lull of strangely soothing demonic chants.  Roused from her beautiful nightmare with a scream, Lucy is comforted back to sleep by her dull husband, Jonathan.  Her head touches the pillow again, and Herzog's Nosferatu begins.<br /><br />There are so many brilliant things about this film, but perhaps its greatest strength is the sense that Lucy never wakes up again.  The harsh, contemptible reality of the next morning, scored with sickeningly syrupy music, and adorned with overwhelming sun blindingly reflected on harsh whites while the persistent chirp of young kittens in the background almost makes one nauseous, slowly and gradually gives way to the beautiful dream reality of the night, which gratuitously blankets everything by the film's end.  As Harker undertakes his mission into the Carpathian Mountains, strongly desiring to get away from his boring hometown \\"where canals go nowhere,\\" the sun begins its descent and camera-work, sound, music, and even acting grow richer with the sun's slow demise.<br /><br />For most of the film, Klaus Kinsky proves to be the richest ingredient, as one would expect.  He is awkward, decrepit, dangerous, and beautiful; a true testament to the Gothic.  Kinsky is almost unrecognizable in his makeup, movements, and general characterization.  There is no [[ASIN:6305972761 Aguirre, Wrath of God]] to be found within any crinkle of his ghastly face.  He is thoroughly inhuman, thoroughly disturbing, and yet thoroughly deserving of our pathos at many points in this rich film.<br /><br />What surprises me most about this film, though, beyond the brilliant lighting, eerie framing and movement (often with shots that come directly from Murnau), and even the masterful performance of Klaus Kinsky, is the presence of Lucy Harker (played by Isabelle Adjani) in the film's final act.  When we first see Lucy in harsh daylight at the beginning of this film, she is pretty, yet boring and restrained.  The true beauty and vivacity that she beheld in the twilight hours between nightmares has been wiped from her face, and it's hard to blame Harker for leaving her in search of Count Dracula, even though we know it's wrong.  Yet, as the film descends into gothic darkness, Lucy is slowly and surely transformed, more sullen and more beautiful each time we revisit her.  By the final act, Lucy is left as our reluctant protagonist, nearly as pale as Count Dracula and far more beautiful and deserving of our pathos as even she recognizes her slow journey toward inevitable death.  It is nearly impossible to resist falling in love with Adjani as we watch her wrestle faith and love with demons, both physical and mental.<br /><br />The climax is wrought with gothic dreams and cinematic visions blurring with contemptible reality.  Acting is incomprehensibly potent, cinematography and scoring euphorically reek of death and, finally, as the light of day brings a brilliant final twist to the age old story of Count Dracula, Herzog sets us out into a quiet raging storm of day and night intermixing passionately.  It is an unforgettable moment, beautiful in its strangeness and depression -- a perfect summary of Herzog's masterpiece.<br /><br />Nosferatu, Phantom Der Nacht, is the perfect marriage of Herzog's vision with one of the silent era's greatest triumphs.  It takes the dream-like qualities of the silent horror film and transports them into a more able vessel with a brilliant navigator roped to the helm.er (played by Isabelle Adjani) in the film's final act.

B00005JPXY|3.0|Well, \\"The Descent\\" or \\"The Host\\" is not.  This movie doesn't rewrite the monster-movie flick but the amusement-ride-film.  By now yo know what it is about: what if the next alien-monster-disaster destroying New York was filmed by a bystander for us to see?  Nice initial idea, but not enough thinking about what to do next.  Why not go to the extreme and use the videos other people made that day?  Alternating between them?  Some bystanders filming others?  A journalist with his cameraman so as to get somebody with a motivation to get close to the monster? (a cliche, but a logical way to do it).<br />Well, I didn't like them stealing from \\"The Descent\\" (night-vision moment in the subway), but it was worth my 3 US dollars (cinemas in Argentina are cheap if you go at the matinee).
B00006879E|5.0|I always dislike someone giving me a CD because it is not usually one I would choose. Even though I happen to like a couple of songs an artist does, is not an indication I want to sift through several of their 'not so good' songs to hear them. That is not the case with this CD! I enjoyed every song on the disc. What a happy gift receiver I was. If you like any of Maroon 5's pieces, you will like this entire album.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This is a good show with great characters.  The imaginary world it created was complex and interesting.  I enjoyed watching it.  But the show had faults that I think are being overlooked because of its short life.      Because of the future setting, the writers tried to create an evolved language where the characters spoke mostly English with occasional words dropped in Chinese.  But it was too consistent.  There were (I believe) supposed to be about 70 inhabited planets, yet everywhere they went it seemed like everyone spoke in the same dialect.  And the use of made up (or possibly foreign) swear words didn't make the characters appear tough, it just came across as a juvenile end run around the censors.  There was also poor use of the menacing \\"Reavers.\\"  They had close calls so often in the first few episodes that I was completely tired of hearing about them.  Apparently so were the writers because they weren't mentioned at all in the next ten or so episodes.      Some of the episodes were highly gory.  This is not a flaw so much as something I feel I should mention in case you are squeamish.  I had to look away many times.    I focused on the negatives because there are already 3000+ reviews you can read if you want to know what is good about it.  All in all though, I really did like this show.  If it was still on, I'd be trying to catch all the new episodes.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|This movie captured me from the beginning. Felicity Huffman's character was very realistic. Her adventures with her \\"son\\"  were what was happening in the world today.

B0011NT4FM|4.0|Gentle Giant's third album was receives a terrific remaster by Eroc (who also did the remasters for \\"Octopus\\" and \\"Acquiring the Taste\\"). By tweaking the album during the remaster process Eroc has managed to keep the dynamic range intact and give more depth, warmth and greater detail to an already exceptional album. Although this was far from the Giant's best album (\\"Octopus\\" was the best for the line up featuring the three Shulman brothers while I prefer \\"In A Glass House\\" for the post-Phil Shulman releases), it's clear that the Shulman's had developed a strong identity and sound for their band.<br /><br />The concept album was based on Phil Shulman's memories of his school mates all of whom had different dreams about their lives and careers. The album follows them as they achieve or fail to achieve those ambitions, their friendship over a lifetime, etc. It's a very loose concept album where the individual parts stand up as individual songs.<br /><br />During the first couple listens I didn't notice any digital glitches (such as the ones that marred the first pressings of \\"Acquiring the Taste\\" and \\"Octopus\\")and the sound is stunning in its clarity and warmth. The only flaw is an indexing error that occurred on the original Columbia CD. Rep used this CD as a reference for the indexing on the NEW release unaware that it was a mistake on the original.<br /><br />As usual the playing is top notch. The melodies and harmonies still have a distinct medievel feel to them combined with a rougher, harder rocking sound than on the previous two releases. The Repertoire features the original credits (and the horrid original artwork where it looks like the three friends have transparent skulls or horrible hair pieces and are locked in sitting fetal positions)but this edition has been digitally remastered from digital tape copy of the original mastertape. Unlike the Japanese remaster of a few years ago, this is not horribly compressed (it was really noticeable on \\"Prologue\\" and \\"School Days\\" where Gary Green's guitar sounded distorted because whomever mastered it from the Columbia master or CD amped up the sound so that there was digital distortion all over the place and no dynamic range whatsoever. It did, admittedly, have more noticeable detail when played at a lower volume but that's because they compressed the heck out of the music).School Days\\" where Gary Green's guitar sounded distorted because whomever mastered it from the Columbia master or CD amped up the sound so that there was digital distortion all over the place and no dynamic range whatsoever.

0739343823|4.0|In this book John Grisham introduces his main character by having him captured and tortued in South America. Then as the plot progresses, we find out he is a thief and possibly a murderer. But the reader senses that he really is a good guy and relys on the ever more complicated plot to come to his rescue and justify his actions for us.<br />John grisham doesn't disappoint us. As the plot becomes more appearent, made believeable by the writters' obvious familairarity with the Gulf Coast and building the readers understanding of the rest of the characters who weave in and out of the plot. The reader can't help but place judgements on all of the actions of the players.<br />But, of course, things never turn out the way you think they will. Mr. Grisham, with a brilliant ending, turns everything around, making us think we may have had that suspicion all along. This reader also feels that a \\"sleepless in Seattle\\" sequel would be very welcomed.<br />The Grisham fan club will call this one of his best.

0195170776|5.0|Buying a dictionary is for me about getting enough words versus the size and weight of the book . With that in mind I find that I need a dictionary that has 250,000 words which this one has and with that comes a large heavy book . There just is no way to resolve this conflict . My only complaint is the photos of movie stars and presidents throughout. Why is this in there ? It will easily make the book dated in no time and more importantly seems to be sending a message that these are the really important people in the world.

Nothing Merchant Ivory has done is hackneyed. All their films resonate with a cultivated and cultured audience. This film is no exception.

B000F3T3CS|4.0|The acoustic is rather distant and hollow.  In other ways this DVD is close to opera heaven.  The sets and costumes are very pretty.  The orchestra plays and chorus sings with vivacious sweetness.  Some may find Villazon overly hammy.  For me, his loveable klutz Nemorino is a delight.  Netrebko plays the smitten Adina, who hides her feelings under a flirtatious veneer, adorably.  These two lovebirds sing with full-throated ease.  D'Archangelo is perfect as Dulcamara: cynical, knowing, confidently seductive, and sonorous.  The only slight disappointment is Leo Nucci.  Not because his singing is less than polished.  But in this company his blustery Belcore registers as a bit of a stage cliche.

0743496736|4.0|Jodi Picoult writes straightforward popular fiction that tackles topical issues. At her best, she creates believable characters who tell us about ourselves and the society we live in. At her worst, she coddles her characters to the point of overlooking their most unlikable traits until the reader can't stand the character and she goes in for the \\"shocker\\" that either isn't all the shocking or derails the story. Nineteen Minutes is Picoult at her best.    One could read this as a fictional retelling of the Columbine Shooting but Picoult goes for more and succeeds. Peter Houghton is the ever-so-slightly-different boy who is the target of the in-crowds relentless taunting at his high school. When he snaps, the consequences are tragic for all. Picoult then tells the rest of the story, switching between the present and flashback, her usual technique. Not many writers could pull this off as well as Picoult. She jumps back and forth in time without sacrificing the narrative drive, all the while adding small facts to the story of \\"why Peter did it\\" until his actions seem utterly inevitable.    At times Picoult's depiction of high school humiliation is hard to take. Whatever your high school memories, it's hard to read about Peter being taunted and humiliated without wanting to look away from the page. Picoult doesn't shy away from showing the cruelty of high school in all its painful details. She depicts Peter with such sympathy and care that the reader can't help but notice that his tormentors are two-dimensional at best. Then again, perhaps that is what makes them so cruel.    The other characters are well-drawn and interesting. Judge \\"Alex\\" Cornier and her daughter Josie take up the lion's share of the novel. While Picoult may want to take a break from courtroom confrontations in her next novel, this time her female lawyer lead didn't make me want to toss the book across the room every time she entered the narrative. Alex is borderline obsessed with being a judge and theproper appearance of being a judge. Even at home she can't let her guard down. When Alex begins planning how she will handle the case in which her daughter was a victim I didn't think I would be able to finish the book. I don't care how small the county is, no prosector or defence attorney would let the mother of a witness, even if she wasn't hurt, act as judge in the trial of the shooter. I kept thinking that this must be a sign that Alex has lost it.    Thankfully, the rest of the characters feel the same way. This saves Alex from becoming an insufferable, unwelcome character. She's still far from entirely likable in my estimation, but the more realistic circumstances she's forced to face makes her much easier to tolerate by the end of the book. This is in contrast to Her Sister's Keeper, where by halfway through I was hoping a massive tidal wave would take out 80% of the characters.    Picoult does resort to another shocker plot twist which I think half the readers will see coming. It's unnecessary but Picoult succeeds in making it at least meaningful to the story as a whole. Still, it is unnecessary.    This is not a feel good book. Parts are almost unbearably sad. For anyone who loves thoughtful popular fiction, however, it is worth reading.

B000002P2W|4.0|Far from the most renowned album by The Who, The Who by Numbers is perhaps the last great Who album.  Lacking both the high-minded approaches of The Who's rock operas as well as the well known hits of other efforts, By Numbers still manages to be one of the most cohesive pieces of rock n' roll that The Who created.  Solid from front to back, this album manages to hit on all cylinders, with great vocal and instrumental work across the album, and as one song centers on the vocals, another may be driven by the fantastic rhythm section, and yet another by stellar guitar work.  This variety lends a sense of fullness to the album and is mark of yet another great effort from The Who.  Good stuff!
1401300529|4.0|For most of us, anything we know about the Korean War is based on MASH, even though the movie and TV series were actually protests against the Vietnam War, placed in Korea because the southeast Asian conflict was too close at the time. Perhaps the southern California hills looked more like the terrain of Korea than the jungles of Vietnam, but the attitudes in the film and series reflected the changing 70's, not the 50's.    In a book finished just days before he died in an automobile accident, David Halberstam delivers a blockbuster about a war most wanted to just forget. His strongest descriptions are his portrayals of the key personnel. Douglas MacArthur, who basically ruled Japan and South Korea for the United States after World War II, comes across as too egotistical to understand what was happening in a country where he didn't spend a single night during the conflict, and too quick to blame others for his own massive mistakes. First the American forces in South Korea were too poorly trained and armed to defend against the unexpected invasion from the North. Then, when American troops and weapons began to flow in, and MacArthur launched a brilliant counterattack behind the North Korean lines, he sent badly split forces in summer uniforms racing towards the Chinese border as winter arrived. He assured everyone the Chinese would not intervene. When they did, they almost threw the Americans out of Korea.    Either MacArthur did this because he was clueless or because he actually wanted a nuclear war against Red China and he believed provoking Mao into an invasion of Korea would give him the opportunity. He was wrong and eventually was removed from his command for openly criticizing the political masters he refused to acknowledge.    China is key to this book. MacArthur was part of the China Lobby, the right wing politicians who accused the Truman administration of \\"losing\\" China, as if the United States could impose its will on a nation three times its size on theother side of the planet. Halberstam writes how China was actually lost by Chiang Kai-shek, the corrupt warlord who paid too little attention to the needs of his people. Ironically the American experts on China, the China Hands, who had spend years pointing out that Chiang was losing and the weapons sent to him immediately fell into the hands of the Communists, were later blamed by the China Lobby for the very disaster they had warned against.    Because men like George Kennan were ignored, the China Lobby couldn't see a split coming within what they saw as the monolith of international Communism. Halberstam hints that what now seems like the inevitable progression of the Cold War might have turned out quite differently had the United States taken a different approach to China, both before and after the Communist triumph.    I have two small qualms with this book. One is that while Halberstam rightly describes the American side over and over again as the United Nations, there is very little actual explanation of the UN role, aside from an occasional reference to a British or French unit involved in one of the battles. The massive error by the Soviets at the Security Council that allowed the UN to enter the war is hardly touched on. There is nothing about the other countries within the UN coalition or the politics that allowed them to take part.    The other qualm is that most of the actual battles of the conflict are hardly mentioned. Aside from in-depth profiles of two or three key battles, which are very extensive, the rest of the confrontations are only referred to in broader strokes. The book is almost 700 pages long, and is filled with deep and incisive profiles of major personalities involved. But except for the most important battles, the actual campaigns are mostly glossed over.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater in 3D and it was awesome.  Yes, I am disappointed that this is coming to HD-DVD since this format is losing popularity and is predicted to DIE within the next year, two at the most.  Blu-ray is just as clear AND it holds 10GB more info than HD-DVD.  Sales for Blu-ray players is increasing exponentially as HD-DVD players sales dwindle.  Warner's release of Harry Potter to Blu-ray ONLY was a HUGE indicator of where the market is going.  Also Disney who is very particular about the format for their classics has decidedly gone with BLU-RAY and will start rereleasing their movies such as \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" this year.  However, Paramount will come into the Blu-ray camp shortly as Warner (their partner in the HD-DVD format) has now converted 70% of their HD titles to Blu-ray.  Indiana Jones IV, a Paramount film yet to be released this spring is being discussed for the Blu-ray DVD format ONLY.  I would be surprised if BEOWULF isn't released in Blu-ray format by 2009 if not earlier by Christmas of 2008.  SO, if you can be patient and WAIT, you won't be disappointed.  This is a movie that only a Hi-def transfer does justice.  I personally am going to wait...

B00001MXXH|5.0|There are so many hilarious one-liners (or two- or three-liners) in this movie that it's impossible to choose just a few favorites. But FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF isn't just a comedy -- it's a whimsical, nostalgic look at high school and a lesson in not taking yourself too seriously.<br /><br />Ferris Bueller wakes up one morning late in his senior year and decides, for the ninth time that semester, that he doesn't feel like going to school. Ferris has no trouble employing melodramatic reverse-psychology on his parents (\\"I - I have a test today - I want to go to college and have a fruitful life.\\") and soon finds himself free for the day, with his parents off at work and his disgusted sister Jeannie at school.<br /><br />So he calls up Cameron, his best friend, who really is sick, because, as Ferris tells us, \\"He's the only person I know who actually feels better when he's sick.\\" Cameron's father barely pays him any attention, preferring to dote on his newly-restored red Ferrari. And it is this Ferrari that Ferris decides to drive to pick up his girlfriend Sloan from school.<br /><br />With Cameron's unheeded protests following them, the threesome spend their day, the last glorious day of truancy they can spend before going off to college.<br /><br />Cameron's story is what makes this more than just a comedy, more than just a lighthearted, funny movie. The symbolism of the car is well done and subtle, as is the portrayal of Cameron's relationship with his father, which rings true because of the many people I know with this exact same sort of parental problem.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great, funny, poignant movie, a tribute to living, instead of getting caught up in life.<br /><br />Rating: Very Good

B000063V8R|5.0|There are several compelling reasons to purchase this set:     This is by far the best of several great NG seasons; writing is crisp, the dialog is visceral, the tempo is great, and the shows are generally as good or better than you will find in earlier or later years.     The characters' development is proceeding on all fronts, human, Klingon, and crew-wise. The production, writing, and directing is nearing its peak.     But, as important as any of these are, don't forget ILM (div of LucasFilms) did the special effects. This is as high a quality of special effect as you will ever see in television. It is guaranteed with all the computer and CGI junk as there is now, you will not see better sci-fi action than this. MANY OF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL Next Gen SHOWS IN HI DEF. YOU MUST!! It is leaps and bounds better than other versions.    Many of us trekkers are just now getting the high quality 1080i or 1080p high def televisions. You will not believe how much better the quality of Next Gen is until you see it on one of these hi def sets. Get one with HDMI and upcoding, and it will up-convert your standard def show like Next Gen DVD TO HDMI and 1080i or p. It is unbelievable!! As good as the VHS tapes were, as good as you can record Trek off TV nowdays, the factory stuff with the Dolby Surround encoding cannot be beat. Many movies do not have the quality of these Trek shows. Some of these shows had as much as 3 Million in special effects budgets- for 1987 that was a ton of money. Some blockbuster films did not have much more budget than a single trek show!     So, add this new compelling element, top quality video, to the OTHER strengths of Season Three Next Gen and you have an all time winner. No collectors set of videos would be complete without Year 3, the Third Season, of Star Trek Next Gen. It is excellence personified. The stereo is near perfect, audio mixing is the best I ever heard (check out the subwoofer content in engineering scenes), surround is first class, the directing, writing, acting, and direction, cannot be beat for TV, and the special effects are as good as you will ever see. You can bet there will never be another Trek Next Gen. But if you have a high def television, you are in for a treat, as this is historic. The Pinnacle of television.     This is the complete package for Sci Fi and Trek fans. You get the action, the effects, the cerebral, philosophical nature of Trek, and video that cannot be beat, 19 hours of it, for 62$. Mighty hard to beat. Gene, the Great Bird of the Galaxy, would be proud. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some really classic trek and sci fi and at least get season three. If you are a trek fan, this one season is the least you can try out. Science Fiction simply does not get any better than this.

0393330435|1.0|I bought iWoz by Gina Smith but put it aside after the first 2 chapters. It is the biography of Steve Wozniak, one of the founders of Apple and has got to be one of the most irritating reads ever!!     The story of Apple's founding and growth is the stuff of legend but only if you can get past Steve's bragging and constant 'look at how amazing I am' pronouncements. It wore thin after a while. I kept putting it down after a couple of pages; had to drink some water to stop the gagging reflex! I hope Steve Jobs gets around to writing one himself or at least authorises someone to about Apple's founding some day.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|I like Quentin Tarantino movies but \\"Deathproof\\" was a drag...unless you like watching good looking women curse, get drunk and act like twits.  A particular scene at a diner came off as an actor's exercise--how many times can you use the n-word, the s-word and the b-word in a conversation.  Extra bonus points for using the f-word as an adjective.    These women weren't even discussing anything relevant to the story.  Yes, the scene where the three beauties beat psycho Stuntman Mike at his own game was terrific but the slog you had to go through to get there hardly made it worth the payoff.    I was really disappointed in this DVD and the fact that the fake trailers weren't included was another insult.
B0009J8FG8|5.0|This inspired concept album is incredibly rich and varied in its themes, musical styles and presentation. The lyrics are poetic whilst the music may be characterized as soulful folk-pop with orchestral infusions. The banjo plays a leading role but there are some scattered bursts of electrical guitar here and there.<br /><br />The songs encompass emotions from joy to melancholy, and are interspersed with colorfully titled brief instrumental snippets like A Short Reprise for Mary Todd or vocal ones like One Last Woohoo for the Pullman. For all its dazzling variety, the album is surprisingly cohesive and the following are my personal favorites:<br />The celebratory Come On Feel The Illinoise with its intricate arrangement, the buoyant Decatur with its witty rhyme scheme and lilting beat, the poignant and solemn Casimir Pulaski Day, the sensitive treatment of a horrible subject like John Wayne Gacy, the mix of sadness and elation in the rousing and catchy tune Chicago, Man Of Metropolis with its segments of hard rock guitar and the tender Tallest Man.<br /><br />Wow what a listening experience Illinois proved to be. On these exquisite melodies, Sufjan's intimate voice is often framed by the most elegant backing vocals over a rich and graceful instrumental mix. The music is infused with a stirring sense of spirituality. Illinois is the most inspiring and uplifting album I have heard in a long long time.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a costume drama based on the factual life of Queen Elizabeth I (played by Cate Blanchett, [[ASIN:B000OY8NBK The Good German]]). Blanchett reprises her role as the highly successful mother to a nation -- England -- from the 1998 film, [[ASIN:B000RF7XYO Elizabeth]].<br /><br />With gorgeous costumes and scrumptious period locations, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a very successful film. The dizzying camera work helps portray the immensity of the structures built for the times, and the dark qualities of rooms during stormy nights or barbaric incarcerations is shown exceptionally well.<br /><br />The focus on this film (versus that of its predecessor) is on the time of prosperity coming due for England as it comes out from under the oppressive thumb of the overzealous Catholic King Philip II of Spain (played by Jordi Molla) during the Spanish inquisition. The ultimate destruction of Spain's navy during a horrendous storm ushers in a time of peace for England. Initially Elizabeth is besieged with matters that demand her attention, all while loving vicariously through one of her women in waiting, \\"Bess\\" (Abbie Cornish) who is enamored (as is the Queen herself) with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, [[ASIN:B000XA5K48 Shoot 'Em Up]]).<br /><br />Being able to reduce herself to a normal woman for even a brief moment is an incredible pleasure to the Queen, and Sir Raleigh allows her these moments whenever he's around. But both know that they can never be together; the Queen because of what's required of her as a noblewoman; and Raleigh because he's basically a pirate with no royal blood. But Raleigh gets as close as he dares by falling for Bess, and eventually marrying her, much to the dismay of the Queen (who, although she knew she and Raleigh could never be together, still dreamt of it).<br /><br />The end of the Spanish armada signals the end of many things: the end of threats from beyond the sea, the end of Elizabeth's possible marriage arrangements, the end of Mary Queen of Scots, and the end of any hopes for a life with someone the likes of Raleigh. But it also heralded a time of awesome prosperity during the incredibly long reign of one of the most successful leaders of the free world.<br /><br />Watching it, one can't help but wonder what would've happened had the Spanish fleet found purchase on the shores of England. Thankfully that never happened and, as an American, I'm doubly glad for it.<br /><br />This is a very well filmed historical costume drama with plenty of outstanding performances and scenery. But it isn't anything we haven't seen before (the aforementioned 1998 Elizabeth film is the prime example). Although there's plenty to look at, most viewers will probably say, \\"Yeah. Seen it.

B000YABYLA|1.0|'JUNO' IN REAL LIFE: I am helping a woman, 56, and her daughter 40, with their transitions through a difficult time in their lives due to an event in the mother's life forty years ago.  (She still won't say how it actually happened: rape or love) but she became pregnant at sixteen and her mother (whose husband left the family of seven kids for a much younger woman with no kids), advised her daughter to give up her child, at sixteen, so she could finish high school and go to college for a degree.    Well,she got the B.A. degree in English. At nineteen though,she had twins, who both graduated with M.A. degrees in business.  And, even later she had a son who became a entrepreneur.  Successful family!    The mother worked for the government for two decades, became a homeowner, got marrried and divorced more than once and then quit her job hoping to gain the career she dreamed of as an editor and writer.  But launching the career has not happened yet because she is still nurturing a larger and larger family as the days go by.  The baby she gave up called one day 38-years later and their story unfolds after the adoption.    SYNDROMES...HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED!  There is no getting around them.  The daughter, I'll call her Mary,38, was adopted by a minister and his wife and she was abused. The hospital records from her childhood tell the story but even she got a B.A. degree from college. She is permanently disabled physically and she is emotionally disturbed and confused psychologically but this is not a \\"tragic\\" story. These people are tough. They have a \\"real\\" view of life with a bit of idealism thrown in.    We hoped that Mary would become a writer too (her mother was ready to drop her jog toward her writing career to help her daughter but Mary said no). Mary wants to sulk, she wants the luxury of sulking to see how sympathetic the world is to her plight. But the world around her is demanding that book she needs to write to help others and to help the foster care and adoption systems but Mary wants to sulk. So, she sulks.    But, just know this...after some time has passed, we can see, Mary may work wonders yet because we can see her going through ALL the stages of syndromes from baby to adolescent and maybe she'll arrive at adulthood in her new life.    Her mother welcomed her with opened arms and was glad to see her. Her mother suffers from: I GAVE MY BABY AWAY BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME IT WAS BEST FOR HER SINCE I WAS SIXTEEN SO OTHER PEOPLE COULD GIVE HER A BETTER LIFE THAN ME...Syndrome. This mother grew up to be highly functional and capable so why didn't she go looking for her child? That's why.  So, she suffers the syndrome: I WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BE MY CHILD'S MOTHER.    Now, she is furiously angry, just enraged that the world told her what to do and it was so very wrong. But, what hurts the most is that her child can't understand why she was given up for adoption no matter how much anyone explains: \\"IT WAS THE CULTURE!\\" The culture in America says it is best to give the child up for adoption than to try and raise it and we are now learning that we need to quit saying that and just say: \\"There are options...make up your own mind...this is your life and your child's life...what you decide will be your story...everyone has a story...and none of know in advance how our stories will turn out.\\"    We now know the miraculous deeds of the single parent and we now know that these deeds can begin at sixteen.    AS A CURE...IF THERE IS ONE...we advised Mary to get involved with her seventeen year-old cousin's pregnancy and childbirth and rearing.  She did.  The baby was not adopted.  The baby was kept.  Mary learned that though the seventeen-year-old says she loves her baby, can't live without her baby she has left the baby and not returned for days.  She says she wants to have fun. And so on.    This teen mother will eventually catch on and may make a great mother with Mary's help, eventually.    In the meantime...they go through all thestages of the syndromes trying to live life and listen to people with ideas about how life should be lived while they are living life as it comes up.  (I hope you see the difference there.  Some people call it, \\"with a plan & goal\\" versus \\"as is.\\"    I FIRST MADE THIS POST EARLY THIS YEAR. I wrote updates on the story.  Amazon.com may have deleted them. I may have been taking up to much space even though I was making a real controversy and getting people's attention.  But the point is this: JUNO, THE MOVIE needed a contrasting review. And, this is it.    \\"JUNO\\"...was well-written and well-performed. There is no question about that.  Ellen Page is a star performer here and deserves top awards.  You will not forget this movie. The music and the vision of Page with her cute little ponytail is unforgettable. Nothing about this movie is forgettable.     It is so surreal and dreamlike (perfect-world-like) that no one wants to be brought back down to earth with my review: \\"I AM THE BABY JUNO GAVE AWAY\\" to a single mother.  Juno picked the parents from a penny-saver, visited their home, thought she at 16...had done a good investigation of the potential parents, but then the husband bailed. He didn't want the gig but the wife remained passionate for the quest so Juno went through with the adoption and went back to her childhood.    NOW LISTEN...I will never-ever tell another female what to do with her body or her pregnancy under dire circumstances and sensibilities. I mean, Nature is natural and natural is cruel sometimes. Natural is abortive sometimes.    It is \\"ideal\\" that is surreal, kind, nice, perfect and relentless.     So, am I saying Juno was wrong? No. It is her story and it will be her child's story.  Is there more than one way to do the circumstances that Juno had to deal with?  Of course.  And, abstinence is one.  Sex education is another and there are a lot of ways to do sex education including showing sexual relations on film with childbirth and the child after birth needing to be loved and raised.  I've taught that and I already know how powerful the right kind of sex education can be in a very gentle but impressive form.    Would abortion have been wrong?  No.  That would have been JUNO'S choice and story. The movie strongly indicated \\"the choice\\" process.    So, I guess you know I am pro-choice. We are free in this country to create our own stories.    I feel strongly though, because of life experience, that: (1)If you give birth that child should have the undeniable right to know something about the circumstances of its conception and birth, and, have the option of meeting the parents or not, and this could be accomplished by video or journal. [JUNO did not want to do that.](2)I feel the child should be told and reminded that they had parents, if they were adopted, or, they had the American foster system that did give them a humane start in life with a huge extended family. (Some very fine people have come out of the foster care system.)    WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO PUT PEOPLE DOWN IN AMERICA...if they don't have the perfect (ideal) life but we have seen enough now to know we need to stop that.  We have the system that can raise people from the bottom and put them on top and they can work their way up to help society flow well.    WE HAVE A VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TODAY WHOSE TEENAGER IS 'JUNO.'  Sarah does not believe in pro-choice; she believes in childbirth.  Sarah does not believe in sex education; she hopes for the best and feel the child ought to know...without an education. Sarah believes in keeping all children who are born to life.  So, her seventeen-year-old daughter is keeping her child and getting \\"shot-gun\\" married, some writers are calling it.      I have issues with the strong indication that this may not be the daughter's choices for her life but her mother's life-choices. BUT STILL, I stop!  Won't say anymore about it because this is not my life story.  It is Sarah's and her family's.  I made my choices, I gave my advice and point of view to my offspring and I think Sarah has that right as well.  I respect another woman's right to teach her offspring how to live and how to create the story of their lives.  I have my story so I feel everyone should have theirs. (Sarah may not agree.)    IN ALL MY SCHOLARLY STUDIES: I find, (1)A second pregnacy is likely; (2)The teen-mother, with proper support, will do well, (3)With the proper support and sacrifice from parents, ANY teenager can keep their child and rise to a highly functional level, and, (4)It is not always the very best idea to enforce marriage in the teen years especially if they are \\"shot-gun.\\"  That may not be highly functional and it will produce more offspring.  And, that seems to make matters worse...the young marriages, unless there is a LOT of proper support.    WHY DID I WRITE ALL OF THIS?   Because teenagers liked JUNO incessantly! I hope to tell them something to help ground them in the true reality that Juno's child still lives. Therefore, it is a person who needs to be cared for, not just forgotten without consideration.  Therefore: JUNO is not as cute a story as we have enjoyed the movie.    THE YOUNG PEOPLE ON THIS WEBPAGE TAUGHT ME SOMETHING TOO.  They taught me that they don't want to be awakened from a very good dream.    SEE THE MOVIE MORE THAN ONCE AND SEE ALL SIDES OF IT: mother and child, parents/grandparents (who will have to sacrifice); then discuss it, and see the adopting side and see society's side too but overall, that child's life should come first...if the child is born.  --Margaret Opine

B000ZLFALI|5.0|To understand this odd (but compelling) film, perhaps you had to be around during the 60's (which I was). The confusion and frustration of that period is so very well conveyed. How better to do that than to bring to life the immortal words & music of the Beatles?! Very fine and original idea. Also, one must understand the gritty, down-to-earth vision of the wonderful Julie Taymor. I've admired her since \\"Titus\\", a most profound take on Shakespeare. I was fascinated by \\"Across the Universe\\" for many reasons. Her clever use of color may be matched only by the vision of Zhang Yimou's films. Assembing a perfect cast, led by Jim Sturgess and Evan Rachel Wood, and supported reliably by Joe Anderson & Dana Fuchs, it couldn't have been better. Indeed, the entire cast was brilliant, with bit parts performed by Bono, Eddie Izzard, Selma Hayek, to name a few. Fresh material is a concept Hollywood has seemed to put on the back burner. Luckily, there are still visionaries like Julie Taymor who can connect with audiences, new and old, to bring fresh air to the often stale and conventional style used by most auteurs. The 2-disc DVD is excellent, with a glorious widescreen version of the film on disc 1 and loads of wonderful and interesting extras on disc 2. Ms. Taymor's vision is well presented.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Having grown up in the 60's and 70's I LOVED the Beatles.  Years later I'd kind of stopped listening and was really ready to hate this movie having seen the distastrous \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" years ago.  This movie took the Beatles classics and blended them so smoothly into the story it was like the songs were made just for the story.  The singers all were talented and it certainly helped that the character playing Jude reminded me of a young Paul McCartney.  It was an update but didn't change the heart behind the songs at all.  If anything the story enhanced it.  I loved it so much it's a definite on my to get list.  Give it a try.  I did and was wonderfully surprised.
B00005V1B2|5.0|I am a huge fan of the progressive rock of the 1970s. In fact, if someone took away all the CDs in my collection, save for my progressive selections from 1970 to 1980, I could probably survive (although I admit there's plenty of great rock that I'd be bummed to lose). I've been a passionate fan of Yes, Genesis, King Crimson, ELP, Pink Floyd and all of the other great prog rock bands of this period since around 1978.<br /><br />The thing is, though, is that in the early years of my progressive rock fan-dom, I was so focused on the aforementioned bands that I kind of missed out on a lot of other great stuff -- or I should say there was a lot of great music that never actually made it into my collection. So, for about the past decade, I've been making an effort to fill in a lot of the \\"missing pieces\\" in my progressive collection -- the stuff I always knew I should have, but for whatever reason never acquired.<br /><br />Three bands which I have been re-discovering as of late are Camel, Gentle Giant and Gong. Each made its own significant contribution to the prog scene of the 1970s -- and if you haven't yet explored the work of these three groups, I suggest you do so. I had, of course, listened to most of the works by these bands before, just never bought their stuff (maybe taped it, or borrowed, it). Of these three, I am currently really enjoying Camel's work. So far I have the first three Camel releases, Camel, Mirage and Snow Goose -- all great albums (and I am also familiar with Moon Madness, which is equally superb), but Snow Goose is, in my view, Camel's crowning achievement. It is a rolling, flowing, majestic suite of tightly integrated instrumental passages which create a amazingly cohesive and satisfying whole. Superbly well-composed themes abound and are repeated throughout ... in fact, the album is so thematic that in a way it is like movie soundtrack, or even a rock opera, only without any lyrics (there are some occasional vocal harmonies, or \\"chanting,\\" if you will, but it's blended in so unobtrusively that you almost don't realize it's there, it's just another part of the instrumentation). As another reviewer here pointed out, it is a somewhat quiet and reflective album -- in a way it's not very dynamic -- but the quality of the compositions is such that, much like the really good prog of this period, it grows on you tremendously as you move through repeated listening.<br /><br />I remember the first few times I heard Camel, back in the early 80s, I wasn't too terribly impressed. They just didn't seem to have the technical prowess -- you know, the blazing guitar and keyboard work, the rapidly changing time and key signatures, etc. -- that was the hallmark of bands like Yes, Genesis and King Crimson. So, even though I liked the music, I guess I just never really broke through the surface. The thing to realize about Camel is that, while they might not be as technical as the other prog bands of their time, they did put an impressive amount of care and craftsmanship into their music -- and today I realize that it has a complexity all it's own. I have to say that Andy Latimer (the lone survivor of the band) is an absolutely amazing composer and a fabulous guitarist -- listening to his David Gilmour-esque solo on \\"Rhayader Goes to Town\\" gives me goose bumps every time I hear it, it's just one of those solos that has an ever-lasting impression, like Gilmour's solo on \\"Time\\" on \\"Dark Side.\\" You see, that's the thing about Camel -- there's just this certain level of perfection to the composing and the playing -- you could successfully argue that it more than compensates for the lack of \\"flashiness.\\" Latimer's playing on this album (and on all the Camel releases) is really, really impressive -- he proves once again that it's not how many notes you play, but the choice of notes, and how evocatively you play them. His playing is packed with so much emotion and passion, his solos are delivered with just such utter care and attention to detail, and with such precision, at times it leaves me practically breathless. Each note is placed right where it should be -- there's never too little, never too much, he strikes that perfect balance -- and it takes a while to soak in and appreciate the high level of technical skill he really does possess. Latimer also plays flute amazingly well and there is rich orchestration on this album which supports the whole thing very well and which also proves Latimer's capabilities as an arranger/composer. Peter Barden's (GRHS) organ and synthesizer work on this album is equally impressive, and bassist Doug Ferguson and drummer Andy Ward have some moments where they really shine as well.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this band, an in particular, about this album. All I can say is, if you're a fan of 70s progressive, and you haven't yet checked out the Snow Goose, or any of Camel's music for that matter, you really should. I'm sure that if you do you'll find their releases sitting right there next to your other, classic prog rock favorites.such precision, at times it leaves me practically breathless.

Don't get me wrong, it is still a great series and how can you not get a laugh at the expense of the cast and the games that get played.  My grown sons have even taken the set home so they can watch it without interruptions.  Poor things missed some of the punch lines.    However, all said and done.

B000VWE5OY|3.0|Certainly not a \\"my bad\\" for the series, but for the manufacture and design of this DVD set. As some others have noted, there are a few problems. One of my main interests in buying the set was to listen to the commentaries. But I was puzzled when I selected \\"Setup\\" from the Main Menu screen and saw that the Commentaries button was highlighted as \\"ON.\\" \\"Why wasn't it set to 'OFF'?\\" I asked myself. When I started playing the episode, there was no commentary. I switched the settings from \\"ON\\" to \\"OFF\\" and back to \\"ON\\" a couple of times. It wasn't until I did the counter-intuitive thing that I found them. You actually need to select the ON/OFF box so that the word \\"OFF\\" is highlighted. It looks like you've turned the commentaries off, but you haven't. Turning them \\"OFF\\" actually turns them \\"ON.\\" Go figure. But, hey, it's Torchwood. Maybe the DVD packaging gurus got caught in a time rift. \\"So much flotsam and jetsam.\\"     The series ain't that, though -- \\"flotsam and jetsam.\\" It's dark, quirky, in-your-face, filled with wonderful Welsh accents and, okay, lots of face sucking of all kinds. Contrary to another reviewer, I find most of the characters to be *full* of heart (if the final ep of the season ain't about heart, I don't know what is).     So, faulty button schemes aside, I'm now heading back to my comfy chair to listen to the commentary, enjoy John Barrowman's \\"God-I-love-life\\" laugh and lollygag through Eve Myles' wonderful lilt.
B000UAI9WQ|5.0|E.B. White's classic story for children provides them with many valuable lessons about life by endowing the animals on a farm with some very human attributes.  The child in the story, Fern, strenuously objects to her farmer father's intentions to kill a newborn runt piglet.      The story continues with the inclusion of several creature characters who illustrate some very human feelings for each other.There is Templeton, the rat, who never did anything for anybody without a selfish motive, and Charlotte, the spider who uses her web weaving skill to advertise Wilbur, the piglet's value to Mr. Zuckerman, the practical farmer who doubts Wilbur will be worth the trouble to raise. Many others, like Gander, the old sheep, and the people at the Fair, add color and life to this wonderful story.    Our children today can still learn valuable lessons from this suspenseful, yet delightful tale of the value of life, and just how \\"terrific\\" and \\"radiant\\" any of us may be with enough encouragement.    A truly great story from an author who also gave us \\"Stuart Little,\\" \\"Trumpets of the Swan,\\" and a priceless gift to writers, \\"The Elements of Style.\\"    Long may this story be available to our children. It is a fable with lasting impact on the formation of their character and sensitivity to others.
0792839730|4.0|A Bridge Too Far is a classic war movie that illustrates both the arrogance of the British army and the inability of the German army to grasp reality.  Caught in the middle were thousands of regular America and British troops who paid the dear price.    This movie is reasonably well-acted, though at times many of the characters appear to be going through the motions.  The true drama comes out in the end when the British finally realize the futility of their operation.  There are many fine performances, namely Sean Connery and Dirk Bogaard.  Gene Hackman is most unfortunately miscast as a Polish officer, but aside from this, most play their roles admirably.    Operation Market Garden's failure falls squarely on one person not portrayed in the film, Bernard Montgomery, an idiot of Herculean proportions.  While the subsequent failure of the mission did not greatly impact the war's outcome, the horrific waste of lives could have easily been avoided.

B000R6PKP2|5.0|Esto está escrito para los que vivimos en España:  Esta maleta no tiene ningún audio en español pero SÍ subtítulos en castellano en TODO.  Quiere decir que para los que tenemos Blue Ray podemos tener la maleta en alta decfinición.  España va muy por atrás en el mercado HD. De hecho me negué a comprar la maleta en DVD sabiendo que en el resto del planeta podían disfrutarla a 1080,24p. En España la maleta en formato DVD se agotó el mismo día que salió y pensé que no podría tenerla nunca. Es cierto que el 12 de febrero la sacan en Blue Ray pero no tiene comparación con la maleta pues solo está la última versión. También es cierto que yo siempre veo el cine en VSO si es posible. Así que para mi ha sido un alivio y un sueño hecho realidad. COMPRARLA ANTES DE QUE SE AGOTE!!
B00005JPTI|3.0|Of the three films based on the novel by Richard Matheson, the newest I AM LEGEND ranks as the middle.  In the first, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH,  Vincent Price used his unique ability to make the audience feel his pain as he often writhed in agony in a sea of goo. In the second, THE OMEGA MAN, Charlton Heston played the straight man to a horde of glowing eyed hippies all of whom favored the flowing robes associated with cinematic free love communes. Will Smith completes the trifecta with I AM LEGEND that has less to do with Matheson's novel and more to do with a series of philosophical conundrums that simmer beneath the assigned text.<br /><br />The plot is well know to anyone who has seen any of its twin predecessors. New York City (and presumably much of the world) has been hit with a plague that started out as a cure devised by Emma Thompson in a surprisingly minor role. The cure mutates such that its victims morph into a race of computer-generated pseudo-humans that we have seen before, most recently as the Morlocks in the revised THE TIME MACHINE. Smith as Dr. Robert Neville and his dog have to survive as he seeks a cure.  The most interesting part of the film is the first half.  The stunning scenes of a deserted and decrepit Manhattan form a subtext that reminds one of the recent book THE WORLD WITHOUT US. What would happen to man's mightiest works of art, of architecture, and of general accomplishment if man himself should vanish? The result would be a creepy sense that humanity is like a temporary boil on the butt of this planet that would soon enough shake off all evidence that we once walked the cobbled streets as the Lords of Creation. The pace of the first half is slow and rightfully slow.  Smith walks the streets of New York and sees a muted civilization crumbling even as a jungle reaches out to reclaim its own.  Smith plays Neville as a man hurt by his inability to find a cure. He dares to allow the audience to feel his isolation as he walks in and out of a video store seeking companionship from a few mannikins. The pace of the second half soon switches from static to kinetic.  Action abounds with mutated dogs and wall-crawling freaky zombies making the movie more of a mind-numbing but less interesting actioner that seeks to find a cure for the plague. The only problem was that the computer-enhanced scenes of morphed humans become the focal point of audience interest, and after a while, that audience soon realizes that except for the one mutate who seems to be the leader, that one mutate is pretty much like any other.  For a comparison about how to keep a crumbling civilization film on track, one need only look at how Vincent Price used the force of his personality and at a fraction of the cost. Here Smith tries mightily to be the dramatic center, but his attempt was doomed by over-eager technical wizards who have proved for the umpteenth time that new-fangled wizardry will never trump the ability of an actor to dominate a scene or an entire film with his voice and twisting body.  I suspect that there will be plenty of viewers who will gladly pay to see I AM LEGEND one time, but once having done so, will refrain from watching this latest version and will happily tune in late at night to watch how Vincent Price gets the job done.store seeking companionship from a few mannikins.

B000ZLFALI|3.0|I tried to think of a better title than just \\"Entertaining.\\" Just having watched this with several other professional theatre directors at dinner last night, none of us rated the movie higher than a \\"C\\"...but for different reasons. (All of us in our 40's and 50's)    Director One (me, musical director/choreographer) enjoyed the music, thought Jim Sturgess was cute, thought the dance numbers were appalling, liked Julie's creativity and imaginative \\"eye\\" for the material, and thought the storyline was nothing special. I would have liked to see her do a remake of HAIR instead, which this resembles in some ways.    Director Two (Musical theatre director) thought it was thirty minutes too long, but liked it overall. She thought the style was wonderful and the music good, but felt that she could not connect to any of the characters and that was the downfall. If you don't care about the people, your not going to care about the message.    Director Three (a non-musical director) enjoyed the story and the politics, and hated the musical numbers (figures). We discounted that opinion right away being a \\"musical\\" movie to begin with.    Overall, the movie is colorful, entertaining, and the actors all top-notch. They do well with what they are given, which is more of a concept-driven approach than true direction of acting.     We had the deluxe 2-disc version of the movie, and frankly, after 133 minutes of the movie, none of us wanted to watch any of the extras. Unless you are really a diehard, get the plain old single-disc movie version.
0375842209|5.0|Comparing this novel to nonfiction accounts of the Holocaust is ridiculous.  The point of the novel is not to be entirely historically accurate.  If that is what you are looking for look elsewhere.  This novel over and over again makes you think and reflect on what you have just read and experienced.  I often sat with the book on my lap reading and rereading a line trying to extract all the different ways it could be intrepreted.  Death as a narrator has the potential to be gruesome but instead just adds to the impact this book had on me.  I teach the Holocaust yearly to middle schoolers and always focus on how this could happen and how each person's actions or lack of action contributes to such attrocities.  I wish I could purchase each of my students a copy of this novel.  It does show the power of words and one person to change things, to move mountains.
0307237699|4.0|Barack Obama has written an accessible autobiography and political manifesto. He has taken care to organize it so as to present his political argument on the eve of his run for president. That is the main problem with the book: its main purpose is to support his political campaign. As a result, we get neither a satisfying presentation of his life story nor his political argument, but a little of both.     Perpahs that is the best way to make a book like this widely accessible. His prodigious intellect (president of the Harvard Law Review), humor and abiding humanity are palpable. Still, Obama's dual purposes in authorship dilute both his narrative and his argument.     I voted for him anyway.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|I imagine I am far from the only one who was truly surprised, and disappointed, with the direction that the Killers took on their second album \\"Sam's Town\\", which almost sounded like it was made by a different band that had made \\"Hot Fuss\\". Now, a year following the release of \\"Sam's Town\\" comes this odds-and-ends compilation of B-sides, 'lost' tracks, live tracks and other one-offs.<br /><br />On \\"Sawdust\\" (17 tracks; 73 min.), Brandon Flowers and his band mates go back to the archives, if you can call them that, given that the band has only released 2 albums to date. That aside, the good news is that for me this compilation washes away the bad taste that \\"Sam's Town\\" had left in my mouth. In fact, I was really pleasantly surprised by the number of good tracks on here. As is usually the case with these types of collections, you have to pick-and-choose your way through these 17 tracks to find the real treasures. Let's start with the good first: (a) the Joy Division cover \\"Shadowplay\\" is outstanding, much better than one reasonably could've expected; (b) the 5 songs from the \\"Hot Fuss\\" sessions are great, with little gems like Under the Gun\\" and Show You How\\", 2 short songs that make their point and then move on, and \\"The Ballad of Michael Valentine\\" is also worthwhile; (c) other outstanding include \\"All the Pretty Faces\\" and \\"Sweet Talk\\", which musically remind me of U2 somehow.<br /><br />As to the not-so-good: (a) the opening track \\"Tranquilize\\", featuring Lou Reed, is outright aweful, plain and simple; (b) the covers \\"Ruby, Don't Tkae Your Love to Town\\" (Kenny Rogers) and \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (Dire Straits) simply fall flat and cannot compare favorably to the originals; (c) the closing track \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is an unnecessary remix which doesn't add much to the original version and goes on far too long (over 10 min.) for its own good. But even despite those lesser moments, in all I felt pleasantly surprised by \\"Sawdust\\". To be honest, after \\"Sam's Town\\", I was about to give up on the Killers as a one-album phenomenon, but after hearing this compilation, I will reserve judgment and check them out whenever they come out with their next album.the Killers as a one-album phenomenon, but after hearing this compilation, I will reserve judgment and check them out whenever they come out with their next album.
0143038419|5.0|When I first starting reading this book, I thought I'd find Gilbert tedious, self-absorbed and annoying.  Which at many times I did.  But mostly, I found her engaging, clever and lots of fun.<br />Even in her most depressing moments you'll find an irrepressible sense of humor, which ultimately keeps her from taking herself too seriously.<br />I loved the adventures she described which brought her from depression to joy, and her openness about deeply personal matters.<br />You will root for her success, and take stock of your own issues when you read this book.

B000YXMMAE|3.0|It's awesome, definitely a step back to their older styles (i.e. more instrumentation and less electronic ambience). But it was a little slower than I would have liked. Plus they chopped all the meat off of Videotape, it was a much better song the way they played it on tour before they released In Rainbows.
0316113506|4.0|I am the mother of two young children.  After having my second child I experienced severe depression.  A friend asked me to be her running partner and I noticed the impact it had on my emotional well being almost instantly.  Since then I have become very interested in brain science & exercise.  Last year I read The Athlete's Way by C. Bergland (also great, maybe more practical for newcomers--a great precursor to Dr. Ratey because it's written by an athlete rather than scientist) and now I graduated up to Ratey's book.  Who knew my C+ in science would lead to this!!   Thank you to Dr. Ratey
B000P0J024|5.0|Great compilation of music by these musicians.  It's good to hear each of their voices and what a bonus to have them singing together.
B000MGUZKM|5.0|I kind of like Jazz music, but I'm no expert, so I don't buy jazz music for fear of buying a CD that I won't like. I saw a great review of this CD in a local newspaper and decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did--it is AWESOME!! I love to just chill to it--it's especially great when sipping a nice glass of wine, but I listen to it all the time! Randy Crawford's voice is sultry, sexy and flat-out awesome.
B00006L6YG|3.0|Upon hearing the original vinyl pressing, I wanted to have a copy to put my SACD player to use. I was very disappointed in the mastering of this SACD. THe recording levels were much too high, and there was no dynamic range to speak of. There were even times that I could notice distortion. THis was regardless of volume level or between the high end sony and toshiba players.    Go out and get the original vinyl, and made sure verve records didn't produce it.
B000001FDE|5.0|I love this album. Any band that suffered the losses that the Allman Brothers did would have folded, and those that didn't would have come out with a product that sounded familiar but was clearly inferior and was nothing more than a desperate effort to hang on to the money making name brand. Not only did they create something genuine,authentic and toe-tapping, they delivered something that would still sound fresh 35 years later. \\"Rambling Man\\" got a lot of air time when it was first released. You would hear it everywhere: in your car; on the beach; at barbeques and picnics; in between classes --and no one got sick of it. Every song is a gem. They also had the foresight to dump the 22 minutes jams. Get this cd, pop open your favorite beverage and enjoy it. I hate to sound like some old guy but when we old guys say THEY DON'T MAKE MUSIC LIKE THEY USED TO this is a prime example of what we are talking about.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|In my opinion this a good movie. Yes, there are some things that could have been changed about it and maybe it should have been longer and explained a few things a little more in detail. I'm trying not to be specific so I don't ruin the movie but like I said it's good. I did like the ending though and hopefully they make another one. If they do I will defiantly buy it. To sum it up, if you liked the other two movies in the series you will most likely like this one as well.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|When I first heard the CD's it was readily apparent that the instrumental accompaniment was much richer.  But Loreena's voice is just as dazzlingly beautiful and enchanting as ever.    However, when I watched the DVD - I was absolutely blown away!    The interaction of all on stage is phenomenal.  You can see and feel the energy riding the musical currents that were created that night.    It is an awesome DVD and any who have only heard the CDs - I emphatically encourage you to get and watch/listen to the DVD.    Totally amazing!
0765318741|3.0|I purchased this book on sale...Thank God!  I have plans to see \\"I Am Legend\\" once released on DVD.  I decided to read the book before the movie (I enjoy seeing the differences between the book and movie).  Half way through the book , the outcome for the main character became evident, and it was a logical conclusion.  The book continued on, and so did I.  I hoped that there would be some logical explanation for what followed.  I tried to force my own explanation into the book to make sense of it all.  It just never happened.  I gave this book three stars because the beginning of the book is quite good. The second half, however, is horrible.

B00004RJEG|5.0|For the melodies that they have in their songs (including cover songs), it's ideal for acoustic performances. Their family instruments are bohan, tin whistle, piano, guitar and violin. You can see them perform with those instruemtns. Violin sounded really good. So as the Guild guitars you hear in a few songs. The entire show was backed by a full orchestra. The instrumental songs can make you jump up and dance even it's an acoustic setting. Just so that you know, they played the best version of 'Radio' @ Unplugged.     I just wish that there's another unplugged or acoustic concert dvd in the future. If you haven't look into their album 'Home', go and check it out. You'll be impressed by how far they can go with the genre of music they play. All the irish songs were absolutely beautifully polished if you like acoustic side of the Corrs.    This unplugged dvd was recorded professionally. You can see how well they edited. You can feel the chorus is chorus, not just by listening but also seeing. Like Yanni said, the impressions on a performer is just as important as playing. It's an emotional feeling that they want to express when they playing each note or beat. It's all captured in this DVD!     The quality of it is alright as it's recorded and produced a while ago. Don't expect it to be HD or anything. It's always the first dvd that i want to pick up when I decided watch the Corrs in a concert.

B00026WU7I|5.0|One of the greatest artistic triumphs of the past fifty or so years, Blood On The Tracks is a gorgeous musical meditation, a haunting and cathartic exploration of love, loss, and the complexity of human relationships. The songs are emotionally purgative and bottomlessly soulful, full of quiet desolation and breathless longing. The lyrics are sheer poetry, gorgeous free verse hurled across the the entire spectrum of human emotion, glowing with warmth, spite, pain and humor. The music is just as powerful, an intoxicating blend of rock, folk, country, and blues, with lilting melodies colliding over dense atmospheres and wordless apocalyptic imagery. The end result is a masterpiece of emotional expression, a darkly resonant and often harrowing piece of music, a work that is both powerfully complex and instantly accessible, something that speaks to every living breathing human being, everybody who has ever felt love or hate or pain, who's stayed awake late into the night, wondering about the pain in their heart and the losses in their life. At times- like during the utter desolation of \\"Simple Twist Of Fate\\" or the spine-tingling story arc of \\"Tangled Up In Blue,\\" this album commands a power that defies words, that digs its way to the very heart of the human experience, to the loves and hates and horrors that lie at the center of our consciousness. At other times, like in the freewheeling narrative of \\"Lily, Rosemary, And The Jack Of Hearts\\" or the wheezing blues of \\"Meet Me In The Morning,\\" it's simply good fun. But it's always, always brilliant. Indescribably essential.
0689837380|5.0|Finally a series of books that is fun, positive and cute as a gnome's nose!   Set in an old Victorian home, the three Grace children must cope with the absence of their father, the strains of moving and a very peculiar housemate. The Grace household is believable and the sibling rivalry and arguments are as real as any I have had with my own brothers and sisters. Beneath all the realism lurks a fantasy waiting to hatch before your eyes as every page brings you one step closer to the truth.   After reading Lemony Snicket and being somewhat disappointed in the strange \\"humor\\", I picked up Spiderwick to see what this little book had to offer. So many parents had asked me in the past if this book was age appropriate or too scary that I finally had to delve into our store's children's section once again. It was a very quick read, but I found myself actually interested in the characters and the wonderful world that was about to unfold for me and the Grace children. Holly Black is an amazing storyteller and one of several truly talented authors of children's literature. Let us hope that Holly-would does not make a shambles of this marvelous series as much as they managed to destroy The Golden Compass.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet.  This is one of the best punk rock albums I've ever had the pleasure to hear, hands down.  It is hard and edgy, driven, but unlike so many punk bands doesn't sacrifice melody and harmony to get that power.  The lead singer can yell and still sound good!?  I can't wait 'till I get the chance to see these guys live.
B000VR824S|1.0|I don't think their were many great performances recorded on this DVD. Compared to the Dallas Crossroads Festival DVD, the music presented here is predictable, flat and uninspiring. Some of the singing is outright terrible. The only credit that could be given for a good performance goes to Hubert Sumlin, Doyle Bramhall II, John Mayer and maybe where Eric Clapton joins in with some of the musicians. The title of this DVD should also be changed since several of the musicians at this show are good artists but not noteworthy for their guitar playing.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|I liked the first and the second.  The third did not fail me.  Actually, I liked the 3rd as much as the 1st.  Lot of mayhem, good effects, considering alot was done in daylight.  My main issue was that it was way too short.  The dvd has some good features regarding the making of the creatures, the making of Vegas, etc.  Features that should be standard in a dvd, but alas are not.    Interestingly, there were about 10 deleted scenes that averaged 1 minute each.  If they incorporated these scenes into the movie, it would still run about 105 minutes.  Too funny.  But overall, if you liked the first 2, you'll like this one, and with the features, a solid bang for the buck.
B000002NC4|5.0|The easiest way to describe this album is as a guitar rock symphony made up of 8 movements, most of which have two or more sub-movements.    It is NOT immediately accessible.      I had to listen to it 10 times to \\"get it.\\"    It's 54 minutes long, and is best taken, much like Dark Side of the Moon and Pet Sounds, as a cohesive entity.    Give yourself a 54-minute block of time with no interruptions, and just let it wash over you.  The music is engaging, and when you think you've settled into a groove, BAM, it shocks you suddenly into something different.    Fantastic, spacey, winding guitar rock that commands not only the listener's attention but participation as well, like it or not.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|While this sequel to the 1998 film Elizabeth pales in comparision, it still finds some nice moments in a film that seems more content on the film more as a work of moving art, with its lavish costumes, gorgeous sets, and stunning cinematography, and yet human development somehow gets lost beyond all the pretty pictures and lovely costumes.<br /><br />Elizabeth's reign as queen is once again in peril. King Philip of Spain plans on Holy War against England and the protestant queen that rules it and plots of assaisination begin to form under the control of Mary Queen of Scots. All the while, Elizabeth finds her heart once again caught in the battle, as she takes notice of a dashing pirate, Sir Walter Reiligh.<br /><br />What's the film suffers is its seemingly vacant story line and the near absent soapy drama that made the first film so entertaining to watch. the director has all this great history to go upon and yet he seems more intent on the look of the film then the actual feel of it. As for Geoffry Rush, his character is reduced to nothing more but a side note that does not carry the same effect as he did in the first film.<br /><br />But the good thing is that on aspect of the first film did not change and that would be Cate Blanchett's performence. Still just as fierce as in the first film, she brings back all of the aspects of our Queen that we knew and love. With a bitting wit, steely determination, and the ability to show weakness at just the right moment, Blanchett is able infuse just enough life into a film that, without, would probally be entierly dead.
075640407X|5.0|This is a 5-star review, although it might not look like one. \\"The Name Of The Wind\\" is a wonderful debut novel. Lots of folks here have gone into detail about its virtues, and I agree with most of that, so I am spending most of my space on what I thought could have been stronger. I'd add that, like another recent entry into the world of series fantasy, \\"The Gentleman Bastard\\", it is very quotable, with plenty of bon mots.     The \\"Most Helpful\\" critic thus far has a point: Kvothe doesn't seem to have any handicaps. Compare him with another SF hero, Miles Vorkosigan, who like Kvothe survives primarily by his wits and near-obsessive mastery of the disciplines and crafts he needs to pursue his chosen path, but unlike Kvothe suffers from massive physical handicaps that, no matter how breathless he leaves the reader with his cleverness, also give the reader pause as to whether he or she would want to step into Miles' shoes.    Another weakness is the lack of a real antagonist. Sure, we know about the Chandrian and we look forward to discovering more about them, as Kvothe does. But we don't get much of a confrontation. We have Ambrose and Master Hemme, but they are not hefty enough to support a novel of this weight. There was another very popular debut novel some years ago set mostly in a school -- you may have heard of it -- and it too had a professor and a student that were opposed to the hero from the start. Yet neither of these was the true villain, and that true villain does show his face at the end, even in a greatly weakened state. This book would have done well to give us something similar to increase our understanding of Kvothe's true adversary.    Nonetheless this is a fine read. I eagerly await the next installment. Highly recommended.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|My husband and I couldn't stand this movie.  I dare say that film snobs like this movie because it wouldn't appeal to the average movie goer.  It was depressing and boring...I kept waiting for something to happen which would better tie in the Japanese girl, but it never did.  People make bad decisions everyday and then they suffer the consequences.  Gee, what a great topic for a movie.  *rolling eyes*

B000I2J6K0|4.0|After reading the reviews, I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed.  Many of the reviews say that this video was either a pleasant challenge or \\"too hard.\\"  I was sure that I had finally found a prenatal workout that would present me with an adequate challenge.    Now, while I am in decent shape, I am by no means in great shape - I can't remember the last time I was able to do a workout regularly...  I found that while my heart rate did occasionally increase, it quickly dropped again, and I found only a few of the excercises particularly challenging...    That being said, this is, so far, the most challenging prenatal workout I've yet come across.  I am pleased that this video doesn't treat pregnancy as a delicate condition...
B000IYV1ME|1.0|Absolutely horible!! First you have to get past the captioning which we already expected so that wasn't to bad, but the movie itself..one word..BAD. This movie had no direction, it jumped from place to place and from plot to plot, 10x worse than a daytime soap opara. It had one msg, bad things happening in Iran, We could have got that point in the first 10min. If it was intended to show truth of what is happening would have been an ok documentary. However as a movie it sucked. Save your money and your time. I really don't understand how this movie could have been nominated for anything.
0446401307|4.0|This book does have the feel of being written for a non-Harry Bosch audience. There is very little of the iternalized reflective stream of consciousness that makes a Harry Bosch book unique. Originally done as a serialized quick read thriller for a mass market audience who presumably don't know Harry it is an odd vehicle in which to introduce a new partner for Harry s well as to haul Rachael Walling back as a cardboard cutout character who moves the plot along by explaining the Feds to this new audience.<br /><br />That said, if you are not a Harry Bosch die hard fan, you will probably not notice the absense of Harry's deep rooted conflicts. Just enjoy this as a thriller for the current times. What I find interesting as one who has followed the Bosch canon for years is the question of \\"Why Now?\\" Harry Bosch is a tormented character that we have spent years getting to know; we love his cases and his existential pain. We know that \\"Everyone counts, or no one counts\\"; words that guide Harry's ever changing career.<br /><br />I hope I am wrong when I sense that in this book, Connolly is testing the waters for a less LAPD centered story arc in favor of a broader Rachael Walling / Feds focus. I hope not, because in spite of some reviewers have said, this does work as a thriller, just not one cast in the mold of the Harry we know. It is this lack of the subtle, the unexpected, the very unique flavor of this character that we find disappointing. Connolley apparently knows this, because he has extensively rewritten the serialized version and added a chapter to make this piece more of a fit with the ongoing Bosch saga. I bought a copy, and I didn't regret it...it isn't a home run, but I got my Harry fix for the winter. I happen to have just finished Echo Park when I picked up The Overlook.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't met Harry before, check out Echo Park as a prequel and get a better sense of why Harry Bosch stands right along side George Smiley (\\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\"),Matt Scudder (\\"When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes\\"), and my beloved Travis McGee (\\"The Lonely Silver Rain\\"). Harry Bosch knows that the truth does not always set you free; it sometimes imprisons you in a very lonely place. I sense that Harry has a destiny, and the author is preparing us for it.(\\"When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes\\"), and my beloved Travis McGee (\\"The Lonely Silver Rain\\"). Harry Bosch knows that the truth does not always set you free; it sometimes imprisons you in a very lonely place. I sense that Harry has a destiny, and the author is preparing us for it.
B00000F214|3.0|Not a bad movie, a lot of unnecisary swearing but overall not to bad. You needed some of the language to set the whole gangster seen but most of it was not needed. The plot was done pretty well, with some twists that they kept hidden pretty well until the end, well done. Not a very original idea but still worth watching, especialy if its a cold winter day.

Most songs are long, but show what a great guitarist Rory was.  Listen and you'll see why Rory was one of Ireland's favorite sons.  Though all songs are great, my personal favorite is Million Miles Away.

B00005JKN9|1.0|It might take eons to review a debacle like this one.The period leading up to the NYC draft riots is not well known; suffice to say that the British-Irish tensions throughout the country running rampant is obviously depicted well in this film. But, where is the Chinese-British hatred, mentioned in passing? Better yet, what of the Irish- black confrontations? Secondly, the riot involving the 'priest and the'butcher' could easily have been used to conclude this abomination with the Irish forces victorious. That would have excluded DiCaprio and Diaz and allowed these bumbling, mercurial lovers to take a well needed vacation,helping Timmy and Lassie with their farm chores. Next, we have a cast of characters, too numerous to mention, all flying around the screen, distracting the viewer, a possible prelude to \\"Ocean's 13\\" 145 years in advance.On we go! Has anyone ever seen a slower paced film with rioting as a main focus? 167 minutes of film time that was originally scheduled for 239 minutes! This isn't cricket, old man! Summing up, if this movie really did receive as many award nominations as claimed, then I've been beamed into a parallel universe by James T. Kirk,fooling around on his control panel, in a stunt dreamed up by Allen Funt and Durwood Kirby.

B000YA82F6|5.0|What an amazing film!  The dialogue is rich and the acting superb. Loved the music, too.    As others have said, it was much more than a teen pregnancy movie. I had no idea what the outcome would be until the very end.    Enjoy!
159102594X|4.0|Joe Abercrombie's debut novel is a fun and lighthearted entry into the epic fantasy genre.  The novel relies on strong characterers and the authors strong depection of small scale action sceanes.  The characters are played off of standard fantasy archtypes, but the characters themselves play off of these sterotypes to make them unique and to great comic effect.    The battles are well written, and the writing very skilfully treads the line keeping its dark humor, but sill telling a more serois story.  Overall and excellent read, leaves me looking forward to the next two books in the series.
0517227851|5.0|Pride and Prejudice has been one of my favorite books since I first read it at the age of twelve. This particular edition is a beautiful, perfect little book.[[ASIN:0517227851 Pride and Prejudice (Mini Gramercy Classics)]]
0143142356|1.0|This book might have been good if some editor had taken a sharp knife to it.  It is just turgid.  Did Follett get paid per word?  I have always liked Follett- he is usually a crisp, tight, inventive writer.  I was profoundly disappointed in this & its companion book (I made the mistake of buying both at the same time). I suppose if you have insomia, this might be a cure, but I will be hesitant to purchase another of his books.  Save your money & find something else to read.
B000UX6THK|1.0|Five stars for Twins Peaks, an absolutely brilliant series. One star (or NONE!) for the frustration of finding out that some episodes are inexplicably missing scenes.<br /><br />For example, Cooper has a dream at the end of episode #2. (He dreams of the man from another place and his \\"cousin\\" who looks like Laura Palmer. She whispers who killed Laura in his ear.)  Episode #3 begins with Norma talking with a man about Hank at the RR. It DOES NOT INCLUDE: The next morning, when Cooper talks briefly with Audrey, who confesses to leaving him the note about One Eyed Jack's. Cooper tells Truman and Lucy he can't remember who the killer was whispered to him in his dream, but insists the dream is a code, \\"break the code, solve the crime\\". Albert, after offending everyone in town, is forced to end his autopsy early. Albert and Truman come to blows.<br /><br />I looked around online to see if anyone else had this problem or if we got a defective disc. I found a comment from someone who was missing a scene. They wrote: \\"After episode 7 and before episode 8, I vaguely remember there being a scene in which Audrey Horne puts on a mask to evade her father at One Eyed Jacks. This was missing from the Gold Box Edition. Does anyone else remember this scene and/or does anyone think this is missing from the Gold Box?\\"<br />That scene definitely SHOULD have been there. WE have not gotten to that episode yet, but I wouldn't be surprised to be able to confirm that soon.<br /><br />What gives?! Didn't Lynch personally approve this set? So confusing...

B000ZLFALI|1.0|I don't normally write reviews, but the mediocrity of this film has compelled me to warn others who are considering seeing it. First of all, I am a huge Beatles fan and I love musicals. I was so excited when I saw the trailer in the theater, I thought maybe it would be like a trippy Moulin Rouge with Beatles songs. Oh, I was so wrong.<br /><br />This film is so corny, so tacky, and unintentionally hilarious. I could not stop laughing at how AWFUL it was the entire time. The characters were irritating, the 60's references horribly cliche and over the top, and the use of the Beatles music was forced in every way and not the least bit creative. This film made me cringe it was so painful, one of those times when you actually feel embarassed to even be sitting in the theater watching it.<br /><br />To sum it up...it was like a high school production of Rent set in the 60's except the writers know absolutely nothing about the 60's but what they've seen on cheesy made for TV movies, and a plotline completely fabricated just so they'd have an excuse to use Beatles songs because they are too talentless to write anything original. I mean come on....\\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\", and a girl actually comes in through the bathroom window...\\"I Want You\\" as in Uncle Sam wants you, and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" while Jude smears strawberries on a canvas? Please. Stop.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film so badly but it ended up being the worst movie I saw last year. And that's saying a lot.
B0000640VO|5.0|This superb film is about the oddball girl of the title, and how she comes to find love through the strange characters that surround her in her life.<br /><br />The opening section of the film is very funny as we are told of each characters personal likes and dislikes. These are not earth shattering things, but the trivial things that we all (OK most of us) take for granted like cleaning out the toolbox. The film uses a narrator to tell us these things, and this technique works well, mainly because the film is wonderfully well-written. Because of this what seems completely illogical at some points all falls beautifully into place.<br /><br />Amelie it turns out although a shy and withdrawn girl on the surface, has a sharp and scheming mind which leads to some marvellous scenes, all of which I might add are directed with a huge amount of style and panache. For a film just over two hours long it maintained my interest virtually continuosly and its certainly one that I will be watching again.<br /><br />Its a film like this that makes you realise what a lot of rubbish is coming out of Hollywood these days. I say that as a person who is not a fan of foreign language films. However this is something very special and I can't do justice to it in a short review. See it for yourself and find out.
0891419195|5.0|Sledge describes the ferocity and hatred and horror of the Pacific war on Peleliu and Okinawa. What he has to say is very consistent with the experiences of veterans that I have known concerning the unrelenting toughness and brutality of Japanese soldiery they encountered. Where pertinent, he inserts interesting remarks about command relationships, lists specific units involved, and describes enemy equipment. His is one of the few books to mention psychological casualties and possible ways for men to cope when thrust into the inferno. His book is unique in convincingly describing the emotional enormities of getting shot at. His observations include many \\"pearls\\" about functioning in combat. The work also forms a bulwark against the kumbaya generated lately about the war against the Japanese in those days. It is an important account and one of the best reads in military history.
6304712936|5.0|This review refers to the shorter 153 minute version of the film, although I have also seen quite a few of the extras on the two disc special edition as well.<br /><br />This is a truly epic film based on Peter Shaeffers's play, which tells the story of Mozart from the point of view of the aged Court Composer Salieri, looking back. Salieri is played by F Murray Abraham, who undoubtably steals the acting honours, if only because his performance is always entirely believeable, if not neccessarily any more factual. Tom Hulse gives a fine performance as Mozart, but I always felt that there was more artistic licence in his performance than in Abrahams.<br /><br />The music is superbly performed and the operatic settings deserve special mention. Certainly this film gives you every opportunity to appreciate the extraordinary talent that Mozart was blessed with. Whether the play the film is based on is in any way factual is unknown to me but this is an irrelevance. The music and performances are fact and that is enough for me.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Somehow I missed this movie and it wasn't until a woman I met (who works on robots in a University Research Department in Seattle) recommended it to me after I told her about Bladerunner (another masterpiece Sci-Fi).    A.I. immediately became one of my favorite movies. The movie is so rich and packed with deep philosophical questions on topics such as love, dreams, happiness, etc. The acting is phenomenal. It's one of those movies where you would not want to see any character replaced because you fell in love with them and each character became so \\"real\\". The movie just kept developing and getting better. A.I. is definitely well underrated.    A.I. appeals to human emotions in a very special way. I was moved many times throughout this movie. It opens up doors to the reality of life and human nature. Jude Law as Joe and Haley Joel Osment as David (both robots) are unforgettable, and the dialogs they have are powerful. David argues for the innocent side of human nature that chooses to ignore reality and pursue a dream that is a pure fairy tale. Gigolo Joe fires back with a reality check in an effort to win David to his cause, perhaps with the hope have David alongside fighting for their own survival (the survival of robots) against humanity who is trying to destroy the \\"artificial beings\\".  David ends up saying \\"goodbye Joe\\" with an acting that demonstrates his understanding of what is happening and yet his choice to go pursue his dream which subconsciously he knows cannot be attained. So many of us can relate to this. Perhaps David knows that if he does not pursue his dream he has no reason to go on living. He is not motivated to fight the humans as Joe is because he was programmed to love his mother, so that is what he does. We humans are also programmed to do certain things and follow our dreams, as articulated in a dialog later in the movie by Prof. Hobby, who created David.    So David goes on pursuing his dream even though logic demonstrates that he cannot attain it. Or maybe he can? Maybe anything is possible? Maybe the realization of our dreams are not exactly how we imagine it to be? This is a powerful way that carries the movie to the end. David, who is a robot, still functions after 2,000 years have passed and when \\"revived\\" by the more advanced Robots that survived the ice-age, is still trying to become human or a \\"real boy\\", so he can win the love of his mother. This finally happens in a brilliant and unexpected way. He gets to spend a day with his mother, just him and her, in scenes that are very moving. This could be interpreted as a dream fabricated by the collective input of all the advanced robots that are present creating this \\"matrix world\\" based on information that was stored in David's \\"mind\\" from when he lived in the house with his parents. This day with his mother could be interpreted as a dream, but isn't life itself a dream? I think that ultimately we know that our lives are nothing but a dream, and yet we choose to think that it is real just as David did with his mother, for the pure enjoyment of those rare momemnts. When we realize how precious each moment of our life is, that is when we can truly enjoy each moment. That is when we are awake as opposed to unconscious (a paradox here). This is truly not a movie written for the entertainment of the masses, and perhaps that is why it has not gotten enormous appeal. Many aspects of the movie are unpleasant and hard to swallow, such as Manhattan covered by seawater due to global warming. This is not a typical Hollywood movie with the formula of happy ending that makes everyone feel good at the end.    Stanley Kubrick may be gone, but his work still lives. Steven Spielberg is still alive and many of us hope that he will continue to create movies like this that gets the viewer thinking and perhaps transformed, instead of the typical formula that works to entertain the masses and earn money in the box office. Stanley Kubrick may be gogne, but his spirit still lives through his work and the masterpieces he's created. I have yet to wath 2001 Space Odyssey, but other powerful movies such as Dr. Strangelove and even Full Metal Jacket are cult classics. A.I. is another example of the precious gifts we would get if Kubrick were still alive and making movies.    I recommend A.I. to anyone who enjoys philosophical topics, anyone who wants to expand his or her mind, anyone who likes to look at human life in the big scheme of things, and what could happen not just in our lifetime but in 2,000 years or more. A.I. is a powerful movie packed with great material and superb acting, a modern Sci-Fi piece that has become one of my favorites of all time.
B00005JMX6|5.0|My Amazon friends have been gloating about this for some time<br />so I finally took out the cash and bought it.

To this poor girl Meg.  To tell the truth<br />I was happy for Meg in the end....

B000JSI7BM|4.0|Well the subject pretty much explains it.  I'm a guy, and I've seen some pretty crappy chick flicks in my life.  They are so bad.  I mean c'mon, how many times can you see the same storyline repeated?  Oh sure sometimes the movie is set in the south, or new york, or wherever the hell it is, they're all the same.  Guy likes girl, girl likes guy.  For some reason or another they can't get together, and it appears they will live a life of unhappiness.  Then something stupid happens which allows them to be together forever.  the end.  Wow.  Well this one isn't like that.  So I mean, don't watch it if you dont have to, but if you are forced into it, choose this one if you can.  It's less painful.  There isn't any nudity in this movie so if you find one that has nudity, you should probably pick that one instead.

B0011FL7FA|5.0|I've already said quite a bit about the film, but a few more points of warning. This movie has a PG-13 rating. It's regrettable. It deserves an R.     The amount of language is quite minimal, though they do drop the f-bomb. The violence level is quite high. What really amazes me though is the amount of nudity.     There's no *graphic* full frontal, but it's still there, and quite obvious in many scenes. There's also a considerable amount of partially and fully topless women. I didn't realize the MPAA was so lax on their standards these days. For those reasons I think we should have an R-rating on Across The Universe. It would give the movie a decent excuse for the skin, and a chance to make the movie a little edgier as well.     This is an A+ movie still lacking. The psychedelic visuals, especially in the Mr. Kite montage are really disturbing, a true PG-13. I'd have loved to see more. A little more of Ms. Wood would have been nice as well.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Certainly not to be confused with [[ASIN:B000K7VHQE Little Miss Sunshine]], the title of this psychologically driven 2007 sci-fi thriller is about the only thing coy about director Danny Boyle's latest entry to his diverse resume of films, which includes [[ASIN:B0001XALTG Trainspotting]], [[ASIN:B000AP04GK Millions]], and the film this one most resembles, [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]]. The same high-octane brio is evident here, which is no coincidence since the film shares the same screenwriter, Alex Garland. However, the setting is fifty years in the future on the Icarus II, a spaceship voyaging toward the sun in order for the eight-person crew to save it from extinguishing.  The sun has apparently been infected by a concentrated energy nucleus leftover from the Big Bang, a \\"Q-ball\\" which has disrupted normal matter and made destroying the nucleus the only option to ensure mankind's survival. That's why the ship is carrying a nuclear device the size of Manhattan in order to reignite the sun.<br /><br />Even though it echoes stronger films of the genre like [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien]], [[ASIN:B00006L92F Solaris]] and even [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey]], the film's first two-thirds are genuinely suspenseful, but the last part turns an unfortunate corner into a pandering level of terror. The psychological aspects of the plot are the most intriguing with the crew extremely fatigued and stressed having been in the ship together for sixteen months. Things start to unravel almost immediately when a radio signal is heard from what turns out to be the first Icarus, a ship that made the attempt to detonate the device seven years earlier. A decision needs to be made as to whether the Icarus II should reroute to save what remains of its predecessor, whether it be survivors or the added insurance of another nuclear payload. From that point forward, Boyle and Garland set up the crew to face crisis after crisis each serving to thwart some part of their mission, and it all begins with human error. It's refreshing to see a sci-fi film devote a lot of time to the psyche of the individual characters and broader philosophical concerns about morality because the approach helps make their ultimate fates resonate more.<br /><br />The requisite multi-ethnic cast has been assembled to play the crew. Hiroyuki Sanada stoically plays Captain Kaneda, the Zen-samurai leader. On the other side of the emotional spectrum are a too-young Chris Evans, who plays Mace, the hot-headed second-in-command, and Troy Garity as Harvey, the less-than-heroic communications specialist. The latter is involved in a scene inspired by a similarly harrowing scene in [[ASIN:B0000CGNEE Marooned]]. Even though her usual vibrancy is somewhat neutered, Michelle Yeoh is a welcome presence as Corazon, the biologist in charge of the self-contained garden. Rose Byrne plays the pilot Cassie as the futile catalyst of humanism on the ship, while Cliff Curtis highlights the unhealthy obsession that medical officer Searle has developed for the sun. The focal point, however, is Capa, the physicist in charge of monitoring the payload, and for a nice change of pace, Cillian Murphy ([[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]], [[ASIN:B000OCY7JO The Wind That Shakes the Barley]]) gets to play a relatively normal character and unlikely hero.<br /><br />Mandatory for this genre of cinema, production values are top-notch with excellent work from cinematographer Alwin Kuchler, production designer Mark Tildesley and with her retro-Jules Verne-style gold spacesuits, costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. The CGI work is especially strong with a fearsome depth given to the interior scenes and a scarifying power to the close-up shots of the sun. Extras with the 2008 DVD are plentiful starting with two separate commentary tracks - the first has Boyle engaging with his unique insights into the production, while the second features the film's scientific consultant, Dr. Brian Cox of the University of Manchester, speaking Carl Sagan-like about the possibility of such an occurrence when he's not giving his take on the action. It would have been more digestible for the viewer to combine Boyle and Cox's comments into one track. There are twenty minutes of deleted and extended scenes best experienced with Boyle's comments, as well as an interesting multi-chapter video production diary by the cast and crew that runs about 47 minutes in total. Boyle has also generously included two creative shorts, both running less than six minutes, by budding filmmakers, and the original trailer and previews round out the extras.l Sagan-like about the possibility of such an occurrence when he's not giving his take on the action.

1400063515|1.0|Benjamin Franklin summed up the point of this book a long time ago when he said, \\"in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.\\" For a less compressed version of this phrase see the plays of William Shakespeare. Even just one or two would suffice. And there are many other novelists and playwrights that can offer the same insight: stuff happens.    Of course there our big outliers. Of course things can happen that are totally unpredictable. They happen every day -- big things and small. If you agree with that idea, then you can skip this book.
0380820846|3.0|I loved the first three books of the Bridgerton series and was looking forward to this installment.  Since I'm new to Ms. Quinn's novels, I was able to read the books back to back without having to wait for a new novel.  Thus, the previous novels were still quite fresh in my mind. Unfortunately, I was also able to remember a lot of the language from the previous novels. Much of it seemed repetitive.    We saw glimpses of Colin, this story's hero, in the first three novels.  I was eagerly anticipating his story because he was so adorable in the other books.  He was charming, fun-loving and confident.  Unfortunately, by the time we get to this novel, he has lost his charm.  He is dissatisfied with his life and his accomplishments and he takes it out on Penelope.  He's tired of being known for his charm and so he becomes whiny instead.  Even Penelope notices that he is not the man she fell in love with but she makes allowances for him. I agree with other reviewers who have said there's no chemistry between Penelope and Colin.  The only time they seemed to interact well together was when they were physical.    I didn't mind the plot involving Lady Whistledown.  I was interested in finding out about her anyway.    This is the first book in the series I had to force myself to finish.
B00008O0WN|3.0|Being a long-time fan of Trek and especially of the Classic and DS9 incarnations, I've always had a bittersweet relationship with the ST:TNG concept.  I've never been able to understand the need for a ship's counselor as a senior member of the staff with a place on the bridge especially when you have an equally if not more competent Guinan and located where she should be to be an effective counselor i.e. as a bar tender.<br /><br />I've also wondered just what role Beverly Crusher plays other than just to blindly copy the Bones McCoy character from classic trek.  I detest the whole ridiculous Q storyline and overall, I found ST:TNG a totally miscast and unbalanced series except perhaps for Picard, Riker, Data, Jeordie and Worf.  And so it has always been painful for me to watch most of the episodes let alone the movies and yet with the exception of the Borg movie, I've enjoyed the ST:TNG movies the least and although this \\"final\\" one has some good points going for it. I can't help but feel that I've been shortchanged in some way.<br /><br />The whole dark mood of the film just wasn't Trek for me while it probably would have fit in say a Batman movie like say a movie of the \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" or something like that, this gothic type feel just didn't fit for me in this movie.  I've watched it a few times and perhaps it will grow on me but each time I watch I get the feeling in my tummy that I get when I eat a heavily hyped up meal that just didn't deliver.<br /><br />The dvd though has decent special features with a few documentaries and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is very good although I regret not getting the widescreen version instead of this full-screen version and I wonder if they could have gotten a DTS sound option included as well.<br /><br />Overall, I think if the mood was more \\"Trek\\" instead of this \\"Jack the Ripper\\" gothic type thing, I would have probably enjoyed this a lot more.  Also, one of the deleted scenes was very amusing with the new number 1 trying to please Picard as well as the chairs with seat belts which really should have been included in the main picture and they would have certainly helped with the cheerful mood that is sadly missing in the picture.  Hopefully they would be included in a future director's cut that is brighter and has more of a \\"Trek\\" feel to it.<br /><br />Verdict: Wait for an improved director's cut with the good deleted scenes included and also for a widescreen version preferably in Blu-ray.ell as the chairs with seat belts which really should have been included in the main picture and they would have certainly helped with the cheerful mood that is sadly missing in the picture.

B00006IM9Q|5.0|Few bands can say that they have a real model at the helm.  Fewer still can admit to being successful as such.  Blondie is probably the only band that fits into this category.  From synth-pop to reggae to pop punk to straight ahead rock n' roll, this band meshed multiple genres together and made it sound great.  This album, digitally remastering all of their best tunes, is an excellent compilation of a band that stands as a pioneer and true legend in music.  \\"Dreaming,\\" \\"Maria,\\" \\"In The Flesh,\\" and \\"Heart Of Glass\\" are all here.  Lesser known tracks to the casual fan such as \\"X Offender\\" and \\"Union City Blue\\" are also on this album.<br /><br />\\"Rapture,\\" which one could argue is the first blending of rap and rock (and pre-dating the Aerosmith/Run DMC tune, \\"Walk This Way\\"), is included, and stands as a wonderful example of how well the band could fuse genres that seemingly didn't belong together.  The island rhythms and reggae sounds of \\"The Tide Is High\\" and \\"Island Of Lost Souls\\" prove that Blondie was no stranger to experimentation.<br /><br />For casual fans and completionists, \\"Blondie-Greatest Hits\\" is a must have.  It features there best known tunes and offers up some excellent songs to newer fans as well.  Hardcore fans probably already have these songs in their collection, but I would suggest they give this hits package a shot, as the digitally remastered songs sound better than ever.  Highly recommended.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|I absoutely hated Atlantis compared to SG-1, but with season 3 they really pulled off some magic. The inter-personal relationships with the team started to shine through and the stories weren't just bang-bang shoot-em-up junk. Before we knew it, my wife and I had gone through every disc of the season, and now we're eagerly awaiting season 4's release!
0385484518|5.0|I love this book and I fell in love with Morrie through it. Such a wonderful man and all of us wish they had Morrie in their lives, either as a teacher, a friend, a father, a grandfather, or even husband. There were many life's lessons through this book and even though we already know most of them, we are blinded and too scared to think or talk about them.  I recommend this book to everyone, I think each person can take something important with them through this book,  But most importantly, I recommend this book to my husband who thinks at 33 he is old.
