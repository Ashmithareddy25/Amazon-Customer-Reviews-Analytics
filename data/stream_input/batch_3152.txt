B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game love to play it. It keeps me alert and keeps me in touch with all my friends and family.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good Read. Loved the twists and turns in this book. John Grisham at his best. Looking forward to the next one he writes
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Light on plot. Poor villain development. Decent music as performed by Adele. Scenery just average. No significant romance scene. Looking forward to better 007 movies in the future.
B00EJY051C|5.0|Exceptional acting, bought for the plane ride to Maui, rewatched late at night in the hotel, and again on the way home! really knew nothing of Linda Lovelace, but after watching, inspired me to buy her autobiography. Very entertaining
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Very Good Movie, Denzel Does It Again I Recommend This Movie to Everyone. I want to see it again. 4 Stars
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I do not care for alarms, however, this ALARM gives you many, PLEASANT options that I wake up much happier.
6305558167|1.0|I don't know how this movie had a 4 star rating. This version is the worst I have ever seen. It is so corny with such poor acting I could not watch it all the way through. Don't waste your money on this one.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|I loved this movie, the tone,  the exceptional acting...the whole story. What a breath of fresh air compared to all the sap filled, sparkly  type vampires. I am glad that I bought this and judged for myself. I personally like a story with my Horror movies. This is from someone who watches all Horror movies, this one I will rewatch over and over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the book; love the series.<br /><br />Great for a quick series to do in a YA classroom.<br /><br />Wonderful themes.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the third.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Pretty good movie to watch with your spouse. Not to good for young kids. Was a better movie than I thought it would be.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|My 9 year old daughter likes this game, but there isn't really very much to it. Once you tend you animals and maybe buy a new building, there isn't much left to do. She enjoyed it for a month or two, but then we deleted it for more active games.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|This is a great movie based on a Stephen King book...it is worth watching more than once in my opinion
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|it was terrific reading, as Grisham always writes.  It is about lawyer and trials as only he can write.  It was hard to put down.  Definitely a must for Grisham fans and others who haven't read him in the past
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The graphics are probably the best  have ever seen in a game like this the movement of the robots is almost flawless no glitches or freezes all around awesome game
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a really fun game for my girls (ages 7 & 9). It is very reminiscent of Mario Bros, but with a fun, leprechaun! My kids often come back to this game, even when we've bought other, newer games. It is very well done, and runs very well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it, so does my husband, sister, sister inlaw , cousin, daughter in law, and 90 year old mother.  Wonderful challenge.
B00FWAZ87I|5.0|Wow what a great album! I just randomly bought this album and I have absolutely no regrets. I just finished my 5th listen-through in less than a week. Anyways...about the album<br /><br />Progressive Metal/Rock in a rock-opera kind of format. There's a storyline and different singers voice different characters. The riffs and melodies are awesome and do a fantastic job portraying the storyline. The mix is pretty good. Also, there are some cool synthesizers and electronic sounds in the mix; it really adds the the whole. The vocalists are amazing and the melodies they sing are rich and identifiable. Also, the lyrics switch between rhyming (typical song lyric format) and normal talking that is being sung. It's very well done. There's also a fair amount of odd time signatures; I love those with all my heart.<br /><br />The only real drawback is the delay between tracks because of the mp3 format but if money's an issue then the mp3 version is a good bet for you. One can probably burn it to a cd after purchase to solve that problem.<br /><br />In conclusion, great album; I'm now a die hard Ayreon fan! want to be one too?
B00881VLCE|5.0|Relaxing helps me sleep..fu fun fun and free get it!!<br />Omg so many words requered......good game thats is is! Thank u
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun, and challenging. My girls (ages 7 and 9) both love playing it. I like that they are constantly adding new levels and such, without messing up the basic play of the game. Fun, entertaining, and a good game to play with parent and child.
0385537131|5.0|I really enjoyed the book..  Grisham is a good story teller  It moved along and I found it hard to put down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love it when an author lets you get to know the characters in a story.. and that's exactly why I love the hunger games books so much. You can't help but root for Katniss and her crew... for justice. If you decide to pick up this book, clear your schedule because you won't want to stop reading and I suggest having a copy of book three in your possession before you finish... it's that good! Happy reading!
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Fantastic movie!!  The movie came quickly and this even included the movie soundtrack.  Absolutely loved it and I got an extra one for my dad for the holidays.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I felt to watch the simultaneously short-and-long mini-series drama as closing this book. Story plot is savagely excellent. This book  seems to appeal especially to husbands or wives in their late thirties or early forties having children. I couldn't pick the other book that day I finished to read this. Emotion to my wife and children. There are secrets and what we couldn't say yet in families. Incomplete facts and decisions we must choose...
B00FX8CLSI|5.0|If anyone is into tying with paracord, this is the book you want to get. It is full of creative knot work by J.D. He is unmatched in his presentaions and knot tying abilities with &#34;His&#34; fusion knotting.<br />DB Wright, Pasco, WA
0333961447|5.0|Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler are consistently a winning combination in today's flood of children's books, and The Smartest Giant in Town ranks as one of the top - and we own nearly 20 of their books!<br /><br />Living in the city my 4.5 year old twins regularly ask about how to help people we see on the street that may be down on their luck. This whimsical story is one of the few that brings forth the importance of selfless giving to others. Recently my son even asked if I could give a man one of his granola bars I had in my bag, because he wasn't hungry and figured that man needed it more than he did. This warmed my heart, and made both kids happy when I passed the granola bar and a bottle of water to the man. We also refer to this book when we gather clothes and toys for donation. This used to be a struggle, but now they gather things themselves that they know they don't use anymore.
B003G4W49C|4.0|It is a different take.  It's not just heroism huge space battles.  It is entertaining and bold, although in some basic levels it goes a bit too far from reasonable.
B003IDMUWC|5.0|I loved this book. I thought I had read all John Grisham as he is one of my favourite authors but somehow not this one. I can highly recomment it.
B000059T00|5.0|Great CD. Eric Clapton, Stevie Winwood make a great team on this CD. I am very happy with it. I also got the free digital download.
B00CD36FF6|3.0|This book isn't about lying, it's about cheating, two things I don't consider to be the same.  I've read a lot of neuroscience and psychology books, and this one ranks somewhere in the middle. I was hoping to learn a little more about pathological liars, which this doesn't deal with, but I have a couple more chapters to go so hopefully it gets there. It really lags at times when detailing the studies used to come to some of the authors conclusions.  I would have liked to have seen a lot more examples from other researchers, but the author focus almost exclusively on his own work.  However, I will say, at least it didn't give the same studies I've read about over and over again in other books.<br /><br />Also, a lot of the studies were conducted in Israel, which having lived there myself, is very culturally different than the US. If the book was written more for a US audience than I don't think the Israeli research can be of much use to them.  If the author thinks that people are universally the same and culture doesn't make a difference in behavior then I guess I can see where he might feel it doesn't matter.  But I personally feel on the topic of lying (cheating) that culture plays a huge part.<br /><br />A positive note is that I liked the pace and rhythm of the book and found it didn't get to heady or was too dumbed down either.  It's good for the enthusiastic neuroscience/psychology novice who's read a lot of these books, but isn't a professional in these fields. And some of the antidotes are light, entertaining and are helpful aids in proving the author's points.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|A must read as I throughly enjoyed. I couldn't get the story line out of my head. Love this John Grisham. Want more to read.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this series. Both my daughter and I waited eagerly for each volume to come out. VERONICA ROTH is an awesome writer.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|This is one of his best. It has everything. Subject, plot, characters. It is more than an exciting thriller.... I recommend it to everyone, it will satisfy all tastes.....
B008P1EWIM|2.0|Kind of a boring app.  I thought it was a waste of my money.....nothing fun to use.  Looking for a better weather app.
B002361MLA|5.0|Intellectually written and it is a groundbreaking leverage to spiritual freedom  Wow, I absolutely love it. Really a graet book.
B00005B1T6|5.0|An album very similar to its predecessors. Nothing special in terms of musical creativity and distinctions compare with Van Halen's previous albums. However, the effort of the band still deserves the praise and admiration from rock audience.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|who doesn't love Angry Birds? ha. Super fun and great time killer. My husband and I play against each other.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This is simply one of the best Marvel releases, the characters leave room for some parody humor which makes the experience much more enjoyable.  Hope to see the newest release soon....
B005S9ELY4|5.0|An interesting contemporary gangster movie in the 21s century. As much as i love about this movie in its humor and acting. Certain plots are bit corny in terms its overly simplistic and predictable plot. Overall, the movie is filled with anxiety and excitement, an amazing ride with the gangster squad.
B00FHB7398|5.0|Ok enjoyed this game in its entirety. Great graphics and well worth the money. One of the best that I've played in a long time.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|What could be better than another Bond movie with Daniel Craig.  This is the best one so far, can't wait for more!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|This is the best show on Television period!!!<br />Falchuck and Murphy are genius' Jessica Lange is at her finest as Sister Jude.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I read this book many years ago in high school. The story has been in my head a lot of years. Now my high school age son has to read it for English. I decided to reread they story myself. This is a great story and it goes to show the live that people can have for one another.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the old Grisham -- captures you from page one. With plenty of twists and turns it is one you won't want to put down.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is my go-to activity when I am super bored.  Something about smashing those damn pigs is just too amusing.
B000002HB4|3.0|The Georgia Satelites are a great rock band, but the problem wasn't the band it was the seller. They knew this cd was scratched when they sold it. The best song on the cd is where the scratch was. Contacted them but go no response.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I had read &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; by this same author and she didn't disappoint me with either book.
096798467X|5.0|Excellent book on the subject.  Even the section on sourdough bread was very good.  We can't wait to put one of these ovens together!
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Very entertaining movie. It holds your interest right up to the end. Would recommend to anyone that likes action movies.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If you like Tina Fey, you will love this book.  If you don't, you will still love this book.  Its funny, touching and has laugh out loud moments.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Poor continuity, couldn't tell the two character POVs apart, the ending (while completely appropriate in my opinion) was written in a way that didn't make sense. The entire book left me with too many new unanswered questions along with the unanswered questions from the first two books.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Good &#34;James Bond&#34; type adventure.  It's set in WW2 and I enjoyed it very much.  I'll read this author again, I'm sure.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I have been waiting for this film because it was so wonderful in the movie theater I saw it twice.  I knew I wanted to own it because I expect to see it and share it.  It is a real winner.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|used it once so far, sharpened the buck knife I purchased with it, in a short time, and it has stayed sharp ever since. well worth the money I paid for it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Absolutely the greatest movie I've seen in a long time.  I'm the baby boomer generation and it may take an older person, such as myself, to appreciate this movie.  I had to buy it so I could watch again and again.  LOL
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this earpiece. I use it in the tractor and I can hear very good and others hear me without much background noise. My husband also has one and he also loves it in the semi or other machinery.
B001VNB54A|5.0|newer movie, the color and action are wonderful, they even mix in a little bit of sub plots, but the action is fine enough that I can ignore the plots.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Intense action in the beginning, which is the reason for three stars. Lacking audience connection and character development. Not much to talk about, but for the price, I guess it was worth it.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|I enjoyed the characters and the clever humor. Story held a good message. Was not excited about the ending. Really fell flat.
B00DXPC1U6|2.0|This season (as a whole) was terrible. It was boring, monotonous, and really went nowhere.<br /><br />The only saving grace was the series finale. As bad as the season was, they did redeem themselves with a smart, well written final episode that ended the series in a logical manner....really, the only way it could have ended. The final shot of the series is haunting, and will stay with me for years.<br /><br />It's a shame they don't sell the final episode of the series by itself. I hate to buy this whole dull season for one stellar episode that every Dexter fan really needs in their collection.<br /><br />(The season as a whole gets one lousy star from me. The Final Episode gets 5 stars.)
B009SQRC9E|4.0|Kids love it.  Fun to watch as a parent too.  This will get watched more than once this season for sure
B002SEQ8ZM|5.0|Loved this movie when it came out so I bought it for my neice as a Christmas present. I'm sure she'll enjoy the film and all of the extras that come with it.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|Well written and interesting premise.  A suffragette in Africa; what a concept!  Am looking forward to reading more in the series.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|The game is very close to the pc. I've waited for it to come on kindle fire for awhile I recommend it to any one who plays minecraft
B00447L4JG|4.0|My little neice is going to love this Christmas present. She likes to be (mildly) scared, and she loves animation.
0143124544|5.0|There is nothing worse than a spoiler review.  Nobody needs a summary of the book they are about to read.  That said, this book is wonderful.  I haven't been this moved in a very long time.  Read it!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game. Should have been . A longer game. Very interesting and entertaining for myself and for my son. Keeps you on you're toes mostly. It . Was still worth it!!
B00DW1WR14|4.0|Not as good (in my opionion) as their last two efforts (Pearl Jam, Backspacer), but a very good album none the less. Really like &#34;Sirens&#34;.
B00881VLCE|5.0|So much fun! I love playing it! Very relaxing and the puzzles are so pretty! Great colors! Can't seem to put it down!
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Both gut wrenching and light hearted, I can't believe I hadn't read this sooner, i will definitely read it again
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The characters were very well written, and the story telling told in each person's<br />voice, added to the authenticity of this great novel.
B00028HBKM|5.0|my mother likes these types of movies and the price was a good value I would recommend this movie if this is the type of movie you watch
006202406X|5.0|This book seriously is amazing. I love every single chapter that Veronica Roth writes, and this book is so disappointment. There are explanations for everything that happened explained, and the whole thing is lovely. Tris is one of my favorite main protagonists ever with her complicated thoughts and decisions she's forced to make. While it's not as good as the first book (in my opinion) it's an amazing end to an amazing trilogy. Everyone should read!
B00ANW33CM|4.0|good game - keeps me busy - got into mahjong a few years ago.  The<br />variations available today give a nice twist to playing, not just the basic<br />game.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|One of the best of Agent Pendergast series.  Impossible to put down and a firestorm of excitement.  Beautiful twist at the end.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|EPIC BOOK! Best of the series in my option. For people who love dragons,dwarfs,elfs,and a classic tail of a knight fighting an evil king. Note: Only read if you have read book one and two.
1593272790|5.0|This book gives & shows you ways to build different things with the Lego building blocks and power modules.  It also allows you to add more movement to you builds.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Classic Pendergast. Loved it. Couldn't put the book down. I hope the character of Captain Bowdree will be expanded on.
1593272774|5.0|This book gives & shows you ways to build different things with the Lego building blocks and power modules.  It also allows you to add more movement to you builds.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was really dissappointed in reading this book. I really like the first two in the trilogy but the third ruined it.
1593272782|5.0|This book gives & shows you ways to build different things with the Lego building blocks and power modules.  It also allows you to add more movement to you builds.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|was sceptical to read the second book as the first was so complete and seemed impossible to follow.  I am pleased to say this book was as good and deserves a read from anyone who has read and loved enders game.
3836538725|5.0|Wish I could afford the collectors edition but this version is still amazing, large beautifully printed. Glad that I could get it for a lot less than directly from the publisher too!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lot's of levels, bright colors, fun little candies and the price is right, it's more fun to play it on the kindle, you can play anywhere
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|The only reason I downloaded evernote was to have it on my ONE android device that would share to all my other devices in place of OneNote by Microsoft which is not android compatible.  The functionality of evernote is much less that onenote.  Since I was already vested in onenote, the lack of functionality did not make it worth changing everything over just to get a note program on android that synced with all my other devices.  So, sorry...my kindle just won't be synced with any of my other onenote items.  I can live with that.
0811879542|5.0|My grand daughter loves this book.  It is one she likes to read over and over.  A very imaginative concept!
1423165691|5.0|Beautiful book for any Disney fan who loves art, or an artist who loves Disney. Very high quality pages, the sketches look like they were hand drawn in the book. Like having a rare artist's sketchbook in your hands. Bare bones of the pencil art showing you why Disney artists are so highly respected in the art world. Almost bought this at Disney World, but waited and Amazon had it for a much better price, of course!
B0009UC810|5.0|This movie is one of my husband's all time favorite movies.  It gets funnier each time I watch.  Beluchi and Akroid are priceless!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really like this program because the story never ends the way you expect it to. It make you look at the universe in a different way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a good book!  Can't wait to see catching fire this weekend! One of the best reads in a while!!
B002CIY8EM|5.0|the history of  chariots of the gods has been around for a long time it's about time I start reading the book and love it  keeps me interested
0060581808|5.0|We are super happy to have completed the series; I have some from childhood and then filled in with the missing ones thanks to Amazon. We are halfway through this book which does have lots of hunting, animal killing and different views on childhood....issues that have been good for conversation with our 8 yo.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read!!! It was actually much better than I expected and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this genre.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|cant ever beat vector, cant ever play in other places unless u pay, and each game takes a long time to load. not fun. so all in all the game takes longer to load than your playing time. Wish people would tell truth when they rate these games. I wouldn't have wasted my time on this game. Its a shame too because it would've been a fun game. very disappointed.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This was the very first app I donladed as the free app of the day and I have had it forger now! it is my favorite game and I recommend this for anyone who loves puzzle like games. Bag it is the best game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had heard of this book but had never read it. It was very interesting. I stayed up reading way too late but it was worth it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I choose 5 star because as you are reading it actually had me wondering who could be trusted and I got engulfed in even trying to figure out the clock. it really kept my interest
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite shows! I love every bit of it, drama, suspense, romance and vampires! Can't lose.
6305784116|5.0|Anything Disney is a good buy.  And the quality can't be beat.  Plus my day care kids love the characters.  A win-win.
B00E03ULJS|5.0|I admit, when I listened to a preview online, I was not that impressed. Picked up the CD anyways and boy my opinion changed within a few listens. This CD has a little of everything! Great dub step/electro/ progressive tracks that definitely gets you jumping. Excellent workout music! Probably the reason why the CD is called &#34;Get Wet,&#34; because it will get you sweating! Great looking singers as well, can not wait to see perform live.  I am Krewella fan for life now. Get Wet!
1451696191|5.0|phenomenal book, definitely not what I had expected, and a bit darker than I anticipated, but Chobsky handles very heavy topics (think midnineties Degrassi High) in a well written way. Definitely recommend
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is terrible!  It is so addicting that I may have to go to !&#34;rehab&#34; to stop playing it
B004GNFSO0|4.0|Another of Stephen King's (as Richard Backman) creepy, but enjoyable adventures in the future.  Don't we all hope our society never actually goes to this low ebb, but we can't help delving deep!
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Liked it a lot, read in three sittings.  It looks at the privacy concerns people have against sharing information online and takes them to the end.  I thought it would be a stereotypical  technology-hating story, but I didnt find it cheesy at all.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is very awesome . The only downside is that you need wi-fi in order to play. But otherwise , it is my favorite game on my kindle.  Must get this game!!!!!!!!!
B00009NQQO|4.0|Very cute product and my 3 yr old loves it.  Its was a potty training gift for him and it was perfect.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|i like james remar as an actor..wanted to see him in an early film...was a good movie for it's time...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|this is the only app I have actually bought. I love it. Money well spent! There are So many choices to pick from
B005LAIGRS|5.0|This was very very interesting...for a thriller/suspense type it really kept us watching....will for sure watch this one again was good!
B0078N2T8I|5.0|Michael Shannon shines again.  A gripping story of a man who questions his own sanity while trying to protect his family from terrifying visions of an ominous future.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of his best. The suspense & brilliant lawering in & out of the court room! Love<br />Plan to rrad it again.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|my son loved it. watches it all the time. arrived very quickly. i love tht it came with the ultra violet.
B007M45PMU|4.0|This is great mellow music and my three year old daughter really loves it, too! I would highly recommend it.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Well first of all its mad boring it was a waste of amazon and my parents money and Amazon's time so dont get it it is wack!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00E9A656K|5.0|CSR racing is the BEST game I've ever played in my LIFE! There's a lot of fun things that you can do like decorate your race car. I recommend that you should get this game NOW!
B001EN71CW|5.0|All great I am happy and satisfied they delivered on time and I don't have much of the inconvenience. The discs and the packinging were in perfect condition, bought as a gift. They loved it, great tv show.
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie is just as good as the book, listing key elements from the book into the movie. Five stars for this movie.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|There's just one thing to say, this game is amazing!!!! I would highly recommend this to a friend<br />Unfortunately, I spent a ton of time over a period of 4 days racing in the new daily tournaments, so I raced in each event every day until I got all of the trophies. At the end of the 4 days I was looking forward to getting the reward, which was a new car. I hit the claim rewards button and it didn't give me anything. That was extremely disappointing because that was the only way to get that car:(<br />The only other thing was I find it to difficult to have the cars you need without spending actual money.<br />But overall, 5 out of 5 stars
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love the continuing story with all it's twists.<br />I can't wait for the next volume. Hope it's as captivating as the first five.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a great way to pass time, and hardly ever glitches. It is a great game for everyone in the family.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this book touched my heart at some times...it made me wanna cry a little... it's so passionate...I could believe this book was just amazing...it showed all of the characters point of view in the book and what they said or thought...I thought this was  overall th  best book I've ever read and I hope u read it to...please send recommendations CAUSE I LOVE THESE BOOKS!!!!!!!!!:):):):):):):):):):):):)!!!!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game keeps me going for hours I lose track of time so easy I was almost late for work cause I didn't think time was flying by so fast lol!!!!!!!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It took a while for me to get really interested in this because it was a bit confusing the way they switch from character to character. It was a fun book too read and had a bit of mystery in it that made me not want to put it down.
1250038820|5.0|Extraordinary book ! I loved it from beginning to end. Brandon has a knack for finding each of his subjects unique.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first learned about enders game from when it came out on the movies.  I thought it would be good but when I started reading I couldn't believe how good it was. Just the way the author explained how the character was feeling and the amazing detail I couldn't put the book down.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really enjoyed the series. I couldn't imagine a different ending after reading the entire series. I really am Divergent!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I loved this game on Facebook and it's even better on my kindle. Easier to actually level up and finish the goals.
B00FEFOKAM|5.0|This may not be the best but it was the last.  Enjoyable duets with many diverse artists.  There will never be another Frank.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|I found the movie to demonstrate the difficulties of recognizing and admitting an addiction despite the fact that one's life is being slowly destroyed. The loss of family, friends and employment, not to mention self-esteem is not realized until the addict has hit rock bottom.
B003V1WXKU|4.0|This is a great reading about one of the most interesting, free-spirit, Nobel award winning scientists. Allows to understand the mind behind the technical work.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Back to the beginning for Grisham. Great read. Grisham is a great storyteller and this is one of his best
B00EEXST2K|3.0|It's interesting in the way it's structured, and Hank Azaria made up to look like Damiano is worth the price of admission, but it's also pretty forgettable.  Anyone looking for information on Lovelace and DEEP THROAT should check out the documentary INSIDE DEEP THROAT, which gives a much deeper understanding of the importance of DEEP THROAT,and political impact, and the victimization of Linda Lovelace.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Excellent throwback. This movie is classic. Fight scenes are great...in a 70's sort of way. Great dialogue with unforgettable lines.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I feel that Ms. Roth rushed through this story and so many of the veins could have been developed further.  Of course I was quite upset about it in general and disappointed.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|The Circle is a modern version of George Orwell's 1984..the book is boring, the characters are boring..would have been much better as a short story than a full length novel..I would not recommend The Circle!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Yet another example of how the master author captures readers attention from the very first page. I thoroughly enjoyed every page of this ebook. Looking forward to seeing what Stephen King will come out with next.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This is a great science fiction drama film that touches fervently on a desire an increasing number of us share: to find out if we are alone in the universe. Personal opinions aside this movie does an excellent job at stirring up the right emotions as you find yourself willing the protagonist to continue trudging along in her quest.<br /><br />The first five minutes of the movie, the first time you see it, should leave you in a wondering gaze as our insignificance and clearly forgettable impact as organisms on this tiny rock become frighteningly evident.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews of this movie. I thought the singing was good. I'd never seen Les Mis before but I found the story interesting.
B00CSCJ09K|5.0|amazing violinist and arrangements , brings the violin to such a different dimension and how much fun is to listen to popular songs with a different twist
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Humble, powerful, educational, and inspirational. I read this on a trail running vacation and really enjoyed the insight into the world of elite ultramarathoning. Great recipies, great stories and no filler. Great read for anyone who runs.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|great music,  and the musicians make the cellos have a deep feeling and variation, always though of cellos as filler in and orchestra and this musicians show how the instrument  can have life of it's own
067144901X|5.0|My children love this book.  It helps them recoginze animals and learn their sounds.  I purchased this one as a gift.
0143034901|5.0|Shadow of the Wind is more than a book to me. It's the story that taught me to love language, the story that enchanted and entranced me. Zaf&oacute;n is a master of language. Shadow of the Wind is my staple travel book, my immediate recommendation, and my inspiration for writing. I've read it some 20 or so times and it's just as beautiful now as it was then.<br />&#34;Coincidences are the scars of fate.&#34;
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|Excellent Movie, I would recommend it to anyone.  If you enjoy comedy then watch this movie, you wont be disappointed...
B002SF9YNO|5.0|One of the most touching films I've ever seen.  A remarkable inside look at Japanese funeral practices, a subject I don't think I've ever seen in a film before.  Lots of comic relief and lots of heart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the graphics and the entertainment that holds my interest.  It is not just a game, it stimulates strategy and logic.<br />Sandy
1592407889|3.0|Don't read this book if you are madly in love with Shirley.  Sachi's childhood was nothing to envy.  It rounds out the image of Shirley as a highly evolved (spiritually) person.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|totally addictive! Ask around and you'll find out a lot of people are playing this game! Levels just keep on going! SUGAR CRUSH!
B0026P3G12|5.0|She is awesome! I have watched her from the moment she was on as a contestant.  She is an inspiring singer!
0439023521|5.0|One of the best stories I have read that is set in a post apocalyptic Earth.  Specifically, the North American continent set an undetermined number of years in the future.  Once I finished the book, I immediately bought the second book which I finished within a week.  Now working on finishing the last book.  The story continues to get better and more intricate.  I highly recommend this book.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I REALLY wanted to LOVE this book.....I am a HUGE Stephen King fan, therefore, I had been counting down the days until this released, especially since it was a follow up to The Shining....BUT....As you can see, today is November 22, and I JUST finished this book today...<br /><br />I will admit, I was captivated at first.....I LOVED the beginning...from the moment little Danny opened up the bathroom door to find the ghostie woman, I was SCARED OUT OF MY WHITS!!!  I was drawn in straight from the get-go.....but about 20% into the book, and I lost interest.......I was confused a bit, and the book seemed to just draw away from the &#34;story&#34;...... Although a couple of months have passed, I still kept going back to this book and reading a chapter here....chapter there....so on and so forth........until this past weekend, when I finally made to to about 80% on the book, and FINALLY it drawn me in again......I had only 10% left this morning, and I couldnt put it down :)  ....... So, I loved about 40% of the book.... the middle of the book was not what I had wanted it to be......I felt like this should have been a short story, and not a novel.....the middle was used to &#34;fill in&#34; a book.....<br /><br />I am STILL a Stephen King fan, I LOVE HIM......Im just not a fan of this book at all ....
B004LWZW42|5.0|As a former comic book collector who has loved the X-men since I was 14, the movie is great.  The writers to take creative license with many of the characters, however, it does work for the movie.  The depiction of the origins of the characters is somewhat accurate.  And certainly, the imagination infused into the origin story line fits well in explaining the missing pieces which are a part of the X-men mythos but never really explained or dwelled up on.  Included is the in depth look of Magneto's origins while in the concentration camps in Germany, how Charles Xavier becomes a paraplegic, how Dr. Henry McCoy also known as Beast becomes blue, furry, with fangs and claws.  All in all, it was a well put together movie and much better than X-men III Last Stand.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this Eric Clapton Crossroads Festival blu-ray. Almost 5 hours of excellent sound and video.  After watching this I was surprised to read other reviews of poor video and/or sound. My Amazon pre-ordered copy was fine.  The CD for this concert is also excellent although I have to agree with another reviewer that the CD should have been 3 discs instead of 2. Highly recommend both the blu-ray and CD of this festival.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but I wish that the updates were more consistent. I have this game on my android and it updates automatically. However, that doesn't seem to happen on my kindle. The latest update I can't even find.
B00E5N8DGG|1.0|Big disappointment. Long gone is the voice of Joe Elliot and there is way to much effects / chorus to hide it. Poor editing makes it look and sound like a Britney tv appearance with Ellen Degeneres due to what would appear as lip sinching. There is no ambience in this concert, none at all. This is what happens when you play in Vegas! mostly tourists that well could be just passer by´s, not real fans. It is one of the most boring audiences I have ever seen in a concert. I honestly do not recommend it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It's Sherlock Holmes. How much more good can bit get. I like the ease of reading it on my Kindle.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Love love love every song on this CD.  I have added the entire CD to my workout playlist!  I like to think it helps me run faster!
B0065CCM76|5.0|This album has the best songs from his albums that I had from way back and some newer stuff that I didn't have. It's a must have for Seger fans.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|I have been a HUGE NIN fan since the beginning.  This CD does not disappoint.  It's very good from start to finish.
B004U8VQOW|5.0|I am in awe of the many spectacular accomplishments of men and women in science and mathematics. The Hubble Space Telescope is one of those accomplishments. Creating a journey through the universe using the Hubble data is an extraordinary result. Thank you to those involved for the ride of lifetime.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a great book for Introverts.  It provides good information on the brain and the theories on differences during the first half, and good examples of people who have adapted (somewhat) to be very successful.  It also helped me to better relate to the extroverts in our business.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I thought at first that this app was great, so I paid three dollars to upgrade.  I checked the reviews as I usually do before committing to a paid upgrade and everything looked okay at first glance, and I needed a new alarm to get the kids up for school.  Well it did not work one morning and they missed the bus so I went back and took a closer look at the comments.  Now I know that before spending money on a kindle app I must carefully check all negative comments, as they informed me that this app contains malware.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|Its ok.  I don't use it much.  It was a free app and I got it.  That is all I know.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for kindle version. Finally it's here. This is the only game l play and I play everyday.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Inexpensive but works flawlessly!  Portable...easily connected to 3 very different wireless networks.  No more paying cable companies outrageous on-demand prices!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|this movie is great to watch.  has two parallel story lines with many heroes.  will watch many times.  a few times i noticed that dialog could be a little disconnected.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This is the best Jane Eyre ever made. The actors who play Mr. Rochester and Jane own their roles and you will be captivated for the entire film. Watch this film and you will fall in love with the characters and everything that is in this film.
0375507256|5.0|good read.  unusual writing style but i liked it.  better than the movie.<br />every now and then someone comes along that takes story telling to a different plane.  this is one case.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|Having read and watched Superman since the 1950's this has to be one of the worst creations I've seen. While Henry Cavill makes a fine Superman the story flies like a rock. Even \\"Superman Returns\\" is better than this. The 1978 movie with C. Reeve was much better and more in keeping with the comics at the time. Since I haven't purchased a Superman comic in the past 25 years, maybe this IS the Superman of today. The Superman I grew up with would NEVER, EVER kill! As Kal-el says in \\" Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow\\" \\"Nobody has the right to kill. Not MXYZPTLK, not you ( Lois ) not Superman. Especially not Superman\\"<br />The DVD interview with cast and crew was ok but I was insulted as to their thinking that they, the writers, were explaining Clarks coming to grips with his being different and how this was so innovated. HELLO, Buy the 10 season series of Smallvile, which I give 5 stars.<br />I know things change but I'm sure there are a few out there with old time values.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I had heard from some friends that Ted was hilarious and rounchy.  Maybe my tolerance for this stuff has grown, or this show was not that funny or crazy.  I rarely laughed and it seemed that the show was just a bunch of Family guy jokes done in reality.  Meh!
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|Good acting, well balanced story - and I'm a chess geek.  And for one of the few chess movies out there - not bad!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow! She did it again. I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait for her to write a new series
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game when you have some down time- it is a good challenge!  Be careful, as everyone says- it is addictive!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I received the  \\"Doubleshock III\\" controller (GENERIC) today, and hopefully in 2 days they will send the Official Sony controller, \\"Replacement\\". The \\"Doubleshock III\\" controllers only sell for $12, not $45. I paid a high price because I wanted the Official controller from SONY. I will update this review if they replace it with the real deal. UPDATE: They sent me a replacement in 2 days. Thank You! Check when you receive yours and make sure it's genuine. Mine was EASY to distinguish. It clearly said DoubleshockIII on the first one instead of Dualshock .
B004HYDL1K|4.0|I like this movie because its got a great cast of actors in it.  The action is pretty much non stop.  There is alot of blood and gore in it but its styled to be funny.  Most movies with this much blood and guts are in horror or slasher films which I don't like but in this movie it works well.
0684857219|5.0|A true Arnold fan here. One of the last of his breed in terms of &#34;old school&#34; bodybuilding. The king of Greek style bodies (he did play Hercules...just sayin') in bodybuilding. This is a great book. I would NEVER say &#34;This book is the one, everyone do what this book says!&#34; about any book. I always say it is a good reference. Even Arnold's book I would say s a great reference. It has hundreds (as I recall) of great pictures of exercises, More than enough workouts for beginners, intermediate and even workouts for the professionals, if one were to get to that level.<br />Coolest parts are that, the book will give you pointers about all aspects of bodybuilding, from nothing to becoming a champ, on every aspect of it, from diet, to workouts, to psyching out your competition, and everything in between.<br />It is also a bit of a history of bodybuilding and a biography about the man himself.<br />If you even think you want to workout, or even just love the sport, you need to at least read this book, I would argue own it, but I'm not pushy like that!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Best Grisham book in long time but the ending was a little abrupt and left a few loose ends.  Who were the other 3 guys at the hanging?  Any prominent Clanton citizens present?  I felt the ending could have been fleshed out a bit more.
031623480X|5.0|This book explains why carbohydrates are bad for you and saturated fat is good for you and provides references to the research that supports his claims.  It appears that research is showing that Cholesterol itself is not the culprit.  It is oxidation of LDL that is the culprit.  Sugars in the diet cause the oxidation which destroys LDL's good functions of nourishing astrocytes in the brain so that they can nourish brain cells.  It will take quite a while for doctors to switch their recommendations for your diet because this is new and they didn't learn it in medical school.  Also how long will it take the FDA to stop recommending more use of statins?  But the book provides extensive research references so you can check for yourself whether he is right.  I wasn't looking for a diet book but thought I recognized the name of the author, but once I checked out the book I realized it may be a life saver for me.  I have switched to his diet eating no gluten or sugar, continuing to eat lots of vegetables and adding back to my diet all the fats that I have avoided for years. (My uncle was a cardiologist.)  It took a while to learn what I should eat but it wasn't hard for me, a sugar addict, to make the switch.  In ten days I have lost 7 pounds.  My doctor will check me in February to see what affect this has on me.  She still doesn't believe that cholesterol is good.<br /><br />By the way the recipe for Greek Lemon Lamb (chops) is out of this world if you marinate it overnight.
B00E6887H0|5.0|Musically, I'd follow Ry Cooder in any exploratory direction he'd like to go. This CD has an intimate sound presence and the vocalists and instrumentalists work wonderfully together. It's a marvelous album !
B00E88YNJY|5.0|My favorite new artist.  Simple music, beautiful and amazing.  Indie rock meets bluegrass meets old time spiritual meets rhythm and blues.  Nice stuff.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun and so addictive! I was reluctant to play at first, but I had to see what all the craze was about. By far, my favorite game.
0385349947|5.0|I originally ordered this book on Audible - I needed something new and fresh to help me through my daily 1.5 hour commute (each way) in Atlanta traffic.  I was surprised and delighted by how much I enjoyed the book and how REAL Sheryl Sandberg is.  She's funny and self deprecating, but also smart, savvy and very confident.  I loved what she had to say.  Really really loved it.  So much so in fact, that when I was done listening to the Audible version (twice in 2 weeks, I might add), I ordered a copy of the hardback and am busy dog earing it and underlining it.<br />This is NOT just a book for 'upper eschelon' women... nor is it only a book for 'career babes'.  It really is for EVERY woman, no matter how she defines success for herself.  I'm amazed how much of myself I saw in her book, especially with respect to all the issues working moms deal with, and the constant second guessing, etc. we women put upon ourselves.<br />OK, enough already.  Quit reading my review and go read her book!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I like the plot, it's an exciting story.  I cannot get over the way that the author tells the story, though.  Katniss is the only character that's truly developed and it's because she's the first person narrator.  The book felt rushed, the plot development was thin and I felt like I was being 'caught up' from the last book for the first 2/3 of the book.  It is a quick read, so if you like reading the books before you see the movie you ought to give it a go.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I can't remember the last time I couldn't stop reading a book. I finished this quickly. It's so interesting and you really get into the story wanting to know what happens next. I would highly recommend this book!
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Fantastic 3-disc set and still a great movie, although the few extra minutes were in comparison to the LOTR extended editions rather negligible.<br />For anyone interested, as it is not written on the cover, this set features a full-on Japanese language menu and Japanese language and subtítle options. Just set your blu-ray player's menu options to Japanese.
0316322407|5.0|The book is written through Malala's eyes. Her observations of her country and its' unsettlement can be an eye opener. Her examination of her assault and the affect it is having on her and her family is saddening. To think a group of men would shoot a child for what she believed in is against everything an American would consider as freedom of speech. The book allows me to be very thankful I can write and converse openly. I would consider it a book for all to read. It was worth the money.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device works well the only inconvenient is the app on the tablet sometimes it doesn't work or didn't appear.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|I enjoy all of Susan Boyle's music. This was no different. Her voice is calming and impressive. I have all her music both in my car and at home. This is the time of the year when she can be most appreciated.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's a cunning game. Like the other games as well. Do not like being pestered about going through Facebook all the time however.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I think this game is about semi playable good graphics and ya pretty good and I would reccomend this for other people
B009JZWO3I|4.0|A bit more nuanced and complex than most TV drama.  Characters are more well-rounded and plots offer a bit of depth.  Rather than descending into cheap soap-opera, this show builds into something more interesting.  For my taste, it's somewhere between &#34;The Sopranos&#34; and &#34;The Wire&#34;, perhaps on par with &#34;Mad Men&#34; (with a bit less visual flare until you hit a scene with the absurdly well put-together investigator whom the writers give far more screen time than credibility).  There is one romance plot that weakens the show, but it does far more things right than wrong (if only the same could be said of the clients...)<br /><br />It doesn't spend so much energy as Breaking Bad on creating a sometimes-tiresome edgy vibe and suspenseful sense of danger.  It takes time to develop and pays off rather nicely.  Like Modern Family, it shows how far networks have come in ten years and how they are still struggling to be as envelope-pushing as cable.  Personally, I usually prefer not to watch the really intense stuff right before bed, so The Good Wife just the right balance for me.
B004V9MU86|5.0|A wonderful story of hope amid the devastation of war. It shows the best of mankind when nothing makes sense.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book kept me guessing. Always a pleasure reading JG's books. The last 150 pages kept me up late dying to see how it would finish. I would highly recommend this book, I enjoyed every last twist down to the end.
0920668372|2.0|This is the most depressing book I've ever read! I cried the entire time I was reading it and can't imagine how this qualifies a children's book. It gets two stars from me only because of the illustrations and because at the end it does show a nice sentiment...it's just so damn sad!
B007HU4FZ2|2.0|This movie should have been rated NC-17 for the pornographic violence (my opinion).  It reminded me of what used to be called, &#34;Snuff Films&#34;.  I am quite familiar with the stories of the passion in the Christian Scriptures, but really...what was up with the snake while Jesus was praying.  And what the heck was Satan doing with a baby?  I don't remember Baby Satan in the scriptures.  I want my money back.
B0092MKFIY|3.0|I don't normally rate music; it's something you either enjoy or don't. I really like the song's tempo and lyrics. Should have read the reviews prior to purchase though-I think the sound engineer(s) should be fired. The recording has way too much distortion for enjoyable listening whether at low volume or louder listening levels. Your call on whether it is 'artistic' or incompetence. Two stars off for that and no more purchases for Imagine Dragons music unless it is re-released sans distortion. Quite disappointing, but at least I now know to research the names of the sound engineer as well on new digital music purchases.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super fun not only for my kids but I like it too.  Love the new levels that keep coming out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Each level is different and challenging. Difficult not to become obsessed! I am elated each time I can score big, light up all the stars and move up to the next puzzle. I am &#34;hooked!&#34;
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Christmas with the Piano Guys?  Yes, please!<br />I like pretty much anything by the Piano Guys and was very excited to find this cd!  &#34;Still, Still, Stll&#34; is absolutely beautiful.<br />If you love the Piano Guys and Christmas music you must have this CD.  The bonus CD with the yule log is excellent too!<br />I also really like the Auto Rip feature so that I can have my music immediately.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|While there are a few things about this show that are silly (like the idea that Vikings didn't know where the British Isle were), generally I found the atmosphere, acting and history to be better than most. Make no mistake, it's a TV drama not real historical fiction, but it's fun!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book! Well written;  Suspense to the end; characters are multidimensional and human; reveals how a tragic and unjust happening can influence later generations who know little/nothing about it
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Great app for game play on the Kindle or  Ipad. Be careful it can be addicting. Would recommend to friends
B007REV4T8|5.0|The first James Bond movie that we purchased because very good plot and actions. The price is alwo agreeable. Highly recommended

B00FY2UJAU|5.0|They just keep getting better.......action packed, suspense and always some mystery! Never much for a sequel, but they could just keep making these!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Was blown away and excited at the change.These guys took a sucessful  Francise and made it better. I never like the original. Kind of childish.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is so well written that I will go back and read it again! Charming, witty and the story line is the best. Can't wait to read her next novel.
1567184855|5.0|Eye opening case studies about hypnotic regression that takes through the process form the moment your soul leaves the body.  Mind blowing - could not put it down.
0385349947|5.0|All female executives or &#34;wanna bees&#34; should read this inspiring and justifying book. Remember it's HER perspective but she helps navigate the land mines ....You have to determine your own course. An excellent gift for Male executives
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|It's important to remember that it's okay to love stories for what they want to tell, just as much as we love them for what they do tell. I'm on record in national publications saying that Superman is an incredibly difficult character to write in comic books. Multiply that by one hundred and you might have some sense of how difficult it is to bring Superman to the big screen. It's good. It's more than watchable. Think wide when you watch this and you'll come away having seen a good story.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I thought it was very interesting, but I have not read other books in the series, so I didn't have all the background.  I liked it enough to read some of the others.
B00FQMVCEA|3.0|It's just OK..... nothing special for sure.  It didn't keep our attention at all and unfortunately we turned it off.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I love this cd. I played it constantly that first week it arrived and I'm still not tired of it! Favorite song: unconditionally
0688103111|2.0|This book was delivered well and on time but, I just didn't like the story.  I found the author annoying, misogynist, and condescending... not funny, at all.
B00BQ4NLC8|1.0|Way too long winded. Too many unnecessary rather boring deviations. Reduce book by half and I might consider giving it two stars. Sorry!

B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is one of those books that I will recommend to all my friends. The story is tragic, suspenseful and compassionate. Tartt's writing is 'art'!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read. It took a while, but was worth it and can't wait to see the movie tomorrow.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is awesome! Now all of my pictures look professional! I am extremely happy with this app! Defiantly worth the money!

B000M02M2M|3.0|They break easily, and, although the colors are deep and interesting, you have to press really hard to get the effect. Given the other options available, these are not the worth the price. Try oil pastels if you want a better quality for a reasonable price.

B003UYUP6M|2.0|In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, And Shapes Our Lives<br />Finally a non-children's book!<br /><br />Unfortunately the people this book focuses on still have the maturity level of children.<br /><br />In the Plex starts off with seemingly insightful and interesting information on a company everyone has made use of. However, it goes on to repeat chapter after chapter the same information over and over again in such a grandios manner that portrays Google in a very biased light.<br /><br />Even when the author attempts to sound neutral and describe one of Googles &#34;wrong doings&#34;, it does so in a way that shows the company coming full circle to full redemption. Comical to read because anyone who even casually reads the news will know that Google has it's fair share of unredeeming qualities.<br /><br />Each chapter starts off with a description, in one way or another, of how the intelligence level of the Google founders and staff far exceed that of the rest of us lowly end users. Hearing the term &#34;It's not Googly enough&#34; over and over to describe how job applicants from non-Ivy League Univerities, or those with less than 3.5 grade point average, don't fit in is enough to make me loose my lunch all the way back to my next Yahoo search.<br /><br />This book does become interesting from a psycho-analytical point of view of the people working at this compound and explains a lot about how they go after the rest of us. Like a pack of nerdy wolves hearding the search sheep into their life metadata information super pen. That's if you can stand listening to each and every minute detail of how their advertisement business came into existence. Described endlessly by interview snippets from &#34;insiders&#34; and always ending the quotation with a &#34;he sighed&#34; or &#34;he exclaimed exasperatingly!&#34;<br /><br />It's almost as if the author was trying to pre-write a screenplay in the type of reflective interview format that you could find from a movie like Gia.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Plays like a hunting trip.lots of choices and options, a great game to play. The game has great graffics.l like the choice of options.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|this game is fun to play.  takes some time to get it but once you do it is additive.  good graphics and story line.  play with friends or alone. just play.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Fast paced and fun! This book is a nice change from the typical Super Hero stories, it's almost the exact opposite.  The people with special powers are evil, and it's up to normal humans to figure out how to stop them.
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|OUTSTANDING. Every blues lover (and especially guitar players) should have this on their playlist.  From a guitar player's perspective (and a life-long RT fan) I think this is Robin's best work since the '70s.  Tasty, toneful, well-chilled blues.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Although there are any number of good to excellent productions available to see, this original reading of the story is truly the best!
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Great way to end the &#34;mid-season&#34;. The writers did well to bring closure to one era and usher in a new era. There are still enough loose ends to make you want to tune into the second half of the season. I am glad they did not leave everything just hanging (trying not to give a spoiler here), but the direction the show took should be praised. Would have given it 5 stars, but don't like these two part seasons, but networks have been doing this for a long time. And they wonder why most people wait until they can get the entire season on video. All that ad revenue they lose. Wake up AMC times are changing. Time to move on and find a new prison.
0143113100|5.0|The &#34;Brain That Changes Itself&#34; is a book about real people with various diagnoses and how their brains healed against all odds and the journey to get to that point of success..
B00EALTWAE|1.0|The movie I like, the product I hate.  The Blu-Ray disk could not be read by either of my Blu-Ray players.  I returned it requesting a replacement and received it promptly.  The new copy had the same problem so this time I returned asking for a refund now Amazon seems to dragging their feet.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great way for me to wind down and get my mind off things.  The cheesy accents are hilarious.
B00F880BWG|5.0|So far so good....<br />This sci-fi drama...which I never thought I'd want to watch, has the uncanny ability sustain my interest.  Must be a bit like the schaddenfreude effect where we like to watch damaged, unacceptable societial norms being executed for the sake of survival...... and we cant look away b/c we'd think we might just see ourselves in the character. Watch out bitters, I'm sharpening my Katana!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game.It keeps you busy. It keeps getting faster and faster.I love playing it when I'm sitting waiting on people.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|A little strange but it was good.  Michael Fassbender is great.  It was a bit on the nude side but I guess that's the point of the story.
0345803507|3.0|The book is the same no matter where you go and I know it was used but I don't understand why it had to come with a sticker on the book saying it was 10% off. That was the only thing I didn't like about it.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Its a great protection for my mothers kindle.  She wont risk spilling or crumbing the device.  its very lightweight also.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This is so adorable, I love it!<br />I like that you can name and customize him. That makes the app even more enjoyable. :3
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row is Grisham's best work since A Time To Kill. He's back with his old buddy Jake and all the wonderful characters that came to life on screen when A Time To Kill was made into a movie. I am so very much hoping this one becomes a movie and that Matthew McConaughey will once again bring Jake to life on the big screen. John Grisham brings him to life in the pages of this really great novel. I thought it was a clever plot for a novel and I thought it was a wonderful read. Couldn't put it down. Bravo,John Grisham.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was the best book i have read in a long time, or ever. It is most definitely a must read!
B0050XFY4O|3.0|It's about two souls who were together as soul mates, lovers in a past life who came back together in the current life to<br />reunite again, they just happen to be step brothers. Once  you get past the incest they had a incredible bond and love, family  acceptance. The ending left you hanging we needed more closure. As in if they got married what do they say, we are brothers<br />who are married, or we are husbands.....emotional intensity of great depth
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I tore through this pretty quickly. It was a fun book and an excellent take on the post-apocalyptic genre. Definitely going to read the second in the series. Good value for the kindle book- definitely worth the $
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best for when your waiting for an appointment. Wish they had more levels though but all in all a great time filler
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I have read all the Scarpetta books, and as I started to read the first chapters of this book I was horrified to think that Cornwell would exploit one of the worst school shootings in America for profit. I am partway through the book and don't think I will finish this one. Scarpetta is a fictional character and it is so disrespectful to the families and everyone that were horribly affected by this tragedy to include it in this book, especially when a year hasn't even passed.  The families have to live with this every day of their lives and for someone to use it in a fictional book is just disgusting. I cant even imagine what the families would feel about this.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It works well, and using my Galaxy 8.0 Note, I can have my browser open for reference to sites like Google Maps while reading.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix is without question one of the most talented - if not the MOST talented - new acappella groups touring today. I saw them on Sing Off initially and they won it against some outstanding competition. Their extremely tight harmonies and very difficult rhythms place them above the rest of the pack. This album contains traditional Christmas songs - but you've never heard them like this! Pentatonix knocks it out of the park!
0785814531|5.0|The book is very large, and the cover looked exactly as pictured. It has a dust sleeve and the actual binding of the book is black with gold lettering. The print is a little small for my liking but that's okay, it is still a great collection. If you are ordering for an older person you should maybe reconsider because the print is a little small and may be harder for them. But is is a great book! A++ and it was shipped extremely fast!
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|First of all I have to say that I was very close minded about this album, as I am what's considered a &#34;hater&#34; of Lady Gaga, I don't support her. In order not to increase her album sales, I listened to the album online.<br /><br />I have to say I don't like her persona, but there are some songs of her that I like and I listen to.<br />Unlike &#34;Born This Way&#34; and &#34;The Fame/Monster&#34;, this album has very few good songs that are pleasurable listening to, the rest is literally hyped trash marketed as &#34;artistic&#34;.<br /><br />The only good songs to listen to are: Aura, Venus, MANiCURE, Do What You Want and Dope.<br />Given the fact that the album was hyped by the pseudo popstar as the &#34;Album of the millenium&#34;, that it took 2 years to produce it and that it has been promoted like hell, this album really is a failure.<br />It wouldn't be bad if she was an artist like Rihanna, that releases an album every year. But for something so overrated by the artist itself, it really is a flop. So I'll give it 2 stars, even tho I know that little monsters are gonna be here in 5 minutes crying and insulting me, wishing me cancer and AIDS and sending me death threats. 'Cause that's what little monsters do.
0393316041|5.0|I am an avid reader of physics biography and autobiography and this is by far the best I have ever read. This is a must read for anyone in a physics or a science field. Stories of being a world class scientist inspire while portraying the interesting life he lead in his spare time. Not only a story about a brilliant man but a great adventure though life of a man who lived life to the fullest.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Fascinating book that I find hard to put down. The descriptive writing transports the reader to the places Alma visits in her quests for answers to botanical and human questions.  I'm looking forward to reading more by Elizabeth Gilbert.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game and glad it is finally on Kindle. But have a problem. when friends give me lives they don't always post. In fact,  I lose about as many as I get. Fix this please.
B000E97X66|5.0|Excellent early work! Was a gift, the recipient loved it! Loved the &#34;Live&#34; versions...he was so young then.<br />The only thing better would have been to get a DVD copy of the concert!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Nothing to Envy is a real life account of life in North Korea after the Korean War.  I found it very interesting because I knew very little about North Korea and this is a story about several families and how they coped with fear, starvation and eventual escape to freedom.  There were parts that were difficult for me to read due to the content and hard to imagine that these things happened to real people.  I highly recommend this book.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Best cd of the year. Best new band.....................................I love this stuff Thanks .Much better then the new dream theater ,and richie open a new door for me ,and mike portney is the best drummer right now.They nail it.something fresh
B009KS4XRO|2.0|While this is fun to play,there are too many problems with the game. Just when I'm getting into the game, it will freeze up. Several times I won, it froze and I didn't receive my credits. I would get bingo and it wouldn't acknowledge. On many occasions it would freeze, spit out all the numbers and be game over.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|Am really enjoying reading these stories.  Always liked Sherlock Holmes so it's good to get back to reading the original.  Holmes is much more human and likeable than he is portrayed in movies and TV.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|Once upon a time there was large mass of people that looked up to their &#34;strong and firm&#34; leaders who copied their methods from leading military organizations. Then one day people realized that actually those long time cherished methods were not very effective any more. Not in a new world, where creativity and internal motivation rules. Because of that,  a wealth of convincing scientific studies was needed to back up the unorthodox new ways. Because of that, new generation of bold and motivating leaders started to emerge. Until finally everyone will be coached to utilize their internal strengths and find childlike happiness at place of work.<br /><br />Yes, very important book. Although, when compared to Pinks &#34;To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others&#34; this books lacks some polish and final touch. But even in the rough form - I certainly recommend it.
B009IEXKXI|3.0|The book kept my interest although it was littered with the F word which was totally unnecessary.  Others may not mind that - I just find the use of the word infantile.  The story was well written nevertheless.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very typical Grisham book. I've enjoyed them all. I've never been to the state, but feel like I know a great deal about it!
B004M8S3Y6|5.0|An apparently well researched topic - I enjoy the fact that Tim Ferriss conducts his own research in separating the dross from the gold
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|amazing documentary commentated by Dave Grohl.  I was raised on fm radio and the 70's music scene has always been my favorite!  Dave maneuvers us on a musical journey that takes us back to the recording studio where incredible music recordings began; plus educates us on how music used to be recorded, a meticulous process I might add.  Starting with Lindsey and Stevie (other Fleetwood mac members, Tom Petty, Rick Springfield, the list goes on and on) and ending with Dave's musical collaboration with most of these musicians of the 70's, including Stevie Nicks, Rick Springfield and Paul McCarthy.  The soundboard used at sound city plays an intricate part in the story as well (loved this part!!!).  I cannot say enough about Dave's passion for this studio and music in general.  I had tears in my eyes at the end of the film...I know, how corny!  I sent the movie to my 22 yr. old son and he ended up purchasing Lindsey and Stevie's first album recorded there because he was so inspired by the movie.
0307474259|5.0|I am a sixty eight female and the ideas presented in this book works. Food plans helps eliminate sugar cravings/binges.  It is definitely a new perspective!!! I have lost weight and maintained my desired weight. I enjoy planned splurges on holidays, birthdays and selected meals on the week ends. I feel great. I often walk on the cross-trainer and lift weights while on this diet. Due to my age, the suggested weekly short term fasts (up to 24 hours or less) is one of the suggested helpful keys to losing and maintaining my desired weight.<br /> In my opinion, having detailed knowledge based on research about what and when you eat enables a person to make continuous wise food choices in daily activities to achieve long term personal goals.<br /> I do have regular blood/salvia testing and I do appreciate personal emotional and spiritual health.<br />But having my food intake under control gives me a sense of an overall well being. LESS STRESS/LESS GUILT WHEN I UNDERSTAND THE WHY!!! (-:

B003AYMZO2|5.0|Excellent opportunity to view missed episodes / season !  And it is so easily viewed on Prime one-click !  Thank you.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|At first when reading the comments for the book I was going in with a negative mindset, however it really wasn't a bad book contrary to the many reviews. I believe Ms Roth is such a good of writer she can take the risk of writing a tragedy. Shakespeare wrote tragedies and his name is well known, so happy endings don't make a book.<br />This book was bitter sweet and it was an emotional rollercoaster, not much books make me cry but Ms. Roth's writing had me so attached to these characters I couldn't help but bring the water works.<br />Her writing style is impeccable and captures you to every moment of the story.  I couldn't help but fall in love with certain quotes in this book. I was completely angry and depressed over this book after finishing it, and only great books can and should have that effect on its readers.
B001LF3YQK|2.0|It is way to dry in Denver for this product to work. The wipes dry out in no time & you are left with a useless wipe & a dirty baby. If you live in a low humidity area forget this product & all wipe case products.
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|I just purchased this and it came this morning. I want to clear up some of the other reviews on the site. It came in the white box as pictured and it has 10 BOXES ONE FOR EACH SEASON. There are not 6 booklets or whatever else people were saying I received 10 boxes inside this white box with each box containing one season.<br /><br />The discs are not scratched at all and I think that might be a problem if you buy it from some other seller but as long as you buy from amzaon your discs should be fine. Everything came in perfect and for the current price of $90 I don't see how you can beat this, unless they have a better deal on cyber monday.<br /><br />I will update this with pictures (with a timestamp obviously) and also with my review of the picture quality on a HD TV because I have yet to try out the discs and watch yet. Until then though I see no reason why this could be any less than 5 stars. Purchase this with ease of mind there is nothing to worry about.<br /><br />EDIT: I purchased this at $90 but it seems to be listed at $95 now. Still a great deal.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this book shows that everyhing can change you'll never know.i like this book because it is soooooooo funny my son says this is funny because greg has a giant sense of humour and he always fails.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|I guess the final result was predictable, but not the way in which it was reached. Overall, a cracking good read and is nice to read another story with Jake as the main protagonist. Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book. I bought it for my boys to read, ages 10 and 12, and fell on love with it. I would recommend it to anyone who loved the movie or is just curious about the story. A very good book and a definite must read.

0385302320|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is a genius! There is so much going on in each story and she finds a way to do it so that you are not overwhelmed by the massive amount of details and interweaving storylines. It sucks you in and you just can't put the book down.  I love these books! I have read that others were disappointed with Voyager, I could not disagree more. It was every bit as captivating as the 1st 2 books. I can't wait to start Drums of Autumn!
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Simply didn't care for the story or the author's style. Stopped reading about half-way through. That's all I have to say

B000QCS8TW|2.0|I really wanted to join the masses in liking this new 'epic fantasy' series. What, another Tolkien? Yippee! Very sadly not :(.<br /><br />I started the book and embarked upon a miserable journey from the light into the darkness. Honestly I found it so depressing and so sexually disturbing (is incest really what everybody wants?) I began to feel physically sick. I could not get past the fourth chapter. I remember loving the novel Flowers in the Attic - but this left me equally disturbed, as if the author enjoys torturing their character creations.<br /><br />Now, had I gone into the historical fiction section and purchased this book - then yes I would be much better prepared to accept what was coming. This book is not fantasy but much more suited to the realm of historical fiction, perhaps even amongst Arthurian Legend - but I retract that because Arthurian legend tends to be more inspiring, promoting high ideals, chivalry and respect of women (generally speaking).<br /><br />Throwing in a couple of Dragons barely gets it into the fantasy section - why is it not in the historical fiction section? Where is that key element so important to fantasy - MAGIC?? SO far I have found NO magic in this book. Sadly this series continues to dominate the epic fantasy section. The smaller writers barely get a look in anymore.<br /><br />These books immediately reminded of The Tudors TV series - vying for thrones and power, conniving, back stabbing, sex and violence etc... Characters of few moral values to which one can aspire to. Do not expect to loose yourself in a magical world when you buy this book. Make sure you have some comedy to watch afterwards, lol.<br /><br />I thought the book deserved a two star and not a one star because... because... I dunno I'm looking forward to the TV series now I know what to expect (historical fiction). I liked The Tudors, so I'll probably like this. It's not the author that's bad and it wouldn't be nearly so bad if it just didnt dominate the fantasy genre.<br /><br />My first bad review, I feel bad now. I guess it's cause I yearn for the light...<br /><br />J*ntasy genre.<br /><br />My first bad review, I feel bad now. I guess it's cause I yearn for the light...<br /><br />J*

B008JFUO72|5.0|I like action movies where you really get to know the characters and the reasons BEHIND WHY they do what they do. This is the first movie (of the three made so far) where we get to see more of the vulnerabilities and sensitivities of Tony Stark as the person BEHIND Iron Man.
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|This book is not for the faint hearted. This harrowing read is brilliantly written.<br />Richard Flanagan is a master of poetic and descriptive language. Once I got into it I could not put the book down.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I didn't like it when I first heard it and I'm the biggest NIN fan on the planet. I actually hung out with the band in Knoxville on their lights in the sky tour. Not as edgy lyrically as their other albums. The only downsides &#34;Everything&#34; which sounds too much like bands I don't like and some of the lyrics makes me hope Reznor isn't becoming a Christian on us. That's the only two complaints I have, NIN is still better than any other artist out there.

B00E0SX118|5.0|Hilarious! My husband and I purchased this after I was told it was a must have and my friend was right. This movie is great and you don't have to have kids to enjoy it.

B001N4TIHI|5.0|OMYGSH how I love this movie. This group of ladies works perfectly together and form a relationship that will have you wanting friends just like these. This movie is hilarious and will have you laughing all the way through it! A definite purchase for the chick-lit shelf!
B00004R99F|5.0|My favorite animated movie of all time.  Great story, music, humor, everything.  Perfect all around.  I love the soundtrack too.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is addicting! I saw it advertised and figured I would try it out and now I am trying to figure out how to get three stars and pass all the boards. A great game to have on your Kindle for when you need some downtime! And who doesn't love the witch theme? Plays well and very entertaining!
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|this movie is all and more than I expected I will sit and watch over and over again without boredom
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|My husband and I watch Red all the time and were so excited to hear a second one was coming out. I Pre-ordered this movie and I am so glad that I did. We have already watched it twice and unlike some movies, this sequel is just as good as the first. All your favorite Red characters return for a memorable action adventure.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Riveting, the characters are endearing, complicated. I learned something about the black market for art and art in general. I couldn't put it down!
B008JFUS5A|5.0|As an avid reader of The Hunger Games Trilogy, and somebody who didn't care much for the first movie, I was wary about going to see Catching Fire. Well. I was wrong. All of the problems with the first film--the pacing, the contrived shaky cam, the fear of treading on the book's themes--have all been addressed in this film.<br /><br />From beginning to end, Catching Fire never lets up, and I'm grateful for that. It doesn't waste time cuing the audience into unnecessary details (something I think the first movie tried and failed to do). Rather, it shows the audience a world on the brink of war, a world of real fear and danger, of ideology and seemingly unbreakable power apparatuses. And it does so in brisk, sweeping views of Panem. Views of the tormented landscape and the equally devastated peoples. Of course, all of this is juxtaposed quite well with the foppishness of the Capitol. The acting, and writing, too, are both spot on. Gone are the head-scratch-inducing lines from the last film. In their place, we have sharp, well-delivered dialogue, some of which even displays a humor and lightness that helps remove us from the burdens of the conflict. In a movie with a such a disturbing setting, that can be rather hard to do. Thankfully, these lines are delivered at the right time and without pretension.<br /><br />(Another note on the acting and direction: thankfully, they got Peeta right this time. He's not the troublesome, wobbly character the first movie presented him as. Rather, he now acts as a perfect double for Katniss. He saves her as she saves him.)<br /><br />As to sound, the music is as beautiful and evocative as it was in the first film. We still get the folksome, rambling tones of Appalachia alongside the booming, empyrean drumbeats associated with the Capitol. One small touch that I appreciated was the constant sound of flies and insects buzzing during the Game scenes. It really drew me into the feel and texture of a humid, tropical forest.<br /><br />I think one of my biggest gripes with The Hunger Games was the shaky cam. It felt contrived and added very little to the movie, other than headaches and vertigo. This time around, we get a steady camera that lets us take in and explore Katniss' world and the atrocities within it. It still focuses the action on Katniss, but we get to see how she interacts with the environment in a much more appealing way...mostly because we can actually see the environment now.<br /><br />Finally, Catching Fire drives home the book's themes without flinching. It doesn't spoon feed the dangers of treating people as means to an end or of the shallowness of television and advertising. Rather, it shows us the effects of these things. They are dangerous, and they affect everybody, whether we participate in them or not. It also reveals the need to sacrifice and give of oneself (burn like a phoenix, or in this case, a mockingjay) if one wants to change things, to renew them, to save them.
0765348780|2.0|This book contains truckloads of gods, demons, races, nations, heroes, villains, factions, cities, politicians, alternate dimensions, historical events, and schools of magic, all elaborately intertwined and fully conceptualized. Decent poetry, too.<br /><br />But every time the author tried his hand at characterization, plotting or dialogue I felt like I was being stabbed in the eye.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|It is an okay movie, but not as good as the Superman movies which starred Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidd.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Gresham scores on the personalities and the intrigue. Try to guess the reason and enjoy the challenge of keeping up with the plot. Thoroughly enjoyed the book
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy watching period shows.  Reminds me of the show Upstairs Downstairs which was fantastic.The sets are so well done and the costumes are beautiful. It makes u want to dress like that.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much! I cried at parts, I laughed at parts, and the book left me with an overall satisfaction. Great book!
B002MG2ATY|4.0|This is a good overview of the historical background against which the JFK assassination took place.  Unless you have read up on the evidence existing about the anti-Castro fervor in New Orleans and the South in general at the time, as well as the South's hatred for JFK and his segregation ideas, intent to end the Vietnam work (bad for big business, especially in Texas), his plan to decapitate the CIA and place its functions in the hands of the military, the movie may be difficult to follow.  Oliver Stone has been very true to facts that New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison unearthed to present at trial against Clay Shaw.  On this 50th anniversary of JFK's murder, it is scary that our government has skimmed over real evidence that proves his death was caused by a combination of government agencies and big business interests.  Funny how all those witnesses died before being able to testify before the Warren Commission and/or Shaw's trial.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Awesome movie great price and I love Charlie Hunnam I have to buy coz he is that great and handsome
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It's an okay game but I don't like how you can only play for so long and you have to quit - unless you want to buy more time.  If it's a free game - I want a free game.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love this game so much I have beat it once or twice.. anyway it's awesome!! I definitely recommend this game for teens. Not many girls play but I know this one does LOL!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really like this game. It has different levels of difficulty and I like that you can try to beat your own times.  The only drawback is that on a few of the game screens the tiles are very small and hard to see.  But this game is addicting.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This app is wonderful. It is always a good idea to use it when you are going out of town or trying to figure out what to wear.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Playing catchup but I have enjoyed the new show so much I wanted to go back and get caught up.
B00EYE0ECW|2.0|Google maps is a tremendous resource, but it's very awkward to use on a Kindle Fire HD.  I was hoping to find an interface that makes Google's power and speed easily available.  This wasn't it.<br /><br />Many of Google/Maps functions aren't available through this program - or at least I wasn't able to find the controls after spending a lot of effort looking for them.  The defaults aren't very useful, and it's hard to override them. I'm a fairly sophisticated Google/Maps user, but I simply couldn't get this to work for me.<br /><br />The clearest statement of my attitude is to say I simply gave up using this application, and have returned to typing in the URL - I wasn't getting any benefit at all.
B00GH4R95C|3.0|Not as good compared to the previous Superman Movie's.<br />I did not see any chemistry between the Hero and the Heroine
B00F880BWG|4.0|Exciting to watch and suspenseful.<br />The episode was available to watch just a few hours after the televised live program
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Like it or not, Google is the very best search engine out there, and this app gives me direct access to that search engine!
B00632HWOG|2.0|New Yahoo Mail is clearly inferior to previous versions. Difficult to navigate, impossible to get assistance. Efforts to get or provide input are impossible.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|I'm probably a little generous by offering 4 stars for this app, but since it offers integration with Gmail, it is still a better alternative to the other email apps offered by Kindle.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great fun.  This is seriously the best bingo app out there.  I play it every day.<br />Download it and enjoy.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|This is a great app and offers excellent protection! I use it on both my Kindle and my Samsung Note II.
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|Going back and trying to get it right began to wear on me. Plus it took the character so long to get to Texas. Once he got there the story dragged on and on and on and there were still so many more pages to read.  I finally went to Wiki and read the book synopsis - I don't feel like I missed anything.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy set up, just some playback issues occasionally, probably the internet connection.<br />It's a low cost way to turn your TV into a smart TV, be a lot better when there is more available content.
1476758581|5.0|I havent had the time to read it yet,but like all Rhonda Byrne books,I am sure that I will love it!
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|All of these are Christmas gifts, these are his selections so I am sure he will love them.  Lego Starwars is all he ask for so he is getting 6 sets
031623480X|5.0|I purchased this book after studying for some time the Paleo/Primal lifestyle. During studying that particular lifestyle, I'd long suspected that grains, sugars, starches, etc., were the culprits for not only obesity, but the health problems that we face on a larger scale. But I had no idea that this crap that we call food affected the brain.<br /><br />I got my first dose of this reality when back in 2006, I was nearly 250 lbs and I'd set a goal to get back down to 140 lbs. A daunting task, right? But....I went to a weight loss clinic they put me on a high-protein, low-fat, low-carb diet. Before putting me on that diet, however, they told me that for 2 days as a preparation for the diet, I was to consume as much protein, raw green vegetables and fat as I'd like and limit myself to only one fruit per day. There were no sugars, starches or dairy products allowed during this 2 days. During those 2 days, I ended up losing 3 lbs. I was baffled...I was sure that over those two days, the number of calories I'd consumed must have been through the roof but I still lost weight.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't think much of that 2-day prep phase afterward. I went on with the diet they'd put me on until I reached 140 lbs. But at some point, keeping the weight off was a struggle. At one point, I used to utilize that 2-day prep diet when I'd go over my goal weight but still hadn't taken it seriously as a long-term thing. What was also interesting was that my state of mind was very volatile during this period of weight loss. I could lash out in extreme fits of anger at any moment over the pettiest things.<br /><br />Let's fast forward to now. I began studying the Paleo/Primal lifestyle earlier this year and I couldn't help but think of that 2-day prep period which I underwent in 2006. My studies have lead me to believe that keeping weight off wasn't able calories it was about the kinds of food I consumed. Even now, whenever I have a so-called &#34;cheat day&#34; by eating processed crap, my mood can often become volatile....and reading this book explains why. Needless to say, those so-called cheat days are a thing of the past.<br /><br />On to a review of the actual book. I like the fact that even a non-medical person can understand what is being said. The author uses a lot of medical jargon, but then he proceeds to break it down into layman terms so that anyone could understand what is being said. The reviewers who said that there's no scientific data are flat out lying. Every claim the author has made, he pointed to either a study conducted by other MDs or results achieved with his own patients. That being said, the author has validated what I long suspected has been the case. Since going Paleo/Primal, keeping the weight off has actually been pretty simple. But most important of all, my mental health has improved.essed crap, my mood can often become volatile....and reading this book explains why.

B00CUWWLWG|2.0|While the graphics are impressive, the game play itself is very tedious.  In order to continue decent play, you will need to make in game purchases using your own money.  That's fine every now and then, but if you really want to have the quality of game play necessary, it's going to cost you.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This is one of the finest reads for me in many many years...my jaw continued to drop at the elegance of the descriptive prose..especially during the Pippa passages. I was amazed at the clever plot twists.I re-read much of it over and over. I was so moved by the time I finished the book, that I haven't been able to pick up another one...I need to savor the Goldfinch for awhile yet.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|doesnt work but i paid fix this or else ill sue you for taking my money and not giving product
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Great music...good service so I'm happy to have it as part of my collection...well done! Good to have as part of any collection!
B008PZZYB2|3.0|I like Ben and Owen so the movie is stupid funny...if you like that humor you will find this movie funny..
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It's starts off great gets you hooked then requires you to pay money or you can't beat the level. The higher the level the more unbeatable unless you buy the extras.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is the best and this novel may be his best ever.  Reading this book is like watching a movie in your mind. It is very cinematic.  Since we know the faces of all the characters from the film &#34;A Time To Kill,&#34; one can see this book on their mind's screen quite easily.
B007ADJTMK|5.0|One of my favorite movies. It has its funny moments, I was laughing so hard I almost started crying. It also teaches some valuable lessons, like doing what you love. I enjoyed this movie because it really touched my heart. Please watch, and read the subtitles!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought this item for my Son and it works great with his Samsung Tablet, it does all that it says!!!!!
B00GH4R95C|3.0|Fans will enjoy this ambitious re-boot, but casual viewers will find it boring in spite of lots of action and destruction. Henry Cavill has great potential, but he spends far too much time crashing through buildings and not enough time interacting with the other characters. The best parts are Cavill's scenes with his parents (Diane Lane and Kevin Kostner). The rest of the film is weighed down by SFX overkill. The screenwriters' vision of Superman isn't the mysterious, slightly sinister figure of the early years (1938-48) or the squeaky-clean hero of the middle period (1949-86), but rather a conflicted outcast in the mold of Wolverine or Spiderman. That's a sad fate for the costumed superhero archetype. The story is bland but functional and a talented cast do their best with weak material, especially Russell Crowe who tries hard to make a dull origin story interesting. Overall, this is an admirable film that fails because its serious pretensions are undermined by laughable scenes like Lois Lane (Amy Adams) exploring an arctic cave at night in high heels and Jonathan Kent's suicide by tornado.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This bond movie was really good and I love the fast pace and Daniel Craig did a great job again as Bond.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. It drives me crazy, but I love this game. It is a lot of fun to play.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I enjoy this type of movie and I was told it was not very good but I have watched this movie 6 times now.
0142403873|5.0|Our toddler loves this book.  I'd definitely wholeheartedly suggest it to any parent and their child(ren)...<br />Now the reason I'm writing this review is that on out trip to Europe this summer we learned there is also an ANIMATION... We got it, and just love it. Check it out: [...]<br />We also bought the Gruffalo's Child [...]
B008XBCJ34|4.0|If you like movies like this than this one will not let you wpwmat all. I have watched it many times now.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|awesome story.  suggested it for the book club I belong to.  everyone liked it and we had a very lively discussion.......very!
B005LAII4E|4.0|Good movie and I was blown away when Duke was killed in action and is no longer in the movie.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|For a non-techie like me, this app is fabulous!  It's super easy to use and can go everywhere with me, unlike a counter top timer or the timer on my stove!  My 15 year old cat requires medication every six hours and with my busy life,  l can't keep up.  If it wasn't for Timers4Me, my vet and my kitty would be very unhappy!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great read couldn't put it down! Keeps you guessing and in the end makes you think about life and all twists and turns it can take and have you end up in a completely different place than you thought
B004I744AS|5.0|It works for everything. It's awesome and everybody should use it. If you like the Encyclopedia you'll love this. That just my opinion though.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Immentily pleased. Excellent characters and a very unique world. Sanderson as his best, so far. Looking forward to the sequol. Recommended reading for any fantasy liker or lover.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. The only real problem I have is that some things cost far too many crowns, which mainly need to be purchased.
1423140591|4.0|Rick Riordan has continued to be a good read for my daughter, book after book.  We will continue gifting his books.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|deceptively simple looking, yet complex and fun to play!  great game!  I am really enjoying it as it continues to challenge me.
0071636080|4.0|I heard about the books at a Story Telling conference. It was highly recommended by a Marketing executive.  Try it.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Book was just brilliant. Ending amazing.  Must read. If bub think u know the ending you are wrong.  Just class
B0092S4WLY|5.0|very cool, thought provoking game. good for children, to actually encourage memory and creative thinking. You could also literally drop them off in a locked room somewhere out in the city and see if they can get out. that would really build character but the folks at CPS may not like it.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|It's like my theme song. I love it, I've always been a Gaga fan and she always make me happy when she brings out new music.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I never thought I'd be interested in a drag racing game, but this one changed my mind. Realistic graphics &amp; sound effects, edge-of-your-seat excitement... what's not to like? Try it, you'll like it too!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well written - characters well-defined - good conversation at Book Club.  Makes one ponder the vagaries of life.  No More
1118109791|4.0|It took a very long time for me to receive it! :-( It came almost a month after the expected date. Having said that...<br />It has all of the information I need for the exam. Now the only question is, 'Am I going to read all of it in time for the exam?' lol!
B004BSFC46|5.0|Man, they sure make cute things for babies these days! The baby of our acquaintance very much enjoys these Lamaze wrist rattle toys. To a baby, lots of things can be toys, including their funny, pudgy little bodies. Waving their arms around seems be all the fun with these accoutrement. Enjoy!
B008JFUR10|5.0|1. Giant &#34;robots&#34;.<br />2. Giant &#34;monsters&#34;.<br />3. SMASH!<br /><br />Okay, that should be enough for fans of the genre, but Pacific Rim delivers all of that and lots more. It's got a sentimental, almost &#34;corny&#34; vibe to it, and yeah, it requires a willing suspension of disbelief, but it pays off and is internally consistent for the most part. Here's a tip to the Jeager drivers though: Use the SWORD first!
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|We were happy, happy, happy to find these adorable footsies to give as a gift to a coworker with a new baby. They were warmly received by mother and baby alike. Fun! They should make these for older adults as well so that we can find our feet a little better.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book was wonderful.  The characters were rich; the story was moving;  and Hosseini 's writing is marvelous - poetic without being syrupy.  I have read his other 2 books and loved them.  He did not disappoint me this time and I look forward to the next book.
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|Since Pixar insists on dropping the ball you have to hand it to the other animation studios. This movie is a lot of fun. Great HD sounds and picture.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love this series.  Watched all 3 seasons and I wished there were more.  I loved all the charactors and couldn't wait to see were each episode was going to take themand how the village would pull together.  I will probably watch these seasons all over again,  that's how good this program is.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great book until the end. Good plot, well-written, interesting character development. But at the end, it seemed like Ms. Flynn was suddenly told she had 1 page to wrap things up and as the reader, I found myself unceremoniously dumped, without explanation. I felt ripped-off by the lack of effort or imagination used to finish the story-telling.
B00GME9AJK|4.0|While this may not be the most accurate account of the Steve Jobs story, it still is an inspiring and entertaining movie. Take it for what it is and enjoy the ride :)
B002GYI96U|5.0|This is no silly, fluffy wedding story.  Serious subjects are hit upon in this story: homosexuality and unplanned, possibly unwanted pregnancy.  This is a great book.  I've read most of Madeleine Wickham aka Sophie Kinsella's books and love them; this is the most dramatic one I've read so far.  The story is powerful and filled with emotional moments.  A great read!
B006BQM762|5.0|A good and fun movie grandkids and I  enjoyed it. Abrams and Speilberg  made a good one together. Hope to see more
B00915G6YE|5.0|greatest series ever from season one til the last season my Sundays are empty without dexter cant wait to see whats his next project amazing actor
B009NET0H8|2.0|Sadly it looks like someone with an hour's training in image editing software, and no appreciation of this great photographer's style, has been let loose on the curves control and turned these sparkling black and white photos into sludgy, soupy prints completely devoid of subtlety. If she could see this book poor Ms Maier would probably wish those negatives had been left undiscovered. These beautiful photos are better viewed on the photographer's official website, where your computer's monitor will make a better of job of reproducing them, for free.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It took some twists and turns and was not predictable, so all in all, an enjoyable read w/o too many moral quandaries.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|So awesome but sad!!!!! I am in love with this series my favorite ever. I want to write books like this!
006202406X|5.0|This book was really good! Just as good as divergent! The ending really surprised me but it was great. Great choice for a book!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This space Series is very creative.  I am enjoying Stargate SG-1 very much.  I highly recommend it for scify fans!
B00E9A656K|5.0|Nice graphics and a lot of fun to play... Love it!  One of the best games I've seen out of the app store.
B00FQUACUM|3.0|I love tenors and I don't mind baritones.  These young men have clear, beautiful voices but need more coaching in English.  Their charming Italian accent unfortunately were jarring.  They should stay with standard carols and leave the semi popular songs alone.  All in all I added 4 songs to my Christmas playlist.  Not bad.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I find that I'm enjoying the game more when I don't have to try for 3 stars. The other challenge modes help to provide a fun challenge along with having achievements. I also like the fact that there are multiple ways that you could complete a level and once you get used to the swinging motion, it becomes not too difficult to toss a rock right where you want it to land. Not really an Angry Birds clone as you're not far away from the things you're trying to hit and your more trying to toss the rocks in the right way to bounce and hit things rather than to throw them at something and try for ultimate destruction.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was very impressed with this whole series. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and I couldn't put it down. Its a better version of a hunger games type book.
1400095204|4.0|“Half of a Yellow Sun” is one of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s best works. She is a prominent young Author from Nigeria who has made a living writing to have people see Africa from another point of view. This Novel setting is in Nigeria, during the Nigerian-Biafran War in 1967-1970. The effects of the war on its people and their lives, is shown from different viewpoints from different social rankings. A high political members, a professor, a British citizen, and a house boys, is how Adichie really captured the viewpoints on how the war effected them and their families. This Is something that I really liked about how Adichie set up this novel through different viewpoints. It made me view the war in different angles. Since the novel had different characters that showed different angles the booked jumped around alot and it took me a few seconds to stop and see where I am at and whose view Adichie has me looking at. The novel was well written and very graphic. Adichie placed alot of emphasis on the details and background that she wanted the reader to comprehend. The graphic details is something that Adichie did very well.<br /><br />Overall “Half of a Yellow Sun” was a great informative read. It taught me something about the hardships people suffered because of the Nigerian-Biafran War that the media did not. I recommend this book for anyone looking to expand their vision.<br /><br />*Read this book for Dr. Rhonda M. Gonzales' HIS/AAS3603 class at the University of Texas At San Antonio*

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|One of the best things that has happened to me since plugging into the book review blogging world is that I have been exposed to books and authors outside of the rock from under which I've been living. Case in point: John Green. Obviously I've seen his books around for years, but why I had never actually read one is beyond me. After reading The Fault in Our Stars, I plan on reading much more John Green in the future.<br /><br />In this witty and emotionally insightful novel, 16-year old Hazel maneuvers through life with terminal cancer (and her ever-present oxygen tank). Keeping her social circle small so that her anticipated passing doesn't affect any more people than necessary, Hazel's world changes when she meets Augustus at a cancer support meeting. Though Augustus is in remission, their mutual experience living with cancer catalyzes their relationship and injects more life into the both of them than any medication can. Written with an emotional poignancy that few contemporary novels have come close to replicating on this subject, John Green's The Fault in Our Stars has more life in its pages than its subject matter may imply.<br /><br />There are many topics in literature that I wouldn't recommend an author tackle without sincere writing talent and acute caution; one, of course, is cancer. There are far too many sensitivities associated with this painful disease to gamble with writing something trite or insincere. All that said, I'm so pleased that John Green was successful in crafting a novel that handles the topic of cancer with the love, care and expertise it deserves and honors those affected by cancer in such a beautiful and honest way.<br /><br />There are very little ways in which Hazel resembles a healthy teenager: she is extra sensitive to her interactions with her parents who she is well-aware will be left childless once she passes; she is no longer able to attend normal high school; even her appearance is unable to be masked as she is forced to totearound an oxygen tank and be subjected to stares. But despite her cancer-related trials, Green still presents a 16-year old girl who can become frustrated with her parents, who marathons America's Next Top Model, and who is expertly capable of falling for a cute boy.<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus are both especially memorable characters because of their insight into life far advanced for their ages, most powerfully their selflessness. Instead of embarking on a romance with a boy who likes her, Hazel distances herself from Augustus because she doesn't want to hurt him when she passes away. While flirting via text she says, &#34;I pictured him at my funeral, and that helped me text properly.&#34; Images such as these really helped me as a reader, who has virtually been unaffected by cancer, get straight into Hazel's mindset, anticipating the end of her short life at any time. Augustus especially struggles with leaving a mark on the world, a task highlighted by the ticking clock of cancer. The idea of leaving a mark on the world is universal; however, viewed amongst the backdrop of cancer, the mortality of every person is brought more clearly into view.<br /><br />On the other end of the spectrum, John Green's writing is also hilarious and poignant that it makes up for the amount of tears you may cry while reading. One of my favorite lines in the novel is, &#34;What a slut time is. She screws everybody&#34;. Similarly, Augustus beautifully tells Hazel, &#34;You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.&#34; Without Green's emotionally affecting writing, I think this novel would have fallen flat; however, it's his carefully crafted words that allow readers to identify so strongly with Hazel and Augustus, no matter where they are or have been in relation to cancer.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A must read for anybody, just keep a box of tissues nearby! 5/5 Stars.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved this book because it transported you into another dimension that only a few have the privilege to see.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read The Hunger Games series before I had a book review blog, so I never wrote a formal review for any of the books while they were fresh in my mind. But this series, especially this book, affected me so much that I'm glad I had the opportunity to re-read it upon the release of the movie and share my review with you today (I literally finished this book an hour before we left to the midnight showing of the film, which is why this review is posting late today! P.S. I'm sleepy.).<br /><br />The second book in Suzanne Collins' dystopian young adult series, Catching Fire takes place a few months after The Hunger Games ends, finding Katniss Everdeen back in District 12, this time living comfortably in The Victor's Village. Her relationship with fellow victor, Peeta Mellark, is strained at best and she's fighting feelings for her best friend Gale after he's kissed her, exposing something that's been building between them long before The Games. But choosing which boy with whom to invest her time is the least of this seventeen year-old girl's problems. When President Snow visits her and threatens the lives of everyone she loves if Katniss doesn't play along with the Capitol's agenda to sweep her act of defiance under the table, Katniss realizes that she'll be playing The Games her whole life and must decide if she's brave enough to stand up for the things she believes in.<br /><br />When I began reading this book, I had no idea what to expect, but Collins delivered everything I could have anticipated and more. For one, I started this book completely Team Gale, but Collins did an excellent job of taking Katniss and Peeta and allowing them to organically grow together as friends and companions that I didn't know which guy to love more by the end of the book. Katniss, while obviously selfless in her decision to initially volunteer for her sister, has acquired a strong sense of survival which she tends to misconstrue (in my opinion) as selfishness. In comparison, Peeta is completely selfless, thinking only of Katniss, even when it means helping Gale. I love to see how Katniss grows by learning from Peeta. I think the only reason Katniss is ever identified as &#34;selfish&#34; (even if selfish means only thinking of her loved ones versus the whole country) is because this story is told from her point of view making her transparent; but I think she is better able to decipher her values because of her relationship with Peeta and his value system. This adds a new dynamic to their relationship and uncovers a lot of who Peeta is (and why we love him! ;)).<br /><br />But as I mentioned in my synopsis, Katniss' boy dilemma is the least of her problems. Her struggle with her value system is what brings this supernatural story down to a human level. The inconceivable is processed by a teenage girl like a teenage girl. I hate complaints that Katniss is too whiny, too insensitive to everyone's feelings, too pre-occupied with herself; if I were in her shoes I would have eaten the berries on day one of the 74th Hunger Games! I think she's allowed to struggle and her struggle uncovers her heart and her drive.<br /><br />To keep my book review blog spoiler-free (as is always my goal), I have to refrain from discussing some of my favorite parts of this book, especially regarding Katniss and Peeta's public relationship and the premise of the Quarter Quell. In short, I loved the way this book had so many powerful little punches that kept me on my toes and at the edge of my seat. The pacing is incredible, especially coupled with how much emotion is compacted into each forward-moving segment. There are so many details I had forgotten about in the 2 years since I first read Catching Fire, and I'm so glad I was able to refresh my brain before seeing the movie.<br /><br />Speaking of the movie, like the book it was everything I expected and more! I think the Catching Fire movie is so much better than The Hunger Games, especially because it didn't try to be artsy (i.e. shaky cameras and super close ups!! Who else HATED that?!). It put out the story (cutting most of what I expected) but it didn't change much. My only complaint is that, similar to the first movie, Katniss and Peeta's relationship didn't translate to the screen as well as I had hoped for. I guess what can I expect in such a short time frame, but that was my only disappointment nonetheless. I mean, I didn't even believe they were romantic, why would the Panem public? They did make Peeta so much more of an alpha-male than he is in the book, which I loved!! Sometimes I question Josh Hutcherson as Peeta when I see him in the media, but then when I'm watching the movie I just love him. Also, bonus fact about the movie: I noticed in the credits that a guy my mom used to date before she was married was in the stunts! HOW COOL, RIGHT?! I am trying to convince my mom to get back in touch with him muahaha! ;)<br /><br />Bottom Line: This series changed my reading life and if you haven't read it, my biggest recommendation on this blog is that you read it NOW. And then go see the movie! If you need a refresh before the movie, I highly suggest taking the time to re-read it because I think you'll appreciate the movie even more! 10 out of 5 stars lol.sy (i.e. shaky cameras and super close ups!!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Had to read this book for a class.  Once I started reading it I couldn't put the book down which from a person who does not like to read, well that says something about the book.  Ended up loving the book.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Let me start this review by saying that I read this in between George R. R. Martin books, which is really hilarious. After dense chapters, complicated story lines and a real lack of girly romance I needed a guilty pleasure easy read, and Entwined with You did not disappoint in delivering just that!<br /><br />Picking up right after the shocking revelation that Gideon Cross murdered Eva Tramell's stalker and rapist ex-step-brother, Entwined with You is a story of growth. Eva and Gideon begin a new chapter of trust and grow more dependent on each other as they secretly rekindle their relationship, careful of police and media. It seems that their lives can't cut them a break, what with Gideon's crazy, vengeful and jealous exes, and Eva's overprotective parents and dirty past popping up everywhere; but Gideon and Eva show how far they've come and prove that together they can take on anything.<br /><br />I am still completely on the fence with this series. Even though it seems like a pretty straight forward copycat of 50 Shades of Grey, I have always been a strong proponent that these books are far better written and have stronger characters than its mainstream predecessor. I love that both Eva and Gideon have traumatic pasts to work through and that Eva isn't an innocent virgin unsuspecting of her own sexuality. However, the more time I spend reading these books the more I feel like they are trying too hard. While this novel had much more action happening to move the story forward (compared to Reflected in You), the melodramatics and vapid dialogue drove me absolutely crazy. I wonder if the author reads the dialogue aloud to see if it sounds realistic because to me it was embarrassing to imagine people talking like Gideon, Eva and even Cary. I know this isn't supposed to be a realistic story, of course; but I wished the dialogue wouldn't remind me of this so often.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading the last two books in this (now) quintet Crossfire series, mostlybecause I can't not finish a series once I'm this deep; but also because I really do enjoy Eva and Gideon. I read this book in 24 hours, so clearly I enjoyed it (albeit guiltily) and I'm going to miss reading it now that I've finished. But this one is definitely aimed at the sappy ladies and best read behind the privacy of your e-reader. ;)<br /><br />Bottom Line: As I've said before, if you're a 50 Shades lover, this series blows that series out of the water in terms of writing, sexuality and character growth. If you're already invested in the series, I recommend this book as well. Anyone else: read at your own risk - a lot of intense sex and a lot of melodramatics (which could totally be your thing, but I dig it more in moderation).  3/5 stars (although it's definitely better than the second book, Reflected in You.).
B008EL25LE|3.0|Nice graphics, pretty fun game. Similar to bejeweled, with a few cut scene match/find the picture mini games. I completed it fairly quickly, for a game that costs money, a little too quickly.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|If you haven't read anything by Stephanie Perkins, I suggest you change that as quickly as possible. Lola and the Boy Next Door, a companion novel to Perkins' Anna and the French Kiss, is a bright, witty and in-depth exploration of the many facets of first love. Lola Nolan is as colorful as you get: her passion is outside-the-box fashion, she lives in San Francisco with her two gay dads and she's dating a hot indie rocker, Max. But when Cricket, the first boy who broke Lola's heart, moves back into the house next door, the color drains from Lola's life and she's forced to face her past. This book takes a strong look at identity while also amply exploring communication and familial relationships.<br /><br />I think Lola and the Boy Next Door is the defining book that made me accept and appreciate companion novels. I am always so disappointed when I learn a book is a companion and not a sequel; case in point: the Graceling series. But in all instances where I've read a companion novel, I have loved it as much as its predecessor. In Lola and the Boy Next Door, Anna and St. Clair work at the same movie theater in San Francisco as Lola and are very present in the storyline; I think that makes Lola the best companion novel I have ever read because older characters are often present.<br /><br />Similarly ever-present is Stephanie Perkins ability to create likable characters that feel like real people and always keep the story moving forward. I loved Lola, teeneaged-Danielle identified with her so much! I appreciate that Perkins characters are not perfect which make readers able to relate to them. Lola (much like Anna) toes the line of right-and-wrong and Perkins isn't afraid for her characters to feel their way through this line in order to write a fulfilling coming-of-age story. Without spoiling anything, at the climax of the story I really felt like I knew what Lola was experiencing, which is a testament to the storyline and the characters. The way Perkins poignantly describes fundamental experiences of growing up hit me hard.<br /><br />Furthermore, I enjoyed that Lola's dads are gay and that her family history is really complicated (again, teenaged-Danielle identified with this so much!). The way in which Lola's dads are written, it's not a &#34;thing&#34; it's just life, which was so refreshing! Instead of it being a huge commentary on same-sex relationships, it was treated with normalcy. I loved the modern family that Perkins crafted with two loving parents who gave Lola everything any teen girl needs: unconditional love, discipline, and boundaries with enough room to grow.<br /><br />While I could write for hours about what I love about this book, I'll just mention one more thing: the setting of San Francisco! I understand that I was completely biased being that I've visited the city a lot in the past few years, but this book refers to so many real life places that it made me giddy! I'm familiar enough with San Francisco that I recognized almost every place Lola referenced; I've eaten pizza at Blondie's, I've bought a cookie at Hot Cookie, I've walked by The Castro sign and all around Lola's neighborhood. It was so much fun reading all of these references and feeling like I was inside the story. Consequently, it made me even more excited to visit Paris so that I could map out Anna and St. Clair's adventures! Who knew books could be decent travel guides?<br /><br />The only flaw I found with this book was in Max; when Max and Lola are together, I understand his appeal enough to reconcile that they make a good pair. But when Lola and Cricket interacted I just couldn't understand why she would stick around with Max. Max was not written with enough appeal for me to &#34;get&#34; him. Although, maybe that's part of the story: that when you're seventeen you don't have to have a reason to date anyone, there are just too many feels to focus. I was easily able to suspend my feelings of indifference, but I wished I wanted to love Max more.<br /><br />(Oh, and I hated the name Cricket. I'm sorry, I'm probably in the minority. But I hated that as a name.)<br /><br />In writing reviews for over a year now I'm learning a lot about myself as a reader, especially what makes me love or not love a book. One marker that I measure a book by is its ability to make me feel like I'm not alone in maneuvering through any given experience; when a story hits you at your core because the author articulates something you weren't able to explain in your own words. Lola and the Boy Next Door is a perfect example of a book that articulates the collective feelings of what it meant for me to be a teenager. For that alone it has become one of my favorite books.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you've ever been a teenaged girl, read this after you finish Anna and the French Kiss! While you wouldn't know it from my review, I liked Anna a little bit better, but this book was still a fast favorite! 5/5 stars
B0022F1XW0|5.0|Love Genesis and this album delivers my favorites and are of excellent quality! I'm so glad that groups do the Greatest Hits!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I think many people would agree that Allegiant has been the most anticipated YA release of 2013. The third and final installment of Veronica Roth's Divergent series picks up right where Insurgent left off: Tris Prior learns that her world of factions is just a small ecosystem in a much larger world, created to help defend the outside world with Divergent. With Evelyn Johnson abolishing factions and running the city like a tyrant, Tris and Tobias head outside the city limits to discover the world beyond.<br /><br />I  have incredibly mixed feelings about Allegiant, but at the end of the day I enjoyed it, especially because of the ending which I will not spoil for you. Unfortunately the book started with a bad taste in my mouth because of all these Four novellas Roth is releasing to lead up to the Divergent movie release. I enjoyed Free Four to get me through the wait between books, but a whole series of Four novellas just to pump the movie? I think the series does better without them and all I see them as is a ploy for more money. It's money, I get it. But overall I think it chips away at the credibility of the Divergent trilogy and franchise. I find it's insulting to loyal readers, especially considering it would have made more sense to appease us in between the actual books. I think I would have been more receptive if it was one book from Four's perspective instead of four cheap teasers. I read The Transfer right before I read Allegiant, and, even though it was a sound novella, it left a bad taste in my mouth because of all the reasons above. I didn't trust Roth as an author anymore because now I feel she's just in it for the money. Not the best way to begin a new book!<br /><br />Overall this novel seemed very aimless to me. I never felt like there was a distinct arc that I could follow and consequently found it difficult to gauge how far along with the book I had read. I suppose I could give Roth the benefit of the doubt that she wants the reader to feel as aimless as Tris, but given my previous rant, I was too disheartened to believe this. If not for the great ending, I would have been extremely disappointed in the book overall.<br /><br />Another difficult part of this book to reconcile is the extreme change in scenery, which reminded me of Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay. The change of primary setting from the first two books took me out of my comfort zone as a reader. I never realize how a constant setting plays such an integral role in a series until it's taken away and the new setting takes some adjustment. This isn't a criticism of the writing because I understand it was necessary, but it might have played into why I felt this book was so aimless.<br /><br />At the end of the day, though, Roth is still an incredible writer and she can't go wrong with the cast of characters she has created. The themes of identity and being capable of creating ones own future are strong in this book and there are a lot of important lessons Tris and Tobias learn together. I could go on about various parts of this book, but I don't want to imply any spoilers. Despite my complaints, I still enjoyed every ounce of Tris' adventure, especially her evolving ideas of right and wrong. She remains one of my favorite female protagonists and a reason why I'll always recommend this series to other readers.<br /><br />Bottom Line: My feelings are so mixed, but overall I recommend this book and series, especially if you've already invested the time in the first two books in the series. 3.5/5 stars, but I'm rounding up for the ending.

B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Wonderfully epic!  Although this is a 3 hour movie it really keeps you going the whole time.  The music and photography is stellar!  There is some cheesiness but that is overlooked when you get lost in the enormous scope of this movie.  This is a definite must if you like movies that cause you to experience several different strong emotions.  Highly recommended for anybody who enjoys quality movies.  Too bad it didn't catch on in the theaters but then again I don't think most 3 hour movies do.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This 2010 movie, with its great cast, was nominated for a Golden Golbe and Satillite Award.  Based on a DC Comics book by same name, features rare appearance by Ernest Borgnine.  Besides the big name stars, it includes Karl Urban, James Remar, and Richard Dreyfuss.  If you like things blowing up, a Bruce Willis trademark it seems, you'll have fun with this movie.  The characters played by Helen Mirren and John Malkovich are complete role reversals, and lots of fun.

B00B04NJI0|4.0|A true horror/gore fan will love this film but it is definitely not for the squeamish.  This ditty goes leaps and bounds beyond traditional gore.  Frankly, it is sickening...not a flick you'd be munching with fresh buttered popcorn or enjoying a TV dinner on the couch.  I've read some of the other reviews of this film and I totally agree with those who hate or like it.  You MUST be a gore fan and enjoy the ability of directors and cast members to produce such grizzly scenes with a tongue-in-cheek attitude.  Please...leave the kids out of this one.  When I see films like this, I can't imagine what future gore will have in store for horror fans.  I gave it a 4-out-of-5.  Good job...a nice variety of sickness.

B0015T6G2G|4.0|This book is Amazing. I'm looking forward to the movie. Nelson Mandela is a leader that has impact on my life.
B0000549B2|5.0|I had to add this movie to my Denzel collection!  I enjoyed the club scene with Wesley Snipes playing solo.  I never forgot the song she sang.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The novel offered historical information in a most readable manner. I had not known of this particularly sordid time in the annals of America.. Following the story of the real life characters' as they moved across the continent and met their caretakers, learned a great deal of what happened to so many unfortunate children.as they struggled to survive in their new envronments. I have recommended this book and will continue to do so.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I loved the movie, but however I did not like the time he spent being a drunk and addict in the movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the books and could not put them down.  The movie was true to the book.  I loved it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is better than the original facebook version, which can get laggy and overload you with quests. This is way more fun and runs really smoothly on my kindle fire hd. I would definitely recommend.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I installed this on my Kindle HD and Mac. You can't use your Mac while using this app as it screws up your screen resolution and takes over your curser. It slowed my Mac to a crawl while using Safari (which was back to normal once I deleted the program). The web pages displayed on my Kindle were cut off too. So either way this app was unusable for me. Thankful I only wasted $4.99 on this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game.  Challenging but not extremely hard. Ive played other escape games and gave up because they were too hard.  I cant stop playing this one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|so addictive I can't even begin to tell you.  only complaint I have is that I don't have enough time to see how many jellies I have left when I run out of moves.  just like to know so I can see if I'm actually getting closer to beating the level or not.
031623480X|5.0|This is a very interesting book. Dr. Perlmutter writes about the effects of certain foods on the brain. And, he recommends against eating grains, sugar, carbs, and fruit, and to eat lots of meat and vegetables. However, the American Heart Association still recommends to eat lots of fruit, whole grains, and vegetables, and reduced amounts of meat. The only thing they seem to agree on is to eat lots of vegetables!. I would recommend reading this book and deciding for yourself. The information presented in Grain Brain is backed by research, and is very compelling.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Always on the edge and can't put it down kind of book. I love each book I read by Grisham
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is very entertaining and challenging,  i like where you only have five lives in a session because i would probably sit for a very long time playing this game.
B004GYY714|3.0|Works some of the time, but not as reliable as it used to be. Has nice features, but takes ages to buffer and streaming podcasts/web episodes (off the BBC for example) get dropped and restart constantly, meaning you only hear the first 2 minutes of an hour long programme before it cuts and you have to hear it again. I used to love it, but it's become steadily less reliable over the years and now it crashes every time I try to listen to something.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I loved the horses I got and all the games there were and you can change the names the.outfits just everything is great
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was updating for like an hour at 0%. I unplugged the USB to power cord for 20 seconds, and it zipped through the update -_-. This is a lot nicer than using my Xbox 360 to watch Netflix though. On the 360, episodes just autoplay, with my Android, I can read descriptions, etc. Also, 1080p &#62; 720p, and no stupid xbox live fee.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|this may be a free game but having to restart when I fail to clear a level rather than spend actual money to keep going is very tedious.  Also the &#34;help&#34; on how to take advantage of the special bonus items is not clear
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|this app is great for school to keep notes and never lose them. it also saves trees from being cut down to make paper. I love this app.
0316322407|5.0|Awesome! The book is conversational. She describes her trajectory since she was born. Her family is beautiful and she is intelligent. It’s a must read.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Not that reading about prison is especially uplifting but this is a very worthwhile read. Much different tone than the show. Interesting commentary about mandatory minimum sentences and their effect on the U.S. Prison system.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Kind of a mash up of movies.  Was like Men in Black only with ghosts, but saw a lot of familiar elements that reminded me of other movies.  But it was entertaining and pretty clean.
031623480X|5.0|This is a MUST read for everyone wanting better health now and in the aging process.  I believe his research is right on and the message must get out to save the deteriorating brain epidemic.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|There's a kernel of a good movie in here somewhere, but overall this was a mess. The story is all over the place, the changes to the mythology are inconsistent, and a lot of the effects are unconvincing.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite fantasy love movies. I enjoy. watching this movie over and over and I'm sure I'll watch again.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I always enjoy a good book with great characters. Grisham draws you in tot the story from the very first chapter. You find yourself rooting for the main characters yet not sure that they are going to prevail. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good story with legal drama.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I enjoyed Pirate Latitudes, but I was very disappointed in Prey, State of Fear, and Next. It seems he master of the techno-thriller had lost his edge.<br /><br />Not sure how much of this book was written by Crichton and how much Preston contributed, but the formula works.Be patient. This book starts off slow with a premise that sounds like something out of a science fiction comic book. The antagonist is a large corporation with deep pockets more concerned with profits than employee safety. (Sound familiar?) Then just when you think the book is going to be a predictable dud, it starts getting interesting and the plot takes a few unexpected twists and turns. Soon the reader is hooked into a page turning thriller like some of Crichton's earlier works. The ending is very satisfying and well worth the wait.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Like many, I struggled to 'click' with the story, the narrator, and characters in the first few chapters.  Stick with it...I was glued eventually, pausing only to wipe the tears from my eyes!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row is full of twists and turns, and keeps you reading non-stop.  It is great legal drama and historically interesting.  You can imagine the times and will find the characters totally believable.  Loved it, just sorry it ended.
1400095204|5.0|Half of a Yellow Sun is a novel I had to read and discuss in my Occupation of Africa class taught at The University of Texas at San Antonio. taken place during the Nigeria/Biafra or the Biafran war in the 1960’s. There are 3 main characters in the book which are Ugwu, a village boy who has been taken in by some well off people in which he becomes a house boy; Olanna, which is Ugwu’s mistress, and Richard, a British outcast who wants to be taken in by the Biafra. All three of these characters have a story which consists of racial discrimination, the struggle to survive, and ofcourse the war. Reading this book along with many others throughout this semester has opened my eyes to the true struggle Africa has overcame. I felt the author made the characters so understanding to the readers that we could put ourselves in their shoes. All the events that happened where described perfectly by the author because she was around it all. It took somebody who was actually around all of the events that were happening to truly write a book like this. I felt like this book took a lot of planning before she wrote it but it really was one of the better novels I have read as a student. This story is one that can truly relate to everybody. The main characters dreams and goals were clearly present in this book and it made everybody want to try and relate to them.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|Ultraviolet is the worst piece of junk.  I've never had it work seamlessly, ever!  Tying UV with Flixster is a big mess.  FYI, love the movie and highly recommend it.
B0063GORYU|2.0|every time you go to play an ad pops up I paid for no ads on my Kindle HDX BUT i suppose because it was a free app they put junk with the app. I will delete this app and find one that you pay for.
0316247545|5.0|It is AWESOME for my little pony fans!It has a detailed description of almost evey episode and interviews with the creators.if you LOVE my little pony you should buy this book.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Our three oldest ages 7,5, and 3  love this game, once they learned how to play it and that there were different levels and players and gear and all.  not to mention that Dad likes to play it too.  my only con is that you have to put playing limits on the game our the boys would play it all day.  This is also a pro because the boys will do any chore we ask so that they can play ninja turtles on the kindle.  :)
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|not the best written show, but very funny. this show is all about characterization and mixing them up in crazy elements. i find myself loling all the time. jess is crazy, a little bit annoying but you can't help but love her. schmidt and nick are very crazy and do some ridiculous things, but it makes it worthwhile. and centrally it's all about family. i love watching the show.
B00338QENI|4.0|This was enjoyable to read, not just to get to the end. I hate science, but loved learning about HeLa in the way information was presented in this book because it combined a personal story with history. The author has a talent for reporting on people's lives and developing their characters without imparting her own opinion.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|i love ginnifer goodwin. she's very cute. she represents a character that i can always empathize with. that is someone who wants to find love, have a connection with that person, and have it really mean something for it. she never settles for less. this movie hyperbolizes her character and how far she is really capable of going. i am not a fan of weird circumstances, but this movie does a job on showing those weird relationships people have.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Enjoy often, only...but I can't get into the tough..and heavy thinking...constraint of the rough and tough...complicated...games..who cares...rather play poker...simple..as that
B009GX69RK|5.0|this is the same rating for season 1. but the difference is that this season goes more in depth with the characters and their relationship with each other.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Very motivated to commence this eating plan. The only diet that has ever worked for me was one that had you skip lunch every day. So, this is also similar in reducing the calories. But I know this will work as you can keep the restriction to 2 days out of 7 which should make it easier to stick to. All the testimonials were inspiring.  Read this book everyone!
B0055D3EFU|5.0|i was really hesitant about this movie because i dont like creepy kid movies, but its not about that at all.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A lot like 100 Floors, but with a little more &#34;searching&#34; to get to the floor solutions.  I've only gone about ten levels so far, but it's a good challenge and fun for me and my grandson to figure out the solutions.
B00GHJ6BJW|2.0|Nothing really new or good here.  Seems to me that there's just too much of the overly explicit lyrics.<br />A couple of songs are just OK.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|one of the best christmas movies, also one of Chevy Chases best movies as well. very funny a must have chevy chase classic
B000NVIXFK|5.0|This is incredible. I am a long time Rush fan who loves the early stuff and the 80's synth period as well. I like alot of the newer Rush material from the 90's on but alot of it for me is either hit or miss with quite a few filler songs on Counterparts and Roll The Bones. Starting with Test For Echo (their strongest effort of the 90's) things picked up a bit and let me say Snakes and Arrows delivers in a huge way. The sound of this album is amazing, all instruments very clearly defined (not the muddled sound of Clockwork). The first 6 tracks are simply amazing. Far Cry is one of the greatest Rush songs ever written. The instrumentals are insanely bad-ass. I highly suggest picking this up if you are a Rush fan. This is the real deal!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game but getting very upset when I lose my lives and extra turns when I play on my iPhone
1608871827|5.0|I was expecting a good book, but it surprised very favorably, showing great content in an unusual format (with post its on some pages, annotations, like the subject was really real - wonderful!
0783114222|5.0|An incredible series created by Tom Hanks.  It is a part of American history of how the space program was started - from the Mercury program to the Gemini program and the Apollo program; and the men who stepped up to answer the nations call in becoming the first in taking a man to the moon.  It also shows the other side - the side of the astronauts family members, and the sacrifices they made.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love it!  Like most games, waiting to achieve the next level is aggravating due to tome constraints but that is part of the challenge!
B009CG0102|5.0|A great movie!  Excellent cast!  An incredible story of how the crew of Apollo 13 and the people in Mission Control overcame adversity to get back home on earth.  It is well worth watching again and again.
B0006B2A42|5.0|One of the best action films Pre -70's ever. Great ensemble of stars, fun special effects (hey...pre-70's) and great story. Shipping was quick, disc and case were perfect. Every movie buff must have this EPIC GEM in their library! Now if only it came in Blu-Ray!!!! ;) Eager to see the remake that is to come out in 2015!
0670033375|5.0|Everybody should read it. A gripping examination of self-destroying communities, and quite possibly a projection of what lies ahead for our own.
B00881VLCE|3.0|If the app would stop crashing I would love it. It seems to not work more often then it does. Please fix this.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|But not quite as exciting as his previous book about this Missisipi lawyer, the plot is to a certain extend, predictable.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|This is a fun show. Truly creative and, in Cher's own words, &#34;fabulous.&#34; Cher shows off her talents well, and has a great deal of fun with herself and the audience.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|It love all of the songs from her new album and i think it was well done. Her songs really talk to me on this album.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Pretty good :) and Best up to date Superman movie.  Vocals drop low some parts of movie but only on the smusshi stuff :P
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|OMG!!!  I picked it for the price and FELL HEAD OVER HEALS IN LOVE with the story!!!!!  I am so glad there is a follow up book because I was MOURNING the fact that this book had ended.  I'm not normally a fan of these types of books but HOOVER has turned me into a true blue fan!  I had a hard time getting past the first half of the book and probably would not have picked it if I knew about the dark subject matter but in the end, I am so glad I didn't read the spoiler alerts and had no idea what I was getting myself into because although the story contained uncomfortable subject matter the characters overpowered the pain and made you want to BE THEM JUST TO BE IN LOVE LIKE THAT .<br />I didn't want it to end and am so elated that I get to take another wild, romantic, heartbreaking, surprising, amazing, ride with these two!!!  Words really can't describe and do this book justice - you just have to take a chance and read it.<br /><br />PS:  Get the whispersyce with it - the performer who reads the story does a HELL of a job on all of the voices- especially HOLDER'S!!!! &lt;3
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app comes in real handy. There are times when I am traveling and forgot my kindle. I can just pull up this app and have it look up the last page I read on my current book, and it updates the tablet so that I can continue reading. Then when I get home I can use the kindle to update to where I left off again.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is fun. The quests are pretty easy and you don't have to buy items with real money if you are patient! The graphics are cool as well. Enjoy!
B000UDMULE|5.0|Legendary, necessary for any bluegrass fan's collection.  It has won multiple awards for a reason, it's a regular on the rotation
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Good time waster. You have a few minutes and don't want to get involved in a book so this is a great fill in.
B00BATG18K|3.0|more details about sex in a whore  house than I care to know  confusing jump between the tales of the generations  a long story  sad  did not really like this book
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This has to be the most addicting game I have come across. I play it on my PC and now I can frustrate myself on my tablet. Thank goodness they give you only a few lives and you have to wait to recharge or I would never get anything done. It is a combination of luck(what bunch of candies you get) and skill in how you use what you are &#34;dealt&#34;
0812982622|3.0|While well constructed, I felt that the author's point of view as expressed in the character of the interrogator was unnecessary and cumbersome. This is a cruel piece of fiction, but many readers will take it as truth.<br />miggi w.
B00632HWOG|4.0|You are away from your regular PC and want to check your email This is for you as long as you h ave a WIFI signal. The only draw back is the read emails are still on your page and you have to delete then from a &#34;real&#34; computer when you can as it can't be done from a kindle. Still it helps you keep in touch.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Th only issue I have is that it will not update to the newest version on Kindle. I have this on my Android phone and have several more levels and vehicles.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|James Bond never fails to amaze.  The action has only gotten better over the years.  Can't wait for the next movie!
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is my son's and he likes it. Being that he's not much of a video game guy, he tends to play this one alot.<br />If you have a child that not into much older games than you might want to try him on this. I approve!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One of the best book i read so far! 5 star well deserved. I think this is a must read for those who liked Game of Thrones or Name of the Wind. Can't wait for the Tower lord.
B00EKHE1JA|4.0|Overall it's a great collectible figure. It's attention to detail is pretty spot on for any one whose wondering if the paint is just splashed on there. I for one loved the movie and this figure is a great way to show your liking of the movie. The only reason I give it a 4 is because the figure could be more articulate. It has multiple points that's should have been able to be moved but sadly weren't, such as the fingers and added movement of the torso. But if you just want to pose it in one position and keep it there forever then this is the figure for you. Striker Eureka all the way!!!!!!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The best season ever! Great episodes: the one when Sheldon, Amy, Penny and Leonard play pictionary, The one when they play D&D. What a great moments!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The book was well written. The ending made me really mad though. That's why is four stars. But it was still good.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This is a wonderful history of MGM musicals containing familiar and rare clips from many movies and hosted by great stars.
B003VXMMTK|2.0|Horrible defeatism,fatalistic ending! Tess is victimized again and again,until she creates victims. Slow moving, to a sorry, oh no finish!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This has to be one of the best musicals ever made. The turn of the century period costumes are beautiful and the dancing is incredible.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I love this Cd. 2 songs you'd swear he copped from Al Green. When I read the liner notes he gave credit to Willie Mitchell, Green's producer.
0783229364|5.0|This is a more modern version of the 60's movie &#34;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&#34; although Michael J. Fox does have to try and does succeed in this movie.
140006922X|3.0|By the title, Zealot, the Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, and based on the radio interview I heard (only part of, because I was driving) I was led to believe this was a historical treatment of Jesus.  Naturally, this is intriguing because who has ever done a historical treatment? Has new material been discovered?<br /><br />No, it has not. The information we have is still the Gospels--not a one of which was written either in his lifetime or by an eyewitness, and even our pal Josephus was much later.  So we are left with the options of write a history of the times, in general, and speculating on the average life of a peasant, and/or using the Gospels to tell about how Jesus was viewed and what that says about the people who were spreading the word.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Aslan goes further than he should. After being quite clear that no gospel had anything to do with historical Jesus, and after making clear that the Resurrection was not to be looked at historically but only as an event of faith, and after explaining that \\"history\\" as we understood it would be meaningless to peoples who spoke so much in parables, he still attempts to make the gospels historically relevant. First he says that most of what the faithful believe (and that he doesn't want to) can't be true because of the problematic history of the writing, and then he says that the uncomfortable stuff (in which he wishes to believe) MUST be true, based on the same writing. In this way he is no better or more credible than the most annoying TV evangelist or the equally annoying vocal atheist in taking a sentence here and there out of context and blowing it out of proportion.  As another reviewer said, \\"The historical context and insights carried the book for the first 2/3 or so and then it spun out of control, with unsubstantiated claims or conclusions colored by the convictions of the author.\\"<br /><br />So he vacillates with no clear message between history and faith.  It is possible to write a good book just on the faith experience, but when your title is The Life and Times of . . . it needs to be History (even if popular history).<br /><br />He's also sloppy in his understanding of his audience. Like many people educated in a specialty, he can't comprehend how much his audience knows. He introduces the Q sources without enough information, just calling them Q sources as if everyone knows what they are.  (If you are the type of person who already knows that Q means Quelle, which simply means \\"source\\"  and that no one knows for sure whether it existed but that similarities and differences in the writing styles of the gospels indicate they shared source material, I can guarantee you that you don't need this book.)<br /><br />If Aslan had kept his \\"history\\" away from treating the gospels as history it would have been a better work. His case that Jesus was illiterate, and his explanation of what happened with James and the movement in general, were well-written. It's as if he were all done with his writing and said to himself, \\"Dang! I was contracted to write a whole book about Jesus but I only have 100 pages. Better work in some gospel.\\"<br /><br />Frankly the fact that all these years later the faithful insist their Lord could not have been illiterate seems to me like snobbery on the part of the devout, and Aslan drops the ball when he doesn't point out how different the modern faithful are from their predecessors on this key point. (Why would you care, two thousand years later, whether your savior could write, anyway?)<br /><br />Aslan clearly admires Jesus greatly and feels there is a great deal to be learned from his teachings. This is neither the anti-Christian polemic the faithful fear nor good history.  It's a good introduction for those who want to learn more about Christian origins.  It is popular history on a subject it is impossible to research historically, so it is a nice try, but not a sucess.
B00003XAVA|5.0|Crosby and Nash were surprisingly successful without Stills in this production. Wind on the Water is one of my most favorite songs.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The quality seems to be good and it does what I need it to do so I am pleased with it.
B000002ITW|5.0|60's music at it's best! Contains both acoustic and electric numbers. It also showcases each performer and their most popular songs.
B005QMOZOO|3.0|I am a fan of writings of both PD James and of Jane Austin. However this book fell between the two stools, is not really in the style of Austin nor of James. The novels of the former are very strong in the delineation of personalities, society, and intrigues of that time, those of the latter have an excellent storyline, plot, characterisation, in a dramatic style. This novel was somewhat insipid and banal. It lacked the strength and force that is found in the true writings of both authors.
B008J8KBKY|1.0|This game crashed every time and was never playable. If the developers fix the game, I'd be willing to try it again.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|Awesome movie. This movie brought back the superman franchise and I cannot wait to see what future movies have in store
B001BANK32|5.0|Never read this a kid. I have always read Stephen King. I was reading Carrie in 7 th grade. Love that it reminded me that places have an evil feel and we can over come them.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Traditional Christmas songs with an Italian twist. The boys do their best considering English is not their native language. Their beautiful voices and harmonies more than make up for this, however. Highlights include, \\"Ave Maria\\", Christmas medley, and \\"Silent Night\\". Also \\"The Christmas Song\\" featuring Pia Toscano stands out. (She's got a really good voice and I don't understand why she didn't go farther on American Idol.)  Anyway, I digress. If you like Il Volo and are looking for some fresh holiday music, put this album on your Christmas list.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Generally speaking I really liked this book. I personally am not an atheist(I'm an agnostic), but since I have studied the bible during my lifetime, I am also open to studying the opposite end of the spectrum. I really liked Mr. Dawkin's idea of an infinite regress, I think he called it. He said that if there is a God then someone had to have designed that God, and likewise someone would have had to design that God's designer, and so on to infinity. I believe he called that an infinite regress. I basically agree with that, and further I don't think there is any way the Big Bang could have, all by itself, created a consciousness in the Universe. I do vehemently disagree with Darwinism, and Mr. Dawkins discusses that theory in this book. I also disagree with Mr. Dawkin's views on abortion. It is always healthy and good to get different views on the big issues and questions of life, and for that reason alone I would definitely recommend reading this book. Also, the world very much needs a counterpoint to the relentless and ubiquitous force of organized religion.
B00000IB4D|5.0|it's part of a trilogy of outstanding Santana work from that era, including Caravanserai and Borboletta that integrates diverse instrumentalization with a story line of music
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is really fun. I like it how they added a lot of robots and decals on the game it's a really good by game and you should try it

B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The great graphics are just the beginning. Easy to upgrade things and several ways to make money ...not aggravating like other games that make you purchase items to keep playing!
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Not the greatest writing in the world, but readable.  The author's stories, however?  Inspiring.  Expect to add a few miles to your long runs while you're reading this.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great season 1 if you like Walking dead you'll love the show! It's aliens instead of zombies. Goods story line.

B005D6O0LQ|5.0|My foot tends to be between sizes, so I wasn't surprised that these shoes were a touch small, but I'm sure the next size would have been way too big.  These are the perfect shoes to slip on when going out to get the mail or take the garbage cans in.  They look good enough to wear grocery shopping or on picnics.  I'm glad I got them.

B0040I09RM|5.0|I love love love Sons of Anarchy. It is the best show EVER. I watch it all the time. Have seen every episode multiple times. It never gets old.
B005LQ6UE8|4.0|The book is well written and entertaining.  The author gives very detailed account of prison life in a gulag.  Once they escape the camp however, it seems the story takes a turn for the unbelievable.  While most of the story has the feel that this could be possible, the long periods without food, and more importantly water are a hard sell.  I would recommend reading this, but dont attempt to recreate it.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|This was too long and the fight scenes were like a video game that never ended.  On top of this there is a black Perry White.  Why change the character?  I like following the original comic book.  There was also no mention of Jimmy Olsen.  I guess his character comes after the movie.  The Lois Lane angle was a joke as she knows who Superman is right from the start.  The first wave of Superman movies with Christopher Reeve were far superior to this.  This was like Star Wars came to Krypton.
B003PIUC02|4.0|Blood, sex, nudity, extreme violence, and I loved every minute of it! The plot in this season is a little thin but its still highly enjoyable. If you enjoyed 300 you will love this show.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the action on the book but Rue I liked then she died was the saddest part in the hunger games
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This film has a special meaning to me and I so enjoyed seeing it again.  Film was great.<br />Thank you
B008Y78GYI|4.0|I loved it even though I have seen it before,  I liked listening to the music and I liked looking at Omar Sharif.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Great movie! ...especially loved the &#34;outcome&#34; which is treadstone without the inconsistency; larx with a soul (larx3 was a single-minded terminator but NOT indestructable :-). Faithful to the storyline of the series; you'll only be disappointed if you're hung up on Matt Damon. Jeremy Renner is not Matt Damon and Aaron Cross is not Jason Bourne, but this latest installation is an upgrade that retains all the original features while providing fresh enhancements (including Rachel Weisz)... go with the flow, its Bourne 2.0! Very well thought out and scripted; no mindless action here, its edge-of-the-seat all the way through. Final scene is exhilarating as Mobi's tune kicks in.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is real good. It runs smoothly so far. My son loves it too. I would recommend it to all ages.
B00G32PQNA|4.0|I saw all three of the movies.  Good story and an interesting trilogy.  Did not know about the previous 2 movies which were equally as good.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|If Galaga had had grandchildren this game would be it. This game has frequent updates, no ads, no in-app purchases. The many levels keep the challenging, the superior graphics and accelerometer play keep it fun. The sensitivity controls are adjustable which is a benefit you don't often see in these little Android shooter games. The developer is quick to respond to any concerns or emails. It's as if they really care whether or not we enjoy their games. both my son, &amp; I myself, have enjoyed many hours over some. Of time playing this game. I highly recommend it from the perspective of both a parent and a gamer.this game has 5 stars over at Google Play, and deserves 5 stars here as well
B001H4R4LQ|3.0|it was a long and  confuse in some points story, so if  you got so far , finish it . And answer all your questions.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another John Grisham book you just can not put down!  Love the connection to the A TIME TO KILL.  Easy reading with new twist & turns everywhere.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I am delighted with the set. Peter Falk, the guest stars, the lack of grisly gore spattered throughout the episodes, and the era of the show are a pleasure.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This is a very unique story of a woman who is in search of the truth about the murder of her sister, who has been living in France. she finds out that her sister has a little girl. Without giving away any more of the plot, I will say that htis is one of my favorite kids of books. It has so many twists and turns and surprises that it kept me turning pages.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I was skeptical about playing games on my fire,and its more addictive than I thought it would be. I love it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am an admitted Google addict, and I bought this in large part because it's a Google product.  But it is actually pretty cool.  Set-up took about five mins., including plugging in the unit (Be aware, it does have a power cable that is not typically shown in the promo shots - it can be powered from a USB outlet on your TV if you have one; and it comes with a power plug adapter if you don't).  The integration with the Android Netflix app is pretty good - I have some quibbles with the structure of the app, but the quality of the streamed picture is quite good.  I was a little less pleased with the quality of the streaming from a Chrome web page - the device worked, but the picture was a bit grainy and choppy.  I'm willing to be that will be fixed in future software updates.  For the moment, I'm primarily using this device to stream Netflix from my Nexus 7 to a TV that doesn't have any other boxes hooked up that provide Netflix. For $35, it was worth it to me to have a super-portable TV dongle I can use with pretty much any flat screen.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I didn't watch this movie, but I did pay for it so my wife had something to watch while flying to NY. So in my opinion I get to write the review cause it was my credit card that got charged!! So here is my review....WIFE SAID IT WAS A AWSOME, EPIC GREAT MOVIE.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I will probably be drawn and quartered by a hoard of angry-looking, red-wearing casual gamers, but this game doesn't do much for me.  It's not bad; but it's not great, either.  You fling birds to knock stuff down.  It becomes increasingly difficult.  It's cute, but it's not for me.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Great Movie
B00F35BV64|5.0|I wish they would put out one a year forever with this cast! Great scenes- witty and fun great for family
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|I'm the grandma that takes the kids to the movies - I love going to the movies!  Although the boys, 7 and 9 are looking for more action and excitement and like &#34;real movies&#34; instead of animated ones, we thoroughly enjoyed Turbo.  I get a kick out of trying to figure out who the stars are doing the voices.  We saw this in the theater and have watched it at least three times since then.  Even the grownups will get a kick out of this one.
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|so stupid I only got through 15 mins- ugh don't bother- really not worth your time- lame lame lame!! yuck
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Very exciting, lots of action and I'm a big fan of the Bond movies.  Daniel Craig is the typical stoic Bond, handsome and indestructable.  Add a little 007 music and you've got a great evening!  Thoroughly enjoyed!
B0084TWN9K|3.0|This was very hard to read- After I finished a story, I felt let down, like I wanted to know more.
B004ADB17Y|5.0|One of my families favorite movies, ever! We watch it at least once a year. We love the adventure of One Eyed Willie.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was very good - It had some interesting twists to it that I did not predict.  It reads very well.
0312330529|1.0|If you just love, love, love Danielle Steel, boy are you in for a long, long, long treat.  This author, whose unabashed  high opinion of himself is beyond overrated, is now a &#34;best-selling author&#34;.  Tells you what the average reader wants in a book and confirms that what constitutes &#34;average&#34; is a 7th grade mentality.  Suppose they would love, love, love &#34;City of Thieves&#34; or Shadow of the Wind&#34;?
B00992CF6W|4.0|I just bought minecraft pe and I signed up for realms and then when I go to the title menu realms doesn't show up. Any solutions
B0092EE5HY|3.0|The story started out okay, but after a while it got repetitive and boring.  George RR Martin is a very good storyteller, but it seems like he didn't know where he was going with this one after it got started.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|Such a page turner - what relevations would each new day bring? Or what new terrors? I was willing her to remember!
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|I love pretty much everything about this game. The theme is fantastic, the graphics are beautiful, the storyline is believable(in a fantasy sense), and the characters are beautifully designed. This is the best and hands down the most creative hidden object game I've ever played and it's FREE! It's a great way to pass the time while being entertained. I recommend to all!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush it is the best game ever.but, I'm stuck on  level 27 $o I'm mad but this is a five star game that everybody probably agrees with.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I will only play till I'm out of lives, I will not pay to play a game. It is fun.
B003WUYR6I|2.0|This is one of those books that I keep waiting for it to be more than a fulfillment of an author's contract.  It didn't ever happen.  Even the ending was completely strange.  His worst yet.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|this is a fun little game, but only play till I'm out of lives, i will not pay to play,
B00CX7TOTQ|5.0|Saw this film last night and could not believe how good it was.  Exciting as hell (top 30 action movie all time), and the story is excellent.  Cinematography is excellent.  Travolta (always good), and Deniro (best role for him in a long while) make Killing Season a must watch.  Way above the cut movie about cat and mouse battle between two former soldiers (with each switching who is the cat, and who is the mouse throughout), but more importantly, about the devastating effects of war on a man's soul and psyche.  This one will stay with you for awhile.  Real emotional impact.  I only regret not having seen this on the big screen.<br /><br />Absolute must see in my opinion.  Thanks for reading.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|works great for me,  I like that i can mix my own sounds, to help mask my husbands snorering,,  thank you
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Sorry just didn't do it for me. It was like hearing Liza Minnelli singing to me. Maybe the next album will be better.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Easy to see why this show won awards.  Nice to be able to see it at my own leisure now.
B00ERIUO02|1.0|Very commercially made for the general populace. I kissed a girl is the only real stand out song from Katy Perry in her career . Nothing really stands out on this album. Eye of the tiger is getting old to me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book! Leaves u on the edge of your seat, never wanting to put it down! I absolutely Loved it!
B00F8KIJ2I|2.0|The only song that I liked on this album was the one that she wrote with her husband. Maybe its time for her to re-invent herself and take her music another direction.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|This is an adult fairy tale.  I had never even heard of this movie before, I picked it because Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were in it.  MF is great as the eveil witch and RD is surprisingly funny.  Predictable, but like I said it is a fairy tale.  I enjoyed watching it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Honest and compelling, The Husband's Secret explores the consequences of the secrets we keep and the power they hold over us.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Great calendar, keeps our whole family updated and in sync. But the widget is not  Kit Kat compatible on my Nexus 4.
1400067820|3.0|Taleb's assertions are poorly supported outside statistics and finance, and you worry the he himself is an ideologue without 'skin in the game' once he leaves his domain. This is evident when he broadly dismisses business inventory practices such as just-in-time delivery, by citing the need to keep wasteful reserve inventory, or in his insistence that technological innovation is driven by self-taught hobbyists. While agile development is broadly practiced in the tech industry for incremental change, Black Swan breakthroughs are heavily dependent on collective capital expenditure and 'sissy fragilitas' (e.g., moon landings (NASA), PageRank (NSF/Stanford), Semiconductor (Fairchild/NASA), ... the discovery of the Americas, and on).<br /><br />It's harmful to make such claims when Taleb has little accountability for their failure.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I already own the SB-600. I got this as my new main flash, so that my 600 can be the backup. It's a little larger than the 600 and comes with a few more accessories (green and orange gel). Wish it came with a diffuser dome! I often use this for off camera flash photography and have it triggered.<br /><br />The controls are a big improvement from the 600. The 700 has an LCD screen, a dial vs buttons to lower or increase flash power which all makes adjusting faster. They also improved the battery door. With the 600 the battery door often wouldn't close tightly enough and the flash wouldn't turn on. The door on the 700 has been reliable so far.<br /><br />I considered several other cheaper flashes, but being a wedding photographer and Nikon shooter I kept coming back to Nikon. Resale holds it's value and I needed a reliable second flash.
0452289963|5.0|This book has no less importance than it truly saved my life.  I came upon it about 6 months ago and am now reading it again for the 3rd time. After years of reading various Buddhist and spiritual books and struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts I've finally come upon a clear explanation of the Ego and how to transcend it.  Knowing that the &#34;voice in the head&#34; the Ego keeps trilling out is not our true nature is a tremendous relief.  Being given permission to ignore, question, or push aside that self-serving voice is a liberation beyond compare.  This book came at exactly the moment I needed it in my life!  Thank you, Eckhart!  I now feel I'm on the True path.  It's a shame so many still live with such a strong identification with form.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really liked this game until I hit level 70!  There is no explanation on some levels of what is required to &#34;crush all the jellies&#34;, which would certainly be helpful.  Some levels seem to be geared toward making the frustration level so high that the player will give in and purchase the helping bonus.  I did find some hints by using Google to get instructions for different levels - but this should not be necessary.  I know it's possible to get past every level, but some of the fun goes out of the game when you have to wait days to move on.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|It is based on a true story and has fantastic commentary.  I have ADD with movies, and this one kept me focused on it and loving it the whole time.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie is long but action packed and fun to watch even if youre not a big fan of marvel or action heroes, you still will enjoy this movie- team work, laughs, and humanity. Good beats evil and the rest is history.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|The review title says it all. It is one of the best FREE white noise applications out there. I think I have downloaded most of the free white noise apps, but the ease of use and the sound options on this app seem to be the best. Until a better one comes along, I will stick with this one night after night.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|Did not know there were so many Nightmare on elm street movies!  Now we can have a real binge watching session.  Perfect price too.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great to have some fun time without getting frustrated by impossible tasks or unattainable goals. I will get the second part for sure.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great book for bookclub!  Our club will be going to see the moving as soon as it is out in December.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I actually could not get past the second chapter.  As soon I Tobias sounded exactly like a women I completely lost interest and did not read anymore.  Very disheartened to all of a sudden have his point of view.  I was so excited to see what the final installment had in store for it's readers.  I was also telling everyone how they needed to read the series.  I stopped talking about it.....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Super easy to install. Great product for the price. Hoping that Google adds more content besides Youtube, netflix, and hulu.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Heroes of Order and Chaos is by far the best game made for any touch screen platform. w.o.w. has become boring compared to HOC so addicting it's hard to do anything else or play any other game.
B009LQKHIO|1.0|I don't care for this author.  Too many typos in the book.  Some of it didn't even make sense.  Nothing grabbed me in the story line.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|i wish there were more interactive actions to do. but it's a good app for free. horse is pretty realistic
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|have to rely on neighbors and not popular with any of my friends.deleted this app.waste of timeafter they get you started.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|A very engaging book. An excellent holiday read for the holidays. Give yourself enough time to sit back, relax and enjoy it.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|Has too many requests to spend real money for my liking. BUT kind of fun to repeatedly blow up this playboy....giggle!
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for music, as it is so subjective, but this is unequivocally awesome!  Sounds like a fusion of Coldplay, Eminem, My Chemical Romance, and One Republic, but with originality throughout.  There is not a bad song on the album.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game it is has various difficulties and can save where you are on more than one puzzle. You can also reset the puzzle if u mess up too much.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|Just started.  So far so good, once I get the hang of it it should prove more of a challenge.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|This is a great little container of lego blocks...my daughter loves it. It comes with several pieces and a little booklet with ideas of what to make with them. She has played much with it, and we will likely be looking for the boys version of this for Christmas...container is VERY big, though, for the number of pieces in it, so unless you plan to add more pieces in future, just be aware that the container is way too big for what comes in it...
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Wow what a year!  Bryson does a masterful job of relating all that went on in a year chock full of exciting events -- Lindbergh, Ruth, Ford, Dempsy, Gehrig, Sacco & Vincetti, talkies, television, etc.  It is hard to put this one down.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game how do you get power ups without purchasing them? Also leaves you stick on certain levels for a long time.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|A Time to Kill is a masterful book.  It takes you back to a time and makes you relive it, with all its undertones.  This book takes off where that one ends, and deals with many of the same characters, but doesn't hit the mark as well.  Maybe having loved A Time to Kill, I expected too much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it. It. Is so fun to play¡!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is also addicting,I play it almost every day! amazing one of the best games ever
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is the second book by Gillian Flynn I have read. Like Gone Girl her characters are not always likable people. Somehow though I find myself wrapped up in their stories, wanting to know more, rooting for them in the end. I am an avid reader. This means that I am rarely surprised by a story anymore. This book surprised me. I highly recommend it as a good mystery that unfolds between present day action and flashback stories of the past. Five stars. Keep it coming, Ms. Flynn.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This is a quick read and, at times, darkly funny. Unfortunately there are no characters to root for. Mae, the protagonist, starts off as a standard heroine. But she never rebels against the evil Circle. Her ex-boyfriend, the one we would typically support, never becomes the true hero. He does not revolt against The Circle; he just goes off grid and disappears. So, even though the parallels to Big Brother and 1984 seem obvious, there is no sympathetic Winston Smith.<br /><br />The book has an interesting premise. Social media so dominates the characters' lives that they spend all their time replying to zings, answering surveys, worrying about why others haven't responded to them, etc. It's a never-ending circle that leads to paranoia and despair. It gets to the ridiculous point where each time Mae returns to her desk there is another screen for her to monitor and interact with.<br /><br />The Circle's goal of total transparency seems to be symbolized by the rare shark they acquire which can consume anything it encounters. The shark's translucent body allows the digestive process to be viewed (talk about transparency) and the result is that everything is homogenized into a gray powder.<br /><br />It's the ultimate form of entropy and it seems to be the fate of the characters in this novel.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Downloaded this to see how it would do on the kindle.  So far it's been great. The graphics are superb for both surroundings and the hunt.
B008602KQI|3.0|it is just a regular action movie with a slow build-up. the hunger games itself did not really get me excited.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Great tune to hear over and over. I appreciate the theme and the great harmony of the group. I play it often.
B001992NUQ|4.0|I almost returned this Blu-ray, when I popped it in and up came the opening of &#34;Never Been Kissed&#34;<br />It's not defective.  Turns out it's just a gag, and the screen quickly changes to the menu screen for Fight Club.<br />Nothing agains the movie &#34;Never Been Kissed&#34; with Drew Barryimore, but I had payed for and wanted to watch Fight Club. Thankfully following that short gag, the real movie began and I was not disappointed.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|This movie was less than previous movies we viewed with Denzel Washington. It pace was much slower than we had expected.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I watched the show on TV, I read the book. I bought it because I thought it a great visilustion of the time and events.
0152465073|5.0|This is  a beautiful old French writing with many philosophies true today about &#34;what is real&#34; and the truth about loneliness
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|Predictable.  John Goodman carried this, even though his character did not appear often, he held it together.  The last few minutes of the story just left you hanging...almost as though the writer's couldn't have been bothered to finished the story with a decent ending...lame!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|McKenna tells another story about life in rural Ireland.  Her ability to make me feel what the characters are going through is amazing.  I felt as though this man could have been my family years ago.  Great story, beautiful writing that pulls you in from the beginning.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Just got into the show during season 3 and decided to go back and watch the rest...Two shows into this one and my mind was blown! Who doesn't love a good ghost story
B00ADQPB50|5.0|did not like at first but loved the first and third, so purchased this to support the series. but I have to say I love this season to once you get passed the first 2 episodes of it being weird it is a great show. and done well it is an asylum so you are weant to wonder who is crazy who is not whats real whats not. another great season I watch one every night
B003JTHXOK|2.0|A typical Nicolas Sparks tale. Reminiscent of older familiar stories told. Perfect for a quick read on a long trip or vacation..
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|fantastic season. season 2 took a bit to get used to but really worth it if you can get passed the first even the second episode. season 3 fantastic al so
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I really enjoyed this return to Ford County. The characters were well-drawn, and the story line kept the reader interested in seeing where Grisham was going.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|because it was an interesting book that explained the words and the story developed quickly, so it was very engaging.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|A good read, but, not as intense as the other Agent Pendergast books. Corrie is developing but she has a ways to go.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I was looking for Bubbles Plus but not available for android nockoff, but I give it a 4 out of 5.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|For Dave Eggars, a pretty fluffy book. But a good look at how we readily give up our privacy, and much relevance to how Google and the NSA are all over our lives
B00BW6SOIQ|4.0|An interesting portrayal of dominant/submissive relationship that was eye opening.  Both actors were great,  Hopefully, we can learn from these roles about unique attraction principles.
B00GIZO674|5.0|If you liked the sponge Bob dinner dash, you'll like this game too. Very addicting! :)<br />I like that this game has challenges you can change, and start over with different food or beverage options.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Ok, let's be honest. This movie had no business being any good. But holy cow it's amazing! Grounded by the Oscar worthy performance of Andy Serkis as the chimp Caesar this is perfectly paced, a fantastic build up to a rousing conclusion. The extras on this set are also top notch, this is the version to get.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love this game,gets harder as you go along,I try to do all the boards with a perfect score,not so easy.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Kubrick had a wicked sense of humor, who knew? To call this black humor would be a supreme understatement, but this is fall down hilarious and yet frighteningly plausible (at least at the time.) Peter Sellers gets well deserved credit but for me it's George C. Scott who steals the show. Everybody is great though and the jokes are funny even in a post cold war world.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The kids love it!  Mixing the tiles makes every game different.  Pay attention to the hints in the rules.  Get wood and brick at the beginning!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I won't give any spoilers, but man, was this terribly disappointing. The premise and the context from the first two books was smart and had such promise, but the author dismantles everything good she built up in the previous books with this lackluster conclusion.<br /><br />This doesn't give anything away that you don't learn on the first page of Chapter 2, but she alternates writing from Tris's perspective and Four's.  That kind of storytelling technique can be very effective and offer valuable extra insight when done properly, but unfortunately, Veronica Roth apparently lacks the skills necessary to accomplish that.  The voices were so indistinguishable that if I didn't carefully notice and remember at the start of a chapter who was the character narrating, I would be unable to tell sometimes and have to go back to check.<br /><br />Not to mention the depressing ending left me hopeless and wondering what I gained from spending so much time with this series over the past few years.  Needless to say, I've lost so much interest and the story and characters have been so ruined for me, I'm no longer planning on seeing the movie I was so excited about. Read this if you want to know how she wraps things up, but expect to be frustrated and dissatisfied. Ugh.
B008JFUPFI|3.0|Just so-so. Very violent. This movie barely covers the beginning of the  Superman saga. They must have a whole lot of future movies on line.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such an additive game. It's maddening at times trying to complete levels and yes, might get stuck on a level for months, but persistence pays off. There are in-app purchases available for extra boosts & moves so if you are putting this on a device for child, beware.
B000P0J09W|5.0|great birthday gift. we enjoy this movie and it is for all ages. i suggest to everyone to purchase this!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|great cd - there is a really great vibe from this recording., I recommend it for anyone who likes any of the artists featured
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Never thought there could be a sequel to The Shining that would be so riveting! It was hard to put the book down.<br /><br />Great job Mr. King! You never disappoint.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This novel is of John Grisham's best! I am a fan, but some of his recent books do not live up to his original writings. This story stands on its own and keeps you guessing from page 1 to the end. Well done.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Greta movie, great special effetcs, and great bonus features! If you love Superman, this is a must buy item for your collection!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|A well laid out and presented book, which provides you with all the information necessary to undertake the 5:2 fast. Michael Mosley made an excellent documentary on the same subject.
B004LROUNG|4.0|fast moving typical Grisham pace - highly enjoyable and realistic characters. Great ending but a little predictable - however did not spoil the book
B00CGYK9O0|3.0|Used it to label candy jars at a wedding and it took way to long to write on them .The chalk didn't work well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addicting. I think. I play this before bed and it is so much fun! if you don't. have this game get it NOWWW
006202406X|3.0|I was a big fan of the other 2 books in the trilogy, but I feel like this book fell short of the mark.
B001MTENOC|5.0|It took me only 2 days to read this book because I simply could not put it down. There was a profound effect on who I am after bathing in this material for 2 days straight. I came away with an epic sense of comfort in the knowledge gained by this material. I will be going to get a Life Between Life reading ASAP.<br />Dr. Newton did a great job of walking through the many phases of Life Between Life events that &#34;could&#34; be experienced by individual souls. He starts with the first point of realizing death and goes on through possible transitions into the spirit world and then on into the many different experiences a soul may experience that depend on each level of evolution a soul.<br />I came away with a comforting sense from the knowing that so much energy went into being who I am and that I am soooo much more than this one life.<br />This is a MUST READ!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I have enjoyed the series and the beginning of this book.  However, the ending left me very upset, and wanting more.  Spoiler alert*** I am not a fan when the main character of the book is killed off!
B0095MVOMC|4.0|good definition of items, simple and clear format. A game that I can play over and over again, this is a good game.
B00DXPC1U6|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter as one of her Christmas presents and it arrived so fast and in great condition.  Here I was worried about the holiday rush for nothing.  Great customer service.
B005KB0SU6|5.0|Absolute mastery of the Spanish prose. Ruiz-Zafon in unmatched in his genre. Each and every sentence is absolutely delicious. It is difficult not to want to read every other paragraph out-loud. Perfectly put together!

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham delivers again - a great read.  Refers to last book, but is a stand alone read.  Unforgettable characters to enjoy.
B00FQMVCEA|4.0|love it its a very cute kids movie my son and I watched a few time he loved it to
B00BAXFECK|1.0|Know it is a best seller, but I didn't care for the book....too much repeating of info, etc.  I just found the downfall of a once nice kid depressing.
0060589469|5.0|you can see how the culture of Apple was born...the concepts in this book describe the reasoning behind Steve's Job's 'Events' where Quality meets subject.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|So disappointed in this album. NOT one song grabs me,. IN fact all it sounds like is she is making NOISE not music!!<br />Terrible and cannot believe she made this disaster after her first 2 good albums!
B006IDG2T6|3.0|I expected more of Sam Harris as it did not really challenge my understanding of &#34;Free Will&#34;. It was a superficial argument perhaps meant to entertain or challenge those whose thoughts had never analysed the concept at all. It was a bit heavy for those who had no idea or understanding of the philosophers terminolgy. This was not entertaining or instructive for most members of my book club
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I guess I was expecting the book to be an actual story like the movie.. bought it before the movie came out.. it's an interesting read, but it's like a list of people's short stories that happened leading up to where the movie occurs and possibly after. I just couldn't get into it as much.. read about half of it, had some other reading to do.
B004LROUNG|4.0|The litigators is an excellent book, with witty characters and a gripping story. Great for a school holiday quick read or a break from text books. Easy to pick up whenever you have spare time; hard to put down when that time ends.
B005DN5BE4|3.0|Did not watch all of it because we found it hard to follow with the first part mostly sub-titles.Not a very clear subject.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is a fun little app. I had fun using it. Kids and adults alike will enjoy this. Glad I downloaded it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent story! I guess most of us have figured out that the Earth is not in trouble but the human race is in deep trouble. So many possible scenarios of how our species will come to its end it's hard to keep up. What will the future bring??? The authors idea of a possible future for man kind is a viable possibility. A very entertaining read, well worth your time.
0765342294|4.0|A very interesting story and a quick read. I purchased this book after seeing advertisements for the movie. Books are always better than the movie so I bought it.
B0009KQOLU|5.0|Different type of movie but has a lot of action, is great to watch along with the volume 1 which goes well as a compliment

1616550414|5.0|Great book, with great pictures, great details, great passion from the creator for the fans, great game to play (no doubt), and one of the best franchises ever created for videogames! A must have for fans of the series !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0802473156|5.0|Very good book that really explains relationships and what we each need to feel satisfied.  I have passed this book onto 4 other people as well who really like it.
B000006YXV|5.0|If you like Marvin Gaye, you'll love this CD. Brings back such memories for me. Too bad he's gone! Great music!
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Having watched every superman movie, show and reading the comic books growing up this film actually has brought superman from the underwear over the tights to a realistic vision of where the suit comes from, how his powers developed and the conflict that certainly must arise in a being confronted with being isolated throughout their youth from their own kind. As for more details about his youth and his lineage I think their are places to explore that. We all know that superman's weakness was kryptonian but the question in my mind was always why. And no one ever tried to explain that/ But this film made some sense as to how and why it was affecting him.<br /><br />I know this is somehow going to lead to the Justice league at least I hope they will take a look at that and those heroes that were a part of it. My wife did enjoy the movie very much and she is not easily pleased by the super hero movie. I am looking forward to future installs of the Man of Steel and hope they take it to new heights and uncover more of who Clark is and his past.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The production quality, acting, storytelling, direction - all of it is top notch and leaves me wanting more of Downton Abbey!!
B005LAII44|3.0|Not as good as it was made out to be. Great actors working with fair screenwriting. Need better writers. CGI was good, Plot was transparent and cheesier than the animated series
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The emotion and connection to all of the characters is unlike any book I have read. It is better than the movie although the movie is really good.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not great. Won't go to sleep and we use a projector that only automatically turns off with no input. This thing would keep it on 24/7. You get what you pay for.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love the game but once you hit level 11/12 I found it extremely hard to defeat my opponents due to the fact that they are all way to powerful and that you should keep the at least levels 1_13  I n  the lower level fights still so they have time to build up some more also money should be a lot easier to get especially the ribbon things please still great game though I'm just stuck  due to the powerful enemies
B0038AUYJ6|1.0|Difficult to read very little story what there was is extremely boring I didn't bother finishing  A truly bad choice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think it's very fun. I can play this for a very long time of I feel like it. I find it very enjoyable.

B00FFERTUK|5.0|Nickelback delivers all their hits in one cd from their beginnings to current songs this is a most have for a fan who loved all of the nickelback singles which have made them the rockstars we've come to know. I got say more artists should offer a greatest hits albums because then their fans can have all their favorite songs on one lp.

1455521310|5.0|Anything David Baldacci writes is a good read. King & Maxwell are excellent characters. One can never go wrong with Baldacci if you are looking for a fast moving suspense that keeps your attention to the last page.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Loved this book and the mini series. Also bought the other books in the series as I could not wait to read more.
0679759328|3.0|Nicely written, more vignette than plot driven.  I don't think I'd return to that hotel, really. But the writing was solid.
B000641D2Y|4.0|The production of \\"Home Alone 2\\" spared no expenses, and the result is that rarity of rarities, a sequel that rivals the original in quality and fun.This review is for the single movie DVD of \\"Home Alone 2\\". There's scene selection, captioning, and trailers for \\"Home Alone 1, 2, and 3\\". The picture and sound are very crisp. Even though \\"Home Alone 2\\" was filmed within a couple of years of the original, I'm impressed that virtually the entire cast is back! Macaulay Culkin as Kevin leads the way, and shows once again that he's one of the screens's top comedic actors. I need to send special kudos to \\"newcomers\\" to Kevin's capers Tim Curry and Rob Schneider. They add lots of zip to the hotel world of Kevin. Especially Schneider in his understated comedic support brilliance. So often in other roles on-screen he's bringing the low brow  dash of poor taste. He's SO much better here, as a nice guy, an everyman. Great job! Leaving no stone unturned,  John Hughes and company even employed six \\"pigeon wranglers\\"! Watch for their names in the rolling credits at film's end. Oh; and the family home from the original \\"Home Alone\\" is back, too. I don't know about Buzz' tarantula. Not seen on camera this go-round. However, the fuzzy spider may have been napping! That, however, would be tough to do with Uncle Frank's crooning of \\"Cool Jerk\\"! (Ironic song choice for Kevin's Uncle, eh?). Anyone who enjoyed \\"Home Alone\\" will love this sequal because it stays so true to the original. Highly Recommended!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book is amazing! It made such an impact on me because it was sexy and funny at the same time which is uncommon for a book from this genre. You will not regret reading this book because it's very rare that you find a story that shows the man's perspective. It was a refreshing change of pace reading something like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Delightful game
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Good drama.  As a pilot myself, I know that some of the pilot/aircraft stuff is a bit far-fetched, but necessary to make the story hold together.
B009R659L8|5.0|I believe I've read all of MHC's suspense novels. Every time I think I might be &#34;outgrowing&#34; her, she draws me back in. This is no exception. In fact, I'd put it right up there with my all-time favorite of hers: Stillwatch.
0061120073|5.0|This book is a masterpiece of characterization, description of the places, description of the era and the tribulations of poverty, alcoholism and cultural idiosyncrasies. The prose and dialog genuinely flow. This should be on everyone's reading list.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This is a great read. I loved the humor.  It's too bad these books aren't better proof read. I have to take the ratings down when there are misspelled words. I did enjoy being able to laugh out loud while reading this book. In my opinion, an author has a little something special going for them when they can get the humor across so well.
B00BR9USC8|5.0|Lawrence Krauss does a wonderful job of explaining the history and current status of observational and theoretical cosmological investigations. I liked his explanation of how the experimental measurements of the granularity of the cosmic background microwave radiation show that the universe is flat, e.g. without curvature. As a quantum physicist, I was pleased, but not surprised, to find out that the universe of real matter that we see resulted from quantum fluctuations during inflation. There is no need to invoke string theory, additional dimensions, or branes. Go quantum mechanics! Einstein might not have been pleased. He was not happy about the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. He was reputed to have said that &#34;God does not play dice.&#34; Perhaps, that was his greatest blunder.<br /><br />Last year, as I was doing some gardening on a hot summer day, I was approached by two overly well-dressed people, who were representing their religion. After informing them that I already had a religion that laid claim to a history that beat theirs by over 5000 years, we discussed the intervention of God in the daily lives of people. I referred to what I thought was a very improbable event, something that would qualify as a miracle. I said that you could pray all you want, but not even God could make the Mets beat the Yankees. They agreed with me on that point, but walked away without even leaving any of their literature.<br /><br />This year, the Mets played the Yankees four times and won all four games. One explanation for this is that there is a being, who is a baseball fan, who delights in helping the hapless Mets. He has intervened for them on several occasions, most notably in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. How could anyone imagine that Mookie Wilson's slow grounder would go through the legs of a major league first baseman? A miracle indeed.<br /><br />Another explanation for the Mets' miracles is that improbable events do occur. In the Many Worlds formulation of quantum mechanics, whenever an event can have multiple possible outcomes, every one of those outcomes occurs in a different parallel universe. We happen to live in a universe in which improbable events have benefited the Mets. Thus the Mets' improbable victories may also be viewed as quantum fluctuations. Supernatural intervention is not required.ion of quantum mechanics, whenever an event can have multiple possible outcomes, every one of those outcomes occurs in a different parallel universe.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game for kids to play when they get bored or need something to do.<br />I would fully recommended this game.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Great show.  Glad we're back in season.  Normally we watch these in one sitting, but we've become such fans we're watching them every week.  That's a big deal too! Ha
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of my favorite mobster type movies. De Niro and Pesci were great. The story revolves around Liotta (Henry Hill).<br />There are numerous other stars in this one.
B005OYHF0A|3.0|Let me summarize it for you: All new code should be covered with unit tests. Want to modify legacy code? Write unit tests.
B000HF0ISC|4.0|Disturbing storyline but follows up with a dose of revenge. De Niro as a priest is different but it works.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|A very compeling story that will keep you on the edge of your seat and turning pages to reach the unexpected conclusion.
B00AYE8C70|4.0|It took a couple attempts to register ,  but have had great luck with reception and service from Guatemala, easy to use after installed
B008602KQI|4.0|I never read the books, and had my doubts about wanting to watch a movie where kids are out trying to kill each other. (And as a guy, I also had the feeling it was more of a chick-flick). But I finally caved and watched it and was glad I did. I found it to be a solidly entertaining film despite the seemingly dark (in my opinion) objective of the &#34;Hunger Games&#34;. And there was just enough balance between love story and action/adventure that kept me interested the whole movie through.<br /><br />Overall, interesting watch! One of the better films I've seen in the year!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Good book that's the best buy in the world . I love this book and I can't wait to read the other s in the series.
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|I had heard quite a few people rave about this movie. It was okay. Didn't hate it, didn't love it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I found the book to be well-written and often profoundly moving.  It was a good read.  I loved the warmth, wisdom  and loyalty of Lavinia's adopted family in impossible circumstances.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give it a five was because I felt that the decisions and behavior of the characters, particularly Lavinia, we're not always congruent with their character's development as intelligent, strong people.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Everything in it was heartbreaking and heartwarming  The characters were so well written.  I will read it again and digest it more the second time.
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|seriously the funniest show to come out in a long long time! makes you laugh out loud every single episode!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I retread the first two books since the story was hard for me to remember, I made it about halfway and thought I'd read the end to see if I thought the rest was worth reading.  By the way I don't usually do that.  I didn't go back and read it.  No reward at the end!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first book and, while the second book did not hit the same high marks, it was satisfying.  Allegiant just seemed to give up.  The change in storytelling made the book feel stilted instead of fresh.  I agree with others who note that there were times I forgot to look to see who was writing and could not tell the difference between Tris and Four's voice. The ideas were good but poorly executed.  At least Four learned something by this book and stopped lying, eventually, but both characters seemed to stop growing.  And the ending was pointless.  Life is traumatic and hard.  The characters had gone through so much and used so many skills to keep themselves alive and thriving through it all.  To end the book in the manner she did appeared contrived and purely to be &#34;different.&#34;  Josh Whedon can get away with this because he does it so darn well.  Veronica Roth lost me on this one.
0385335989|5.0|Excellent book and series. Once you get caught up with the story, you can't stop reading. I have read the entire series three times.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It is a fun game and I enjoy playing it. I like that it has different 'challenges'. The thing I don't like is that if you don't have 'energy', you can't continue play until it recharges itself......or you can BUY energy crystals....it seems almost every game gets you hooked, but then has the option to purchase the full version or added/more levels.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Didn't think I would like it but it is so cute. The only thing<br />is some things  take to long and I don't have the time to Waite on it so I play another game to pass the time.
0062238310|5.0|Love all the side notes from Julian on the why's behind how he crafted the story. Fun to read the dialog and imagine the scenes afresh.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I like reading Grisham's works and this was a good read however I felt that in the second part of the plot the author somehow did not share the story enough with the readers ....... it seemed that he enjoyed writing the story for himself.
B00FXEL00W|4.0|it's a book that really makes not want to put it down, really didn't want it end. I loved it.
B0074VA2T2|5.0|Great app. I've got the book and this helps my 3 year old learn her numbers. Since she knew the book, she was more into the app.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is my favorite game l. I deleted all my games but minecraft and BTD 5.IT IS AWSOME thats how i describe it
B001AGXEAG|3.0|we like the movie, that is why i bought it. but there is NOTHING &#34;deluxe&#34; about this edition. just the basic DVD with the movie, and trailers for other movies. no extras.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|What drama.... intensity!  I loved the style of writing and the story content was thrilling.  Thank you so much! Fantastic...!
B00GHJ6BJW|2.0|Maybe her &#34;surgeries&#34; affected her art because this album is really horrible. The 3 singles she released (Applause, Venues and DWYWWMB) are the only really good songs
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Not realistic enough. Speedy zombies. No eating of brains. Just some virus knock-off.  Good thing we have OBAMACARE. The solution to everything. Thanks Barry.
0307341577|2.0|Gilian Flynn has a real knack for creating the most unlikable characters. Most of the time these people are sociopaths. Dark Places is an interesting story despite the cheesy coincidences in the end. It is a page turner.<br /><br />This is a really violent book and I normally avoid stories like this but I got sucked into the plot. However, I had to skip through at least three sections of the book to avoid reading about horrific animal abuse. It's graphic and unnecessarily so. This is on top of the already disturbing violence against the main characters.<br /><br />I have to wonder how a writer can come up with such brutality and depravity. I had similar feelings about Ursula Hege who wrote Stones from the River which also featured heartbreaking violence against an animal. What goes through their heads?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast did meet my expectations! I didn't give this product 5 stars because it has some trouble keeping it's IP-Adress and i have to restart my router.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a good read! I'm so excited to see what else is in store and how the movie compares to the book!
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Plain and simple .... enjoyed it very much. Now waiting for number 2 come out. Purchase and smile and ENJOY.! ! !<br />Happy BonBon
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Fun, New and challenging, especially the underwater levels. If you liked the first one, you'll enjoy this one as well.
B00BC254I8|5.0|I really appreciated the honesty in this book. I have always been a fan of Mike Tyson the great boxer now I am a fan of Mike Tyson the man. Wonderful read!
B00DI75SWM|4.0|It is a fun app.  Would like to be able to save directly to my device but I can email it and save that way.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Perfect sequel to A Time To Kill, which I think is Grisham's best book so far.  Hope it's a movie also.
B000L9IUPM|2.0|The first DVD gets stuck during play.  Only way to get it to work is by skipping 3 songs.  DVD #2 works well.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Couldn't get a bejeweled blitz on the Kindle, but this game is a fun surprise.  I am particularly enjoying the Arcade option!
B00ETPLQ82|5.0|It's good old Metallica nice and heavy but still done with some talent, I think you should give it a listen !!!
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|This a fantastic way to learn geography. I bought the game for my son but have been playing it myself for enjoyment and entertaining education. We also own Stack the States which has helped me memorize the location of the tiny puzzle piece North Eastern states in the U.S.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|great game, very challenging.  although I get stuck often and spend weeks and weeks on one level, that's sort of annoying...
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The acting and the characters are so very good.  Julianna has always been a favorite.  The show is addicting.  Great entertainment.  I love watching it on Kindle with no commercials!
1476727651|5.0|I loved every aspect of this book!!!; the writing, storyline, plot, characters, and how well it sequels The Shining giving us an in depth look into Danny's life as an adult. This is one of those books I challenge every reader to find a legitimate flaw. I couldn't, hence the reason I give it a full, fat, 5-star rating all day long. I won't say anything more other than - READ THIS BOOK!!! You won't regret it.
B00DQQSD3Q|5.0|As a Star Wars fan, the book is great. I had a problem trying to stream it to my iPad to get the full videos that came with it. I read the &#34;written&#34; words on my ancient but still very efficient Kindle. It worked on the iPhone, but not the iPad. But I loved the book
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Show continues to be well worth watching. The cinematography alone sucks you right in. The production is 5 star, but once you get to the end of the season, you'll see why I gave it 4. :-)
039916409X|5.0|I have not completed this book, yet.  However, it is terrific as are all of Margaret Lynch's products.  She is a terrific teacher of tapping and this is such a simplistic process that believing it works can be difficult at times.  Love Margaret Lynch and if I had the funds, which I WILL, then I would purchase everything of hers I could get my hands on.  So much trash has been thrown out thru my use of tapping it is incredible.  Garbage in, garbage out.  Tapping in, garbage out!!  It hardly seems possible that the tapping is relative to the baggage brought to my conscious from subconscious.  But it is!  Please try this and allow yourself to be wowed by the results.  You are about to be your own janitor and that is the most liberating feeling.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|That was easily the best book I have ever read in my life<br />The power it had was overwhelming but still a great book
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Have seen this movie before, but HAD to see again as is a classic 007 BOND movie.  Lots of action!  Loved it!
B00902AKK4|5.0|Ynth is a cute, fun little puzzler. Initially, about 6 levels are open, and completing a level opens 1 or 2 more. Some of them are quite challenging and require thinking outside the box (pun intended). I have enjoyed this one very much.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love this &#34;app&#34; whether to meditate or just to relax.  Lots of choices to mix or match, I usually can relax best with the &#34;flute&#34;.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I love this series and highly recommend it to anyone.<br />At first I was a bit hesitant, but after watching the 1st season I was hooked.<br /><br />It is interesting how I got so attached to some characters, and then there were characters I only wished they got killed by zombies but didn't until season 3!<br /><br />Watch it and join the clan of fans!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Ads ads ads ads yuck would be nice except ads mabey if one you buy with no ads but I am happy with my calculator so don't really need it.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|They are Star Wars Legos and who wouldn't love them!<br /><br />These legos are cool and a great Star Wars fans. Overall great gift idea.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|i liked it cause i am a drunk who hasn't had a drink in 27 years and could relate to the whole thing...
1451626096|3.0|The White Princess follows the story of Elizabeth of York a princess of the House of York who was used as a game piece by her Mother and the new ruling Tudor house of England when she is married to the new upstart Tudor king Henry whom much of the country still sees as a pretender to the thrown and who the author portrays as not having the natural 'finesse' of a natural ruler that the York line had in its rulers such as Elizabeth's Father King Edward, or the last York Ruler, Elizabeth's uncle King Richard;  with whom Elizabeth of York had a much whispered about relationship.<br /><br />While some of the details in the story were interesting, this was not one of my favorite Philippa Gregory books, it was very bogged down with the political and battle details of the time, and I found myself after the first hundred or so pages getting annoyed with certain things.  Like Elizabeth constantly telling King Henry, 'I don't know' or when her cousin Maggie Teddy's sister would deliver shocking or private news Elizabeth would consistently just start off by asking 'What?' I don't think this really did justice to how smart Elizabeth would have been or how dialogue would have progressed.  The details, and events that were concentrated on in the White Princess surprised me it was not as enjoyable as other books by this author, that I've read.<br /><br />Some of the settings, and descriptions of the children were enjoyable, however the overall descriptions of Elizabeth were not what I expected.  The descriptions of England, Henry and his Mother and Elizabeth's Mother were more on point in my opinion, and I do enjoy learning more about this time period. The book follows Elizabeth's life from her marriage to Henry up until he decide's the fate of &#34;The Pretender.&#34;  I don't recommend this book if you're looking for a normal Philippa Gregory novel it was really more about King Henry's cowardice,  and Elizabeth not letting go of her love for Richard.  An interesting take on the story of the cousins war.tory of the cousins war.
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|The book was an excellent read, although it did feel a little drawn out at stages.  The hero of the novel is an eighteen year old boy and was perfectly written as someone struggling to find his place in the world.  His emotions which he displays toward a girl of about his own age are well portrayed and place this novel well in the middle-grade/young adult section.  If I were to find any fault in the characterisation (and this is really a stretch because I had to sit back and think about it) it's that the main character almost becomes a little bit of a cardboard cut out as a snarky boy who can find humour in almost any situation.  But that might be par for the course with a novel in the same genre.<br /><br />Comparing the novel to another superhero novel, Seven Wonders, it is leaps and bounds ahead of that novel which seemed to lose its focus toward the end.  Steelheart was relentless in its approach and didn't all of a sudden become about something else like Seven Wonders - although that was technically the first novel written by Adam Christopher even if published after his Empire State.  Compared against the infinitely superior Empire State, Steelheart's atmosphere and world building seems to come second as there was such something special about Empire State and the Age Atomic.
B00GOQ9M4O|1.0|Worst episode in the Walking Dead series by far!! They better make up for this big steamer soon or else I give up.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Arrived on time and works like a charm! Seen it so many times already and even better on Blueray! Just works so well.
B00BAXFAJC|1.0|I am not sure why this book received so much acclaim. I found it so boring I couldn't get past the first chapter.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Very good acting & directing.  Developed characters are colorful.  Initial scenes of aircraft problems and crash are well done & gripping.  However, the rest of the plot (with emphasis on dealing with alcoholism) is predictable, formulaic & tedious.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|yet another excellent British crime drama/murder mystery. Just wish there were more to watch and that the US had the newer series of British shows available quicker!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Seem to be a fun game you can go at you pun speed. Hard to get coins. Need to work on getting coins
B0000DIXDR|4.0|I would have liked full screen. I also was looking for the 20 annv addition, but only found blue ray.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Incredibly interesting book about how we all create the story of who we are in a surreal context of a real and fictional North Korea
B0029BXMAI|5.0|These are the BBC TV series and I love these series for more than 30 years. Many episodes are politically so real and contain intelligent black humors. I reccomend you to watch these DVDs in addition to the books.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This a fascinating and well documented account of the life and ministry of the perhaps the most significant figure in human history. It provides new insights in separating Jesus from the role of the Christ.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|This is the best Rubinatein CD set ever sold including 2 DVDs. It was interesting the sound of Piano are improved over half century(1928~1976) and how Rubinstein developped his music. I also love the CDs with Szeryng and Founier. Finally Rubinstein made Barenboim a great conductor!
B000TEPEAS|4.0|Great for late night driving if you want something to keep you awake. I listened to this for years when I drove truck back in the 1980's.
B0002O06NA|5.0|Everything sounds better on vinyl. No bonus tracks like on the big come up but still an amazing album. Smart purchase.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I have not read a book that shocked me in a really long time, this one did. I love it when I read a book and it makes me emotional, I had the tears flowing. There's not an age limit on this book. Yeah it's young adult but don't let that stop you from reading the series if you are over the \\"young adult\\" age. A new world and characters worth falling in love  with. I have to add that not all books are supposed to leave you feeling all fuzzy inside. Some books show little pieces of real life. There will always be that one time when not every character makes it to the end of the book.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|There is no way to log off the app. When I redownload the app it now will not register my device. Customer service was not helpful at all. How do I get all my songs that I purchased on Amazon on to my phone. No one can help
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a fun game to play with all of your friends but is very addictive though. Just try not to spend too much money. I've had friends that have spent hundreds of dollars on this game.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Entertaining but kinda dumb. I enjoyed but I don't think my wife enjoyed it as much as I did .
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|It won't let me even play it it just keeps saying a problem occurred when downloading and I've tried deleting and downloading it again an  clearing its data and nothings worked
1250038820|5.0|Humans' pictures, comments, stories, insights, joys, delights, celebrations, loves, tears, and woes.<br /><br />Reader/viewers' opportunity to experience New York Humans through the eyes of a remarkable artist of images, words, compassion and empathy.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This is the best game than talking Tom and talking Tom 2.<br />I admit that you should get this game
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game. As others have said, it makes you think but Isn't so hard that it can't be completed without repeatedly referring to a walkthrough.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|While the game itself, graphically superior as it is compared to others, is decent, an advertisement covering the ENTIRE bottom of the screen was a major turn-off. I can understand a small advertisement in the store, but these do not disappear to the point of hindering my ability to continue playing. As much as I enjoy the Big Bang Theory, I do not need a constant pop-up every time I feel the urge to play this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the idea and the author puts it together wonderfully. I would recommend this to teens and adults.  Now I am gonna read the second book.
B007JZGIMS|1.0|This app wasnt what i thought.  It was supposed to sync my itunes music but nope...... very disappointed for wasiting money!
0684847248|5.0|This book (and the others written by M. Scott Peck) have been pivotal in my life.  Peck's presentation of what it means to be an &#34;adult&#34; has made a tremendous difference to me personally -- and, as a management consultant, to me professionally, too.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Leo DiC was a BRILLIANT Gatsby -- but although the person who played Daisy looked right for the part, her acting was inadequate, to say the least. The actor playing Tom was also really, really good. But Daisy! If only she and the script had been good.<br /><br />The script really dumbed down the book: especially annoying were the voiceovers explaining the action. And why was it necessary to begin with Nick talking to a shrink???<br /><br />With all the great (and unknown) songs from the 1920s, I found the rap unnecessary -- and wrong for the period.<br /><br />All in all, I found this movie very frustrating because it wasted two great performances with its awful writing.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Let's be honest, does Downton really need me to review it?  It's so well produced. It's beautiful to watch and the story line has a hook. Have already watched it again and again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A moving story that brings intra family violence to the public in general. Sparks never fails to transmit these emotions that mark one of the curses of our time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book in sixth grade. Here I am 12 years years later and I just read it in two days. This book is so deep yet so accessible. Totally an amazing read.
B00CO4GO7I|3.0|Basically, I do not enjoy true story books. I did admire what he stood for and was impressed<br />by his deeds.
B001R60ESE|5.0|very good music, very recomendable for relax listening, video and audio quality , the only bad thing is that Chris Botti talk a lot<br />between every song.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and I am very happy it is available for the Kindle now. That is all I can really say. If you have never played the game, be careful, it is addictive.
B00ENZUUF8|4.0|I had this CD when it originally came out and loved it.  There are some of their best quality tracks on here - including the powerful  &#34;Hit Between The Eyes&#34;.  So, no question I jumped on this Deluxe Edition CD/DVD when it showed up - and the improved sound quality is awesome!<br /><br />My only problem with this release is on the DVD....It shows 12 tracks, but it just ends abruptly after &#34;Lust Or Love&#34; (track 10)!  I went back and replayed it to be sure, and this release is clearly missing &#34;Big City Nights&#34; and &#34;Rock Me Like a Hurricane&#34; at the end - ??? How does this happen on a Deluxe Edition?<br /><br />Either way, get this for the improved sound and if you don't mind the missing DVD tracks.  If any knows of any way to remedy this for those who have already bought it, let us know.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a calculator very quickly and this one downloaded and was ready when I needed it.  I worked for what I needed it for.
B00DQBWLSO|4.0|Not as good as Battle Studies (or the first few) but better than Born and Raised. Some really memorable tracks with an interesting and dynamic use of &#34;old country&#34; sounds.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is the best angry birds yet! My son and I both enjoy playing it. As a Star Wars junkie, I love all the characters that have been incorporated into the game. And the ability to play for either the birds or the pigs adds a fun twist to  the game. My son finds this edition easier to play than the others. The addition of the telepods allow you to play as your favorite characters whenever you like. Great job guys, keep up the good work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great app for kids or even an adult so I recommend this to every one.it can entertain anyone.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Best app ever in my opinion I love how you can connect to Facebook and play your freinds and family
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love watching the interplay between the characters.  Harvey and Mike are the perfect guy-team.  Harvey and Donna should get married at the end (not too soon).  Rachel and Mike should be together.  And the list goes on with all the supporting staff.
B00G32VYDG|4.0|A few more expletives than I would have liked, but still a good movie. And who would have expected Kevin Bacon?
B000HKYOK0|5.0|You have to love the original Star Trek.  Still holds up pretty well after almost 50 years.  Love the outfits!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Have been a fan since the start and was lucky enough to have see the guys play in St. Paul on the &#34;In God We Trust&#34; tour.  Have caught many live acts since then and that show remains in the top few.  Michael is the reason I started singing and remains an elite singer to say the least! This album harkens back to their raw roots and is as hot as any metal release- God bless guys and keep rockin' now get some gigs in Colorado!
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|I enjoyed a curiosity to see the movie with out going to the theatres.  A great time to share with my Son and his take on the series of movies in this genre.
B004RQDQIQ|1.0|The quality of the image is terrible. It's like you're watching a tired old VHS version. This film deserves much better treatment. I can only recommend it if you absolutely love the film and need to own a copy.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I have watched all the seasons so far and this is one of the best TV dramas ever. You can't watch it without getting hooked.
B00BCX2F66|2.0|I thought this was suppose to be a like a kick stand for the phone so that I could watch movies. 2 thumbs down. keeps it protected. Gets dirty fast.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Great series...but she needs to have it come to an end.  I thought the first 7 were all that were in the series...I come to find out that she keeps writing them.  They need to end and have a final conclusion.  But, still a good read!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Going to give her book as Christmas gifts.  Thank you, Malala, for simply being YOU.  May all your dreams come true.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much...just didn't like the ending. At. All.  Well written, and kept me interested.  Tris's character kind of grated on me at times, but overall a good series to read.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I would love to give it a five star rating, but I cannot. The reason being, you have to spend money for crowns to buy a dragon. I refuse to do so, so I can not do certain quests that require more than three heros at this time. Other than that, it's a great game.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book is what I call a chocolate mousse of a read. It looks small, but is quite filling. It can be devoured in a sitting but is best slowly savored, plus it's chocolate so what's not to love! A delight.
B0060AY85C|5.0|Of all the authors I've ever read, few can impart the heartbreak of the human condition like Toni Morrison.  A short read, I tore through this book on a flight from Tokyo to the United States, absorbing the characters, the conditions, the injustice that humans visit on each other.  Though the there are many themes, I found this book speaking to the dangers of apathy and of giving up.  Exposing the shame of medical experimentation on people of color in the darker days of our nation's history, it also demonstrates the good that can come of the kindness of strangers and the prices we pay for remaining silent.
B00DEE9U0K|5.0|This DVD set is the continuation of the series that ROCKS !!! Can't get enough of it. George Romero was quoted as saying this show was more like a soap opera. Not so, George.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It's a classic for a reason.  Though the text may be old and cumbersome, I enjoyed this book.  It was fascinating to see where much of our pirate lore was born.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the best book ever written in the history of books are there more than five stars cause it deserves more than just 5
B006G3JPWO|5.0|I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie.  I don't even have kids and this is an all time favorite! Perhaps its Winnifred's wicked magic?
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Though the storyline held your interest through most of the book it fell flat at the end.Expected more from a sequel to the Shining. Somewhat dissapointing
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|Ordered it by mistake but thought I'd give it a try. Lost interest a few chapters in and just stopped reading it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This is a sequel to A Time To Kill.  Same attorney on the same little southern town.  Not his best but it is entertaining.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|Rocking album from Thirty Seconds To Mars. The album is simply awesome! Fans can look for the band's signature sound on this album and walk away with another great experience, as is the case with all of Thirty Seconds To Mars' albums.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Perhaps seeing the movie for the first book somewhat spoiled my opinion of the first book.  This time around I got to read the book first!  This one contained lots of good twists and turns without being overly complicated!
B00FCAK12A|5.0|This anniversary edition is a hard rocking reminder of what Lamb Of God is all about. With the tracks remixed and remastered you can enjoy this album again with a new twist while maintaining the hard edge that fans love. Crank up the stereo and blast this awesome album!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and am so glad it has come to the kindle great play amazon it was about time
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|As a fan of Hootie And The Blowfish, I decided to give this album a try and I'm glad I did. Although a different sound than I'm used to hearing, the CD was great to listen to. The music on this album is very good.
B0039208QM|5.0|Another great Tim Burton Batman movie.  Great fun for the whole family! All you children from the late 80's and 90's do yourself a favor and buy this movie.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|We've watched this movie at least six times and show it to all our friends.<br />It is an absolute delight.
B0039208JE|5.0|There's just something about this movie that's magical to me.  Tim Burton was at his best back then and he still makes pretty descent movies to this very day.  Both this movie and Batman Returns were great movies.  Forget Batman Forever and Batman & Robin.  If you were a kid back in the late 80's and early 90's this would be the perfect movie to buy.  Christmas is just around the bend, so parents, you might want to think of buying your little Batman fans this movie and Batman Returns.  Pass on the nostalgia to your children.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|My granddaughter could watch this 24/7 so I thought I should see it to keep up with her.  Very cute.  Love all the crazy looking characters.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|This app really deserves a five star rating. I rated it four stars for the reason they charge an recurring fee as opposed to an outright price for this premium app trial. The extension is available at \\"no charge\\" with the Google Chrome Browser.<br /><br />26 Jan 2015 - This is a follow-up to my previous review. This is the most amazing app and worth the $12 a year subscription now that I have used it extensively. It covers all my devices and generates powerful passwords and stores them for me in an encrypted vault. I just have to remember the master password to access the vault. It saves, auto-fills and displays duplicate passwords used to show any vulnerability. The program asks to run a security check to show how weak your current passwords are.

B002SSBD6W|5.0|Anyone who is a consumer of animal products should really read this book. They should be demanding change in the way their food is produced for themselves and their families.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Painful.  Seriously painful.  I'm embarrassed to say, I didn't mind Kristen Stewart's acting in the Twilight series, because I actually thought that she was pretending to be Bella (who is a pretty mind-numbing character, packed with unwavering indecisiveness).<br /><br />This?  No, Kristen is just bad.  And it detracts from Theron.  It detracts from everything.  The disc was hung from a tree to deter wildlife.  Two stars because it can be repurposed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok I saw my cousin playing this game I said what game is that and she said subway surfers I went on my kindle and got the app .anyway best game get it.
1878424319|5.0|Easy, quick read.  Profound.  Buying it for all my friends.  Helps you see the world and interactions with other people in a different light.
B003QSPTAY|5.0|This story is a classic and this video is family friendly. Our children love the story line and find all the characters great. The girls' grandpa is hilarious, sweet, and an example of what a grandparent should be! Watch it with the kids for family night and you will have a good time. Aldo, it has a happy ending. ;)
0307719774|5.0|Fun little book.  Kind of hard to write in, had to bend the binding to flatten out the book so it was easier to write in.  Going to be fun to look back year on year and see what I was up to then!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Such a powerful story of one man's experience growing up in and escaping from the labor camps of North Korea.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|After seeing PJ20 you realize that these guys are trying to make good, original music.  You'll see that you've never heard anything like Lightening Bolt before, yet it sounds so familiar, and good.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|I first heard Love Bites (So Do I), loved the hard-rock hilariousness of the song, and decided to download this CD. I was surprised that along with the awesome screaming, Lzzy Hale has a wonderful singing voice! You get a good mix of songs you can shout to (Love Bites, I Miss the Misery, Freak Like Me) and some really nice ballads too (In Your Room, Break In). The song Beautiful with You really reminds me of The Veronicas, so if you enjoyed &#34;The Strange Case Of...&#34; maybe check out &#34;The Secret Life Of...&#34; too.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is another well crafted story with a classic gripping Grisham twist. With well developed characters and a familiar setting, the book was impossible to set aside.
0060763280|4.0|Good book. A with generally good knowledge and advice. A little bit heavy on the &#34;universe&#34; is wanting to help you stuff but I just looked past that and picked out the good stuff. There is some practical advice with is why I give it a 4 star over a 3 star rating
B004PGO25O|1.0|Press field should stick to historical fiction and golf. I hope he does not start publishing his grocery list next.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Very good movie.  Typical Terintino movie.  Not the average western movie.  Foxx is brilliant and would recommend seeing it to anyone.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Monsters University Movie Night with GG:  We loved this, showed it to my grandchildren, we thought it was a sequel but found out a prequel , it was great
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|We watch quite a lot of scary movies. Rarely do these movies creep me out of nights to come. I found myself thinking of certain scenes quite often. Unfortunately, I was made fun of by my SO. I've recommended this to many.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I thought taking on the subject of alcoholism in this context was a creatively brave thing to do,  and people I know who are alcoholic say it's very very true to life. It wasn't a 5-star, but Denzel was amazing and I'm glad I saw it.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|loved reading this book ... some parts are boring but every book has to have some boring parts... but thats just me ... but other then that i loved the book and someday i would love to travel and meet new people like she did in the book it was so exciting to read about  her travels
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book recreates the characters from A Time To Kill and is wonderful. It's a completely different story, but the relationships still ebb and flow, but in a mature friendship. They accept each other's flaws  and work together to make a great story filled with the courage to do the right thing.
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|Enjoyed like the first RED, lots of action. Its hard to rate movies becuase I don't no what your taste is, but I enjoyed RED 2.
B003G4W49C|3.0|not for young readers, book dragged on with too much internal thoughts and philosophy.  I liked this book when I read it in my late 20's, my 10-year-old gave up by page 200.......
B000W27AE0|5.0|I remember when this album ruled the world. Tears for Fears have many great albums but this is the one that made them a household name. The extra songs don't add much but it's nice to have I guess.
B005JE7XW0|5.0|This movie was so funny! I loved it and would definately recommend it if you like horror movie spoofs. You won't be disappointed!
B00136JR2M|5.0|The one that started it all. It's probably their best as well. Who knew that New York and cheesy Kung Fu movies would make a great mix...Wu-Tang!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun game really easy to play. I enjoy games like this one. So check it out i hope you have fun too. Maybe have some of your friends play as well
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|I am not a big Zombie fan but I enjoy the scenario that this show proposes. This series is character driven not zombie driven and that is why I think it is so successful. My only issue with the first season was that there were only six episodes. Outside of that it is a great series that only gets better and more addictive.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|They're only problem with this game . It doesn't work well without internet. The game keeps you interested as it unfolds
B00EYRCD8M|5.0|Excellent condition, very excited about it. No scratches, no problems. I love this artist and am happy to really begin my vinyl record collection.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It looks stunning in HD! Not only do the colors pop, but everything looks a little more realistic, without changing the original intent. They did a great job!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun and addicting.  I put off playing this for fear of what I would become. But it doesn't matter, I'm a Candy Crush addict and I admit it .
0307278255|5.0|So moving.  Beautiful, difficult, heart-rending stories @ immigrants to America.  Her writing is beautifully fluid and alive.  READ THIS now.
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|Superman was one of the very early comic books I enjoyed as a young kid, and I've read those comics for decades. I haven't always liked the changes they've put the character through, but nothing I had reservations about in his comic book portrayals disappointed me in the manner this movie did.<br /><br />First, very little about this movie and virtually nothing about the character spoke out to me as being Superman. Henry Cavill's portrayal of our single favorite super strong, super fast, invulnerable hero was almost devoid of emotion. Even his brief and infrequent outbursts of anguish seemed forced, and that was virtually the only emotion the writers or director allowed him to show. I just didn't get \\"I'm Superman\\" out of this performance in any way. Yes, he was brave. Big deal.<br /><br />Amy Adams as Lois Lane was OK, but brought little life and only a dab of the spunk to the role that we've watched over and over again from Margo Kidder's performance. It's as if the direction was afraid to \\"go big\\" with the acting in a genre that demands its characters be very, very big.<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne was wasted, as Perry White's scenes in the film were throw away moments that really added nothing to the story or the atmosphere of the film. If they had been completely cut you'd never have noticed them missing.<br /><br />And that's just the acting ... when I start discussing the story decisions thing go downhill in a hurry:<br /><br />1. As a Superman \\"traditionalist\\" I didn't get having Lois Lane track the mysterious super-alien back to his roots with an over-simplistic and hardly detailed investigation that took her directly to the Kent farm. This is not a spoiler, as this happens early in the film and you can see it coming a mile away.<br /><br />2. The entire sub-plot about her desire to have an expose on an alien presence in the form of a super being on Earth had some interesting potential but in the end was just a throw away story element. More on that later.<br /><br />3. These writers decided to follow the course of many on having Jonathan Kent die. The manner of his death, especially vis a vis Kal-El as his adopted son, was a complete disconnect for me from the possibility of this character being Superman. It was supposed to provide some deeper psychological underpinning for this Superman story, but it was merely ill thought and useless.<br /><br />4. Having Superman's relationship with \\"Earth\\" transition from moving from a suspected alien threat to a friend and savior was horribly bungled. It was an idea. It just wasn't an idea these writers could competently plot.<br /><br />5. Turning the end of the movie into an extended battle pretty much resulting in the destruction of Metropolis (sorry if that's a spoiler) was a decision made for the purpose of having a special effects spectacular with what the writers/director hoped would be shock value. Sorry, that's been done. And in this context it made little sense and by logic hampers the story. At the time this happens, \\"Superman\\" is completely unknown to the public Even with General Zod's public announcement, this is not a character known, trusted, or beloved by the public. The virtual destruction of Metropolis, in which he participated even as he tried to stop it, would leave pretty much everyone resentful and suspicious of this being. From either the standpoint of logic OR emotion, it just doesn't work.<br /><br />6. As I promised, back to Lois' expose: That could have been a really interesting element of a Superman introduction if handled with any subtlety or intelligence at all. If it had been the main theme of the movie and been well written, it could (and probably should) have carried the film. Yet the moment Zod shows up with his announcement, ALL of the effort put into that sub-plot became completely wasted. It is obvious that the creators of this story had many ideas, didn't have the skill or talent to boil them down to a few that would work well together, andjust jumbled everything they thought might be \\"cool\\" into one extended, illogical mess that had little to do with a satisfying \\"Superman Origin\\" story.<br /><br />7. Then at the end, we have Clark Kent merrily showing up for work as a reporter at the Daily Planet (where of course Lois already knows his secret!). But how? When? With the damage and evident loss of at least tens of thousands of lives, Metropolis would have had to be essentially abandoned as a toxic environmental nightmare, not to mention graveyard ... and that included extensive damage to the Daily Planet Building itself that likely would have taken years of repair, if it was even deemed structurally to be salvageable!<br /><br />It's like this film was written by clueless 20-somethings with no idea of even the most simple practical results of the events they were so proud of. These writers seem like the kind of people you'd see Jay Leno quizzing on the street and finding incapable of locating Canada on a map of North America. LOL<br /><br />There is more but this review is long enough.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that if this movie is at some point in the future playing on one channel, and Christopher Reeve's Superman of 1978 happens to be playing on another at the same time, I'll be watching the 1978 version. This film simply has none of the charm, humor or life of the first series. In fact, the much lambasted \\"Superman Returns\\" had a far more convincing and embraceable story than this film.<br /><br />I've always been a DC fan over Marvel, but Marvel and who they choose to work with in films is flat-out putting the DC portrayals to shame. Comparing this film to \\"The Avengers\\" leaves \\"Man of Steel\\" looking as flat as a pancake. It's very sad, as I was really looking forward to the prospect of an excellent new Superman movie.<br /><br />To finish with a technical note, the special effects are well executed. In my opinion 3D is wasted, just get the regular Blu ray if you must see this. Nothing about the 3D stood out to me at all in the frequent jumble of wreckage presented in this film.<br /><br />I was often annoyed by the decisions to go with a \\"pushed\\" look for most of the film (especially the flashbacks) that often left scenes looking grainy and washed out. It was a stylistic choice that didn't work for me as a viewer.<br /><br />Whether you enjoy the CGI effects and scenes or not, nothing about the excellent technical presentation can make up for the ineptitude of the plotting or writing.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this film a lot. In the end I cannot recommend it whatsoever. I will try out the sequel and see if they do better, and hope that I can completely forget this one and pretend that the next one is first in the reboot sequence. If they can't get the next one right, that will be the last of this series I watch, if it even survives the next installment.just jumbled everything they thought might be \\"cool\\" into one extended, illogical mess that had little to do with a satisfying \\"Superman Origin\\" story.<br /><br />7. Then at the end, we have Clark Kent merrily showing up for work as a reporter at the Daily Planet (where of course Lois already knows his secret!). But how? When? With the damage and evident loss of at least tens of thousands of lives, Metropolis would have had to be essentially abandoned as a toxic environmental nightmare, not to mention graveyard ... and that included extensive damage to the Daily Planet Building itself that likely would have taken years of repair, if it was even deemed structurally to be salvageable!<br /><br />It's like this film was written by clueless 20-somethings with no idea of even the most simple practical results of the events they were so proud of. These writers seem like the kind of people you'd see Jay Leno quizzing on the street and finding incapable of locating Canada on a map of North America. LOL<br /><br />There is more but this review is long enough.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that if this movie is at some point in the future playing on one channel, and Christopher Reeve's Superman of 1978 happens to be playing on another at the same time, I'll be watching the 1978 version. This film simply has none of the charm, humor or life of the first series. In fact, the much lambasted \\"Superman Returns\\" had a far more convincing and embraceable story than this film.<br /><br />I've always been a DC fan over Marvel, but Marvel and who they choose to work with in films is flat-out putting the DC portrayals to shame. Comparing this film to \\"The Avengers\\" leaves \\"Man of Steel\\" looking as flat as a pancake. It's very sad, as I was really looking forward to the prospect of an excellent new Superman movie.<br /><br />To finish with a technical note, the special effects are well executed.

1250038820|5.0|As a transplanted born and raised New Yorker, a photographer & poet this book speaks to my heart & all my senses. I love where I live now, but would be lying if I said I didn't miss New Yorkers. I feel I am home when I look through this book. Brandon captured the look, the vibe & the spirit of NY. I love the quality of the pages, the binding & the size of the book. Some coffee table books are so big, that once opened, they are hard to handle. This one is perfect. Only thing I wish it had was page numbers, only so I could tell people, you gotta see/read the one on pg so & so. Bravo Brandon!
B003GRWBW4|5.0|This movie is so wonderful it is hard to even review. A cult classic, after one viewing you will know why. Such a beautiful piece of social commentary. Harold's mother should have won an Oscar, she is wonderfully hilarious. I cannot say enough about Ruth Gordon - who wouldn't fall in love with such a vivacious beautiful soul as she teaches Harold the beauty of life (Harold is fascinated with death, Harold meets Maude because they both attend funerals for fun). This one is a must see for all.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The original series of Star Trek was the best. Love the remastered special effects.  The original series of Star Trek holds a special place in my heart. This is well worth looking into for new fans and old.
B001H1UQRI|5.0|Incredible movie (even better book) This movie is NOT about fighting. This movie is a love story. A sick and twisted love triangle. This movie is smart, funny, horrible, sad and clever. One of my personal favs and one of the few books that was translated perfectly to the big screen (Misery with Kathy Bates is another). Fight club evokes the same feeling you get as yo read the book. It is genius.
0765338149|4.0|102 pages into the book and it still holds my attention.  My plan is to finish the book then wait until the movie comes to the small screen to view.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever watched.you will love it .comedy .check it out.well have a good one

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I hate that Lady Sibel died, but I love the rest of it. Never a dull moment. I feel sorry for Lady Edith. Nothing good happens for her.
B003J5UIRS|1.0|This scholarly look at reincarnation lacks reader appeal. While going into detail about child cases, the reader must slog along hoping for the read to change from scholarly to truly interesting...which it never does. Also, the digital transfer runs words together and loses fs within words.  Do not recommend for a Good read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. Lot of the books I read takes place in England, and now I have a voice to go with them. I love the British accent. But I hate that Matthew died after it took so long for him and Lady Mary to get together. I can't wait for the new season.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Frun is fun with friends.and this game is one of the best frun apps ever. so have frun and stop reading.
B00BNUBK46|5.0|Like some have mentioned, the instructions are worthless. Once you figure out how to put it all together (basically just looking at the product photo instead of the instructions), the light is great. I took it out on a hunt and used it to setup my tree stand at 4 AM. The hike in to the woods, the combo flood + spot basically lit everything up, and once I was at the tree, I just used the flood without the spot. Before we left the cars for the woods the lowest flood setting was great as well because my pals can look at me without going blind.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Good price and sound quality was excellent. Music selection on this CD was great. Have really injoyed listening to this CD.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|The trailer was very intriguing. Anyone who has read the Norse Mythology will be struck by the realism of the scenes. I may even rent, or buy the series.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This app is already better than on the computer. I like the whole new layout of this game it is pretty cool now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read! Exciting and adventurous!! Story line and characters are detailed to well that you can imagine the scenes and peoples clearly.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|What a bizarre book. I thoroughly enjoyed the firs half. But the second half of the book is very odd. I picked this for our book group, and I think I'll pay for it.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Although it was not what I expected, it was not the sellers fault I didn't read the full product description. Over all it was on time, in great condition, and my husband loved it.
B00000IZOR|4.0|I saw it for six dollars at CVS so I wasn't too happy otherwise it's a pretty cute get a little toy for my grandson
B00BW8WI5Y|5.0|I loved it. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a very touching novel. I read Perfect Rachel Joyce's second book and as i liked the style of Rachel's writing I decided I would like to read The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry which was The Sunday Times best seller.The story is about one morning Harold recieves a letter in a pink envelope addressed to him at Fossebridge Road. When Harold opens the letter he discovers that it is from a lady friend of his who he used to work with at the brewery the lady friends name was Queenie Hennessy. The letter contained bad new that said she was in a hospice in Berwick-upon Tweed. Harold sat down and started a reply back to his dear old friend Queenie,but he did not really know what to write. Once Harold finished his letter he left his wife Maureen hoovering upstairs and poped out just to the end of the road to the post box to post his letter off. Harold decided once he reached the post box he would walk to the next, but instead of posting the letter Harold made a phone call to the Hospice a hundred miles away and said tell Queenie to hold on as I am walking on foot to see her. As Harold walks the hundred miles to see Queenie we follow his lovely journey. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry comes highly recommend.Review by ireadnovelswordpress.com

1484011775|3.0|My son had to read this book for school, he thought it was good, and he both listened to this book as well as reading it.  Having listened to the book was very helpful for the project he was required to do.  Soon, after he read this book he saw the TV movie version, which was quite different from the book, he preferred the book.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Ewweh...it's a junk app..I can't help but wonder if it's malware... it's really useless. But it is great if you don't want your pages to load, like things freezing up...especially if you LOVE uninstalling and reinstalling it over and over..Then, yeah, this is definitely the app for you. I really appreciate that I didn't have to pay for it..so my expectations weren't high..but, really???..give us a break...So some pride in the products you put out.
0399160450|5.0|Hard to beat Tom Clancy as a writer. Current. Relevant. Too close to being a real possibility. Great characters. Vivid detail.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Fabulous documentary! I loved seeing the 4 babies doing the same thing in totally different circumstances. Highly recommend it for anyone interested in parenting. There is no dialog, so you can't really do 2 things at once while watching it. I normally just listen to a movie while I'm doing something else. I had to stop and concentrate on this, which isn't necessarily a bad thing!
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn stands shoulder to shoulder with Tom Clancy as great writers. Outstanding character development. Locations come alive. Almost reality. Very hard to put down.
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|It is just OK - this is not my type of game but thought I would try it for something different - it's currently in the cloud
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|One of the best rock albums ever! I already owned the first release but when this came out with the DVD of the New Years Eve concert I had to own it. I was at that concert actually and due to it's VERY late start and open bar my memories are a little fuzzy from that night. This helped me relive that amazing New Years! It would have been nice to have better camera angles for that concert but I'll take it. The other concert on the DVD is way more professional and was filmed a few months later when the group had polished the act by quite a bit.
B00FHB7398|5.0|So far, I love the game.  Sometimes a little hard to follow without using the hint button but overall the graphics are great and it has a great story line.  Glad I purchased it.  I am still in the beginning stages of this game but so far I love it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Each story drew me in and held my interest, but somehow they never felt truly interwoven. Almost as if each could be a short story instead of all one novel.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This game I find to be a great past time - something quick to play when you don't have a lot of time and it doesn't take a lot of brain power - no heavy thinking but yet you have to think a bit to use the best strategy

0061433063|5.0|Terry Pratchett.  If you haven't read him, this is a great way to get your feet wet.  I love his Tiffany Aching series.  Great for kids, great for adults.  Terry Pratchett is laugh out loud funny and very wise.
B00FLNRN06|5.0|It was a great film with lot's of humor.  My family and friends have never laughed so hard in awhile.  The cast was terrific and Jennifer was out of her comfort zone.  I applaude it all................

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have a similar game on my phone but it doesn't compare to this game. it was worth spending the money to get it, and hey its not like its four dollars...its 99&cent;!! I'm so addicted to it, I spent my whole day playing it and I hope to get more games that run as smooth as this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun!!!! I play this on my kindle when I get home it's so addicting. I recommend this to everyone, some of the levels are challenging but that's the fun part!:) Me and my friends play this all day at school it's so MUCH FUN everyone should get it, you won't be disappointed!:)

B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|Gary's new book has more blockbuster revelations as well as continuing Arten and Pursah's much-needed review and clarification of A Course in Miracles. I also appreciated learning more about his personal journey with first wife Karen and second wife Cindy and his teaching.

B00874T02K|5.0|I've appreciated this app. It's pretty basic in concept: do some exercises on one day, do more two days later, more two days later, until you reach your goal. Having that framework and the goals for exercise has been great!
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|Haven't perfected this game.  I got it for my grandson but the skill level maybe too much for him.  We tried it together but I'm not too good at it yet.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased this thing on impulse.  I have phones, tablets, PC's, TV's, blu ray players, gaming systems, etc. that can do what this thing does, but for some reason, I bought it anyway.  I think the most intriguing thing (besides the price) was probably the size of this thing.  I mentioned I have a ton of over things that can do what this does (except chrome browser mirroring) but none can compare to the size.  I have one connected to my TV and anyone walking by would never know it's there (as opposed to, say, my ps3 which you can see and hear when on).<br /><br />I've played youtube videos and movies from netflix on this and I've tried the Chrome mirroring and I haven't run into any issues at all.  I've controlled it from my iPhone, Galaxy Note 8, PC's running Chrome browser (after downloading the extension), and iPads and all work without a hitch.  You can forward, reverse, play, and stop your videos all from any of those devices.<br /><br />By far, the best use I came up with was watching NFL Sunday Ticket using this thing.  I subscribe to NFL Sunday Ticket on DirecTV and I was able to cast games using the Chrome browser.  This allowed me to move one of my DirecTV receivers out of a room that was hardly being used.  That alone prompted a 5 star rating for me.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|What's missing:  the usual fascinating plot, suspense and wonderful creepy feel I get from the Kay Scarpetta novels. Which I have loved from the beginning.<br />What's here:  relentless narrative.  Long conversations between Benton and Kay, repetitive internal musings and descriptions.<br />I can't recommend this book, but if you are a Cornwell addict like me you'll buy it anyway.<br />Shucks, though.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Love, love, love this book!!<br />Even better  than the first, but can't wait to read the next!!! Truly a fantastic book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really love Candy Crush! Thanks for finally making it available for Kindle Fire. Next up, Windows Smart Phone, please!?
B00FQPHA0M|4.0|Great movie touching on the legend of Superman with a pinch of Harlan Ellison's &#34;Man with the Glass Hand&#34; mixed in.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|what a waste of 2 hours at any cost.  i wouldn't take it a second time if it were free
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favorite go to game. Fun, fast-paced and easy to play. You'll be easily hooked. And it's free!
B00E6F155E|3.0|From a nostalgia standpoint. It's really cool. It's really good to see this saved to Blu Ray. Some classic Gabriel going on here. But from and audio standpoint. Eh. As others have mentioned maybe some over dubbing going on. But it's not too bad. Maybe it was needed ...who knows after decades of storage. The video is pretty good to considering the age and transfer. Seeing these guys and hearing this music 30 years younger brings back some fond memories. However this isn't a Blu Ray that I'd pop in the system as a reference show for any one.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Seems to have a few glitches once in awhile?  It's just ok but when it works it's fine. Pretty average.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Don't read! The ending sucks. Just stop reading at insurgent, this book will only disappoint you, I couldn't even finish it. I want my money back!
B001M4YZ90|3.0|After watching and adoring \\"Lock, stock and two smoking barrels\\" and \\"Snatch\\", I had high hopes for this film, especially considering the cast - but I was ultimately a little bit disappointed. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited spoilers.<br /><br />I will not say much about the story, it is for you to discover, but this is another Guy Ritchie British gangster film, so you can expect to find a mob boss (played here by Tom Wilkinson), a femme fatale (played here by Thandie Newton) and three small time crooks somehow overwhelmed by the stuff they got themselves into (played here by Gerald Butler, Idris Elba and Tom Hardy), as well as some other colorfoul characters.<br /><br />There is of course some humour, as the director attempted to repeat the success of his earlier British gangster films, but this movie is really significantly less funny than the two previously mentioned masterpieces. Also, some characters are simply impossibly annoying, like the prodigal son of mob boss (and also terminal junkie), named Johny Quid.<br /><br />There will be of course some dead bodies dropped, some people will get double-crossed, there will be some robberies, some sex, some Russian gangsters, an appearance of the Old Bill, etc. - but somehow all this doesn't work as it should. Also, a part of the plot is in fact simply copy pasted from \\"Layer Cake\\" - and that really wasn't necessary... Finally, some things are not definitely explained at the end of the film (it concerns mostly Thandie Newton's character), as if it has been poorly edited and some important scenes were removed by mistake. And I absolutely hate when it happens.<br /><br />So, notwithstanding good actors and some good moments (especially one really hilarious robbery), this film is definitely a lesser thing than previous British gangster movies by Guy Ritchie. Watchable of course, but do not get your hopes too high.get your hopes too high.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it, I hate it, it is everything that is reputed to be. Addicting as hell, it does help pass the time or, eat up the time if you will.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Like the game. Bright and colorfull. Really like the game so far. The graphics are pretty decent as well. Like to get ahead of the game, havnt had to buy anything.
B006GZ8OFQ|5.0|A great representation of the beginning of &#34;lurid&#34; fiction in a Victorian England. Well written, it holds up as a great novel, even today.
B001Q8FRNA|5.0|Holy balls - this is an amazing album!  I've been on a proto-punk binge and this band was recommended by a friend.  They've now been upgraded to Super Best Music-Loving Friend.
0140067477|5.0|This review is tied to the review I posted for &#34;The Te of Piglet&#34; (see that post for background.) The young man that suggested I read Piglet also recommended Pooh and I found both books on Amazon. Both books focus on Taoist teachings that make the oriental philosophy an easy read for anyone - young and old.<br /><br />As a enthusiast of Persian, Roman, Greek and oriental philosophies, I found more similarities between Lao-Tze and Plato’s writings than differences. In a few areas - they took diametrically opposed paths.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend this and Piglet because they're excellent guides to living our lives positively.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Typical Zynga game, still fun. Good use of a medieval setting,though characters are toon like and it does get repetitive

B0015DROBO|5.0|I found this to be one of the best novel's in resent thriller. The charter's so compelling I could not put this book down, It is a shame we have lost this author I love his style and charter's he created. I have read this book twice. and am sure I will read it many more times.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I really appreciate the context of Jesus' life being identified and explained.  This is the first book I have read that makes Jesus a real person in history.
0316055433|3.0|Author is a gargantuan talent, and the novel is an amazing achievement. As a reader, you must have a pretty strong stomach for suffering, including graphic descriptions of hard-core drug use. Though I cared deeply for the characters and respect the author's quest for meaning, I have to admit that I felt sucker-punched by the bleakness of the novel's vision.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Much better through Amazon than on cable--Can follow the story line better when you can watch back-to-back, and dont have to wait a week between episodes. Good story lines.
0140177396|2.0|The Good: The story is classic and the writing is easy to get though.<br /><br />The Bad: This was definitely the case of the movie being better than the book. I saw the Gary Sinise version in high school and I remember the visual portrayal being a lot more entertaining that the writing here. For a short book, not much happens and it what does happen is very slow paced.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty's first album is great.  I like the story telling in each song and the simple ballad like tunes . Scotty does well with Country.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|First of all, the use of time in the novel is unique, as the Eastern attitude towards time is so different from the Western.  Here past, present and future are all the same, going back 7000 years.  Second, the characters are compelling from Nabi to Pari.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|the sound of this group is enchanting. The vocals of Chloe and the ladies are great. I will keep buying as long as they keep singing.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The writing is transparent and the story lives on long after the last page.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Anything that Chloe and the girls do is wonderful. I love the simple songs and the complex arrangements of the others.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Early levels are fun but it doesn't stay that way. After a week of trying to work level 30, I've decided that frustrating isn't fun. It's ok if you want to pay, but not for people who want to pay instead of being able to solve on your own. I deleted it finally, and no more frustrating lack of fun.
B00902S0IS|5.0|The 1st really big color sci-fi movie. The acting is campy in parts, the special effects for the time are spectacular.!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is John Grisham at his best. Jake Brigance (A Time to Kill) is back 3 years later.<br />Once again--and the reason I like Grisham so well--is that I can't put the book down. I love that! No, I hate that--I don't get any work done. No, I love that!  Buy, read, share.
B0072NWKEC|4.0|I still find Kerr's Bernie among the best of the best when it comes to holding my interest for six books!  I am not sure whether I love the character or the author  or the duo, but I know that I have been more than satisfied with each of Bernie's exploits.  I hate to think his time will come to an end.  Bernie is no Superman.  However, he is so completely a decent human living in a vile period of history that to retain his moral core is extraordinary.  Kudos to Philip Kerr.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|The premise of this book sounds very intriguing.  Happily married for many years, Cecilia's perfect life is uprooted when she accidentally stumbles upon a sealed envelope on which her husband has written, \\"For my wife.  Open only in the event of my death.\\"  So I don't disagree with the thousands of readers who have purchased this book because they were dying to know what secret is enclosed in that envelope.<br /><br />What I do disagree with are those readers who feel that this book lived up to its potential.  It felt like the first half of the book was a series of redundant chapters teasing the reader with the inevitable unveiling of the husband's secret.  However, long before Cecilia opens that envelope, I easily guessed what the big secret was.  And, as it wasn't very well disguised, I am guessing that I wasn't the only one.<br /><br />In addition to disgustingly perfect Cecilia and her family, this book also follows the lives of two other women in the same town: Tess who is experiencing a marital crisis and Rachel who has never recovered from the murder of her daughter many years before.  While all three of these female characters are sympathetic, I found none of them particularly likeable or worth rooting for.<br /><br />While the first part of the book was intended to be one long, drawn-out, and ultimately ineffective tease, the second half proved to be a meandering let-down.  Once the secret is out of the envelope, there is really not much left to wonder about.  And I was particularly disappointed by the epilogue, which I found to be ridiculous . . . as well as a huge cop-out.  I feel that this this book was progressing in the wrong direction, starting with a big bang, followed by a long, slow fizzle, and ending with a thud.  The only reason I continued to read is because I was waiting for something to happen . . . I figured something of significance would eventually happen.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />I have intentionally not yet read any other reviews because I wanted to keep mine objective and free of influence from others.  But now this is finished, I am dying to read some reviews and try to figure out why others loved this book that I barely tolerated.ecause I wanted to keep mine objective and free of influence from others.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This was by far the best movie I've seen in a very long time!  Whoever gave this negative reviews have not experienced life of joy and sorrow to the fullest!
B0011UGLK6|3.0|You've read it before from Jhumpa...all her characters are brilliant...all of them can go to any ivy league school they choose...blah blah blah.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|This is an excellent performance by Rachel McAdams, and highlighted by Diane Keaton, and Harrison Ford. The interplay of all the actors is fabulous, and the dialogue is quick and original.
B000IYU9IG|4.0|This is the Authentic Collectors Edition, asin B000ANVPPQ. The faces seem to be a little light in color, but, really, it's not a bad copy. Worth the price.
0865478007|4.0|A very rewarding and absolutely necessary volume in the mainstream of psychopharmacological  critique, by a refined researcher in the field. Dr. Goldacre is never out of focus though militant and his voice is much appreciated also by psychiatrists and clinical psychologists who are dedicated to the use of drugs but want to know something more!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|Must have! You can play pretty much anything.And you can play wonderful classical music. You will not be dissapointed playing this!

1451695195|5.0|I have read this book and thoroughly enjoyed  reading about the out of body experience of the Neurosurgeon. Easy to understand for someone who does not understand medical terms.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The one l play on my laptop has more tiles so less likely to win as often.  Then again, l haven't tried the 'challenge' screens yet.  Worth .99 to play.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope you will too. I usually don't read these type of romance books  however I was pleasantly surprised that I thoroughly liked this book and recommend  it.
1600595871|5.0|Fabulous book for learning more binding techniques.  Instructions are clear and well written with pictures to assist in making.  A must have for a bookmaker who wants to expand their techniques.

B002QYNIHU|5.0|I wanted this figure so bad, unfortunately is not so easy to get this figure in Mexico, but I've always heard of the good reputation that Amazon has so i thought in give it a try, this is first time I buy a physical product online and on top of that for International shipping and I must say that Amazon didn't disappoint. I was supposed to receive the figure in 3 weeks but received it in 4 days, maybe I missed out some especial promotion or something? help here, but anyways, overall the package came in very good conditions.<br />About the figure I must say is amazing, however take into account that this figure is not a toy, it has very impressive articulation 2 extra pair of hands and one additional face, the only thing that this figure lacks is a happy face which is the regular mood of Goku. Can't wait for Majin Vegeta.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|The best show I've ever watch.  I was lost after watching the final show.  Couldn't find any thing to watch.  Until I found &#34;Dexter&#34;.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|When I picked up \\"A Time To Kill\\",I had no idea that I would read every book John Grisham wrote......he has such a way that involves you immediately and doesn't let you go until the last page has been read. I have loved all his books and especially this sequel of his first book....thank you John for all your hours spent and all the enjoyment you bring to your readers.........
B00GKUKKEU|3.0|Gave this presentation a 3 star.<br />a) There is absolutely nothing extra here from the NON steel book edition except the steel book<br />b) this Steelbook edition is actually the BestBuy exclusive...<br />c) 3 stars because despite the picture, the details card (that describes whats on which disc and the Audio Coding info, screen scope...you know, all the fine details you want to know about the discs... are just a non-clip on insert that only attaches to the tin when the pastic in on the case.  Once you take the plastic wrap off, it falls off.  its too big to put inside the Tin... unless you cut it up... so much for collector's value there.<br />If the Tin came with a slip case on back to insert it, i would have given this presentation a 4 star....<br />(that it presents nothing other than a steel case... well, i wouldn't give it extra stars for that.... the steelbook is a waste in my opinion, but there were not more copies of the extended edition 3D NON steelbook in all of bestbuy... so i was sold this steelbook edition at that reduced price... if they did not do this, i would certainly not have spent $70 for the steel book edition).
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|This is one of the few films I seem to be able to watch over and over, and with every change of the political landscape it still rings true.  An American classic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book had me guessing and questioning the characters. It made me mad in some places too!  I did not want to put it down.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|It was very well conceived and executed. Watched the movie one night and turned around and rewatched the next morning. Then stopped reading the book I was to read. I was not disappointed.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I was really enjoying this game, I had a dark rift dragon (level 10), a topaz dragon (also level 10), and many other dragons. But just today I started playing and all my data was gone. I was back to the tutorial with not one of my dragons. Can Backflip studios PLEASE get me Barack my data?
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This movie is truly a classic. Hilairious movie and a great soundtrack by Cat Stevens. As always, Amazon did a great job with delivery.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I had this game on my computer and I think this version is much more fun, more colorful, a lot more to do.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|The best yet! I love all the Crossroads videos. They're always the best collection of blues players gathered in one place. This one features so many of my favorite artists!!<br /><br />**TIP** I've seen several reviewers remark about the video quality on this Blu-Ray. There definitely is too much digital pattern noise in the shadow regions of the video. BUT if you can adjust your picture settings of your TV, set it to the &#34;Movie&#34; setting or any setting that lowers the black levels. That got rid of the issue for me and made the video a joy to watch!!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|This movie was very well made. It was sweet and funny, all rolled into one great movie. I simply loved it and almost teared up at the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. If they ever make another game this then I would be very very very happy. If sunny other company tries to make a similar game then they will fail! No joke!!!!!!!!<br />What now you other attempted company's everyone has to love this game!
B0091THDOM|5.0|Excellent and useful case that is one of the best I've ever had. I love this case!!! Classy, small and protective.

B00F91RYL8|3.0|...but that's all. Skip this and see a true modern terror classic. It seems that someone was merely trying to cash in. greedy Hollywood scum.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great Movie.  The original singing 10th anniversary is the best but you will appreciate the movie it is great.  To see Crow singing I was shocked.  It was great.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Great book! I really enjoyed reading it. It made me feel more secure and less self-conscious about a lot of things. Being a mother is actually difficult and we do need a 'hall pass' once in a while. Great tips about child raising. Very educating book. I´ll definitelly read it again many times.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I use this app all the time.  It's great and easy to use!  I don't think I'd change a thing.
B007N31YFW|5.0|This is a great film, especially if you are a musician.  It has a very unusual story-line and the characters are captivating.  Swedish film with subtitles.
B00915G6MG|4.0|The big story of the summer for this series, as many of us know, was Cote De Pablo's planned departure from the series after the first two episodes of Season 11.  This left me watching Season 10 suspecting that Shane Brennan and Gary Glassberg worked the season at least suspecting Cote was leaving, and writing the second half of the season working to set up closure with Ziva.<br />  Having said that, I found Season 10 to be up to the usual high standards this series continually gives.  At this point, dealing with \\"The Body Of The Week\\" part of the story has become secondary to the doings in the MTAC and between the team.  The interaction between the team and those around it has always been the hallmark of the series, and continued to be in this season.  The cast, as always, were great; and the \\"visits\\"--Diane Neal's Abagail Borin, Joe Spano's Tobias Fornell--were at their usual high standards.<br />  This season began wrapping up the \\"Harper Deering\\" story, followed by Navy Yard bombing's aftermath--Abby being unable to sleep, Ducky fighting to get back to work following his heart attack...in the first half of the season, the episodes that stick out are \\"Lost At Sea\\"--where Neal's CGIS Special Agent Borin and the team investigate a downed helicopter and the murdered pilot of the chopper; the two-parter \\"Shell-Shock\\", where a Marine suffering from PTSD witnesses the kidnapping/murder of a fellow Marine (Or does he??!?) and Gibbs has to help him sort out what he saw and what he didn't;<br />\\"Devil's Trifecta\\", in which Melinda McGraw returns as the ex-wife of both Fornell and Jethro.  McGraw is magnificent as Diane Gibbs Fornell Sterling--she isn't in the best of moods when she pops up, and the aftermath of Tim McGee having to be her bodyguard one night...and the looks on the faces of Gibbs and Fornell (To say NOTHING of Tobias' reaction) may be one of the funniest moments this series has EVER had.  Robert Wagner comes back as Anthony DiNozzo Sr. for \\"You Better WatchOut\\", and for the first time, the series goes inside of Tony the Younger's apartment.  The episode that most sticks out in the first half of the season is \\"The Namesake\\".  This is a brilliant and touching episode, bringing back Ralph Waite as Jackson Gibbs and introducing Billy Dee Williams as Leroy Jethro Moore, the man Gibbs was named for.  It's an episode that deals with the estrangement between Gibbs's father and Jethro the Elder...and Gibbs' mother, who both men loved.  A strong episode, dealing with two old men's pride and stubborness.<br />  The season flipped with it's SECOND two-parter--\\"Shalom Shabbat\\" and \\"Shiva\\".  Michael Nouri makes his final appearance as Ziva's father, the Mossad spymaster Eli David; Paula Newsome makes her final appearance as Jackie Vance, Leon Vance's wife.  Obviously, this is where I began to suspect--upon a second viewing of the season--that Brennan and Glassberg were writing an exit strategy for Ziva; but as the second half of the season progressed, Rocky Carroll's Leon Vance had to adjust to being a widower...but also came to understand Gibbs more, especially when it came to Jethro's avenging of Shannon and Kelly.  For Carroll, the second half of the season was an evolving performance that was done well.  Cote was very, VERY good in the back half--Ziva NEVER lost her focus at work, but was working off the books to pursue (And yes, KILL) Ilan Bodnar.  That second half of the season seemed a stark contrast to Season 1 after \\"Bete Noire\\"--remember Gibbs' workstation running facial recognition on the photo of Ari until the end of the season??!?  Notable in the second half are \\"Detour\\", where Mallard and Palmer are kidnapped with a body they were taking back to MTAC and have to work to plan an escape, and \\"Squall\\", in which we meet McGee's father--an Admiral in the Navy--and see the strain in their relationship (Note: Sean Murray has had a lot of fun in dealing with Tim's various family issues--in my review of Season 9, I forgot totalk about \\"The Penelope Papers\\", and how great Lily Tomlin was as Tim's grandmother).<br />  The season's last two episodes actually come after Ziva has avenged both her father's murder and Jackie Vance's murder (The episode--major surprise--is named \\"Revenge\\"), and again, really seem to have been plotted out with the option of Ziva leaving the MTAC.  Colin Hanks' Richard Parsons, the Inspector General investigator, seems to question whether Gibbs is leading a team that \\"has a lot of red on their ledger\\" (Avengers' line, I know...), and focuses on Gibbs--again, going back to this series go-to story, Jethro sniping Pablo Hernandez all those years ago.  The season finale is unique--Muse Watson returns, so we get Mike Franks as spirit guide again.  But the shock here is John M. Jackson dusting off A.J. Chegwidden from \\"JAG\\".  It's a great return, somewhat surprising--of course, some probably were thinking \\"Chegwidden??!?  They couldn't have gotten Harm or Mac??!?\\"  Then again, Jackson's return could be just a start of Brennan going full circle...<br />  This was a season that got angry after the deaths of Eli and Jackie.  The usual lightness that sometimes is part and parcel of this series was shadowed by knowing that Ziva was on the hunt for Ilan, and KNOWING what she was going to do to Bodnar when she caught up to him.  Again, in viewing the season again after the summer, I just was left feeling the showrunners knew Cote was more likely to NOT come back.<br />  Highly recommended.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|One of my favorite books faithfully rendered in the film. Redmayne is particularly good as Angel Clare. That Stonehenge ending always gets me.
B009HSUTB6|5.0|This deluxe edition 3 disc set with live and remastered tracks  will not disappoint any Peter Gabriel fan.  I doubt if Peter's music will ever go out of style.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Wow...I can't believe I never watched this series until after the finale.  I just finished this first season DVD and it is just...wow.  I'm totally addicted.  The story line is compelling and the acting is outstanding.  I seriously can't wait until I can start on Season two!
0500515328|5.0|Jewels are reproduced in their actual size, paintings or photographs show them worn by the Romanovs, text informs historical circumstances, all in all one gets a vivid picture of that splendid Court.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|An enjoyable read. Alone the same lines as the Fifty Shades trilogy but better written. I enjoy the first two books in those trilogy, I was a little bored & had my fill of their messy relationship by the third book.
B00005J9PB|1.0|it's in a format I can't even watch because apparently its a bootleg from europe... money wasted! SO DISAPPOINTED NOT TO BE ABLE TO WATCH A MOVIE I LOVE.
B007RFJ4QM|2.0|Entertaining,in a light way.  The script and some of the scenes seemed below the caliber of some of the actors in the film.
B0086700CM|2.0|Frustrated with the lack of instructions especially since this was the first time I ever ventured out of my comfort zone to try something new.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is a fun and easy game. Enjoy it greatly :)  The controls are simple tap and fire and the direction are nice and clear.
0385537131|4.0|another great john grisham book. great writing that just flows. he tells a wonderful story. the ending is not unexpected.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book is the best book in the world.....!!!!!XDjust the right amount of romance,comedy,action,and i can REALLY relate to katniss when she says gamemakers are only distractions from the food
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|a typical james bond movie. several attractive women, unrealistic combat, and an unrealistic ending. Daniel craig is okay. judi dench is great.
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Each and Every time I hear a new album from AFI it draws me in more musically intricate and lyrically brilliant.
0060853972|4.0|Good Omens is by far my favorite book ever, but I was hoping to get the white version depicted since my last copy (now lost, sadly) was the black one...
B008ETOSYI|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks for one. The Notebook is in my top 10 films.  And I admire the bright bright galaxy that is Taylor Schilling.  It's on the inside as much as the outside.  Looking forward to watching her bring home Oscar one day.  Meryl Streep like in her ability to convey a bajillion emotions in that beautiful face.  Follow her work folks.  It is truly inspired work.  You will be glad you did. #lucero
B0026OE2O8|4.0|A must have in blu-ray, just lay on your sofa and enjoy sceneries you never thought exists on planet earth. And you can see how we humans are destroying the beauty of our planet.
B00E9ZATJO|1.0|I was anxious to see it bc the first one was so good.  This one was the stupidest movie I've seen in a LONG time!  It drug on and on.  I hung on to the bitter end.  It was awful.  Sorry!
B001XCWPAM|4.0|Great package for the trilogy, once you start with the &#34;Identity&#34; you will not stop until you finish the remaining two.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Arguably the best series of the 21st century season 2 doesn't disappoint. The acting, writing, and gorgeous costumes make everyone wish they could visit with Lord Grantham and his family.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Loved it and couldn't put it down. However, I was looking for a little more in the ending.  I thought it played well with the characters from a Time to Kill.  I hope he continues with the Jake Brigance character.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I did not like this book. The characters are cliches at best. The writing is horrendous. I know people get caught up with all of the sex, but for me it wasn't enough to overlook the terrible writing and predictable plot line. It may be the worst book I've ever read.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This movie is extraordinary. The director can be admired for the gentle exposure of a most touching subject. Helen Fox is a very brave woman to act the part of a sex therapist with so much confidence. The acting of the other parts is also unbelievably realistic. It provides a great experience to watch it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This fast paced book takes you in a roller coaster ride that is both exhilarating and disturbing. A great read!
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I'm  hooked on g5 adventure games and this was the best yet! excellent graphics and interesting plot.easy instructions to follow and I liked the twist at the end! am looking forward to seguel.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you're looking to laugh out loud this is the perfect book! Tina Fey is hilarious as she tells the story of her life. An easy fun read!
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|A rather disappointing ending to a well constructed saga. The buildup of characters that end up playing such a minor role at the end, the arbitrary deaths and survivals with no apparent meaning for this...
B00B7Y0206|2.0|it would not download. I tried it three times on my kindle fire. I am so disappointed. I wish it would work. BOO!!
142314189X|5.0|Great reading.  My son and I are having a great time reading together.  My son is 8.  However, I think this is wonder for all ages of reading.
B00C04H2VO|5.0|Excellent packing, no damage on arrival at all.<br />Nicely detailed figures made from strong somewhat flexible material!<br />Small note: figures aren't all in the same scale.
B00368CZN8|5.0|This is one of those movies that will probably not appeal to the general masses. This movie can be hard to find un the United States. I don't think it was ever released here until recently and that was only in a small number of theaters. They make the DVDs available in Region 1 but I haven't seen any Blu-rays that can be played in the US. This was added to my collection of little-known movies that deeply touch me; another hidden gem of sorts. This movie can be seen as a Drama love story that jumps around a lot. You must pay attention to fully grasp what's going on. This movie is thought provoking and can make you feel like some things are left unanswered. To me, it is all about the experience and the idea rather than a start to finish story. I love the way it is put together. It is unique and refreshing. It is a deep and artistic movie about possibilities in our lives, the decisions we make and the effects. Do you realize how different your life could be if you had only changed one little thing in the past? I'm sure everyone has had those seemingly insignificant points in their lives that actually could have completely changed the course. Everything we've done in our lives, no matter how insignificant we may think it was has brought us to this moment. Emerging out of endless possibilities, each of us is very unique. For Nemo (Jared Leto) some things seem to go solely by chance while others seem like they are tied to him by fate. This movie is similar to The Butterfly Effect (2004) in that it portrays different paths through life based on decisions and tiny changes.  Other than that, the two movies are very different. This movie has soul and can touch some of you.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a rather sad story about young people with cancer.  I had to read it for a Book Club, otherwise I don't think I would have chosen it.
