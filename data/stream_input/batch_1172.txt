B0034G4ORC|4.0|As a former Marine, they got allot right in terms of the look/feel/tactics.  The characters lacked some of the inherent \\"grunt\\" personality that USMC infantrymen have, but that's not too surprising.  The movie has big expectations beyond merely an action movie and it falls a little flat when it attempts to be more, but the attempt at pulling heart strings comes off as honest which makes the movie more endearing.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|(Droid X) There's lots of variety, humor and gameplay value.  Zombies are comical, not overly gross.  They lose an arm, their head pops off when the final pea, or cabbage, or watermelon defeats them.  Not terribly difficult, but enough of a challenge to keep you engaged.  Play the flash version online to see if you like it.
B004132HZS|5.0|As a lifelong Sherlockian, I was more than a little skeptical when I first heard about this new Holmes series. I was afraid it would be more like Guy Ritchie's movie than like the classic Jeremy Brett shows. I could NOT have been more wrong! What I found most delightful about the shows is that while they would all be very enjoyable for someone who was not particularly familiar with the canon, there were multiple references that would be VERY familiar to those who have read all of the stories.    As an example: in the original stories, Holmes often spoke of a \\"three pipe\\" problem that he had to consider. In this series, Holmes used three nicotine patches instead - a charming update!    And of course, having Watson be a blogger instead of someone writing stories for the newspapers or magazines was a great touch.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|Good movies captivate me, making me forget what day and time it is, what I have to do later on, and just take me away for the few hours I am sitting in front of my excellently large flat screen tv. This was not the case with Sucker Punch.<br />My boyfriend and I were very excited to see this. Thinking that we had saved money by not going to see it in the theaters, I went out on a limb and bought this Blu-ray the day it was released. So last night we sat down and watched it... all 2+ hours of the Extended Cut.<br />I agree with the critics. It seems like three or four different movies put together. I caught myself several times looking at the clock to see what time it was or scowling at the tv! My boyfriend, who loves a lot of movies (more movies than me!) gives a C- on his grading scale. I give it a C+, for effort, makeup and costuming, and the action scenes.

B003YFIUW8|2.0|This is not a review, but a comment about the pricing for the books. Today I can buy this book (paperback) for $8.99 or buy the Kindle version for $9.99. That makes no sense. I see that the publisher set the price for the Kindle version, so perhaps this is an oversight not reflected in the reduction of the price of the other books. But if not ...
B004G600A4|5.0|My Family and I had just watched this movie recently. it's an awesome movie. It has a great storyline, music, and beautiful story. So, please watch this film.
0385335997|5.0|This series is one of the best ever.. You need to read or listen to all of them.  I loved the audio because the narrator Divina Porter makes all the characters come alive. And she doesn't have a problem speaking Gaelic. You will fall in love with Scotland, Jamie and Clare. You will time travel with this series. Its a great adventure. :-)
B00127RAJY|5.0|Not going to repeat what others have said about how great this is - but if I am on Day 5 (I am a total slug, and that is being kind) this is like magic.  Hence the 5 stars.  You WILL be able to do it without stopping, eventually. But THANK YOU to the reviewers who warned about bouncing and the knees, I did maybe 25% of the actual moves the first day and ran around my apartment for the jumping part.  I am not a small person, that is a lot of stress for untrained knees. My knee did hurt a little even doing 25% so now no big bouncing until I strengthen my knees with other exercises. If I didn't take it \\"easy\\" (HA!) I probably would have hurt myself. Also with the back/abs, I did more planks instead.  And yup those push ups are really good for abs too.  But my knee might also be due to form, I wish I had a mirror to check...every time she tells you to check for form, I am doing it wrong.  Sigh.  I also stretch for a good 5 minutes before, more advice from other reviewers that I know helped me not to get injured.  So thanks and good luck to you!
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|For Sex and the City show fans, this movie is good because we get more from our favorite characters, but it's not as good as the first movie.
B000XAR2EE|5.0|If Raiders was action-packed and Temple of Doom was scary, [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]] is hilarious. It takes the original Indiana Jones formula and treats it irreverently. That's the genius of this film. Sean Connery as Indy's dad was brilliant casting. Having the former James Bond try to overshadow and outdo the son makes for both funny and emotionally touching moments.     The other characters stand out as well. The new Indy girl, Dr. Elsa Schneider (Allison Doody) is both gorgeous and very complex. One is never sure of her loyalties, making her one of my favorite Indy girls of the entire series. Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot) was briefly seen in the first movie but now has a more prominent part as almost a source of comedic relief. Some of the best moments are his attempts to cope with Indy's adventure. Only Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), the expedition's funder, comes off as boring or less than meets the eye.    Aside from the humor, it's the moving father-son relationship that between Henry and Indiana Jones that really makes this fun to watch. Unlike Crystal Skull, which overdid the \\"lost son\\" angle, Last Crusade pulled just the right amount on the emotional chords. The two have a competitive relationship, but it never becomes melodramatic. The end is particularly poignant.    Aside from Raiders, this is easily the best of the Indiana Jones series, and definitely the funniest.
0142000655|5.0|This is such a special story, one that I never get sick of reading. Steinbeck paints such a vivid picture of the characters that I actually became attached to them. Of all the stories I have read I have never become so distraught at the death of certain characters as I have with this book. The characters are so life-like and you are sure to be able to relate with them, and even know people like them (especially Cathy). Please read this classic, if you do you the characters will become old friends (and enemies) of yours and it will seem as if you are part of their family.
B0042SSO1I|5.0|I like the new spin on an old legend. There is good acting, great special effects for a series like this and a good balance during the series between humor, tension and pacing. The development of the relationship between characters has gone well during the first three seasons. If you like a re-start on the Arthur legend with some interesting twists this is a fun series to have.
0743297334|5.0|Such a great story, and a truly amazing read. When you read the story you feel as if you are sitting beside Jake and his friends(?) at one of the many cafés they visit. I wish I could give it six stars. I cannot imagine how anyone can give this book a bad rating. It is a wonderful example of the Café Society of the 1920's.
B000001FK3|5.0|I discovered JJ Cale the way someone of my generation (\\"X\\") usually does - by reading about him repeatedly as being the influence for bigger-name musicians.  This was the first collection of his that I bought, years ago, at an independent record store.  The picture of the well-dressed raccoon on the cover was enough to get me curious.  The album sounds very much like the cover would imply: down-home.  Instead of country twang, however, the music is more \\"swampy,\\" with Cale's relaxed vocal approach taking the lead on the fairly minimalistic and finely-crafted tunes.  This is music which sounds very, very honest.  It's not well-recorded by any means, lo-fi long before the term came & went as jargon for 90s indie rock. Without any studio trickery to cover up the warts, the music stands on the strength of the songs themselves which at their best are absolutely captivating.  How Cale does so much with so little is pretty amazing.  The man truly is a unique talent, and after a few spins of this disc it is very easy to see why he influenced so many others.  If there is such a thing as \\"timeless\\" music which sounds as good now as when it was recorded (if not better) this would be it.  A must-have for anyone who likes well-written front-porch swamp rock.
B0050PYNOY|4.0|I'm very conservative and a mom, so for this movie I put all those thoughts aside and just enjoyed the film. I laughed my butt off! I would never go around swearing or doing crude things and I don't condone anyone who does...but this is a movie, and a dumb one at that. That's the point, its supposed to be dumb. I don't understand the bad reviews. If you know its going to be a disgusting movie based on other reviews, not to mention the rating advisory, then why give it a bad review for being disgusting?     I found myself chuckling for hours afterword. There is something about the way McBride says the F word (and he said it a lot) that makes me giggle every time. Portman was wonderful! She is so serious and believable, completely out of place with everyone else and yet it works so well. The special effects and action were actually great, much better then I expected. Not only is it funny but with all the action its not boring either. I have no idea how the cast made it though this one with a straight face. Too funny!

B000HKWCOA|5.0|Enterprise is the best Star Trek series, period.    Having watched and loved the original as a kid in the 80s I thought I had merely grown out of the genre when I tried to watch modern attempts at it.  But now that I've seen Enterprise I realize it was just that all the attempts in between were horribly childish.    Enterprise, however, is well written, well acted, has great action and grown-up inventive story-lines that carry you from episode to episode.  I just regret is not watching it when it was still on the air, not imagining that I could enjoy the genre again.    Enterprise is Star Trek for adults.  It's like having new episodes of the Original after 50 years.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Awesome book! You won't be disappointed. I couldn't put it down. Every time I got an extra second in my day, I was dying to read what was about to happen next! I thought for sure I could see the outcome of this book, which changed ever so often, and I was proven wrong. The very last few pages and scenario were the only things that I felt were a little disappointing. Felt kind of rushed, but it was nothing to discredit the whole book in its entirety! Great work!
0811875040|5.0|I own over 150 cookbooks (I'm a food anthropologist... don't judge!!) but have only ever written one previous review, and that was to voice my great disappointment with a particular candy cookbook that purported all-inclusiveness but did not carry a recipe for fondant. However, I have been galvanized out of my review-writing inertia by this fabulous piece. It is aesthetically pleasing in that sort of hyper-managed faux-casual way, replete with meticulously crafted swirls of icing and painstakingly disordered arrangements of cookies. Oftentimes this stylistic approach falls flat when food stylists don't have the skills to fully veil that craftedness with the appearance of effortless beauty, but not in the case of Miette. I can only describe the aesthetic as casually perfect and perfectly casual.     I see that some have taken issue with a few recipe errors, but it seems like for the most part they can be circumscribed with a little common sense. Personally I had a fantastic experience baking the thumbprint cookies, in which I substituted cake flour for the all-purpose (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons cf per cup ap), divided the dough into two parts and added lime juice and orange zest to one and grated baker's chocolate to the other. I paired the citrus cookies with a dark plum preserve and the chocolate ones with a brighter apricot preserve. They came out beautifully and were a big hit at dinner. Looking forward to exploring some of those cakes and also the delicious looking marshmallows.    Highly recommended!

B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love this game. It's simple, well-paced, and very addictive. The problem here is that the adaptation from iOS didn't work out very well. There aren't any bugs or glitches that I noticed, but it sites nothing to take advantage of Android. Loading takes forever and the graphics are scaled up from what looks like iPhone 3G resolution. If you try to switch to another application and back, you'll face another really long loading screen. This is clearly a hold-over from some other operating a system with lousy multi tasking support. It also takes up way too much disk space, even when installed to the SD card.<br />I love this game, but ended up uninstalling it because of all the frustrations.

B00127R7JM|5.0|The former front man of legendary black metal artisans Emperor offers his second solo installment in a much varied musical tapestry.  From the dark crunching maelstrom of jagged hooks in the trademark metal vein for which Ihsahn is well respected for, there's still a real sense of moderation throughout most of the songs. \\"Angl\\" blends in influences of metal & progressive rock as well as aspects of neo classical music which no doubt assists in the albums smooth & unpredictable flow which might attract a wider audience not already familiar with his work. Ihsahn is definitely not rehashing anything from his past efforts & that alone is a much welcome breath of fresh air & worth some unearthing.
B004I11VZ0|5.0|I'll start off by admitting that I'm both a huge kung fu movie fan AND a huge Donnie Yen fan, so I may not be the most unbiased person in the world.  Having said that, Ip Man 2 is probably the best martial arts movie I've seen since the last Ip Man came out.      The action scenes are nothing short of spectacular.  Donnie Yen and Sammo Hung demonstrate how they got where they are today.  The choreography was extremely well done.  The story is fantastic (though it is, at least partially, based on the real life of Ip Man).  The acting was quite good for a Kung Fu movie (I would personally say it was just good period).  The subtitles were probably the only weak point here - they suffered the same fate as all subtitled movies: strange/random misspellings.  Thankfully, there were fairly few of those.    The sound and picture quality were excellent, and I didnt have any issues with artifacting (a not uncommon issue on blu-ray releases of Martial Arts mmovies).    Definitely recommended, and an absolute must-have if you enjoyed the first one.
0061251321|5.0|Think of your job.  Now, pick one of the following:  \\"Life sucks\\"; \\"My life sucks\\"; \\"I'm great\\"; \\"We're great\\"; or, \\"Life is great\\".      Next, read Tribal Leadership by Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright.  The authors focused their ten-year research on the language we use at work and the relationships we have there.  Those five phrases at the start of this article are the basis for the five tribal stages they developed to summarize business cultures.    As the stages change, collaboration, communication, and structure change.  A culture of dyadic (\\"two-person\\") relationships is reflective of companies in Stage Three; while a triad (\\"value-based\\") relationship firm will be in Stage Four.  Stage Three is the \\"I'm great(and you're not)\\" culture; and Stage Four is \\"We're great\\".  There is a big, big difference between I and we.    This is not your father's business book.  It is not filled with numbers and lists and graphs and bullet points.  No quants here!  Instead, the authors dissect what we say at work and how we behave(That is more important than most of us want to admit). They help us understand why our company is where it is culturally; and they give us tools to graduate to higher stages.    Tribal Leadership will alter your perception of yourself and your company.  You will discover that it is not something you can fix with a coat of paint or moving into a nice shiny new building.  It is much deeper than that.      It is about core values, having a noble cause, and experiencing a tribal leadership epiphany.    I suggest you pick up the paperback version of Tribal Leadership.  The Afterword, all of six pages, is a powerful look-back by the authors after their hard cover version was published.    Note:  a copy of Tribal Leadership was sent to me to write this piece.

1591844096|5.0|Seth Godin wrote \\"Linchpin\\".  You may have read \\"Purple Cow\\", \\"The Dip\\", or \\"Tribes\\".  I haven't; but, now I will.  I like Seth's perspective of the 21st Century business world.  There's management, labor, and linchpins.    Linchpins are game changers, connectors, creators, inventors, and challengers.  They are not the rock stars or the automatons; but they make stuff happen--most of the time behind the scenes, without fanfare.  Linchpins arrange uniquely, lead by inspiration, possess domain knowledge, and ship on time.    Most of the time, their value is not truly measured--or missed--until they are gone.      Who is a linchpin in your organization?  Can you indentify a linchpin?  Can you think of someone in your career whose departure created a big hole that was never filled--or a little hole that had to be boarded up and ignored?      Who is a giver who has the character to be satisfied with the notion of a gift?  That may be a linchpin.  That may be you.

0385528752|5.0|We all want to change things.  We all have history of attempting to invoke change; but, for one reason or another, we were not able to pull it off.    If change was easy, we would be doing it all the time with great results.  It's not.  Authors Chip Heath and Dan Heath, brothers, take on this compelling topic \\"at every level--individual, organizational, and societal\\".        What I like about \\"Switch\\" is how the Heath brothers framed their book into three elements:  The Rider, The Elephant, and The Path.  Each one of these elements makes change a challenge, and, to Heaths' benefit, they don't try to sell snake oil.  They admit early on that their approach is flawed and can easily be defeated.  Their goal is to provide a system to make change \\"easier\\".    \\"Switch\\" is more than a book; it's a behavioral process with a roadmap.  This is a valuable tool in the realm of finance and accounting, where routine is embedded--and change is resisted.

Authors Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson are founders of 37signals, a software company based in Chicago.  They started their blog the year they launched their company--1999!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Harry Potter series?  Loved it.  Twilight saga?  Certainly a fan.  Teen/young adult fiction has certainly come a long way since my late childhood of Fear Street and Babysitters Club books.  I think that this genre has really taken off in a way that has inspired far more teens to read than ever before.  And for that alone, I will be forever thankful.      However, I feel that while I loved Harry Potter and Twilight, I did wish an author would come in and write something a bit less fantasy and more thought provoking.  Sure, The Hunger Games has an element of Sci-fi seeing as it's so far in the future, but the core theme of survival really dominates the bulk of this book.  And I'm not just talking about in the actual Hunger Games but also in their daily lives -- in the Seam, for example.  If you took away the technology of the Capitol, District Twelve could be compared to POW camps of our world's messy history.  I truly appreciated the parallels.  I look forward to the time when my son (who is far too young for the series now) reads these books.  I will certainly take the opportunity to highlight the cultural and historical lessons this brings up.

0439023513|4.0|This is a good book.  A lot of people were disappointed by it, and maybe knowing that lowered my expectations going in.  But when I read it for myself, I discovered that it really is on the same level as the other two books in the series.  Everything you loved from the first two books is here: the brutal world, the violent action, the romance, the tragedy, and most of all, the fierce heroine of the story, Katniss.  She's been aflame for two novels, and here she gets to burn brighter than ever before, even as the story goes to a darker place than we've seen yet.<br /><br />Not everything comes out right for everyone.  I don't think I'm spoiling anything for you by telling you this, since I feel that has been the standard from book one, and if you've gotten this far then you should already know it.  Like the first two, the story doesn't pull any punches.  Not everyone makes it, and those who do aren't by any means unscathed.  But that's what we expected.  It's what we wanted: the most dangerous game.<br /><br />The ending satisfies.  Everything is resolved: the love triangle between Katniss and the two guys in her life, the conflict between the Capitol and the rebels, and Katniss' own Hero's Journey.  I won't tell you it's perfect, but it works, and it works well.  This is a solid book, and a great close to the series.  I personally think that some of the criticism of it has been unfair.  This is by no means the weakest part of the trilogy.<br /><br />Everyone who loved the first two books will want to read this, and I think it closes the series well.<br /><br />Now, to fully explain my review of the book I have to address a few important scenes from the story, so if you haven't read the book (which I do recommend), then you should really stop reading now, because the rest of the review will spoil the ending for you.<br /><br />*MAJOR PLOT/ENDING SPOILERS FOLLOW*<br /><br />When I first finished the book, there was a particular scene that seemed to ruin everything for me.  I'm speaking about the scene where Katniss votes to have a final Hunger Games with Capitol children to satisfy the rebels and make peace.  \\"How, after everything that happened, could she do that?\\" I asked myself.  Honestly, I closed the book with disgust.  It took a lot of thinking about it to reach the decision to like the scene.  Now, a lot of people believe that she only went along with the vote to get her shot at Coin, and really put an end to the evil of the Hunger Games once and for all.  I believe that too.  The problem I have with the scene is that the author doesn't tell you if that is the case or not.  That annoyed me.  A lot.  When I first read it, fresh from Katniss losing her mind after Prim's death, I completely believed that she was damaged enough to want another Hunger Games.  After three books of being inside her head, the author leaves it up to you to decide what her intentions are.  And that's when I realized that that scene might actually be brilliant.  Katniss thinks, \\"This is the moment, then.  When we find out exactly just how alike we are, and how much he truly understands me.\\"  And in a way, this scene is Collins saying to the reader that it's up to us to decide whether she has fallen to the point where she can condone the murder of her enemies' children or not.  As for me, I read the scene one way the first time, another the next.  I think I know how it went down now, but I can't say I'm one hundred percent sure.  The thing you are going to have to decide is whether that ambiguity is a mistake on the part of the author, and she should have told us what Katniss wanted, and were there actually another Hunger Games or not (the book doesn't say, but Plutarch does say that the world is \\"in that sweet period where everyone agrees that our recent horrors should never be repeated\\").  This review, and my final score of the book, is based on my belief that holding that back from the audience and letting the readers decide how well they know Katwas a brilliant move on the author's part.<br /><br />Now, about the death of Prim.  Some people have a problem with the scene because it is unnecessary.  We've already lost enough people to give the readers a sense of danger, and didn't Rue's death in book one serve the same emotional purpose for Katniss?  I disagree.  Everything Katniss had ever gone through in all three books had spun out of her trying to save Prim that day.  Losing her sister was the most devastating blow the author could have given her, and absolutely necessary to bring her to the place where we might believe she would vote for another Hunger Games.  She says \\"I vote yes...for Prim.\\"  Prim's death is what made her wake up to the evils being done by her side of the war.  Rue's death belongs to the Capitol, Prim's to the rebels.  It made the hell of war universal.

I'm glad she chose Peeta, and for the right reasons (though the scene where she confronts Gale is very sad).  I can't say I'm fond of love triangles in storytelling, but the romance in the Hunger Games books is really a mirror into Kat's soul.  The scene where the boys talk about how Kat will choose between them is perfect.  I love how the author doesn't try to refute their reasoning in Kat's final choice.  She does exactly as Gale said she would, and chooses the boy she can't survive without.  The epilogue is a little unnecessary, but still important.  Collins doesn't leave Kat's future up our imaginations.  She used ambiguity as a storytelling device when it was appropriate, but here she tells us exactly what happened, leaving nothing to chance.

At the close of such a bleak and violent series, this was as perfect an ending as anyone could have hoped for our heroine.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a great book.  It's not a perfect book, but it ends the series well.  As series endings go, I believe it is superior to Suzanne Collins' Underland Chronicles.  Recommended to everyone who read the first two books.<br /><br />Final Grade: BNow, about the death of Prim.  Some people have a problem with the scene because it is unnecessary.  We've already lost enough people to give the readers a sense of danger, and didn't Rue's death in book one serve the same emotional purpose for Katniss?  I disagree.

B002SJKWZ4|5.0|Really works just as advertised.  Even better, all the feedback from the unit is done by haptic (touch) means - it's quite unearthly when you use the left and right twist for volume.    It's also quite handsome and comes in a very nice black box.    Highly recommended!
B004SKIPXW|5.0|If you are looking for an Oscar winning movie, this is not it.  Do not buy this movie if you are looking for a wholesome movie.  If you are looking for an action packed movie with car chases, shootouts, blood, guts, sex, nudity, and everyone in the movie has a middle finger attitude; then this is the movie for you.  I think the people that rated this movie low were thinking it said Drive Happy or Driving Miss Daisy 2.  The movie also great special effects and very good detail in all the scenes.
0756404738|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is one of the best writers working today. His characters are vivid, his story within a story is fascinating, and this 2nd book in the series is even better than the first. He frequently writes several pages of iambic pentameter and rhymed verses at a time, cleverly slipped into what appear to be prose passages, so you'll be reading along and suddenly stop and say, \\"wow, that was brilliant!\\" (or \\"beautiful!\\") and you'll stop and go back, just to savor the sweet words of wisdom that slip from this bard's tongue. And now, by the 2nd book, we're beginning to get a better sense of the over-arching story line, which is being revealed through the story-line within a story-line. Sounds more complex than it is, but the good news is, from beginning to end, this is a fast and entertaining read I recommend to all SF & Fantasy fans. I p-put this right up beside Jim Butcher's recent Fury series. (Butler is another terrific writer, if you haven't discovered him yet.)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I think that my kindle has officially melded to my hands last night.  This was an AMAZING book!  I haven't been this apt to keep reading since Twilight!  I read straight through the book in half a day.  I was up till the wee hours of the morning with my cell phone for a light finishing the last 50 pages.  If you are at least 17 or 18 then pick up this book and devour it like me!  Just beware not to have anything planned that day because you wont be able to put it down!  I plan on writing my official review on my website soon:  [...]  Happy Reading!
1594202842|5.0|This book is incredible.  In succinct form, it outlines a style of parenting designed to make your child reach their fullest potential.      For instance, the author tells a story in which, as a child, she won an academic award.  However, since it was not the 1st place award, her father said, \\"Never disgrace me like that again.\\"  Wonderful!  I have already started to use this parenting style with my five year old.  The other day she brought me a finger painting she did.  Rather than congratulate her, I held it in juxtaposition to a high-res print of Titian's \\"Annunciation.\\"  Her work was clearly inferior, so I burnt it and grounded her.      More recently, she recited her multiplication tables up to \\"six times six.\\"  I almost gave in to my 'western' instinct to clap and say \\"good job,\\" but then I read that Gauss was only five when he discovered the closed form for the sum of the first n integers, which is a tool still used in college-level calculus today.  I remembered the book, and grounded her for several weeks for disgracing me.      Thanks to this book, my daughter now spends all her time in her room studying (although I do hear some muffled weeping from time to time).  Oxford, here she comes!
B004JK61K0|5.0|Great! A mail app that works. Simple easy to use. Allows me to review email on the go and see all of my folders. App runs on LG G2x without problems. I would only add one thing: a new account option that lets me copy the config of another K-9 account as the starting point for setup (I have several email accounts on the same provider).

B001O54NKS|4.0|Released in 1985, Under Lock and Key is Dokken's third album and marked a bit of a change of sound as it's not as heavy and raw as the band's previous album, Tooth and Nail (1984), or even its follow up Back For The Attack (1987). This one goes for a more polished and melodic approach that was popular during that decade but is overall just as good of an album, if not better than its predecessor. The band was obviously aiming at the charts with this release as they went towards a more commercial way. Under lock and Key features Dokken at it's as its best with some highly melodic and fun rocking songs that proves why Dokken is one of the better Hair/Glam-Metal bands. Dokken released some excellent albums in the 1980's and to me Under Lock and Key is perhaps their very best, it captures the band at its brightest moment. Don's voice is at its best here and sounds amazing; I really feel that he does some of his best singing on this album. As always we are treated to some very skillful guitar work by George Lynch who proves himself once more. Not to be forgotten, bassist Jeff Pilson and drummer Mick Brown also provide a strong and tight rhythm section.<br /><br />Unchain The Night opens the album very well, it's a good rocker with a memorable chorus. I just love Don Dokken's screams towards the end, Don sounds excellent here and his voice is terrific. The Hunter is one of my favorite Dokken songs, it has a good feel, solid melody and the chorus is undeniably catchy and is simply the band at its best. In My Dreams is a softer song that's very much on the pop side but there's nothing wrong with that as it's a great Dokken song. Its Not Love features an excellent riff courtesy of George Lynch, got to love the tongue-in-cheek breakdown towards the end! Jaded Heart is a very nice ballad with a powerful feel to it. Don't Lie To Me and Will The Sun Rise (It could be said so of many songs but this one has an incredible solo, Lynch makes the simplest things sound great) are both undeniably catchy songs that have some qualities of a ballad but are also rock `n' roll. The only song that I am not a huge fan of is closer Till the Living End, it's a heavier song and certainly not a bad one but it's not a great track either. It has great playing on it don't get me wrong, it's heavier in the same way that Tooth and Nail was but something is missing.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Dokken: they know just how to craft a catchy song full or arrangements and hooks while still making it rock. I think Under Lock and Key captures Dokken at its shiniest moment, it's safe to say that if you don't like this album then chances are you won't like the band very much. It's easy to classify Dokken as just another band that was around during the Glam movement or that decade they call the 1980's but I think they were actually one of the better bands of that genre. The band also had a hard-rock sound to them mixed with the 80's sound. Add to this lyrics that were more clever and intelligent than that of many bands of the era had mixed with some fantastic guitar work, and what you get is this band who is in my opinion often overlooked and underrated. I don't think Under Lock and Key is a five stars album but it may very well be Dokken's best and comes somewhat close. I think 4.5 stars is fitting to this excellent album, I love Under Lock and Key and it's an album I would recommend to fans of melodic/Glam metal.y catchy songs that have some qualities of a ballad but are also rock `n' roll.

B000OP1M6M|5.0|First of all, for those of you that don't know, the Seiko SKX007/009 are essentially the spiritual successor to the Seiko 6xxx diver's watches that were so popular as tool watches in the Vietnam War era. At a glance, it's hard to tell them apart - the main differences being the subtle differences in the case shape and the shape of the indices on the face. The 007 is the current black bezel version, the 009 has the \\"Pepsi\\" red/blue bezel for a little added color in your life. It uses a Seiko 7S26 automatic movement which is a decent reliable movement with only a few drawbacks - more on that later. This watch shipped from Amazon's warehouse in Kentucky unlike the comments from some previous reviewers. I've only had this particular watch for a few hours, so I can't speak to the accuracy of this watch in particular, but I've been wearing a Seiko 5 with the same movement for months now and other than it running slightly fast (not unusual for an out of the box mechanical movement that's never been regulated) I can't complain about it at all. So as to this watch - let me tell you all the little, niggling things I *don't* like about it, so you can make an educated purchase. First of all, the 7S26, unlike the Swiss ETA 2824-2 in my other dive watch (which, to be fair, cost about 5x as much) cannot be hand wound, nor does it \\"hack.\\" What that means is, when you pull the crown out to the time setting position, the seconds hand keeps running, so you cannot synchronize it to the second with a time source such as a top of the hour beep on the radio, an \\"atomic\\" clock (really a clock synchronized to WWVB, but that's another discussion) or the NIST web site. Not a huge deal unless you're really need that precision, and if you did, you'd be wearing an \\"atomic\\" watch anyway. And the \\"poor man's hack\\" works on this movement - set the time, then hold a little back pressure on the crown (turn it in the opposite direction ever so slightly to the direction you'd turn it to advance the hands) and that usually stops the second hand. When your time source catches up, let go, et voila, synchronized watch. Also, the bracelet is to be kind, flimsy - not unusual for Seiko watches. I honestly purchased the bracelet version only because due to the inscrutability that is Amazon it was cheaper than the rubber strap version. I'll be putting this on a Mil-NATO strap I think, but if you like bracelets, there's plenty of aftermarket bracelets out there far nicer than the original Seiko ones - only the high-end Seiko watches get really nice bracelets. Also, the bezel action is a little light, although I haven't worn it enough to see if it ever rotates by itself. This particular watch just showed up at my door today, so I haven't had a chance to see how the lume lasts, but traditionally Seiko lume is about as good as it gets - if you want something more visible at night, you really need to be looking at watches with tritium hands and indices. The bezel insert is printed, not engraved, for what it's worth, and the crystal is \\"hardlex\\" (a Seiko proprietary hardened mineral crystal material) which is less scratch resistant than sapphire but actually somewhat more impact resistant. (you win some, you lose some. And I'm not aware of any watch at this price point w/ a real sapphire crystal anyway.)  All that said - if you've got as far as reading this review, you probably ought to go ahead and buy this watch. It's damn near an icon in the world of tool watches. It looks good without being a copy of someone else's design (how many Rolex Submariner homages does the world really need?) and at the same time is an evolution of a design that is a classic in its own right. Seiko makes a hell of a movement, I have no reason to doubt the 200m rating, and if you really want near-quartz accuracy from it, just wear it daily for a month or two to let it break in and then take it to your local watchmaker and have him regulate it for you. $150 (I see now it's $145?) for a quality automatic waterproof watch complete with screw down crown is not a bad deal at all.  Anyway, above and beyond all that, for more watch-geekery goodness, there's a decent sized aftermarket out there with different bezel inserts, hands, dial faces, etc. for this series of Seiko watches for those that just have to have something completely different.  Edit: William Jean sells solid-link bracelets for Seiko watches with solid end links and decent quality clasps.  I'm waiting for one to arrive now although the watch is fine on a Mil-NATO strap.  After wearing this watch for a while I've found that it only gains a few seconds a day, although more than that isn't unusual for a 7S26.  Edit #2: I tried the William Jean \\"super oyster\\" bracelet but ended up going back to a Maratac Mil-NATO strap.  It just seems to fit the character of this watch better, although the Super Oyster does make for a nice combination with this watch.  After having owned this watch for a while I have a few nits to pick regarding it; I still like it but figured I would report on the negatives.  1) the crown does not screw down as nicely at that of my Marathon GSAR.  To be fair, the GSAR costs about 5x as much.  2) the auto-winding mechanism is not very efficient.  If I wear the watch all day it has lots of power reserve, but I have had a few occasions to wear a watch to bed, not having an alarm clock handy.  I find that the GSAR is the choice for that duty; if I pick up the Seiko and it has run down, I apparently do not move enough in my sleep to wind the watch; it will stop running overnight.  This is not a problem for either the GSAR (ETA movement) or my Vostok Amphibia, but it is for the Seiko.  Unfortunately the Seiko does not handwind, and the Vostok's lume is awful, so the GSAR is really the only choice for that duty.  Not a situation that most people will care about but in the interest of full disclosure I thought I should add this to my review.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|This is an interesting movie.  Credit also goes to the editor(s) that created the enticing trailer, which got me interested in the movie.  The story would have been more engaging with additional emphasis on (1) the subsequent re-creation / re-supply of the NZT pill and (2) the mind expansion and its relevance to the Eddie's life.<br /><br />In conjunction with the enticing trailer, there is an elaborate marketing strategy for this film on the internet which \\"advertised NZT\\".  For those who enjoyed this movie (like me), check out this cleverly done website for the movie [...].  The creation of this website should have been part of the movie.<br /><br />Personally, the Russian characters are a TOTAL WASTE of time and should have been removed from script.  In turn, more emphasis should be made on how Eddie's chemist enhanced NZT,  how Carl (Robert Deniro's character) gets cornered or defeated entirely by Eddie's new NZT and how NZT eventually gets marketed as a 'legal' drug.<br /><br />To me, the movie was too short and did not elaborate enough on matters pertaining to brain function enhancement and the impact it brings to a person's life.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I loved this book.  No endless chapters on what type of business structure you should set up or mindless talk on every detail a book writer needs to focus on.  Instead what you get is a step by step guide of what this author did to help make his success.  It may not work for everyone but it's the best \\"How I did it\\" book I've seen on writing in a while and I've read quite a few.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|This album is edging out U2's the Joshua Tree as my favorite of all time.  David Cooks voice is magnificent and these songs are outstanding.  Listening to the album in order takes you on a journey but any of the songs are great on their own as well.  What a work of art!  Beautiful instrumentation as well as the wonder of David's voice.  I've been listening to this almost nonstop since I got it and just can't get enough.
B004VFYOA2|2.0|I have many Music Videos & watch them frequently. I was all keyed up to see this video on the music I love. When this DVD started I noticed it looked like it was out of focus some times. It looks like someone in the seats recorded this video & not professionals. I was very dissapointed in its quality. It goes from Black & White to color & back to Black & White ???? I still liked the video.
B0050LJIRK|3.0|So, Limp's first studio album since 2005 started out firing on all 16 cylinders. It was like taking a trip back into my 20s when Korn was still relevant, Britney was still every man's fantasy and rock had a rosy future. The first five tracks on Gold Cobra remind me of classic Bizkit, yet it doesn't sound dated. The second half isn't terrible, but I felt a gnawing sensation mounting from the pit of my stomach as though I was watching the latest Michael Bay summer blockbuster; a great beginning to grab your attention, a mediocre middle that is just intruguing enough to hold your attention and a disappointing 3rd act. It's not that the album is a letdown. Overall, I'm thrilled to add this to my collection, but I personally felt the novelty wearing thin as the album progressed.<br /><br />Aside from tracks 8 and 13, the remaining singles on the second half of the record are so-so, but probably forgettable. Fortunately, the final track (Killer in You) is a very solid single as is \\"Walking Away\\", which appears in the eigth slot, and the two break up what is an otherwise average second half. Overall, I don't like giving the album only 3 stars, but I feel giving it 4 would be pushing it.<br /><br />It's good to have LB back, and this album is good enough to where I'll look forward to the next.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|I'm glad I didn't review this album immediately.  After half a dozen + listens it has grown on me.  Song oriented yes, even a little bit safe, (but nice songs) - not my preference when I think of musicians like Trucks, Oteil and Kofi Burbridge (much prefer the extended jams and I hope the 2 instrumentals are a taste of their future direction).  Susan Tedeschi has a large piece of the pie here, hopefully Mike Mattison will get 2-3 leads on the next one to add more variety.  Enjoyable none the less.
6305127646|5.0|Watched this movie years ago and loved it, liked it more when I recently watched it, if you like a good spy film with enough action to keep the boys happy and enough romance to satisfy any girl, then perhaps you should give this film a go. Val Kilmer is great in the lead and Elizabeth Shew does a great job as the reluctant heroin. Just watch it and enjoy.

ROCK AND ROLL!!!!!
B0052U59F4|3.0|Yes, I had already read this story on the authors fan fiction blog and would say it is my favorite fan fic of  all time. That being said this version seemed to be missing that special quality the first story had. As a whole, the story is heart wrenching, sexy, humors at times and all together a great read... However... If I didn't already know how the story would pan out I would have thrown my Kindle into a wall when I reached \\"end of part one\\". Seriously? That was the best place to break up the book.? Not in the least. This was not a cliffhanger but rather an incomplete story thrown into an abrupt halt mid climax... And no one likes that!     Christian and Ana have great banter and even better sex. He is every girls \\"I can change him\\" dream and she fulfills the innocent turned dirty fantasy of every male. I am eagerly awaiting the rest of the book and understand that the choices that have brought this book down in quality are not a direct result of the author herself.
B00406UK7S|5.0|A very good movie with lots of action. If you like movies dealing with Romans or this time period, you'll love this DVD.
0345529057|4.0|I've just started reading the first book in the series, and I look forward to it every night.  Glad that I have three books in the set coming behind it.  It's a great story-line with even better characters.  The only negative for me is the strong sexual content in the story.  I'm finding that these are short episodes, thus far, and so I question the need.  But, since they are short, it's easy to skip over them.  That being said, I'd definitely recommend the books.  Great summer reading!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|She is powerful, and wonderful to listen to. Definable her own sound. I LOVED her. She will be added to my music Library and in my IPOD  forever. I can not wait and am actually drooling with the thoughts of her new Album.
1573228737|4.0|This is a Gothic ghost story with a twist of mystery.  The story takes place in the late 1800's, with the heroine visiting a women's prison as penance for her own botched suicide attempt.  She meets and becomes intrigued by a prisoner who is incarcerated for a death that took place during one of her seances.  The story unfolds with a dramatic and unexpected climax, and a most satisfactory ending.<br />Although it is a dark novel, I found I could not put it down.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Gothic mysteries.
B004LWZWE2|5.0|No, seriously.  There were cops posted in the theatre at the back of the auditorium in case some rock'n'roll addled customer went crazy.  Nobody went crazy that way, but the movie blew me away.  Still does today.
B004WOS7LO|4.0|I wish I could give it a five out of five star rating, I really do... but since some of the songs in the middle sound very similar to one another, that makes it a four.  Don't get me wrong, this is a VERY solid four-star album.  And that's the best part of it-- this is an ALBUM.  This isn't a collection of singles thrown together and packaged perfectly to fit in the pop-laden industry.  The strongest songs are Circadian and Rapid Eye Movement, the book ends of the album (without the extra tracks)  Both of them pack an incredible punch and are heavy hitters, and make me wish we were in a musical era where either of those would be released as singles.  Even in his softest moments, such as Goodbye to the Girl or Fade Into Me, David's voice stays strong and true, which is such a nice change from the auto-tuned artists shoved down the public's throat on a daily basis.  His first single off the album, The Last Goodbye, really does fit into this collection, and the more I hear it the more I enjoy it.  Would I recommend this album?  Absolutely. Hands down it's one of the best albums I have heard in a very long time.
B003L77GVK|1.0|So glad they finally ended this abysmal, uneven, inconsistent series.  So sad the Stargate franchise had to end on such a poor note.
B003L1ZXCU|4.0|In this techno-thriller by Daniel Suarez, game programmer par exellance Matthew Sobol reaches back from the grave to change the world. This is the first book of two in a series. The second is Freedom.<br /><br />The story begins with a news item announcing the death of Sobol from brain cancer. Sobol was the billionarie CTO and co-founder of the computer game company CyberStorm Entertainment. Soon after Sobol's death, a programmer with the company is murdered. Then, another. Detective Peter Sebeck is called to investigate. Their murderer isn't a mystery for long, because Det. Sebeck receives an email from the killer - Matthew Sobol.<br /><br />Before dying, Sobol created a daemon, \\"A computer program that runs continuously in the background and performs specified operations at predefined times or in response to certain events.\\" This daemon was distributed throughout the world, like a computer virus; it was designed to search the internet for news of Sobol's death and, once found, initiate Sobol's plan. The programmers were murdered because they knew too much about the inner workings of the daemon that they had assisted Sobol in writing.<br /><br />The daemon then recruits people and businesses worldwide, both legitimate and criminal, through wile and blackmail to carry out Sobol's plan. In response, Det. Sebeck and every conceivable government authority begin their battle against a computer program threatening to change the world order. What is the daemon's ultimate goal? How can one stop a program that is both nowhere and everywhere?<br /><br />I have a mixed feelings about this book. Its a page turner, has a great hook, and is very enjoyable. However, the writing is uneven and could have be tighter. This is Suarez's first book. Perhaps if this had been his tenth, the writing would have been better. He could have used a better editor.<br /><br />This book's plot is very dependent on technology and so is packed with technical jargon. That in itself is not bad. Jon Ross, a computer programmer with a shady past, explains many of these terms to Det. Sebeck for the reader. But sometimes, the terms go undefined, and I often feel that the author is technical word name dropping to impress the reader. This is a case where a better writer, like Michael Crichton, would have eliminated the terms to keep the plot flowing.<br /><br />I recommend this book and will be sure to read the second. However, if you don't think you'd be into a tech-heavy book, you might become confused and bored.ast, explains many of these terms to Det. Sebeck for the reader.

B0055OK2T0|5.0|Matt Damon is perfectly charming in this movie and the plot moved fairly well.  Emily Blunt was adequate in her portrayal of Mr. Damon's love interest.  The best thing about the movie was the interesting plot which was carried well throughout -- even without blood and gore and sex and swearing.  A great movie for tweens and above as it will leave you smiling and thinking about living a deliberate life instead of just letting it happen.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I happily pre-ordered this DVD when it was first listen on Amazon.  I was extremely happy with the price, especially since I was short on cash and really wanted to buy the DVD--since I was a huge fan of the movie after seeing it in theaters.    The packaging kind of worried me when I first got it--it was only boxed in cardboard.  Though the product itself was in excellent condition, and so was the disc inside.

This game needs a better memory system!!!! I can't give this 5 stars until they put in a better memory.  Buy this game if you want to start over every week! DROID X.

If you are not used to working out with weights, start off with 2 pounds and move up. I plan to try it again, with 2 pound weights. I finished physical therapy on both of my shoulders 6 months ago and i am finally feeling stronge enough to use weights again... Good luck!
B004EPYZUI|1.0|A young girl named Baby Doll in a mental asylum is scheduled to undergo a lobotomy. She retreats into her imagination, along with other residents of the asylum, and plots an adventurous escape.<br /><br />Director Zack Synder is a genius when it comes to design. His films 300 and Watchmen are rich, visual marvels, though Watchmen was a mishap when it came to storyline. Watch a trailer of Sucker Punch and it's clear Snyder knows his strengths; he has stuck with delivering fantastic, arresting graphics to the screen.<br /><br />But while this may seem an uber-cool, surreal flick, note the elephant in the room: the young age of the characters.  The film is cast with a bevy of attractive, young actresses decked out in sleek, skimpy costumes designed to highlight their sexuality. Clips and stills from the film also emphasize the overt sexuality of the production. This may not seem like much to modern audiences, but stop and think about this for a moment. There is a definite pedophilic vibe to the whole production---the lead character's name is Baby Doll for a reason. She is committed to the asylum by her wicked step-father and is described in all of the marketing material as being a \\"young girl.\\" The director, himself, referred to this film as \\"Alice in Wonderland with machine guns\\"---but Alice was a young girl. Why hasn't Snyder been held accountable, even questioned about his using underage female characters in an highly sexualized and violent film? How is the sensationalism of this production going to further erode morality within our culture---to the further detriment of what should be one of our society's greatest treasures: our young women?<br /><br />Baby Doll escapes into a fantasy world she has created in her own mind. Which is more real to her---the fantasy or the horrors of reality? While fantasy is always fun to watch, it's a great delivery system for worldview.<br /><br />We often find the fake world of the film to be presented as comparable or even superior to the real world.  Then comes the eventual questioning of which world is actually real (think The Matrix). This blurring of the line between reality and fantasy promotes, often subconsciously, the idea that our world is defined not by established rules and shared experiences, but by the perceptions of the individual. If there are no shared experiences, there is no shared morality or expectations.  Again, man is left to fend for himself. He defines the universe as he sees fit, and his moral beliefs become situational rather than stabilizing.<br /><br />-- Review co-authored with film critic Scott Nehring ([...]).

B0051BVQFG|1.0|Awful. 2 hours of yelling. Cardboard characters. Predictable beginning, middle, and end. Non-stop melodramatic music (to dictate to the viewer how he or she should feel.) No more than a paragraph of meaningful dialouge and no, I am not being hyperbolic. The \\"movie\\" was, essentialy, like watching someone else play a sci-fi video game for 120 minutes. Even as an exercise in escapism-this movie failed. The cliches were so over-used as to be insulting to the viewer. There was zero attempt by the writer(s)/ director to make this into anything more than an extended preview of, well, any given CGI riddled train wreck. You could literally watch this movie without the sound on and you would miss nothing of its plot. Save your money.
B0054LRR3S|4.0|SBTRKT is a anonymous producer from England. His beats are what I would call a mix of hip hop and dubstep but with a great pop sensibility. Most of the vocals on this album are provided by Sampah, which range from good to great. But my favorite track on this album is the Single Wildfire featuring Yukimi Nagano of Swedish band Little Dragon.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|My daughter and I saw the movie before it went out of the cinema.  We each had our own impression of the movie.  My daughter thought it dark, and had trouble following the plot of the movie.  While the theme has darkness in it (main star's evil step father, what happened to her mother and sister, and then what was happening to her).  I found the plot to be extremely deep.  If you felt you were in a no win situation, would you do your best to help others around you?  Or would you just cave in and let it be?  Sucker Punch, to me, is about a young lady who is courageous, bold, and has the spirit to continue on in the face of what appears to be certain defeat. To do so in a way that helps others, and gives her peace in the end knowing she smiled at the face of what would be death for most of us.
B000Z9PYJS|3.0|While I enjoyed much about this book I was confused much of the time.  The entire first part of the book sets up the authors knowledge of zoology which is important to the story.  But, there is such a great portion setting up Pi's religious beliefs and love of God.  What confused me was how this belief in a higher being played very little part in the story after the ship sinks. It was disturbing at times and humorous at times.  I guess I would give it 3 1/2 stars if it was possible. Worth reading if you love animals and want to learn many interesting facts about zoo life.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I personally loved this show. I will admit with some of the other reviewers that season 1 was a bit weaker than season 2. However in season 2, the characters were starting to gel, find their places in the cast and the story line was looking really promising. Then SYFY decides to cancel it. I'm sure I'm not the only reviewer that is tired of SYFY luring viewers in to new sci-fi shows and then canceling them. Ie... Caprica, Demons, just to name a couple. Then ruin endings of great shows like BSG.     I don't know what the execs at SYFY are doing, but it seems like they have a problem staying committed to shows once they get them started. Its almost like they wanted SGU not to succeed with rotating time slots, stupid show times, and not give the show a chance to succeed just a the show seemed like it was coming together and starting to gel. A true shame. But yet they will continue to run crap like Ghost Hunters and the like. Hopefully they will come out with a movie to satisfy the fans and not leave us hanging with a cliffhanger, out of all endings they could have come up with. Just plain bizarre.

0061689246|4.0|About the Book: In England, there is a small town known as Wall, named because of the wall that separates it from a meadow, which is really part of the world of Faerie. Here a young lad by the name of Tristran Thorn is looking to win the heart of a beautiful girl by the name Victoria Forester. One night the two of them glimpse a falling star, and Victoria promises Tristran whatever he wants if he retrieves the star for her. So he crosses the wall and enters the world of Faerie, but when he does find the star, it is not what he is expecting. When stars fall in Faerie, they turn into girls. So Tristran and Yvaine, the star, end up in a series of troubles and adventures, involving witches, unicorns, and a series of brothers trying to kill each other for the throne.<br /><br />Review: Although I had heard and read some of Gaiman's stuff before seeing the Stardust film, I did read the book after. I did find the book fantastical, but I have to admit I found the movie more to my liking. Both follow the same storyline for the most part with only two major deviances: the end and the air ship. The movie also had a lot more humour in it, which just seemed to work wonders for Stardust. Book wise though, the writing flowed nicely, and although it was an easy and light read, it was interesting. The plot followed a fairly general fantasy adventure type, but the plot was unique. Even if you had seen the movie, you could still enjoy the book. Something you can't say about others. It is not my favourite of Gaiman's works, but it is still wonderful. Stardust is neither a waste of time or money.
B004LV32JU|4.0|This is something you listen to and start to think joining a big circle pit in a live gig of Sylosis. The guitar riffs are the spot here and the mixing of time during drumming/bass make the music more complex but still catchy and with great heavy punch.
0440422973|1.0|I don't read many books, and this book is exactly the reason why.  For some reason unbenounced to me, I finished the thing.  I think I thought it might get better.  It didn't.  The end was ok, stuff at least happened.  The middle was VERY long.<br /><br />Here's 90% of the book: some people try to sell them Christmas calendars and (conflict!) they have to say no.  The sellers are mad.  Some people try to sell some fruitcake (conflict!) and they have to say no.  The sellers are mad.  Some people try to sell them a Christmas tree (conflict!) and they have to say no.  The sellers are mad.  Some people tried to get them to make a donation to the police department (conflict!) and they have to say no.  They are mad.  The neighbors want them to put a frosty statue thing on the roof like they all do (conflict!) and they have to say no and everyone's mad.  I'm pretty sure this same thing happened at least a few more times.  It was incredibly tedious to read.  But kind of funny when describing the book like \\"are you serious, AGAIN?\\" is what my boyfriend said to me as I told him what happened next.<br /><br />I think it's completely ridiculous that they spend $6,000 every single Christmas.  Who does that?  Are other people in the world (America) like that?!<br /><br />I also did not like that they said that tanning beds are healthier than the sun.<br /><br />Awful book.  Turns me off on reading in general.  Finding good books are too hard.  I tried and ended up reading this one.  Ugh.  This book is the epitome of mass produced novels.
0061743526|5.0|I've read that Harper Lee never wrote another novel, as she believed she had no where to go but down.  After reading the book I understood what she was thinking.  As I read the book I took notes.  I wanted to remember all the great phrases and powerful descriptions she used.  Harper Lee had a terrific southern vocabulary.    This is a book written 50 years ago about racial injustice.  It was written 50 years ago, but the story takes place during the Great Depression.  It is a critique of American justice and southern culture. The story line is that a black man is falsely accused of raping a white girl.  Everyone knows he'll be convicted because he is black and the jury will be all white.      Atticus Finch is the lawyer the judge appoints to defend the accused. Knowing the man is innocent Atticus Finch works for to justice at great personal cost. \\"But before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a persons conscience.\\" This is great wisdom for when we face opposition in life.     The attitude and life philosophy of Atticus Finch gives hope to the reader for the world we live in.  (I recently have read Lord of the Flies, Catcher in the Rye and Fahrenheit 451, these books take hope away from the reader, they left me with a feeling of despair. They are very pessimistic stories.) \\"Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win.\\" and \\"No matter how bitter  things get, they're still our friends and this is still our home.\\" are two quotes to remember from \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" as we too live in a world where injustice must be fought.  Hate the injustice,don't hate the people.    A neighbor describes Atticus to his daughter, \\"I simply want to tell you that there are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your father's one of them.\\"     One of the most powerful moments in the film adaptation of the book takes place in the court house when Reverend Sykes, the minister of the First Purchase Church tells Scout, \\"Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father's passin'\\"

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am going to wait for the original versions to be remastered for BD. We all know Lucas is trying to sell these movies as many times as possible so send a message and skip this version. You have probably already owned these on VHS and DVD but trying to sell us multiple BD versions is ridiculous and should not be rewarded with repeat purchases of the same format.
B002K0WBXW|1.0|This was actualy painful to watch. Two great actors that were given a script that actualy reflected absolutely no chemistry between them 95% of the movie. I can think of absolutely no other movie I have ever seen where the script failed the actors so badly. But that's not the end of the story. To show how cheap and superficial the director, writer, and producer were, the movie for the second half of the movie takes place in Sitka Alaska in order to add authenticity to the warmth of the story. As someone who lives in Alaska, however it was painfully obvious that:    A. the movie was not filmed in Alaska.   B. the extras were not from Alaska.   C. the building architecture did not reflect Alaskan architecture.    During the directors commentary the writer and director admit they could not afford to film the story in Alaska, so here's a thought for them: Movies are a visual medium!, pick another location for the movie setting if your too cheap to even go see what Alaska looks like! Next time Sandra does a movie set in her home state of Texas, I hope she will substitute her filming in Massachusetts using cut and paste background special effects. That would give her neighbors in Texas somthing to talk about.

I purchased the album after hearing Adele's \\"Someone Like You,\\" and it was the best $12 I've spent in a long time. Every track on this album is memorable and encites the love, and sadness, each of us has so deeply felt at one point or another, and every listen feels like the first time.
0064410935|5.0|Charlotte's web is a wonderful book perfect for children and adults, which expresses love, courage, and friendship to the reader. The book is beautifully illustrated throughout the entire reading which helps any reader to truly be a part of the story.     Charlotte's Web is about a young girl named Fern and her triumphal helpfulness of saving a pig in which her father was about to kill due to it being a runt. Fern takes care of the pig and names him Wilber, and she sits on a stool in Mr. Zuckerman's barn for many days just watching and listening to the noises of the barn. Wilber makes friends with a spider who calls herself Charlotte. Charlotte tries to save Wilber's life by doing all she can as a spider.    As an elementary teacher I find this book to be a fantastic read aloud. Students always want to hear more about what is going to happen. The story does end on a happy note which is good for young readers, or listeners. If you decide to read this book for a read aloud, you might want to try some summarizing strategies. I like to give my students 3 post-it sticky notes and have them jot down notes on two sticky notes during the read aloud and return to their desks and write a complete sentence explaining either what was read, what they are thinking about, or what they think might happen next. Then I receive 1 sticky note from each student and I can quickly read where they are with their comprehension. I used this in the second grade classroom and it is great for them, and depending on how you set it up, you could probably use it for higher grade levels too for their responsibility of paying attention.

0553382152|5.0|I bought this book about 19 years ago when my son was going through cancer treatment.  We got to know many families - some who's children didn't survive the fight.  This book helped me understand why bad things have to happen to innocent and wonderful people.  It really did change my entire attitude toward people in general and my purpose for being here on this planet.  It answered many questions that I hadn't ever really voiced.  I have read this book a couple more times since then and I have recommended and loaned it out to people.  I wonder if Betty really knew how many lives she would change for the better when she sat down to share her experience with us.  I am grateful.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and devoured it in one sitting.  I set it down sadly wanting to know more of what happens to our new friends from that world.  I would warn parents that there are themes in it for older teens that could lead to some discussions. But knowing of life's many different choices is a good thing. After all not everyone is happy with a life lived the same way as all the rest and that is a beautiful and wondrous thing. I am looking forward to more journeys in this world.

0525422943|5.0|by Victoria Testa<br /><br />On rare and beautiful occasions, an experience  can change the way you see everything. The experience can be so powerful that it changes your life. Where She Went by Gayle Forman captures that moment.<br /><br />Where She Went picks up two years after If I Stay. Mia, after recuperating from a car crash that killed her family, dumps Adam with no explanation, practically with no words. Adam uses the pain and heartbreak to create an album that shoots him into stardom. A new girlfriend, a new life, a new Adam. But there are parts of his old world that haunt him wherever he goes.<br /><br />On a visit to New York City, Adam stops by Mia's concert at Carnegie Hall. A rising new cellist, Mia is reaching a stardom of her own. She is barely recognizable, but deep down she is the girl that Adam loved. The girl that left him with wounds too deep to be repaired. Yet, Mia shows no sign of the damage she walked away from after the accident. She is a new Mia with a new life that Adam is not a part of. Can Adam face his Mia-less future? Or will he suffer even more heartbreak?<br /><br />Gayle Forman alternates between memories and reality, giving the reader a glimpse of every aspect of each character. In fact, these moments are so impeccably real that it is hard to believe this is a work of fiction. Gayle Forman's ability to transport the reader into Adam's mind is awe-inspiring. He narrates the novel with a harsh outer shell. As we watch his protective layer melt away, the reader sees the way Adam grows and changes through Gayle Forman's lyrical and beautiful language.<br /><br />At the heart of Where She Went and If I Stay, there is music. Truly, these books prove that music is all around us. It is in conversations between strangers on trains. It is in rustling leaves and laughing friends. It is in the air we breathe and hearts that beat. Music connects people in a way that nothing else can. Music has the power to heal and excite and love.<br /><br />Where She Went by Gayle Forman draws a vivid portrait of how breakable the heart is. But, as much as it reveals despair, it also elicits hope. It is not human nature to give up on our dreams. We are far too stubborn and strong-willed. Where She Went is a beautiful testament to the strength of the human soul, the magic of music, and the power to look beyond the past and into a brighter future.trait of how breakable the heart is.

B004R13U6Y|3.0|I bought this based on reviews that it was an acceptable reader on the Xoom.  while it has many nice features that you would hope for in a PDF reader, it fails my most important need - it does not render pages fast enough to briskly read a book.  if your need is for business or for other organizational reasons, it would be acceptable.  If your desire is to read for any sort of pleasure not waiting for a blurry page to momentarily focus, it is not.
0811875040|3.0|I agree that the book is very pretty, but many of the recipes are a bit daunting and definitely not for a novice baker. Also, many of the recipes are just variations of a few base recipes instead of an entirely different thing. I made the double chocolate cake for the tomboy version, and also the hot milk cake for the coconut version. The chocolate cake rose so much that it fell over the sides of my pans, and the milk cake sunk in the middle. Also, even though I buttered the pans, the cakes still stuck. It was pretty disappointing since I followed the directions exactly (even buying pans, thermometers and strainers specifically for these recipes). Another thing that might be worth mentioning is that some recipes call for pretty expensive ingredients (coconut puree at $25 per order from their supplier), so its almost not even worth baking anything if the recipes aren't accurate. With that being said, I have to mention that the chocolate cake was the most delicious, moist and perfect tasting chocolate cake I have ever baked. I didn't even have to eat it with icing, it was that good. I'm still going to keep trying some recipes in the book, a lot of reviews show success with the smaller baked goods, so I'll probably stick with those and not the cakes (except the chocolate)!

B004WJRF6C|4.0|Review:<br />McCartney. 2 CD Special Edition 2011<br /><br />PACKAGING: *****<br />Nice digipack, all recyclable cardboard sleeve.  The front and back of the package is very close to the original album, great job.  The photo montage from the original inner gatefold sleeve is now spread out over several pages. The photos look great, pristine.  The disc sleeves can tear but the trick is simply pushing up on the hole in the center of the disc<br /><br />LABEL: *<br />No Apple label, just plain black, plain.<br /><br />MUSIC:*****<br />Listening to this album is like meeting an old friend by the fireplace on a Fall morning. I found myself singing and humming along to many of these songs.  It's rough, almost demo quality at times but that is part of its charm as a piece.  It has 2 classic compositions, Maybe I'm Amazed and Singalong Junk.  An several other gems like Every Night and Man We Was Lonely.<br /><br />The second CD contains 7 bonus tracks.  Suicide is a ditty that was briefly mixed into Hot As Sun/Glasses. And Don't Cry Baby is a demo of Oo You.  As far as a second bonus disc I would only give this 1 star.  This whole package could have been one disc, really wasteful to do the 2 discs but maybe these are limited editions.  The CD age is coming to a close.<br /><br />MASTERING: ****<br />I have the old Capitol CD, not the Holland remaster from 1993.  This new CD sounds marginally better that the older version.  That old CD sounds pretty darn good.  But the mastering is first rate on this new disc<br />with some numbers like Lovely Linda jumping out with improved bass and low end clarity.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|I never have seen worse reviews for a movie from professional critics than I saw for this film when it was released: \\"two hours of solitary confinement, which feels more like dog hours\\"; \\"movie lives up to its name\\"; \\"what happens when a studio gives carte blanche to a filmmaker who has absolutely nothing original or even coherent to say\\"; and so on. There were a handful of dissenters, notably Betsy Sharkey of the LA Times, who said she wouldn't have missed it for the world, but there always are a few eccentric responses to anything. So, when the DVD slid into the player last night I fully expected momentarily to go screaming from the room in agony because fumbling for the remote would take too long. I didn't.    Did the mainstream critics and I see the same movie? Many of the reviews were written by people I respect and with whom I usually agree. I don't agree this time. I saw the same movie Betsy did and I'm with her. Yes, of course this film exploits adolescent fantasies. I don't think the trailers hid that aspect. Do we need to list the many highly regarded movies that play to adolescent fantasies?    Basic plot: wrongfully committed to a high security asylum by a corrupt stepfather, \\"Baby Doll\\" seeks freedom while indulging in two layers of fantasy.    Just go with the flow of this surreal and beautifully filmed movie. It does make sense in its own dark way. It's true that video game references are not original to this film (see Scott Pilgrim as one example), but this movie handles them well. The heroine's journey is not a warm and fuzzy one.  It won't leave you feeling cheerful inside. But I didn't leave the room.    Clearly a lot of people truly hate this movie, and I can't guarantee you won't be one of them. But if the idea of a blend of Shutter Island (2010), Teenage Doll (1957) and the Nintendo game Zelda, the Ocarina of Time doesn't strike you as outlandish, you just might like Sucker Punch.    I'm giving this four stars. It is a marginal four, to be clear, but four nonetheless.

B004X8W468|5.0|It only takes about 5 pages to see why Rebecca Stead won the Newberry Award for this book.  The story about a young girl, Miranda, who is growing up in New York City in the late 70's, deals with many of the things kids of middle school age deal with from creating new friendships to dealing with first time romantic feelings.  The book has many characters that are quite interesting from the kids who make up Miranda's friends and enemies, to the adults that round out the cast of characters.<br /><br />I truly found this book to be an absolute joy to read, and what pushed it to the 5th star for me was the fact that I found myself wanting to pick it up and continue to read after I sat the book down.  I found Ms. Stead to be very clever in how she entitles her chapters to how she pays homage to another Newberry winning author, to the overall pace of the plot.<br /><br />Stead is very good at keeping you guessing and I truly didn't know how it was going to end until I got to the end, which is something of a rarity in children's fiction.  I liked the length of the book, in that it wasn't overly long.  Sometimes when I finish a book I wish that I knew more, hoping that the author would have written another chapter or two, or maybe add a sequel, but in this great book, I found that at the end, it was the end, and I had everything I needed to walk away contently feeling like I just read a GREAT book.<br /><br />This is a great book for anyone of any age, and is a great introduction to good literature for children.
B0055OK2T0|3.0|I like Matt Damon and he doesn't disappoint. This is 2 hours of fun. Nothing earth shattering, but I enjoyed it.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Talent like David Cook is rare. He has talent combined with a keen intelligence and sensitivity that today's music scene is sadly lacking. His freshman album was really good. This his sophomore endeavor is STELLAR. Yes, I am a David Cook fan. I like the music that he made before AI and have enjoyed the progression to now. I agree with another review I read that said This Loud Morning is an instant classic. Yes, I will be listening to it over and over for quite awhile.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|The Book is way better, but I could say that about all the Harry Potter Books. If you like the others, this will not disappoint. If you didn't like those, then why would you consider this one?    I say go ready the book to find out what happens. It will be a much better experience than this will.
0307272702|5.0|I bought this book and it put into simple teams how we need to eat in order to be more healthy, energized, and of course loose weight too. I actually have purchased 8 copies and are lending them out to all my friends/family/co-workers!
B004ZGYEKC|5.0|Okay, I had the album when first released in '66 and loved it.  When Greatest Hits was released in '69 it had TWO Sunshine Superman album tracks in true stereo.  Yes, there are multi track tapes of this album, so they will probably release a stereo version real soon.........  Wrong!  I had to wait another 42 years for this to happen.  Boy!  But was it worth the wait?  You betcha.  If you had this album at any stage and liked it, definitely get this release.  It is absolutely fantastic.  They could have fnerked it up completely, but they didn't.  The mix is superb.  Squeeze another star in to make it 6.
B0048EL8DM|1.0|I was mostly interested in learning more about the (history of) oil spot market by reading about Marc Rich.  I was very disappointed.
0375826742|5.0|I say \\"Well...o-kay.\\" because I looked forward to this being the end of a trilogy. This is not a complaint against the books story...It's just that I was waiting for the climactic action. Then the book ended on yet another incomplete note. My disappointment ONLY stems from the fact that this series didn't remain a trilogy and I wanted to find out what happens. I am currently involved in about 4 different book series and after finishing \\"Brisinger\\" I am at a loss because all 4 series are between books...UUUGH! so frustrating!     THAT SAID...I loved the book. I was so engaged in the story that it wasn't until the last quarter of the book that I realized it wasn't going to end yet. Paolini has improved his writing skills so much since Eragon. Kuddos, I loved the book...BRING ON PART 4!!!!!

B002EWD0I6|5.0|When it come to well rounded entertainment the British seem to know how to do it best. A great show and acting. This is a show you and your children can watch.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|I rented this from Amazon and I really enjoyed it.  It is an intelligent thriller because it doesn't rely just on special effects but there is solid action and dialogue.  While the story may not be entirely original I think it is well-executed and suspenseful.  I will be purchasing this dvd.
1594744769|5.0|Anyone not fantasize about having some sort of supernatural power as a child, a special quality that set you apart, in a good way? Did you dream of defying your parents and schoolyard bullies, so no one would dare mess with you, or anyone you cared about, ever again?<br /><br />Since children are small, and at the mercy of higher authority, they occasionally feel  helpless, and feeling helpless leads to fantasies about wielding power, independent of the adults who generally stand in the way of the fun stuff they want to do.That's why so many children's books are about orphans, the abandoned, or those largely ignored by their parents/guardians. Without an adult preventing them from doing things, their imagination is the only thing limiting them. And if there's one thing kids have in abundance, it's imagination.<br /><br />Another thing children crave is adventure, as well as a mystery that's slightly scary but not without the hope of overcoming whatever evil force stands between them and what's morally right. Children have a firm grasp of right and wrong, not that they always follow it. The good ones do, but there are always antagonistic baddies. Actually, their understanding may be more highly refined than that of a lot of adults, at least characters in the literature do.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a Peter Pan-esque fairy tale following the rules of children's literature, employing supernatural elements mixing with the \\"real world\\" to create the best sort of fantasy for children who enjoy exploring mysterious and eccentric worlds with mysterious and eccentric characters.<br /><br />And delight it does, even for a seasoned, jaded adult like myself.<br /><br />I requested a review copy of this book because I couldn't resist the pull of all these delicious points: remote Welsh island setting, mysterious children living - when they shouldn't be, by all standards - in a huge, rambling old Victorianish school, lead by a matron dressed in black from head to toe. And the photos!  All those sepia-toned portraits of unreal individuals, mostly children.<br /><br />The book satisfied the part of my \\"inner child\\" that's drawn to gothic stories, the sort of book that tickles the dark, gloomy bit of the imagination. It's not magical realism per se, or, well, if it's considered so it's so closely blended with fantasy it's hard to tell them apart. The story is impossible from a rational perspective, the children's lives and how they've survived for such a long time unseen by outsiders defies reality. And that's the best part.<br /><br />The main character, Jacob, is very young at the beginning of the book, transfixed by the supernatural stories his grandfather tells. But as he grows older he loses the childhood ability to believe in the unreal, the unseen. After his grandfather is killed in a mysteriously grisly way, he finds it harder to explain away the paranoid behavior his parents saw, the dementia they believed was creeping in. But there was another reason Jacob suspected his grandfather had been telling the truth all along - the grotesque, unreal face he'd seen in the woods, near the site of the murder... The face only he could see.<br /><br />Such a joy of a read! This is the kind of gruesomeness that doesn't keep me up nights, the sort that's so overtly fantastical the adult in me knows it's fictional. It doesn't involve a serial killer, mass murderer or psychotic, but instead supernatural creatures with a nicely complex back story. But to a child: say an advanced late elementary or junior high/middle school aged fantasy fan, it could feel more possible, easier to imagine. And more real...<br /><br />The story does build a bit slowly. That's my only criticism, though it shouldn't bother a reader with a bit of patience. But once the reader is up to speed the plot builds to a breathless pace all the way to the end.<br /><br />The best part is the ending leaves more than enough room for a sequel. In fact, itbegs for it. So many things are left up in the air, I can't imagine there won't be a follow-up. At least I hope so.<br /><br />Very high marks to Miss Peregrine. Put this one in the hands of a child who's a voracious reader, and see what happens. Or, forget the child! Adults should give it a try, to satisfy your younger reader self.<br /><br />I'd love to hear what you think of it.be a follow-up. At least I hope so.    Very high marks to Miss Peregrine.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is an action-packed book that held my attention and made me consider our nation's current role from a global perspective.  That said, beware.  After you read this you will want to read the next (Catching Fire).  The next book is somewhat redundant but still entertaining.  Unfortunately the final book (Mocking Jay) is AWFUL.  Probably one of the very worst books I have ever finished.  Consider yourself warned.  IF you read the first you'll be entertained and moved, the second will be so-so but the 3rd will make you wonder if the same author even wrote it.  Truly-it's horrific.  Not in the \\"I didn't like the end\\" but it was an unhinged, incoherent mismash of thoughts that seems to have been written by someone under the influence of something.  Maybe it was a deadline.  Whatever the reason, the last book tarnishes everything that came before.  I think it's only fair to let you know before you start the trilogy.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|strangely enough this book if followed correctly could probaly save your life in a real non zombie survival situation. i read this all the way through and was entertained thoroughly. remember though this a guide not a story even though it does contain a history of the outbreak.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read all three books right after the other and the 1st was great, 2nd ok and 3rd TERRIBLE.  There were so many loose ends that were just left hanging.  Half developed characters your thing?  Well read this b/c it's chocked full of them.  This is not a case of me not agreeing with the end, instead it's that this was not the end.  It was a cobbled together excuse to capitalize on readers who spent money on the 1st 2 and had to finish.  The author should be ashamed.  I want a refund:)
0784011176|5.0|I deeply appreciate the beautiful and intense reviews of this amazing film. It has a tragic, beautiful story, acting worthy of the potential of the super people in the cast, and great cinematography.    But let's be straight; Harvey Keitel's full frontal nude is HUGE! Any guy with \\"size issues\\" will NOT need to see this, especially with his lady!    Otherwise, has something for everyone
0061733199|5.0|This book is nothing better than spectacular, and I repeat is spectacular! By no means am I an accomplished survivalist, but since I started my survival kit this last month, I was looking for a book to compliment my project. This book gives you complete details in any situation and it is an easy read. I recommend to anyone who is interested in emergency preparedness or if you are a beginner in knowledge of the outback!
B000P0J0AG|5.0|Heat is absolutely one of my favorite films of any type, and is as good as action films get. I agree with the reviews about how great the Oscar winners were in their roles, De Niro and Pacino, but what stood out then was the overwhelming presence-in a bit part- of today's greatest leading lady- Natalie Portman.
B0055JP7EU|5.0|Wow.  Just wow.  I was NOT expecting that ending!  The writers are absolutely brilliant!  I loved the Doctor's reaction when he found out who River was.<br /><br />I cannot wait until the second half of the season airs in September.  I can't even fathom what is going to happen then...I had no idea this was going to happen, lol!  I must say, this is definitely the best episode of both seasons 5 & 6...and it was only part 1.  So glad I decided to purchase this season. :)  I'm not going to spoil it for anyone though...closing the diary now. ;)
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love Plants vs. Zombies on the PC and have had great fun vanquishing zombies for many hours on end while playing the PC version.  I could not wait for the ap to be available so that I could hunt more zombies while on the go.  First the good stuff:  Almost exactly like the PC version meaning that the game play, characters, etc...are just like you saw in the PC version.  The graphics on my Google G2 were great and are not pixelated at all; very clear and very smooth (while the game is in play), sound is great.<br /><br />Now the bad stuff:  Although the graphics are great the game often stops and restarts in the middle for no reason I can see.  Very frustrating after you have chosen your plants and started playing and planting and killing zombies all of a sudden the game will stop and send you back to the choosing plants screen and you have to start over....urrggh!  Takes quite a bit of battery to run this ap so take your charger with you wherever you go.  Even 10 minutes sucked pretty much the life out of my battery.  I have lots of other aps and games and have not had this problem with them.  Once the ap is running it is difficult to close the game or to  \\"turn it off\\".  Essentially you have to click \\"main menu\\" and then hit the back button on your phone to get the pop-up that asks \\"are you sure you want to exit\\" then you have to touch your screen on the \\"yes\\" button and then you have to \\"back button\\" to your home screen.  Sometimes with all that I have still looked down and noticed that the game is still running.  In that case, the only thing I was able to do was to take my battery out and reset the phone.  I was not able to just shut the phone off. It seems like it just freezes in kill zombie mode.<br /><br />So, the good news is that I did not pay anything for this ap.  I obtained it as one of the \\"free ap\\" promotions from Amazon.  I am glad that I didn't even spend .99 on it as I would not have felt that I had received my money's worth. As a free ap--well as the old saying goes, \\"you get what you pay for.\\"  I sure hope they offer fixes or upgrades--when the ap is running smoothly it is  entertaining and makes waiting in line at the coffee shop kinda fun.oes, \\"you get what you pay for.\\"  I sure hope they offer fixes or upgrades--when the ap is running smoothly it is  entertaining and makes waiting in line at the coffee shop kinda fun.

B0055FR5PS|2.0|Poor portrayal of Marines shaking in their boot with bombs and bullets flying around them.  If I was the producer of this movie I would go to the front lines in Afghanistan and watch how real Marines behave.  Too much camera shaking going on.  Hollywood needs to understand about this. Other than that it's the same old \\"bad aliens come to earth to conquer and kill humans\\" movie.  I've seen it before.
0345529057|5.0|After seeing previews for the series on HBO I decided to give the show a try. I was not aware the show was based on a book series until about a week before the premier aired. Around week 7 of the HBO airings, I received this 4 book set and started reading the first book.    Being that I had enjoyed the show on it's own without the extra material, I initially chose to stay behind in the book from what ever was shown on TV. Knowing that I wouldn't be able to wait so long for the next seasons of the show, I decided with the last episode I would continue and finish the book so I could find out if the show was as enjoyable while knowing the story. It thankfully was so I've now read through the first 3 books and am very early into A Feast for Crows.    So, that all being said, for those that are new to the series it is a very good read (even if you're not an avid reader; I'm guilty as charged). I've rarely been so enthralled with a book, let alone 4. You never really know what's going to happen, even when you think so. Whether it's because the sly tricks of one of the many characters or because you think \\"I know how this works now,\\" you're inevitably going find yourself in the wrong.  GRRM sets up his story well, and evokes emotions throughout. I'm only sad that I'm 15 years late to the party.    As for the books themselves, they're of good quality. Each is marked with \\"An original series on HBO\\" banner across the top. The symbols you see on the binding of the book is also the cover art for each. The boxing, as you can see, is shown with actors of the HBO series. There's nothing I can complain about in these respects. Happy reading, A+ material.

0060558121|4.0|Neil Gaiman himself has said that American Gods tends to be a somewhat polarizing book: people tend to either love it or hate it. The novel is the story of Shadow, who is in prison for an indeterminate crime involving robbery of some sort. He is released a few days early when his wife dies in a car accident. Having nowhere to really go and nothing to do, he accepts the offer of a mysterious man named Wednesday to work for him--to protect him, transport him from place to place, run errands, hurt people who need to be hurt (only in an emergency), and in the unlikely event of his death, hold his vigil (37). Gradually, Shadow learns that Wednesday is actually Odin the All-Father, brought to America by immigrants who believed in him and sacrificed to him during the Viking Age. Wednesday has really recruited Shadow to help him face a coming storm--the new gods of television, the Internet, media, and other modern conveniences are usurping the old gods, and what's more, the new gods want the old ones dead. Before he knows it, Shadow is on the ultimate road trip across America, helping Wednesday gather forces from among the old gods to fight the new gods.<br /><br />This book was cleverly researched and interesting from a mythological standpoint. I kept wondering what Joseph Campbell would have made of it. In the novel, the reader meets gods and creatures as diverse as leprechauns, Anansi, Thoth, Anubis, Mad Sweeney, and Easter. The book certainly had me researching various mythological references so I could understand what was happening in the story. For sheer chutzpah with storytelling, I have to give Neil Gaiman props. What he did with this novel is not something very many writers could do. All that said, I didn't completely like it. I liked parts of it. Other parts seemed to go down a path I couldn't follow, and some threads introduced in the novel were dropped later. In some ways, it felt to me like Gaiman tried to do too much with this novel. On the other hand, some threads were brilliantly woven throughout the book. The concept is pure genius, and I don't really even have problems with most of the execution. Ultimately, it just didn't have some indefinable something that makes me enjoy a book. I give it four stars because I can recognize its brilliance, and I certainly don't want to leave anyone with the impression that I hated it. I didn't. It just didn't do \\"it\\" for me, even though I found it interesting, and despite its size, a quicker read than I anticipated. Four stars then is a compromise between the three stars I'd give it based on my personal reaction to it and the five stars I'd give it for what I'd recognize as its epic greatness. My own reaction probably has something to do with the fact that I'm not a huge reader of fantasy or science fiction. I have certainly liked other books by Neil Gaiman: [[ASIN:0061689246 Stardust]], [[ASIN:B002UDD4IA Coraline Movie Tie-in Edition (Paperback)]], and [[ASIN:0060530944 The Graveyard Book]]. I would certainly try other books by Gaiman in the future.re brilliantly woven throughout the book. The concept is pure genius, and I don't really even have problems with most of the execution.

B004LWZW24|5.0|I love horror movies, but they never really creep me out.  I had my hand up to my mouth throughout the movie because I was so nervous about what new creepy imagery they would show me.  The story itself is kind of...lame.  But the creepy factor totally overruled the story.  I can't wait to see it again and show people who haven't seen it.  Especially the ones who get creeped out easily by shadows in their bedroom and stuff.
0143057812|4.0|Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's novel The Shadow of the Wind begins with a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a vast, labyrinthine repository for books of all kinds. Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, cautions his son that he must never speak of what he sees to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be its protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catches his eye. He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.<br /><br />The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zaf&oacute;n brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|\\"Mo-tard\\" is a term used in the Marine Corps when something is so overly motivating that it's outright ridiculous. That's this movie in a nutshell. I can't help critiquing movies like this because I spent much of my career at Camp Pendleton where this movie is set and filmed. I called and texted many friends during and after watching this asking when was the last time you went golfing in uniform with kevlar on and night-vision attached to it? NEVER!! Marines do NOT hang out on base golf courses at night drinking on a truck tailgate!! I have lately fallen in love with \\"retreat hell!\\" as a jest and say it all the time to annoy people. And the air force chick who was runnin and gunnin like rambo and knew all the Marine Corps weapons systems and how to properly employ them? OH-kay!    Now...the action was great and a lot of it, the story was nowhere near on par with movies like Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow or 2012 etc. The movie is by FAR more about the Staff Sergeant than anything else. I mean, it's more about the SSgt than it is about the world being attacked! thats how the movie focuses things. There was also pretty much NO break from the action. Example: they're running, now they're shooting, now they're yelling and running again, now they're shooting again...I would watch it again because it's funny. The Staff Sergeant has almost a deeper voice than batman in Dark Knight...it's like he eats and drinks testosterone boosters for breakfast, lunch and dinner.    Here's a reference: Think C.Eastwood's \\"Heartbreak Ridge\\" in 2011 but with aliens and you have Battle: LA to a T.
0142429112|4.0|Deborah Harkness's debut novel A Discovery of Witches combines several elements I like--a great gothic house (and a castle), supernatural creatures (especially witches; I love witches), and academia. Diana Bishop, a rather reluctant witch and descendant of Bridget Bishop--the first \\"witch\\" executed in the Salem Witch Trials, is a professor researching the history of alchemy in Oxford's Bodleian Library when she is able to call forth a manuscript called Ashmole 782, believed lost for over 150 years. Diana suddenly attracts the attention of several other creatures--witches, daemons, and a vampire named Matthew Clairmont. Soon the two make even more startling discoveries--hidden inside Diana's DNA are predispositions for just about every magical power witches possess. Together they must discover what Ashmole 782's secrets are; why her parents were murdered when she was a child; and why daemons, witches, and vampires want to prevent them from discovering anything (and from being together).<br /><br />A review on Amazon describes this as a combination of [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]], [[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]], and a romance, which is just about right, except I'd throw [[ASIN:031613290X The Twilight Saga Complete Collection]] into the mix. It's certainly better written than The Da Vinci Code and perhaps Twilight, but not Harry Potter. It must be hard to write about vampires right about now. For one thing, we want the strange Byronic dangerousness of the vampire, but we don't like the whole murdering people to eat deal. We have, if you'll pardon the pun, taken the fangs out of our vampires. Edward Cullen is a great example of this phenomenon, and Matthew Clairmont is not terribly different. Despite the author's attempts to tell us otherwise, he never comes across the page as very dangerous. Nor do any of his \\"family.\\" The vampires that do seem frightening are all bad guys. Despite lacking some teeth, they are fairly charming. I particularly liked Marcus. For astute readers, there's a reference to another famous vampire in chapter 13 (I think--it's hard to keep track when you're listening) that vampire fans will enjoy. Harkness also dispenses with some of the vampire myths--her vampires can go out in the sun without incinerating (or sparkling).<br /><br />I actually liked the witches much better, especially Diana's aunts Sarah and Em. Sarah has a sort of hardened no-nonsense way of speaking, and Em is just sweet. I absolutely love their house. I won't spoil it for those of you who want to read it. The daemons confuse me. I can't tell what they are that makes them different from humans except for exceptional creativity and intelligence. They don't seem to have any supernatural powers like vampires or witches.<br /><br />I think I enjoyed this book on audio perhaps more than I might have in print because Jennifer Ikeda was such a great reader. She can do a variety of accents easily--French, Australian, and Scottish. She made each character sound different and instantly recognizable. I did find myself wishing I were reading the hardcover in some parts so I could easily flip around and check things.<br /><br />However, I admit I don't care a lot for the main characters, Diana and Matthew. Are they just grown up versions of Bella and Edward? Well, kind of. Diana is Bella with a little bit more self-esteem and attitude, maybe. The descriptions of the places, the food, and the other characters made me keep listening, and I enjoyed it enough to read the sequel, which I might enjoy more because of where it will be set (a bit spoilery, so I won't give it away). Diana and Matthew are a strange couple. They seem a little forced together as though they were set up by a good friend and are trying to make a go of it without really feeling any sparks.<br /><br />It's a worthy debut, and I think it will likely be fairly popular. Despite my feelings about the main characters, I did enjoy the book and look forward to the next one.
B003UYV08E|1.0|I always judge a movie like I judge a book -If I can get through it or not.  I didn't get through this one.  Dull flashy opening that lead to a...court room?  Dull dull and duller.  The chemistry between Robert and Scarlett J was, well there wasn't any.  I flicked back on the Roku and finished up Loose Change 9/11.  Like the first Iron Man, this was all flash and little tension.  Don't bother with this one. (How can you make Gwyneth Paltrow as unattractive as I have ever seen her and Scarlett J only marginally sexy? Try this director out...) Awful execution of two very attractive women.
0446195529|1.0|This book was so bad I couldn't finish it, so I have no idea who was actually behind the unnecessarily convoluted conspiracy, and I actually can't care... In particular, I got fed up of:    (1) A totally unconvincing UK secret agent who has a poorer grasp of British English than Dick Van Dyke - has Baldacci never been to London or does he just have a tin ear ?    (2) Plonkingly obvious statements of tradecraft made to said agent in, presumably, the interest of enlightening the reader. N.B. She's been on the job for a good 10 years now, pal, I think she probably knows this stuff...    (3) Silly action sequences - I know Stone was the best 20 years ago and I would be prepared to accept he could still hold his own in a fight, but beating off an attack by multiple 20-something pros - I mean, come onnnnn.....    (4) Lack of attention to detail - the British Secret Intelligence Service hasn't been called \\"MI6\\" for a very long time, except in the popular press.  An agent would certainly never introduce herself as such.    (5) Rather unbelievable twist and out of character behaviour at the end    I bought this book at the airport but spent most of the flight staring out of the window - that should tell you something.

B003INBNXO|5.0|I was blown away by the incredible martial arts.   The story is touching.   The actor playing Ip is fantastic.   Now I want to learn all about the real man and the real martial art.   Loved it.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|My only nitpick with the dvd is that there are no commentaries from the cast.  I hope they remedy that with S2.  I LOVE the show so there's nothing much else to say.
B000EZ7ZZE|3.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was excellent.  It looked like it was recorded digitally, it looked so good, and I'm sure it was.  It appeared to be presented in 2.40:1, so there were black bars at the top and bottom, which is how I prefer movies to be.<br /><br />The Dolby Digital 5.1 was about the best sound I have ever heard.  There was also PCM 5.1, but no DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, or Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  This Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack had better surround sound than most DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Blu-Rays.  Lot's of sub-woofer bass also.<br /><br />The movie itself was just okay.  Lot's of action, violence, and blood & guts. I was glad it was only 1 hour and 27 minutes long.
B004OEIL54|4.0|The film is really great, I love it, but this blu-ray edition is poor. The case is simple, without any printed inserts. Not many extras, just some from the previous DVD edition. But for $6,00 (the price I've paid for it) is a good deal!
B0034G4P8K|3.0|You would think that after two giant movies in a franchise, the people in charge would learn from mistakes, and make sure the series finale would have all that was good, and jettison everything that didn't work.  Astonishingly, while \\"Dark\\" features more of what we want, it has seemingly failed to learn from it's predecessors and their mistakes.    \\"Dark of the Moon\\" follows the autobots, valiant robots from outer space, as they continue their endless struggle for freedom and tyranny.  Only this time, the evil decepticons have a secret weapon that can turn the tide in their favor, and not even the combined forces of the autobots may be enough to save humanity this time.    After the previous entry in the series, \\"Revenge of the Fallen,\\" Michael Bay promised that the third film would be the best in the series, and to that end, he was mostly right.  \\"Dark\\" is indeed the most enjoyable movie of the trilogy, in that the story is fairly straightforward, there's a higher sense of menace, and the robot action is the best yet, especially at certain points during the climactic Chicago battle.  Yet, despite being the best film in the series, \\"Dark\\" has the the exact same flaws in the previous two films:  Humans take up a majority of the story instead of the robots, to the point where it feels like the transformers are guest stars in their own movie; there are too many human characters who add little to nothing to the story, such as Simmons (who doesn't need to be in the film at all) and his bodyguard; and the film is too long, with numerous scenes that should have been cut out (mostly everything with Sam trying to find a job, and his parents).     Still, despite all the flaws, \\"Dark\\" does offer quite a bit of fun.  When the transformers themselves finally get to do things, they are relentlessly compelling to watch, thanks to the photo-realistic CGI.  Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) is a fascinating character, while Optimus and all the other robots, both autobot and decepticon, continue to hold our attention.  The cinematography is also excellent this time around, with many gorgeous vistas and great scenery.  The fight scenes are also more enjoyable, due to the camera lingering on each shot for a few seconds longer then in previous films.    Overall, \\"Dark\\" is something of a mixed bag.  While it does offer the best that the Transformers series has to offer, it's impressive visuals and action are marred by mistakes that have been repeated time and time again.  For those who enjoy Mr. Bay's brand of films, and are willing to overlook the fat and excess screen time for unneeded human characters should find plenty to enjoy here.
0802473156|5.0|I find myself wishing I would have bought this book a long time ago.  It would have saved me the pain and agony of a divorce.  I highly recommend it.  It's an easy read, and just a marvelous book.
0439023513|4.0|I was very disappointed to finish this series. That being said, I can say that, for me, I rate the books as follows:  Book 1: A+  Book 2: A+  Book 3: B+    Mockingjay was a fitting conclusion to the series, yet, for me, it lacked the suspense of the previous books. Katniss moves from the arena, from the Hunger Games, into leading a full-on revolution against the Capitol on behalf of District 13, yet, strangely, I found the suspense and action in the other two books more harrowing than in the final installment. The book does not, however, leave the reader feeling that the main characters are invincible nor does it leave one to believe that the end is never in doubt.     Collins makes interesting developments regarding the love-triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. For me, the ending to this was very satisfactory, although all may not agree. This book presents tragedy on an epic scope, yet its worth may be akin to that of 1984. In this respect, the savior of humanity against evil has the very danger of succumbing to temptation only to become as dangerous as the original evil.     There is no question this series as a whole was spectacular. Despite some parts of \\"Mockingjay\\" simply feeling rushed or uninspired, it remains a fitting conclusion to a spectacular series that presents a lesson all can benefit from heeding.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|I have to admit that I am writing this having already read \\"Wise Man's Fears\\" and this does affect my rating of this book - I'll explain why later.    First and foremost, The Name of the Wind is actually fairly well written, flows well, and despite being very slow at times reads quickly and easily and I enjoyed reading it.    Problem is that it goes nowhere. The ending feels abrupt and is not really an ending as such. It really feels like nothing more than an arbitrary stopping point. At the end of the book you are left with nothing but loose ends and the hope that the next book will take care of them and build on the events that have occurred.    Well - book 2 does not address any of the loose ends, the things that felt like filler in Name of the Wind turn out to be just that.    The problem with \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is that once you realize that 90% of what you are reading is just filler the whole book falls apart. There is no reason for the great detail that is given to the vast majority of the events as they are irrelevant. Whole chapters could have been ripped out of this book without the reader noticing.    As a series this is turning into a slow unrewarding trudge through a series of uninteresting and unimportant events. Between the 1500+ pages of Book 1 and 2 nothing at all is resolved and not a single story line is completed. Still at the University, still single and still feuding with a rich kid...
0142418471|5.0|I have loved John Green's books since \\"An Abundance of Katherines.\\"  He had a little help with this novel as David Levithan wrote half the book.  They alternate chapters, each with a different Will Grayson.  Green takes the odd numbered chapters and Levithan writes the even numbered chapters.  Their Will Graysons are different yet similar as they are both teenage boys living in Chicago and dealing with the usual teenager angst.  Levithan's Grayson; however, is very depressed and in the beginning a little too emo for me but eventually I came around to liking him.  Green's Grayson was an immediate favorite although he was overshadowed by his best friend, Tiny Cooper.  Tiny is the true star of this novel.  Tiny is huge, gay and over the top in everything.  I couldn't help but fall in love with Tiny as does everyone.<br /><br />Green's Grayson has two rules:  1) Don't care too much and 2) Shut up.  Both of these are really hard to live by and have Tiny has your best friend.  Levithan's Grayson goes through life seeing it as nothing good ever happens in his life, except when he meets a boy online named Isaac.  Then one night the two Will Graysons meet and their worlds collide.  Things begin to happen to both Will Graysons that are unexpected and delightful.  It was a wonderful book and I finished it in one night.  I wish I hadn't now because I want to hear more about Tiny's life and adventures.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

1439196834|4.0|Barney Stinson is the greatest character on How I Met Your Mother, no doubt about it. This book simply provides more for those Barney fans who can't get enough of him on the show. However, it is not as good as \\"The Bro Code\\" so I only rated it a four star item. Pick this up if you like the Bro Code!
031603441X|5.0|Read this start to finish non-stop.  A remarkably candid, but intelligent and well written tome.  Recommended to all, musician and non-musician alike.   Along with Andy Summer's Autobio, perhaps the most interesting famous rock-musician book I've seen.
0316098337|5.0|This was such an original book.  While the premise was dark it seemed light and hopeful being told by a 5 year old. At times it began to drag on, but then it would turn, and you had to continue. So interesting-thought provoking-I will recommend this book to everyone.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|when i saw the preveiw for this movie i thought ok this girl is going to make an alternate world in which she and he freinds journey to find a way out of their a mental hospital flashing back between that world and the mental hospital. when i saw the actual film i felt like throwing up. instead of her going into this cool world where she has to fight to live she goes to a dance studio WTF. the trailer dosent make it out to what its supposed to be. when she goes into the world where she has to fight is when she dances.ridiculous. then by the end of the movie everyone is dead then a man she invisioned in her fight world is really a real person? thats not the worst. the main character, babydoll,dosne't talk for the first half hour i though she couldn't then when she finally does talk i see the cgi and i just think this belongs in a 2001 movie not a movie from 2010. they look like the same technology as finding nemo. then the last over talk of the narrator tells you to fight? WTF i had no idea what was going on what so ever. the second i fnished it i wanted to chuck the dvd out out my window because i just felt like i wanted that disgrace out of my house. but not only that they call this a modern take on alice in wonderland. really, really. this movie goes on my top ten... of worst films.

1933492953|5.0|There are a great many guides available for both composition and making comics, but I've never seen one that combined the two concepts as perfectly as Framed Ink.  This book provides a much-needed missing link that goes beyond composition of single images and frames them in the context of a sequential work.  Mateu-Mestre shows us how to start with the story first, so the drawings serve the narrative and not the other way around, how to shape mood, indicate motion and character relationships, and create a sense of continuity between images and scenes.  His lively illustrations are beautiful, but they're also a great way to put theory into action -- each example includes thumbnails to show the effect of light/dark masses and lines of tension.  This helps the reader understand how to break down each component of a drawing and make purposeful choices to best aid the story, rather than stumbling upon solutions by accident.  His explanations are clear, and you come away excited to apply his lessons to your own work.  A wonderful book.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The album has a sound that resembles albums of the the early 90's, one because they recorded on tape and two Dave Grohl is a musical genius.  Every song is great, written well and played amazingly.  This is the best rock album i've herd in over 10 years.
0375842209|5.0|After hearing so many wonderful things about this book, I had expected to pick it up and not be able to put it down, but that isn't how it was at all. For starters, I bought the book, then let it sit on my shelf for a few weeks. Then, I started reading, got bored, and put it down for another month or two before trying again.<br /><br />\\"But you gave it five stars,\\" you're saying to this review. Am I right? Am I? Yes. I gave it five stars because once I truly got into this novel it was worth every ounce of boredom I initially experienced. It seems I've read a lot of books lately that start brilliantly but end in a way that makes me angry or disappointed. Some of them play with my emotions in ways that make me feel manipulated by the author, others are nothing more than fluff, but this book . . . well, this book was meat--a full meat and potatoes meal, with rolls, warm gravy, and a satisfying desert. Not a sweet desert, maybe something more like key lime pie, because the ending wasn't happy, but felt real. And the true beauty of this novel is that it brought tears to my eyes on a number of occasions but didn't leave me feeling like the author was toying with my emotions because they could.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I joyned the missminimalist.org crowd only recently and this helped me to catch up on all the great and inspirational thoughts from Miss Minimalist :) Thank You, Francine !
0525423273|4.0|This book was super cute. I think it's great the idea was birthed during National Novel writing month. The characters are endearing, the parents are particularly well developed. And they aren't your typical in-the-background \\"supportive type\\" parents. They have their issues and it's interesting to see how the main characters deal with them. The suspense in this novel is done really well, Stephanie Perkins holds stuff back for just the right amount of time to keep stuff interesting.
0385736002|5.0|It seems reviewers always forget a MAJOR aspect when reading a series, especially a YA fiction series.......................... You will NEVER get all the answers in the first book!!!!!!!!!! DUH!!!! If it's a series it's MEANT to be broken in to lots of pieces and make you wonder the obvious. JK Rowling did it with Harry and many other authors have done it with their respective series'. Repetition is also consistent in many FIRST books of a series to make sure you remember WHO your reading about, the role in the story this character portrays, and the importance of remembering details.<br /><br />This series cannot be compared to Harry Potter!!!!!!!!! These are two different storylines and two different types of authors! M.T.S. is a REAL historian, while Rowling had a story come to her on napkins in a cafe. Both found inspiration in COMPLETELY different ways!!<br /><br />I find the book to be a breath of fresh air. Historical figures left and right, good introduction for a first part in a series, and true to style in the YA Fiction world (grown ups get over yourselves and your supposed intelligence level). The twins represent a ying and yang (silver and gold) in my opinion being very different but alike at the same time. The guidance provided by Nicholas and his band of friends, mysterious as they all are, keeps it interesting as well.<br /><br />When you start a book, no matter how hard, FINISH IT!! Then, and only then, will your review have any kind of significant weight.
0385341008|4.0|This book started out a bit slow but was worth every bit of extra effort to get to the ending. By far one of the most romantic books I have ever read!
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Been years since I had seen it and wanted it for my collection and I still enjoyed every moment of this futuristic flick. When there is only moments to save the Earth... There is FLASH GORDON!!!!
0440241901|4.0|I wanted to give this book five stars because I loved it. From the quirky voice of the narrator to the funny somewhat predictable story. It was a completly fun book to read. Not only that but it was written in first person, present tense, which really put me in the shoes of the protagonist.<br /><br />But, I just couln't give it that extra star because of all the bad language. Sheesh, does anyone write without taking the name of God in vain five times on every page anymore. And without using the S word and the B word. See, I can't even write those words. How pathetic is that!<br /><br />Now I'm just complaining to complain -- really, it was a very good book. I enjoyed it and would have enjoyed it even more had it been just a tad cleaner
B0050CQY1W|4.0|Ambitious, bold, impressive... Beyonce takes risks here and most of them work! Her best album yet and thanks to Amazon I got it the next day after I ordered it! Life is good!
159514188X|4.0|I had a little trouble at first, switching between past tense in italics and present tense in regular print. The flow of this book is kind of broken up a bit by the way the author has merged two voices together, but once I got used to the effect, I had to admit this was one of the most gripping books I have ever read.<br /><br />I hated the girl, Hannah Baker, at the beginning because of what she'd done. Not because she'd committed suicide, but because she had made tapes about why she did it and then blackmailed all those she felt were responsible into listening to them. It just seemed so cruel and vindictive. Even at the end, I still thought it was cruel and vindictive, but I really like the narrator, Clay, and how he learned from the tapes and moved on with his life.<br /><br />It just goes to show what happens to us isn't what matters, but how we handle it. Over all it was a good read, and I'm glad I read it.
B0046E825G|5.0|I really liked the book. It was hard to put down. I did not exspect what happened,happened. There has to be more to the story. If I were Bella, I could have not been able to make the decision she did. But, she never lost either of them so I quess she had her cake and ate it too. I can't wait untill the movie comes out. It is a MUST SEE!!!!!
0938045695|5.0|If you intend to train with kettlebells, this book should be part of your training strategy. The information is invaluable.
1400079144|3.0|The premise of using symbols from the Masons sounded clever but in the end, it was done far better in one of those National Treasure movies.  The bad guy was so over the top bad, he was just plain silly!  Robert Langdon was plain tedious -- between the constant references to his claustrophobia or his inability to get with the program about what was happening.  If he said \\"I don't understand\\" once, he said it a thousand times -- each and every time he came across something mysterious and out of the ordinary.  You'd think by the fifth or tenth time, he would know he's not in Kansas anymore, but no, I don't understand!  Also, the other main characters are paper thin - one after a horrendous mutilation and loss of a son, still takes the time to explain the still undisclosed mystery to Langdon in the Masonic library -- before thinking of going to the hospital or grieving for his son, or if he didn't care for him -- calling a funeral home.  Listened to it on audio when I had nothing else to do mostly to learn the resolution, which was not very interesting in the end.

0061784788|4.0|Like all the Sigma stories, The Devil's Colony is a quick, fun read that hurtles through a globe spanning adventure  powered by an historical mystery threatening global cataclysm. The heroes are true to form while some of the enemies are a little more nuanced and sympathetic than usual. And in the end all is [at least momentarily] well.<br /><br />I do want to say something about a topic other reviewers have used as a reason for skewering this book- its e-book price. I too am disturbed by the fact that the hard cover edition is actually cheaper [at this writing] than the kindle or Nook price. This seems to fly in the face of the rationale for digital books, and I can understand the anger of those who are boycotting over this. However, I did buy this book and feel that its content deserves a fair treatment. It's price is what it is, and whether you choose to pay it or not will probably not be influenced by a good review if you feel the cost is just inherently unfair.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it combines the Founding Fathers with Native American History, adds some Mormonism and finishes it off with a Lost Tribe of Israel, all tied together by nanotechnology and yet Rollins makes it work so that you find yourself reading \\"just one more chapter\\" until the book is too quickly finished.<br /><br />Has the author entered that cook book stage which usually dooms ongoing series to boredom, or at least predictability? To some extent yes, though he tries to keep his characters somewhat fresh by fleshing out their personal lives, and occasionally adding a new member to the team. But it is his ability to find new historical mysteries to exploit which keeps me coming back for more.<br /><br />All in all, Rollins remains a guilty pleasure, a diversion from both the mundane chores of life, and the real dramas and even life threatening situations which are taking place throughout our very tumultuous world. At least with Rollin's world we get some closure, even if it only lasts until the next book.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|This album is a classic by the great Alan Parsons Project.  Simply outstanding! One of the best progressive rock albums ever released.  A must to all progressive rock lovers and collectors.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|The script, acting, and quality are all flawless, as far as television goes. If you're looking to be highly entertained, then look no further. The subtle humor, creative plot, and enjoyable dialogue entices the viewer more with each passing moment.    If you're into legal shows that include all aspects of human nature, including compassion, then Suits is for you.    Hopefully this show continues to have the opportunity to thrive; it has definitely drawn me in and I won't miss a second of it.

B004ZQRJFO|5.0|This album is sick. best collab album of all time. If you like Eminem or Royce you have to get this, they amp each other up. Don't pirate it, actually buy it. I love all the tracks, except Above the Law (because the chorus in that song is literally unbearable) and I don't like Loud Noises (because Slaughterhouse sucks and the song is annoying, even though I liked Eminem and Royce's parts, but Slaughterhouse were just AWFUL on it.) The parts where that song leads up and then goes \\"Slaughterhouse!!\\" makes me sick it's so annoying. but aside form those two this album is pure gold. You have to get this.
034552554X|2.0|First I want to say that I like the title of this book, but while it is an engaging read, it suffers from some very weak plot points especially in the second half of the book.<br /><br />This is the story of Victoria, and we the readers get to follow her journey to self acceptance and love. This book also shows how hard it is for children raised in the foster care system. Once Victoria is 18 she gets emancipated by the state, then she has three months to find a job or else she gets evicted. Instead Victoria spends that time looking for flowers and planting a small garden in a secluded spot in one of the parks around. So when 3 months have passed and she hasn't found a job, she gets evicted and is homeless for months, before finding a job at a flower shop run by a woman called Renata. And that's how this book begins.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br />The problem being that Victoria is a very frustrating heroine. She brought her problems in her adult life on herself, for no reason. The book falls apart when Victoria finds out she is pregnant, and instead of telling Grant, who loved her so patiently and quietly, she runs away and leaves his place and her flourishing job at the flower shop (it also bears mentioning that I didn't like Grant and Victoria's first intimacy). Then she is homeless for months, even knowing that Grant is looking for her desperately. So she finds out she is pregnant, and because she is scared she leaves her job, and Grant without telling him (i.e all means of support) to be homeless?! It makes no sense to me.<br /><br />She then returns to her blue room and gives birth to her baby girl, and once again the story stops making sense. So mother Ruby (Renata's mother) birthed Victoria's baby in Victoria's small blue room, and yet she doesn't think to check if Victoria has food in the house and change of cloths, and diapers for the baby? Victoria almost starved to death in the house and all her acquaintances Renata, mother Ruby, or Marlena didn't think to get her food when they visited! And she didn't think to give them money and ask them to get her food either. It just doesn't make sense at all!...and so on...<br /><br />Basically this book featured a frustrating heroine, characters who interacted with each other in a sort of stilted way, and several parts of this book did not make sense.<br /><br />But I did enjoy all the talk about the flowers. I enjoyed learning their meanings. The one thing that I loved about this book, is that the author (under the title Victoria's flower dictionary) included a flower dictionary at the end of the book! I thought it was a great touch to end with- it was my favorite part of this book, and it is what caused me to add another star to my rating. I just wish that this book had a more cohesive storyline and characters.o get her food when they visited! And she didn't think to give them money and ask them to get her food either.

B0055FR5PS|3.0|In the comfort of your own home. The previews got me hyped for some serious alien interaction that never comes and we know pretty soon exactly how the bitches will be defeated. I wouldn't be surprised if this film got some dosh from the armed forces, it'll make you want to join the marines within the first 19 minutes, if you didn't want to already. I have to note that Eckhart is impressive as a soul-crushed soon-to-be-retired-but-ha!-not-yet commander, and I could never tell if the cold glint in his eyes was CGI or actually, well, acting. But there's great explosions and it's left open for a sequel in which a young Hispanic man leads the rebellion against the ruthless, faceless aliens who killed his sweet dad 10 years earlier. But, y'know, maybe not, especially because that Spielberg pic coming out looks AWESOME. Let's look forward to that, shall we?
0316286850|4.0|I'm 30 years old and the only make up I know how to do properly is one eyeliner technique. Sad isn't it? ;)  This book is filled with vital information about the basics, and a bit more advanced, of how to apply make-up. Obviously getting the result he has pictured takes practice, but since acquiring this book, I've never looked better. I enjoy putting on makeup now, whereas before I hated it. I've always had the same look. (on dark features) Black eyeliner, maybe some eye shadow and lip balm. He's got me wearing lipstick! He's the female friend I've never had, one who knows how to apply make-up and how to explain it!  This also makes a great coffee table book for people into theater, make-up, fashion, or any of the arts.
0345529057|5.0|First of all, I do not feel it is fair to rate this product 1 or 2 stars based on the fact that the Kindle version has issues/is more expensive. This page is not solely about the e-book, its about The Four Book Collection itself. Therefore, that's what I'll be reviewing...<br /><br />As far as the actual condition of the product, great. The books and their sleeve came shrink wrapped nice and safely to my doorstep. The print isn't too small, the pages aren't tissue paper-y or anything. They did, however, come in the wrong order. So be sure you don't mistakenly start reading the wrong book!<br /><br />As far as the novel itself goes, phenomenal. If you enjoy drama, fantasy, mystery, intrigue, and/or action... you'll love these books. When reading the book (I'm about a third of the way through the first book and watched the first season of the HBO series) I was mostly reminded of Lord of the Rings and anything set around the Arthurian Legends. Particularly a novel called \\"The Mists of Avalon\\". That book features the female characters from the King Arthur tales. A Game of Thrones also has many strong female characters. It is a long series- which means you get a lot of pages to learn about and grown attached to the people in the novel. And you will find yourself becoming very animated as the book progresses :P<br /><br />Anyways, I'm going to go ahead and assume that if you are looking at this product you already have a decent knowledge of the books... and if not, there are probably far better reviews out there on the web for you to read. So I'll leave my review at that.<br /><br />In short, this is a great physical product, and a great read as well. Highly recommended.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|I have never written a review on amazon, but when i seen this movie didnt get 5 stars i had to write one. Dont let these other reviews ruin the movie. It is genius. Dont ask details about it before hand and dont expect a horror flick and you will love it. Trust me. It is the best movie to come out in a long time and very well bugeted. Please give this film a chance. If you dont like it let me know if thats possible. but like i said i didnt put any details of the actual movie because its best not to know anything about it before you watch Triangle.
0470913029|5.0|The sale went perfectly.  The book was interesting, informative, funny at times and an easy, quick read.  I would definitely suggest it to anyone interested in running, outdoor adventure or just a cool story.
055357342X|2.0|Ok...So I LOVED the first 2 books and I understood when certain things happened to certain people and breaking molds that other fantasy series seemed to make, aka good guy always winning...but do NOT get me so emotionally involved and cheering for someone and then have them killed. Im left with ONE...ONE person I even care to read about now and thats Jon Snow. Im tempted to just start skipping the other chapters cause Im done giving a damn about everyone else, you've left me with little girls and boys and a dwarf, and some hot girl a thousand miles away that should be its own series/book as i keep feeling it just doesnt fit anymore. Im really disappointed and dont know if ill be reading the next book or even bothering with buying the new one. This book really ruined it for me, there was a line and to me this book crossed it and now the story just got utterly boring and pointless... Thanks for ruining it for me. Enjoy your series, Ill watch the first and second seasons on HBO then im done.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book has the pacing of Thomas Perry at his best, the read-ability of Stephen King at his shortest and a protagonist worth of \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" fans.  I could not put it down! What a smart, exciting, fascinating book.  Who is SJ Watson and why is he/she not writing more?
B001POX73C|5.0|This is a fun, feel-good book with some entertaining characters. Georgette's attention to historical detail really makes it feel authentic. I have read it twice since I have just purchased it, I look forward to rereading it again and again. A must read for those who appreciate a Regency romance with flair and wit.
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|Extremely fun but no pictures save of my catch. Other than that, I recommend this to anyone, and I haven't fished in over 20 years.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Updated the old app and my antivirus software said that ithis one has been reported as being malicious, so I uninstalled it.
B001NA4CMI|3.0|We paid over 3 times more to buy the Special Edition that included a downloadable Digital Copy only to find out that the Digital Copy expired in 2009.  Amazon originally suggested that we return the item subject to an extra restocking fee because we had opened the package.  They recluctantly agreed to refund the difference between the special edition and the basic movie.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|This book sort of made me feel like I was being pulled along by a thin thread. The concept of the novel: a young woman is kidnapped, subsequently raped, and gives birth in a backyard prison, sounds like the stuff of greatness. However, all I got from the book was an abnormal relationship between a desperate mother and her breast-fed five year old. The characters had absolutely no depth, and there was no exploration of any of the deeper issues merely touched upon in the book. A disappointment.
B000000XB9|3.0|I bought this, together with Volume 2 at a great price from another place.  My only complaint about this set is that part 1 of Suzie-Q is on Volume 1 and part 2 is on Volume 2.  What idiot thought it would be a great idea to split a song onto 2 separate discs?
0312360258|3.0|I went into this novel with low hopes but and open mind. I had read reviews that talk about how bad the novels are and how they are not Twilight(why would they want to be), rip off Twilight( not like the story was an original), and are badly written(some saying read Twilight instead, like it is written so well). But aside from the obviously intentional bad grammar, use of language and stereotypical cliches the story was a good one. I do not expect much when it comes to YA because the authors want to cater to their niche. I do not think that most of these authors intend their work to stand the test of time, so the influx of pop culture did not jar me from the story. I found it to be a well-thought out foray into the vampire world.<br /><br />Zoey is a sixteen year old girl who gets marked, that is triggered to go to the House of Night. A vampyre finishing school that readies fledglings, teens going through the change, to become a vampyre. If one does not go to the house of night and be among the adult vampyres, their bodies reject the change and die. Zoey in her Native-American-ness is special and chosen by the vampyre goddess Nyx. She has a filled in mark, unheard of in the vampire community. She also experiences feelings and changes that only an adult vampyre would. She enters the house of night and begins the journey into what the goddess wants her to be. The book was a good read, it is cohesive and the lore is explained in the actual novels. While the novel does have underlying connotations, the message is a good one. The heroine is not perfect and the people around her, nor her goddess expect her to be.<br /><br />The story is unique, the vampyre gene is triggered so that they are not made but born. The vampyres are strong and different yet not so much that they are immortal. I like that it is the tattoo that tells of their difference and not extremely pale skin and dead eyes. I also like the indication of a Goddess and affinities with nature and animals. The things that make this book not as good are the way the characters are developed. I will give whiny Zoey a pass this book because she has had a hard life with her parents. Plus she is a teenager chosen to be special when all she wants is to fit in. But the way Heath, Damien, Stevie Ray, etc are written is pure stereotypical cliche. Zoey takes AP biology, Shaunee comes from a private school; yet they flounder at Damien's vocabulary? He is using words most teenagers of sixteen years should have comes across. I know the world sees teens as superficial, cliche, and whiny but you do not have to make them that way to sell a book.this book not as good are the way the characters are developed.

0793518326|5.0|The most comprehensive book of Beatles music, this is the end all. Transcriptions are perfect, all instruments are transcribed, and it still gives guitar tab and chord boxes for those so notationally inclined.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|This classic novel is a must read for everyone. I found it to be well written and most entertaining. Isn't it wonderful that we live in an age where books can be stored on a computer. Amazon.com is better than a bricks and morter bookstore, if you ask me.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I like the game but it crashes my phone. It takes way too long load. It does not have a convenient pause button. It has lost my saved file and that caused me to start all over again. For a game that is designed to kill time it needs to be more smooth and quicker.
B001E45XT4|4.0|Great headset, well worth the price, lasted me for several months now with no issues whatsoever, I'll probably upgrade to a nice 100+ pair soon though
B0034G4ORC|1.0|I only watched this show because of Eckhart, I have really enjoyed his films in the past, but this was a very pedestrian performance. The sad thing is that a team of well trianed monkeys could have made a better screen play, the dialogue was pretty much cut and pasted from the other hundred thousand war movies. Same old regurgitated crap.
B004NELBPC|3.0|Pros:  -easy to navigate  -great content    Cons:  -the ads tend to flash bright colors, which makes the articles hard to read    Summary:  Unless you can ignore the unusually invasive ads, I don't recommend it.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|This app is very entertaining. I played it everyday for about a week before completing the highest level currently available.
B0055FR5PS|1.0|This movie had potential as a great action flick - but in the end leaves you empty and wondering why you just paid money to rent it. The aliens looked like they would be bad ass from the beginning of the movie but ended up just being walking octopus with weapons and for the most part looking very cheesy and lifeless. The dialog had its corky moments that left you rolling your eyes way to often and wondering when the movie would end. I was greatly disappointed in this movie and would recommend my most recent positive rental - the outlander - as a scfi action alternative that want leave you with a dark void to fill.
0060855924|5.0|Far away, in a land shaped like a saucer, which sits balanced on the backs of four elephants, who in turn ride the shell of a giant, deep space-swimming turtle (gender unknown)...live Rincewind and Twoflower. Diehard cynic and failed wizard, Rincewind is bound to Twoflower (Discworld's first ever tourist) by fate. (The magistrate's threat if Twoflower should come to any harm might also have had something to do with it...)  Together the two set out to follow Twoflower's insatiable appetite for adventure, danger, and whatever other legendary predicaments strike his fancy--and end up towed in the wake of his uncanny penchant for trouble. In fact, if not for the undying devotion of Twoflower's sapient (and apparently carnivorous) pearwood luggage, neither character could make it through the dragons, the inferno, the 8-legged demon, shipwreck, or kidnapping mayhem that ensue. Finally, washed up at the end of the world, it's up to their combined (and questionable) wits to save them from virtual annihilation...  ____________________________________________________________________________________  Packed with a brilliant combo of sparking wit and superb writing, it's no wonder this first installment of the Discworld bibliography spawned the 38-odd books that followed...and their devoted fans. Hilarious, adventurous, inventive, but above all precise, even in its absurdity, Pratchett's prose provides not only some welcome relief from the conventional fantasy world, but is first-rate reading all on its own.  I highly recommend this to those seasoned fantasy-lovers looking to investigate the roots, influences, and permutations of today's otherworldly fiction--or just those seeking something truly original, witty, and lighthearted. While I do think a younger reader would get a kick out of the superficial storyline, the satiric undercurrent of its humor, as well as some mature content, really make it a more satisfying read for the older bibliophile. In fact, the more you know ofthe allusions contained (Rincewind's wizardly problems are a cracked mirror to those of LeGuin's Ged, for instance), the more fun it becomes.     **This is the only Discworld title \\"to be continued.\\" It is finished in The Light Fantastic. If you intend on speeding through this title--which, if you're anything like me, you will--I recommend having the second book handy, to avoid frustration. The first ends...well, abruptly, as is absolutely fitting, considering the circumstances.**    (This review was originally published at <...>)
B003XD7ECI|4.0|i finally got a chance to hear this full album today. i had already heard the tracks SILENCE and IF I HAD A WISH through the videos on youtube, but the rest of the album had been a mystery to me. finally today i downloaded each song individually and arranged them into album running order and listened to it. all i can say is WOW! this is a truly fantastic piece of melodic hard rock/metal mastery. every song is a winner. no filler here. each song is instantly enjoyable and could be a single in it's own right. this album is full of heart, soul, and emotion and takes you to a different place in your mind. that and it just puts a smile on your face.  the voices of kiske and somerville sound fantastic on this recording and the music is written and played well by the musicians on this album, including magnus and mat from PRIMAL FEAR.  all in all, this is a great album for any fan of melodic hard rock and metal. it's a nice break from the uber-heavy things that are out nowadays. i sincerely hope they release another album together soon. pick this cd up, you wont be disappointed.
0312323867|3.0|I didn't read 'Something Borrowed' before I read this book, not sure if it would have changed my experience.<br /><br />I wish I could say I liked this book more than I did. My first flaw with it is that I hate stories where lifelong female amigas backstab one another by sleeping with eachother's boyfriends/fiances. Yes, I know at the end of the book, Darcy analyzes it all, but it still makes me cringe a bit.<br /><br />Now about Darcy - her arrogant, childish manners grated on my last nerve and it felt like this went of for half of the book. Even so, I put up with it because I knew something would happen that would trigger a change in her, but when it did come, it just didn't seem big enough. I expected a huge crash-and-burn, but it all boiled down to was - a conversation.<br /><br />One calm scolding from her friend Ethan, and suddenly she became a madeover angel with a heart of gold. I felt the transformation was too fast and forced.<br /><br />But - I'm a sucker for happy endings! I loved Ethan and the way he slowly warmed up to her. Out of everyone, he had the guts to shove the proverbial mirror in her face. I liked that he didn't let her manipulate him the way she did with her other men, even if they did end up dumping her. My favorite part was her trip to the OB/GYN when she recieved her first ultrasound and learned about her bonus prize.<br /><br />The writing was clean, colorful and smooth. Even though I didn't like this book as much as 'Love The One You're With' (another title of hers), I am crazy curious to read 'Something Borrowed!'
1442419814|3.0|This was a fun and quick read for me. The future world that Scott Westerfeld created was very intriguing and described so well that I felt I could imagine it perfectly in my head. There was clearly a contrast between Uglyville (dull, boring, etc.) and New Pretty Town (fun, colorful, exciting).    The premise of Uglies is very sad: Tally spends her whole life pining for the time when she turns 16 so she can be \\"pretty\\" and go live in New Pretty Town to finally have fun. It's a representation of the importance society puts on looks, but it also reflects the feelings of teens who just want to fit in. Tally doesn't want to be the prettiest girl after her surgery, she just wants to look like the rest of the popular kids who live in New Pretty Town. Sameness is desired while uniqueness is seen as ugly with no exceptions.    I think Scott Westerfeld did a good job making his point though I wish there was a little more explanation of the world Tally lives in. For instance, I'm not sure what the deal is with the adults in this world. Her parents and teachers seem to be just as clueless as Tally. Apparently that's just the way life is in this world, but I'm still wondering why?    A great idea for a book, this story just needs a little more fine tuning for me.
B003TZ9EGO|5.0|I purchased this Lady Gaga CD as a gift for my niece.  She loves it!  I must admit,I kind of enjoy it myself. [[ASIN:B003TZ9EGO The Remix]]
0060557818|1.0|[Audiobook Version] When a modern Londoner meets a dirty, starving girl, who is wolfing down a grilled cat-on-a-stick, and his reaction is to say - \\"Hi, I'm Richard. What's your name?\\" (not, \\"What in the _____ are you doing with that _____--ing cat!\\"), that's the moment you know something just ain't right about \\"Neverwhere.\\"  This story defies the imagination - not to mention the reality of human nature - in many, many  ways.  There's lots of pointless, pedestrian movement, as weird characters pursue other weird characters from one weird place to another, but very little of it advances the story, reveals characters' motives, or overcomes obstacles -  all things real \\"action\\" is supposed to do. What's more, the book seems to be aimed at pre- teenagers, who would gobble up the creepy landscape and give not a flip about the sloppy, comic-book dramatics, but who would give kids a book laced with the f-word and crude sexual references? Not me!     As for the author's narration - he sounds like he's reading to 5-year-olds with his constant pauses (so his dimwitted listeners can keep up with him) and his wink-wink emphasis on lines (as though they're laden with sly jokes we're all too dumb to get).  After an hour of hearing every line of dialogue  - from the horrifying to the mundane - being delivered in an oh-you-big-silly tone, I thought someone needed to tell this emperor he doesn't have any clothes!  Perhaps I'll listen to this book again someday, after I've knocked back a few, and then maybe this writer and I will be on the same plane.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I enjoyed Fawlty Towers many years ago on PBS.  It's been fun to watch them over again...they're still funny.  When I don't have time to watch a full length movie, I can watch one or two episodes.  I'm sorry they only made a few episodes.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|So the movie wasn't total crap, but not at all original.  I kept comparing it to the 1985 movie The Company of Wolves [[ASIN:B00006G8H3 The Company of Wolves]]which I really did like, despite it's age.  Nice idea for a movie, but could have been better.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|A truely beautiful short film based on the childrens book, \\"The Gruffalo\\". It played on cable during the Christmas holiday 2010 and we were able to DVR it. My children (boy aged 5 and girl aged 3) ask to watch it about once a week, especially if we read the story at bedtime. I personally like to watch it, and most of their shows I cant stand. The movie uses only the words from the book, and does an excellent job retelling it. It shows the circle of life, where every creature in the \\"deep dark wood\\" is being eaten by something else; mouse sees all this and comes up with a plan to escape the same fate. An excellent story, we just  love it. I cant wait for the DVD to come out - Im sick of fast forwarding past all the commercials.
B001HQZKF6|5.0|Very strong Blu Ray from THE POLICE: Content, Audio, Video quality is all good. The concert itself and the various versions of the classic POLICE songs are very thrilling. VOICES INSIDE MY HEAD sounds amazing. I was really happy with the extra features and the fact that both a 5.1 and 2.0 mix were included. I like watching concerts in 2.0 even though I have 5.1 system and it certainly is a good thing for those who only have 2.o stereo set-ups so that they can avoid any loss in audio quality in the down-mix process.<br /><br />My only splitting hairs criticism is that the audio is not raw umcompressed PCM (it is DOLBY TRUEHD); they say that DOLBY TRUE HD and DTS HD MASTER are as good as PCM in theory but in practice PCM sound better because it is uncompressed, very high bit-rate and is not a variable bit-rate codec.<br /><br />Overall a superb purchase! Nice to see THE POLICE reunite for tour! Hope they do it again![[ASIN:B001HQZKF6 Certifiable-Deluxe (Blu-Ray)]]
B001PPLIFU|4.0|This is not a plot/character driven movie, it is an action movie. So if you aren't particularly fond of action, you'll probably want to skip this one. The plot is incoherent, and the characters paper thin and dull. But the action, oh the action...<br /><br />My beef with most current action movies is the over-reliance on cgi and the tendency for animators to completely ignore physics. When something looks real on screen and the cgi invisible, it has much more impact for me, and I think for most people. Anyone remember in Blade II when Wesley Snipes has a scene where it alternates between fantastic choreographed fighting and 100% CGIed Wesley and his opponents. The CGI ruined what could have been a great scene by making it laughably cartoonish.  By contrast, The Dark Knight was such a good movie in part because Nolan made a conscious decision to use as little cgi as possible, Quantum has the same ethos.<br /><br />At its core, the action sequences are real, and Craig does most of it himself (you should watch the bonus features to see one particularly bond crunching jump he did off an Italian roof). The real action is then modified by the cgi team to remove things like harnesses, guy wires, scaffolding etc. They do not change the basic action, there are no moments when Bond becomes a comic book hero doing things that no human could do. When he lands, you feel it. It is such a refreshing movie in that way and allows the viewer to enter the world.<br /><br />So if you are like me, and are tired of cgi excess but still like a good action movie, you should watch this one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read this when it was first published for the book club I had just joined.  I was expecting something cheerful.  I was also suffering from severe depression.  Although I thought the book was excellent; well written and engaging, I will never read it again because it absolutely haunted me.  I would remember the last lines of the book at odd times and just cry and cry.
B0042YHC38|5.0|I decided to take a gamble and buy this armband.  I made this decision based on the following:<br />-Adidas reputation for quality design and materials<br />-My experience with Adidas gear (shoes, glasses, clothing)<br />-Griffin's reputation for quality products<br />-amazon.co.uk reviews of this product<br /><br />As soon as it arrived I immediately opened the package for first impressions.  I was immediately impressed with how thin and lightweight it was.  I wondered if the fact that it's not made of stretchy material would reduce it's effectiveness as others have fairly commented.  My only experience with iPod armbands in the past was the type which had a dedicated silicon skin for the device which was designed to clip on to an elastic strap.  It worked but was far from ideal.  The Griffin/Adidas design is far superior to this other type of armband.<br /><br />The Griffin/Adidas armband is so thin that it conforms to your arm, even with the iPhone 4 in there.  I thought this was fantastic compared to how my old armband fit on my arm, and that was with a smaller and lighter iPod nano (1st Gen.)  I went for a quick 2 mile run before it got dark and I was completely satisfied with how this Griffin/Adidas armband performed.  It stayed in place and was comfortable, because of how closely it places the device to your arm.  I have zero complaints about this armband and will purchase one for my wife to use when she goes to the gym.  It's designe very well and is priced extremely well here at Amazon.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Paul McCartney plays in rock and roll bands since 1958 (Quarrymen) and this incredible man plays and sings very very very well and if you consider his age (69, birth 18th june), Paul McCartney can make the crawd sing togheter and make everybody enjoy and cry in his concerts.  Good Evening New York City was record live on old Shea stadium, now renamed, but it was the stage of historic beatles performance under 55000 fans on 1965´s concert.  This show (2009) have beatles, wings and solo paul and everybody needs this classic cd+dvd on your collection.
0439023521|5.0|This trilogy is probably some of the best literature that I have read in a long time. The story line is engaging and always keeps you guessing, the characters are well developed and real. There is not one moment in these books where I felt any dislike for them. Character driven with a protagonist that isn't a cookie cutter hero. These books are a great example of what young adults should be reading. These books are what give me hope for the future of literature, and are exactly the reason why I love to get lost in books.
B0013LPS8Y|5.0|War was the first u2´s album that became a great success.  Song like Sunday Bloody Sunday, new year´s day and \\"40\\" are on u2´s set list from 1983 to now in concerts.  But you can listen to others no classic songs but too important song for you history: Like a song, seconds, drowning man, two heart beats as one and surrender.  this DeLuxe version shows others songs in single version or remix and a marvelous booklet.
0345505387|2.0|I'm a BIG Diana Gabaldon fan and have read all of her books serveral times. Love the depth of her characters and her historical accuracy.  That being said, unless you've read The Outlander recently or more than once to remember all the little details, this \\"graphic novella\\" will make no sense what so ever. Didn't like it at all. The male characters looked so similar, it was difficult to tell them apart so, even knowing the story line it was very easy to get lost. And Claire was depicted like a Betty Boop type character; not real at all. Save your money for the next Outlander \\"real\\" book.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This review is for both the show and the blu-ray set. The show is fantastic. One of the best sci-fi shows ever produced, cut down way before it should have been. Fillion is incredible, but the show itself is also awesome. Re: the blu-ray set, it's also very good. High quality, cool extras, just well done. Highly recommended for existing fans, and certainly for anyone who has never seen the show...watch it! As soon as possible!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've only played this game for a few minutes so far, but I think I'm going to enjoy playing it.  First off, the graphics and sound are very cute and fun and it looks great on my tablet (big screen).  It plays in the portrait orientation only.  The game play is what I like in a video game.  I'm not a big game player, so I like a game I can pick up at any time and play for a few minutes and enjoy without being an expert at it.  So, like Angry Birds, it's easy to get into, but not so simple that it's boring because it has strategy involved in deciding which ropes to cut, and in which order, to get the candy to swing into the stars and ultimately into the monster's mouth.  I actually prefer this strategy to Angry Birds because there are more choices of how the problem can be attacked.  In any case, if you like Angry Birds, I think you'll like this one too. Perhaps even more.
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|I won't get into whose version is the best and why... In the end it all comes down to personal tastes. Richard Strauss is my favorite composer after Bach and Beethoven, and this recording by Norman is an example of sheer beauty. To think that Strauss wrote these at the end of a long and fruitful career is staggering. Like Melville, he still had the artistic touch... Certainly one of my top 10 favorite recordings, and maybe the number one...
B000LAZDQA|1.0|I cannot imagine any movie being worse than this one. Really. It was simply abominable.  Horrible dialogue, horrible acting. Senseless plot. I was transfixed and had to watch it all because I find it impossible that anyone could have made such a disaster.    Anyone who enjoyed this pathetic movie should have their head examined. I am astounded that anyone could have rated it more than a zero.
B002N2XHXU|5.0|Ishmael Beah was a typical Sierra Leonean teenager at 13 when he and his friends left home for a neighboring village to perform in a hip-hop demonstration and found himself caught in a civil war. He witnessed brutal atrocities committed by rebels in scorched villages and spent endless days and nights in flight before being recruited by the army as a boy soldier and becoming a ruthless, drug-addicted killing machine himself. At age 16, he was rescued from his combatant status by UNICEF and nongovernmental organizations, spending months in rehabilitation before becoming a spokesperson for peace.<br /><br />\\"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier\\" is a page-turner, a story of lost innocence readers are not likely to forget. The author's closing story so poignantly underscores the truth of killing: nobody wins.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I enjoyed this game and had almost every achievement. then, it deleted all of them and all my bought plants on level 5-9 second time through. Pretty annoyed.
0756404738|5.0|The Name of the Wind is, other than the Bible, my favorite book of all time. It just evoked something in me that I can't explain (and I'm not really going to try). It's a great story, phenomenally developed world and characters, and everything just came together perfectly. The Wise Man's Fear is more of the same. I can't say it's better than Name of the Wind, and it's certainly not worse. It just feels like a continuation of the story (which it is). Even though the story stands on its own, so much would be lost if you didn't read Name of the Wind first (and you should do that anyway...today. Right now. Go!). This book is just as awesome as the first, and I can't wait for further books in the series. All I can say is...if you haven't discovered Rothfuss yet, GO and get started NOW!
140004281X|4.0|I've never read Munro before, and purchased this one after seeing a rave review of \\"Runaway\\".  I have only read two or three of the short pieces so far, and find Munro to be a pleasant read, allowing me to do some easy pass-timing.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|We are still enjoying Supernatural and are on our last disk.  I think it is time to order Season 4 now!!! Yea
B0054JURZA|3.0|Bon Iver's sophomore album has the distinction of being not only indie-rock kids' most anticipated efforts of 2011, but one of the year's MOST anticipated efforts, period.  After contributing vocals to Kanye West's critical and commercial darling [[ASIN:B003X2O6KW My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]] in 2010, Bon Iver's stock greatly rose, making the ever inquisitive, curious music enthusiast (moi) curious of the artists and his sophomore release. Having never heard Bon Iver's debut [[ASIN:B0011HF6GE For Emma, Forever Ago]], a critical darling and favorite among indie circles (or so I am told), I won't compare 2011's [[ASIN:B004XE0P5E Bon Iver]] to anything but will judge it only as its own entity.  That stated, Bon Iver is a flawed album with some extraordinarily capable and credible moments.  The biggest flaw of Bon Iver is the ponderousness and sometimes emptiness of the material, which promotes more timbre and production over songwriting and structure.  If this album were judge solely on its sound arrangements and the grand and sparsity of the production work, it would be nearly flawless.  However, too many instances production and timbre take precedence over the `song' itself, which hurts Bon Iver ever so slightly.<br /><br />\\"Perth\\" opens up the album spacey, but beautifully with acoustic guitars.  Throughout, some memorable guitar riffs nudge their head bringing a sense of unity to the cut.  The snare drum work here is notable, serving as support for frontman Justin Vernon's vocal experiments.  Why \\"Perth\\" works so well is it's simplicity and creativity with sounds (timbre).  Follow-up cut \\"Minnesota, WI\\" isn't too shabby, though the `structure' of the song is perhaps too ambitious or devoid of a more accessible form.  Sure, this is `indie-rock' (despite the incredible numbers Bon Iver opened with), but still a few more hints to the listener as far as structure would have put \\"Minnesota, WI\\" over-the-top. On a positive note, Vernon sounds great exploiting his lower singing register, and the use of varied sounds is superb (saxophones, guitars, synthesizer, banjo, etc.)  \\"Holocene\\" steals the show from both \\"Perth\\" and \\"Minnesota, WI,\\" introducing the bizarre use of vibraphone and at times bowed vibraphone, usually more at home in either a jazz or  wind ensemble/orchestra setting.  Additionally, the use of reeds in tandem with one another (saxophones, clarinet) is sheer genius. Besides an excellently penned chorus (\\"and at once I knew I was not magnificent...I could see for miles, miles, miles...\\"), the songwriting as whole is among the best of the entire effort.<br /><br />\\"Towers\\" isn't bad, and the opening guitars dictate a faster tempo than the slower pace set by the first three cuts.  The pedal steel is a wonderful addition to the overall timbre here and marks a high point of this cut.  Additionally, the use of acoustic instruments is so nice (and rare) to hear, even sometimes on indie releases.  The quibble would be that \\"Towers\\" is a better `concept' than `song.' \\"Michicant\\" atones `big-time' with a nice six-feel established from the onset, contrasting the groove of previous cuts.  The vocal production surround Vernon's voice here sounds particularly well done here.  As far as the mix and production, it is some of the most refined and skilled of the album.  The most brilliant moment might be during Vernon's third verse, when two separate sets of saxophones are panned to the left and to the right.  \\"Hinnom, TX\\" is conceptual, but lacks being a true `song' as opposed to merely a `soundscape'; James Blake's self-titled debut effort ([[ASIN:B004CR5TD0 James Blake]]) similarly suffers from the ails Bon Iver suffers at times.  \\"Wash.\\" saves the day (and is arguably the second-best cut), featuring a superb, tender vocal performance by Vernon, oft-times accompanied by piano with use of strings (violin, viola) and pedal steel.  The harmonized vocals are a high point for certain.<br /><br />The final three cuts of Bon Iver are disappointing, causing the effort to sag and lose some of its zest.  \\"Calgary\\" sounds a bit too nebulous, lacking enough structure to truly allure or captivate its listener.  \\"Lisbon, OH\\" serves it purpose as an instrumental cut, but given the averageness of \\"Calgary,\\" it fails to rebuild support as Bon Iver tumbles the slightest bit.  Closing cut \\"Beth/Rest\\" cannot compare to the best cuts of the album (\\"Perth,\\" \\"Holocene,\\" \\"Michicant,\\" or \\"Wash.\\") and it closes the album less satisfactorily than it opened.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004XE0P5E Bon Iver]] is a flawed affair with some truly genius moments. Perhaps with some extra attention, Bon Iver could have been an even better affair.  Nonetheless, hardcore Bon Iver fans will be happy to add this effort next to For Emma, Forever Ago, even it underwhelms at times.using the effort to sag and lose some of its zest.  \\"Calgary\\" sounds a bit too nebulous, lacking enough structure to truly allure or captivate its listener.  \\"Lisbon, OH\\" serves it purpose as an instrumental cut, but given the averageness of \\"Calgary,\\" it fails to rebuild support as Bon Iver tumbles the slightest bit.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game is wonderfully done and tons of fun. The only complaint that I have (besides how addicting it is) is the fact that I cannot seamlessly intercept calls and texts and come back to gameplay. (I'm using a Sprint Samsung Epic Galaxy).
B0015DROBO|1.0|I rarely write a review, but this book really made me mad. I actually don't understand why on Earth I even finished it. Maybe I kept hoping for something ... some reason why \\"21 million copies\\" were sold. Well as many others said before: I do not get it. This book and its sub-par plot can be reduced from some 650 pages to about 50 without loosing ANY important piece of the story. The rest is just junk. Don't waste your time please.

B004XE0TDW|4.0|I'm sure there will be plenty of reviews of the album's music, , so I'll comment on the physical vinyl version itself.  This is a well-made album at a good price.  I bought mine from a local record store, and it was $18 (also came with a coupon inside the album cover for a free digital download of the entire album...not sure if the Amazon copy offers the same coupon inside, but I would assume so).  The album cover is attractive and includes a lyric booklet inside.  The cover also opens (hinged, rather than a plain cover) to reveal a second piece of original artwork.  The pressing is quality, and sounds as good as the digital copy on my Audio Technica AT-LP120 with a Shure M97xE cartridge.  If you enjoy Bon Iver and are looking for some mellow listening on vinyl, I recommend this album at this price.

1594484805|4.0|Daniel H. Pink's \\"Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\\" insists that business has it all wrong because it does not apply what science knows: that the human animal is motivated not by money or extrinsic gains but creative challenges or intrinsic considerations. Pink, the author of \\"A Whole New Mind: Why Right Brainers Will Rule the Future,\\" which I reviewed on this blog in an earlier post, claims that organizations have a greater chance of flourishing if they learn to tap into our natural tendency toward problem solving, self-development, and creative endeavors.<br /><br />The author uses the metaphor of the carrot (rewards) and the stick (punishment) as examples of twentieth-century thinking that no longer work in our society and economy. He refers to case studies from the business world to suggest the triumvirate of autonomy, mastery, and purpose are the clarion call of our time.

GREAT GAME!!!!! :-)
0199235694|4.0|As promised, this book is an excellent introduction to modern Japan. I found it succinct and informative when covering territory with which I was unfamiliar and accurate (if very brief) when delving into topics that I had previously explored in much greater depth. Succinct and enjoyable, an excellent resource even for those who already possess more than a passing familiarity modern Japan. I found it particularly elucidating on the subject of the lead-up to Japan's imperialist ambitions in Asia.
074356619X|5.0|I listen to this audio book every single day. It's such a great inspiration and helps you stay focused on the good things in life. My boss gave this to me and it's completely changed my life. I've battled depression my entire life and every time I feel an episode coming; I pop on any of the discs (it's a 4 disc pack) and whatever message starts, I feel like it's exactly what I needed to hear and it just clears up my mind completely.  I feel like it's my shield and my weapon against my depression. I'm not saying it's the only thing you'll need if you are also battling depression, what I'm saying is that it's a great help in fighting it; or should I say, in focusing on being happy. Can't say enough good things about this book; I also have the hard copy for when I can't listen to it. Worth every penny and much, much more.
B004J00KJ8|4.0|Four Weddings and a Funeral (comedy, romance, drama)<br />Directed by Mike Newell<br />Starring Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Simon Callow and James Fleet<br /><br />Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer   1994   117 min   Rated R   Released Jan 11, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: DTS 5.1<br />Italian: DTS 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br />Polish: Dolby Digital 2.0<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 2.0<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, French, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish<br /><br />Discs:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 3.5/5<br /><br />Four Weddings and a Funeral was released in 1994 and was a breakout role for Hugh Grant. If you have seen Notting Hill, Love Actually or the Bridget Jones movies, you'll know that Grant plays similar characters in every movie. Writer Richard Curtis wrote all of those screenplays and understands what Grant can do. He typically plays eloquent characters who are a bit confused about what they want in life. He has great comic timing and plays his roles with a lot of charm.<br /><br />The movie opens with Charles (Grant) late for a wedding. We see him dash around with his flatmate, Scarlett, and drive like a maniac to reach the church on time. He's the best man, but he's forgotten to bring the rings. This opening sequence is pretty funny and sets the scene well.<br /><br />Almost all of the action takes place at the four weddings and the funeral mentioned in the title. We are introduced to Charles and his friends, and they appear at every wedding. Tom (Fleet) is one of the richest men in Britain, but is clueless about women and doesn't have a girlfriend. He's amusing and harmless and reminds me of Colin Firth's character in Love Actually. Gareth embraces life and throws himself into any situation without stopping to worry whether he's making a fool of himself, while Matthew is his lover.<br /><br />The story is full of good observations about human behavior. If you have ever been to a wedding, you'll recognize the types of character portrayed in the movie. Some are there because they genuinely want to be, but others tag along as an excuse to get drunk or to seek romantic partners of their own. Some are touching and others are embarrassing or annoying.<br /><br />At the first wedding, Charles encounters Carrie (MacDowell). He likes her instantly and changes his plans so that he stays at the same inn. They have a romantic moment, but it quickly ends when Carrie announces that she has to return to America.<br /><br />The rest of the movie shows meetings between Charles and Carrie at each of the weddings. Their situations change each time, but it's clear that they like each other. Charles runs into previous girlfriends continually, but considers marriage as something to be avoided for the most part. In contrast, Gareth thinks marriage is a good way to get out of a boring conversation.<br /><br />Charles has a brother, David, who is deaf and communicates through sign language. That sets up a few of the funnier scenes when Charles lies about what David is saying. Another interesting character is Father Gerald; a young priest played by Rowan Atkinson. Most American viewers will know him as Mr. Bean, but he's appeared in numerous movies of this type as well as Blackadder, which was a TV series also written by Curtis. Father Gerald isn't a very good priest, but he'll probably make you laugh.<br /><br />The movie succeeds because the characters are believable and similar to people we have encountered in our own lives. It's easy to identify with the main characters because the story rings true. It's above average in terms of romantic comedies and also works as pure comedy. Even if you don't care about Charles and Carrie, there's plenty to smile at. I wouldn't rate Four Weddings and a Funeral up there with Love Actually, but it's worth seeing.<br /><br />Video Quality 3.5/5<br />Unless you bought Target's exclusive version in January, this is the first time you'll have had the chance to see Four Weddings and a Funeral on Blu-ray. The result is a clear upgrade, as you would expect, but it's not a stellar transfer by any means. The movie is plagued with minor scratches and dirt throughout the 118 minutes. The image is soft at times and clarity never threatens to dazzle the viewer. Colors are accurate, but a little subdued.

0553386816|4.0|Remember how you get started reading a John Grisham book and you have to quit reading, due to other requirements? Well, this book is SEVEN STORIES, each one different and each one draws you in. It fits easily with a busy person's schedule but allows them to go back in their mind to review the ending. John is best at describing a situation or person, without too much information. This allows me to visualize the story much better than other authors. It will be interesting to see which one of the seven stories you liked best?       COACH
B000GH2YPG|5.0|Rebecca is a very well-written novel with a murder mystery twist.<br />There isn't one character who is moral or innocent, yet everyone<br />has their own charm and justification for their actions.  du Maurier<br />created a complex story that holds together quite well and the ending<br />leaves no doubt as to the role that suffering, jealousy and revenge<br />play in the lives of some interesting characters.  A novel one can<br />read and, then, re-read to catch some of the subtleties.

0307279189|5.0|I picked up this book on impulse on Monday. I just wanted something different to read. I was getting tired of the depressing \\"literature\\" books that I usually read. I've been running more seriously since 2009, when I ran my first half and full marathon. I was going through a transition period in my life and running really helped me through that. It relaxed me, and it gave me a sense of purpose. It reminded me of when I was in high school and started running a lot. For no real reason that I could explain to anyone. I've never been on cross-country, or even had friends who like to run at that time in my life. It was just this innate desire to run when I was stressed. Often I find my mind racing from one thing to the next, and I rarely hear myself think. Slowly I begin to forget what my own voice sounds like. Running allows my mind to finally relax. This is something I have since shared with other runners, and many echo my findings.<br /><br />However, the good came with the bad. I started to have injuries like any other runner. I was a mid to heal striker, and I often had to take fistfuls of ibuprofen before races to avoid the pain. I also cracked four of nails and ripped one off. I was getting blisters on a regular basis. I went to the running store, and they suggested running socks. This did help, but the pain and the ache I was feeling in my knees continued to get worse. I started spending a lot of money on running shoes. I really believed that I needed a new pair every 350-400 miles. I thought that this just comes with the territory, and that there was nothing that would change these facts.<br /><br />Then my brother and a guy that I run with started talking about this book, and the Vibram Five Fingers. At first I wasn't convinced. It just didn't make sense. Why would people be stupid enough to keep buying shoes if they were causing the problems? The impact argument did make sense to me, so I though I would give them a try. I figured what's the worst that could happen, I go back to wearing shoes? I was willing to take that risk. I read more about this guy and bare foot running, and slowed into wearing them exclusively when I run. That was eight months ago, and I haven't worn shoes since.  And now I wear them out sometimes too. I really wish that I could go barefoot everywhere, but the concrete and glass doesn't make this a real option for me. I don't want to be Vibram's poster child, but they are the closest thing to barefoot out there.<br /><br />I tell you all this to show you that I was already sold on this idea, before I picked up this book this past Monday. I finished the book in a very busy week, and was talking it about it all week to anybody who would listen (mostly my fianc&eacute;e who I knew would rather talk about something else). The book just echoed everything I had thought about running. It is the idea that you should be compassionate when you run, and that it's not about being fast. Also the people I run with and I always try to laugh and have a good time when we run. It's the runs when you don't take it seriously that you have the best times. This ideology is echoed in the book to the ninth degree. It has the examples and the scientific theory that I could never come up with. I haven't had any more problems with my toes and the pain has gone down significantly in my knees and my ankles. I no longer need ibuprofen to get through a long run.<br /><br />Now I know why I run, and that it is not unique to me.to wearing shoes? I was willing to take that risk.

B0058VW36U|2.0|Downloaded the GetJar version to test and it doesn't play well with the original Droid (yes I need a newer phone).  The Amazon (ad-free) version is the same way. It stalls, gives force close, and reboots the phone without warning.  I like the game, it just kills the older Droid.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|Seems like these either work or don't. I had them for about 3 months and then the left channel started going out. Sometimes I could disconnect them from the PS3 and reconnect they would start working. After about of month of this the left channel is completely gone. I've just stopped using them and wrote them off as a very bad purchase. I read the other reviews about this same problem and hoped I wouldn't get a lemon. Well lesson learned. The quality control of these is just bad. Take note, if they start going bad all hope is lost.

B0047Y0FGY|1.0|This book was a waste of my time and money. I thought since Ms. Fey is such a talented actress and televison writer, that her talent would carry over to a book. Ha. It didn't. Her book agent should be ashamed of him/herself, by printing out such trash and trivial stories, to profit only on the basis of Ms. Fey's name. Even if Kindle offers this one for free, pass on it.
B001HN6918|5.0|I'm Progazoid's 13 yr. old daughter and I think that this movie is awesome! I love the characters in it. I think that this movie is much better than the first movie I like how Tigress is so friendly to Po in the second one than she was in the first one. At first I thought that the movie might not be that good because I thought it was weird that the villain was a Peacock! But I found out that it is a very funny,action packed,heartwarming,and a little bit sad too. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that shiffu was my favorite character in the first movie and he's barely in the second movie, but besides that great characters in the movie I love how the furious five are acting more as a family in this movie than the first. I recommend this movie to anybody who wants to sit down and laugh their heads off!  '
1416972242|3.0|3.5/5.0     While this second installment in \\"The Mortal Instruments\\" trilogy is just as engrossing, just as creative and just as well written as the first, I found I had major problems with the turn of events that leave the H/h as brother and sister rather than boyfriend/girlfriend. While the problems dealing with their romantic feelings despite the situation may be entertaining for some, I found it disappointing and even with the very subtle \\"hints\\" that all is not as it seems, I consistently had to pull myself back from the overwhelming \\"ick\\" factor.     The huge cliff-hanger endings are also a minus. It's very annoying when one is required to read the next book. I prefer choosing to pick up a book because I love the writing (which I would do in Clare's case) as opposed to having to pick a book up because of a ploy.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This is an incredible movie that is more than 50 years old.  It must have been a marvel when it was released.  Some of the dialog is dated and some of the special effects are dated, but the majority of the special effects are actually amazingly good.  It must have really blown people away.  Besides the sci-fi element it is actually a decent movie.  If you watch it, give it a chance, some of the effects in the beginning are not as good as the ones later.  Also the sound track was supposedly the first all electronic soundtrack.  I watch this every few years.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. And like other reviewers, I have enjoyed playing with it on my iPod Touch. I'm thrilled its finally available on Android - because I can now carry it with me everywhere - and thus waste more time :) I got the free version from GetJar last week (with ad's) but saw the ad-free version for $0.99 on Amazon this morning. Ad-supported version deleted, Amazon version purchased. Completely and totally worth it.

0307946711|5.0|Having read this book in two days, this says a lot about a beautiful story of Em and Dex. I discovered this novel through the trailer of the much expected summer movie. I am so happy I bought this novel as it was worth every penny. An intriguing concept to explore one day of these characters' lives for twenty consecutive years. The author does a fantastic job at painting vivid scenes of these two characters and shows us that it is our actions that determine our destiny. This book reminds us of the meaning just to live one day, if only one day, to its fullest.
1416955070|5.0|4.5/5.0    \\"City of Bones\\" is a YA urban fantasy that is delightfully creative while (just barely) hanging in the realm of reality. Clare uses the backdrop of modern day New York City to introduce us to all kinds of fantastic beings, from the run of the mill vampire to squishy, wormy demons. The main characters are written true to life and with love ( translation: they are teenagers, ya have to love 'em or they would drive you to ripping pages.) I tend to steer clear of YA because of that very problem. This story is so well written, however, that even adults forget the age issues - with one major glitch: The relationship between the 15 year old heroine and the 17 year old Hero. For an adult, no matter how compelling the feelings of the characters are, the fact that they are so young just keeps niggling in the back of the brain when trying to imagine an HEA.    Overall, and even with the hesitancies, this is a great book - especially for the young, but not ONLY for that group. Anyone of any age who enjoys a good, clean get-away from reality will absolutely love this story.    *Warning* It is a serious cliff-hanger, so if one doesn't want to invest in the next two in the trilogy, beware
B0055OK2T0|5.0|I am REALLY tired of blow-em up, shoot-em down movies.  This was great:  good action, good acting, great chemistry between leads, some fun plot twists and definitely not sorry I watched it.  An adventure/romance for the thinking person.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Yeah, I went ahead and dished out the $4.99 to give this book a read. I actually wasn't expecting much beyond the usual methods of promotion but I will say there is some good advice in here that I would guess is quite hard to come by. I don't want to spoil the read by saying what that advice is, but I will say that in some cases it takes the usual methods and cleverly expands upon them.    I bought this book out of curiosity mostly. I know writers will try to make good use of it, but even if you're a just a reader this book is pretty darn interesting. It really gives a glimpse of how successful some of these indie writers can be by using resources that are widely available.    Frankly, I'd never even heard of this dude until recently, but I'll state for the record that if anyone was going to find a way to pull something like this off, it would be a guy like him with that sort of keen business mind. And I have to add, a crapload of dedication, because honestly, I got the impression that this guy worked his butt off to make his writing successful. So I guess this is the bottom line: If you're a writer and you don't want to do even a little work, this book probably aint for you, but if you're willing to dedicate some time to making stuff happen, then I say give it a read because it might open your eyes to new possibilities.

B003ZHVJFA|2.0|Tekken Is a very popular video game franchise. It's had an animated film in the past which has been voted one of the worst animes of all time by animenewsnetwork.com, but of course if your a fan of Tekken you'll want to watch it. Same goes with this movie. I've been playing Tekken since I was two years old, so of course I'm going to get my hands on anything I can find that's Tekken. I know the Tekken story line inside and out and of course like most games turned into movies they ruined it! Heihachi is a good guy, Christie is white and plays Jin's love interest instead of Ling, There is a sex scene with Nina and Anna, Oh the list goes on!! Then the only fighting style the got right was Edy's! -__- the plus side is the costumes were great, the actors looked pretty much like the characters in the game. Overall I wouldn't watch it again, but to those who are Tekken fans I say at least see this once, rent it 1st! Good news is we get Tekken Blood Vengeance in July and it will make up for the bad movies we've had in the past :]
1416972250|5.0|4.5/5.0  Wonderful, wonderful finish to a great YA trilogy! High suspense, lots of action, intrigue and we get all our questions answered - hooray! My only complaint is that, after three stinking books of waiting for Clary to vocally declare her love (and after Jace has done so numerous times), we turn that last page without it. Not ONE time in this book does she tell him she loves him - HUGE letdown, so big that that alone dropped it half a star.

055358894X|3.0|With \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\", Scott Lynch has created a unique, genre-blending world that melds together elements of fantasy/crime/spy/picaresque in a wonderfully detailed re-setting of Renaissance Venice.  Throughout my reading, I was thoughtfully and enjoyably immersed in the colorful descriptions of the streets and narrows, the intricacies of the organized crime underworld, and the gradual unveiling of Camorri culture.  The hallmark of a good fantasy, to me, is that I lose sense of the words on the page and watch the story unfold in my minds eye; by that standard, \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" succeeded admirably.    Unfortunately, I found the setting of this book a lot more compelling than what was going on within that setting.  The plot of is fairly predictable and edges on unoriginal.  The characters - even our protagonist, who is unveiled to us in past and present juxtaposed storylines - are 1-dimensional and underdeveloped.  Lynch's prose, particularly the dialogue, moves briskly, which is more than I can say for some genuinely excellent fantasy series like Gene Wolfe's \\"Book of the New Sun\\"; but I still found his actual words to be unimaginative and cliche.  If not for the novel setting, this book would feel like another forgettable Forgotten Realms book.    This is Scott Lynch's freshman novel, and it is a commendable work.  I am genuinely interested in the world he's created and his own development as a writer, so I've decided to invest myself in this series.  Despite my misgivings on the plot and characters, I found this a light and enjoyable read, even at its 700+ pages.  Lynch is in danger of becoming another RA Salvatore - somebody who gives us wonderful characters and setting, but doesn't employ them effectively.  I sincerely hope he doesn't go that route; \\"Red Seas Under Red Skies\\" is due in the mail today, and I'm eager to find out.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|The only reason I purchased this book was because it was recommended to me. I had seen it earlier and thought it looked silly and that I would hate it. Boy was I wrong! This is a fascinating tale that makes me look at my dog differently. For about 2 months, I would wonder what my dog thinks about everything I do.     Being from Seattle, I could picture everything - because I've been to nearly all of the locations mentioned.     This book made me laugh and cry. I recommend it to all dog lovers and anyone who is not a dog lover.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a great game that IMO rivals the addictiveness of Angry birds!  The animations are smooth and it's just fun to cut those ropes Fruit Ninja style and watch the candy swing around to grab those stars. Too bad not all games are of this quality and that 99C pricing hits the spot! I know what I'll be playing on the train rides to work (at least for the next couple of days).     PS.  In case it's useful for anyone,  I'm playing this on a Samsung Vibrant.

B000ICLRIE|2.0|Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the 5 Disc DVD.

B000VM9Z8K|4.0|This is probably the best \\"Chick Lit\\" book I've ever read. Because the author tells Lexi's story without letting you know what her past is, you can really \\"step into her shoes\\". This is a quick fun read. Great book to read between 2 serious novels.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|In proper Limp Bizkit tradition, Gold Cobra opens with an intro before \\"Bring It Back,\\" which serves as a second intro of sorts. It starts with a hip-hop beat verse ornamented by some of Wes' unique guitar playing before bringing rock/metal in the chorus. The following track, \\"Gold Cobra,\\" brings a full song with Fred Durst in top form. In the years since Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, Fred and the rest of the band explored more traditional pop/rock with Results May Vary, experimented with (and quickly discarded) maturity with The Unquestionable Truth, Pt. 1, and then Wes spent some more time writing his own music with Black Light Burns. All of these developments are evident in Gold Cobra - Fred's singing and rapping are rock-solid, and he obviously knows exactly what he's doing. Softer songs such as \\"Walking Away\\" and \\"Loser\\" both tip a musical hat to Wes' work with Black Light Burns (in a good way). John Otto, Sam Rivers, and DJ Lethal also appear in top form - Limp Bizkit's rhythm section is often overlooked in the love for Wes Borland and the hate for Fred served by most critics. This album is all about grooves, and Sam and John dish them out like professionals.<br /><br />This album has great, clean, and enormous sound - every aspect is crystal clear. The bass is heavy, the guitar is well balanced, the drums sound like real drums, and Fred is placed in the forefront, as a frontman should be. Unlike earlier Limp Bizkit albums, this one doesn't feel like it has any filler - there are 12 quality songs with interludes included at the end of some, and there is no ridiculously long \\"outro\\" as could be found on the first three Limp Bizkit albums. The songs sound distinctly like Limp Bizkit without being the least bit derivative. There are no jabs at other artists (\\"Stinky Finger\\" and \\"Hot Dog\\" come to mind) - the closest parody to be found is \\"Autotunage,\\" which is a surprisingly good song. It might have been more enjoyable if Fred had made the autotune more of a joke, but it's noteworthy for being an anthemic pop song, something Limp Bizkit have never really done before.<br /><br />The beats hit hard, the guitars are the best they've ever been, and the energy throughout is palpable. The chemistry in this band comes out clearly through the recording, and it is fantastic to hear them together again. Every member shines throughout, making this a clear highlight of Limp Bizkit's career.<br /><br />Recommended: Bring it Back, D***** Bag, Loser, Killer In You<br /><br />4.5/5re of a joke, but it's noteworthy for being an anthemic pop song, something Limp Bizkit have never really done before.

006117758X|3.0|This is the second of four books I bought at a library sale for a total cost of about $1.10.  It's not the best of the batch so far, but I enjoyed it.  It's about this lonely kid with horrible acne who spends most of his time hiding in his room.  It's interesting, though almost nothing happens, and funny as hell in parts.  Overall, I thought it was a good read, but I still don't see why so many people call Bukowski a \\"poet.\\"  His prose is very straightforward and honest and he isn't ashamed of his most embarrassing qualities (there are quite of few of them!) but he's no Nathaniel West or Steinbeck.  I debated giving this four stars but overall it's not a great book just a good one about southern California.

0688014291|2.0|The One Minute Manager is a parable outlining the fundamental aspects of a \\"One Minute Manager\\" program. In the introduction, the authors emphasize the use of the book as a management tool. The key, according to Blanchard and Johnson, is to learn from the program, applying the principles to daily management functions in an organization, and sharing the newfound wisdom with others.<br /><br />Each section is discussed according to the overarching narrative, followed by a summary emphasizing major concepts. They include \\"The First Secret: One Minute Goals,\\" \\"The Second Secret: One Minute Praisings,\\" and \\"The Third Secret: One Minute Reprimands.\\" Mantras relating to these management techniques are peppered throughout the text, displayed as plaques in various offices. These facets are again summarized in the final chapters, reiterating the key points and offering examples regarding the application in actual situations (although the actual situations are ultimately odd and juvenile). The book concludes with encouragement to adopt the \\"One Minute\\" management style immediately, simultaneously sharing the \\"gift\\" of the program with others in a tone that eerily conjures cult recruitment.<br /><br />While the book certainly deals with management concepts, its usefulness as a practical tool is limited. Written from the point of view of an individual seeking more information on the ideal management style, the narrator is referred to an outstanding manager and seeks to discover the nuances of \\"One Minute\\" management, a concept that seems too good to be true. The narrative is extremely simplistic, frequently relying on examples that are trite and cloying. The character supposedly embodying the ideal manager is usually just irritating, bombastically talking too much without really saying anything at all. While this makes for a fast read that is easily digestible, it undercuts the seriousness of the lessons outlined by the author. These drawbacks are somewhat diminished through the helpful reiterations of key points in the \\"One Minute\\" summaries; serious managers looking for useful strategies without pedestrian fluff would benefit from focusing on these sections exclusively (which are literally encompassed by only four pages). The strategies are not innovative, although the condensed presentation of approaches to goal setting, praise, and reprimand successfully distill this information into extremely manageable parcels that will be easy to implement quickly and effectively. Some suggestions are outdated and potentially dangerous, such as recommendations to touch colleagues when offering feedback, but overall the basic suggestions remain relevant.<br /><br />Spencer and Blanchard both bring experience as management/human resource consultants for a number of well-known companies. It is clear that as an outgrowth of their consulting work, they have developed the \\"One Minute Manager\\" program and the text appears to be the marketing of their trademarked philosophy toward management. The real secret of the \\"One Minute Manager\\" is that none of the concepts are actually secrets. They are common, fundamental management principles given a catchy title and framed within a mediocre story. The ideas, while somewhat stale, may be more palatable to inexperienced and broad audiences through the highly anecdotal nature of their delivery.<br /><br />The One Minute Manager is ultimately useful for individuals seeking suggestions for basic management strategies in the areas of goal setting and evaluation/feedback. Readers seeking in-depth recommendations and management guidance will be disappointed, but those seeking a lighthearted and casual overview of commonly accepted management strategies might appreciate a cute story with a few helpful kernels that outline three fair, honest, and effective management techniques.rations of key points in the \\"One Minute\\" summaries; serious managers looking for useful strategies without pedestrian fluff would benefit from focusing on these sections exclusively (which are literally encompassed by only four pages).

B004EPZ07K|3.0|Green Lantern has received quite a bit of flak from reviewers for not being mainstream enough to relate to modern audiences. And that's a shame, because if Green Lantern is guilty of anything, it's of being a SUPERHERO movie.<br /><br />Back before all these directors started streamlining films, revising backstories, and taking out Spider-Man's technologically-advanced web shooters, comic books were a glorious hodge-podge of the near possible, the impossible, and the just plain fantastic. Because superhero settings include every superhero and villain imaginable, they have to accommodate magic, aliens, superscience, and alternate dimensions in one heady mix. This makes for a very rich comic book series that can be intimidating for new audiences - which is precisely why movie directors cut out so much.<br /><br />But you can't cut all the crazy out of Green Lantern and still stay true to the comics. And so, with tons of exposition, Green Lantern rabbit-punches viewers with world-shattering fact after mind-altering fact in the first five minutes: aliens exist, there's a giant yellow monster imprisoned in a planet, ancient humanoids predating humanity have been guarding the universe with green willpower, and there's a dizzying variety of highly advanced technical races from across the galaxy. Green Lantern makes Superman's backstory look quaint. His name doesn't help either - Emerald Flashlight has to say an oath that activates a ring that's charged by a lantern that's powered by a planet that's actually the embodiment of all sentient beings' will. No wonder critics got confused.<br /><br />)o()o()o( \\"I pledge allegiance to a lantern, given to me by a dying purple alien.\\" - Hal Jordan )o()o()o(<br /><br />Director Martin Campbell knows all this. He makes fun of the ridiculous circumstances in which Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds and his fab abs) finds himself, ranging from a dogfight with two robot jets to a dogfight with a giant soul-eating monster. Part of what makes Green Lantern so entertaining is that it embraces its pulpy roots: there's the childhood sweetheart (smoking hot Blake Lively as Carol Ferris who just happens to be a successful businesswoman and fighter pilot), the nebbishly awkward villain (Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond), and tough-as-nails \\"red Spock\\" Sinestro (Mark Strong). The real villain of the piece, Parallax, sounds like a 1980s video game effect - oh wait, it is! This is not a movie to be taken too seriously.<br /><br />)o()o()o( \\"It's not a magic ring--it's a ring powered by advanced technology!\\" - Hal Jordan )o()o()o(<br /><br />And yet, Green Lantern is no movie trifle. The challenge with a superhero who has powers like Green Lantern is that the possibilities are literally endless - the rings are powered by the hero's will, which means he can technically imagine anything. This also means that an abusive hero might imagine black holes and solve all of his problems that way. Green Lantern cleverly constrains these god-like powers by imposing plot-related restrictions on Hal's creativity. When all Hal can come up with to stop a helicopter from crashing into partying guests is a Matchbox car in a ramp, it's because he played with one in his nephew's room the day before. When he's trying to use the sun's gravitational pull as a weapon, it's because he used the Earth's gravitational pull as a weapon against the two jets earlier and because his tutor Kilowog points out that gravity is a...uh, harsh mistress. Hal Jordan might always manifest boring weapons straight out of a first-person shooter, but that's because he's harboring a lot of guilt over his military daddy's death.<br /><br />)o()o()o( \\"You thought I wouldn't recognize you just because I can't see your cheekbones?\\" - Carol Ferris )o()o()o(<br /><br />Speaking of daddy issues, Green Lantern is one giant ball of forest-colored father/son conflict: Hal and his military pilot father, Hammond and his successful senator father, dead Abin Sur and grieving Sinestro, Abin Sur and the newly created Green Lantern, Parallax and his newly adopted avatar Hammond...it's clear the Green Lantern writers were looking for some emotional hook, and that hook was spelled out D-A-D. Green Lantern tries very hard to be deep.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Green Lantern can be pretty shallow at times. Parallax, remember, is an ancient being predating much of humanity's evolution, but he falls for the oldest trick in the book. We're supposed to believe that Parallax really, really, REALLY hates Abin Sur and everything associated with him. After he kills Abin Sur, you have to ask why Parallax wants to go after just Hal Jordan when he could be eating so many other Green Lanterns for breakfast.<br /><br />When Green Lantern goes big, it's glorious, but when it pulls in tight, the plot turns an earth-shattering battle between god-like beings into a schoolyard shoving match. But really, that's pretty normal from superhero comics. It's just that today's movie superhero fans expect a guy in a cloak that's just like you and me without any of the world-spanning baggage.<br /><br />Green Lantern's guilty of being true to Green Lantern, spandex, mask, ring and all. For those who find it implausible, maybe a superhero powered by a jade-colored light source isn't for them.rallax and his newly adopted avatar Hammond...it's clear the Green Lantern writers were looking for some emotional hook, and that hook was spelled out D-A-D.

B0054JURZA|5.0|Some of these reviews are hilariously awesome.  I love the funny stuff people say when they hate something so much!  I dig the album.  Gorgeous and textured.  Mature and melodic.  It kind of just rolls out of the speakers without you really knowing when one track ends and the next begins.  The lyrics are nearly indecipherable.  The song names are gibberish.  Call it overproduced or whatever, but what does that really mean.  It's beautiful music.  His previous stuff was great too.  Who cares if this is different.  Don't get so attached to what you think an artist should sound like - you'll only end up disappointed.  I do think the last track is a bit of a trip.  Jimmy Fallon busted his chops for it - comparing it to Bruce Hornsby.  I can't disagree with that simple but fairly accurate comparison.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.
0470638842|5.0|I've read many books on Social Media - Socialnomics is by far my favorite. If you're looking for a book that not only hits home in personal lives but in the business world as well, read it. Qualman is an incredibly intelligent author and provides useful content and wisdom that you won't want to miss.
B000B63IEI|2.0|I leave it to others to characterize the performance and its merits. Whatever they may be, they're deeply compromised by the technical failure of the finished production. A narrow soundstage, the dryness of the strings and a near-complete loss of Andsnes' justly celebrated tonal palette compare poorly with the promotional video, a fine rehearsal session with decidedly more generous audio qualities. I'll keep the disc - it's interesting on other levels - but won't reach for it except perhaps as an example of expert performance denatured in its journey from concert hall to finished disc.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Well, it's not as good as the 1933 classic but, at least it's better than the '70s version. Peter Jackson wanted to make this movie, for his whole life and it really shows. He has remained as true to the original story as possible, while still making it enjoyable to today's \\"Smash Bomb\\" audience, with more action but, important classic scenes intact. The acting is great, even though Jack Black is a weird choice to play Denham, he's believable enough. Altogether, I would say this is worth seeing, even for hardcore purists. Just to clarify this is a review of the 2-Disc Special Edition, which also has a free comic book inside!

B004EPYZUI|1.0|Just a really poor movie. Non-sensical story used to jump between sci-fi action sequences. It made little sense, was misogynistic in nature, and just boring. It's like a 1970s \\"women in prison\\" movie without nudity. Even adding nudity would not have saved this clunker.    What I wonder is who's spending millions to make junk like this? Why not just donate 1/100th of the film budget to me. I could write a better script.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|...but, it's really an entirely new storyline, despite what you may, or may not have heard from other sources. That said, I am a huge fan of the original Star Trek series and Next Generation-and I enjoyed this movie so much, I went to see it in the theater twice! The reason it's good is: J.J. Abrams does actually care about the classic stuff. He's just trying to pay homage to one of his lifelong joys. I say, let him! It's a good example of a well made remake and in our current film era, isn't that the best we can hope for?

1439156816|5.0|I have to admit I am not a Stephen King fan - as far as his books go. His genre is not my cup of tea. For that reason I hesitated when I saw he had written this book. Being a novice writer I needed all the help I could get, so I started researching to get some answers to my writing problems. It was hard to dismiss the glowing five-star reviews people wrote about 'On Writing\\", so I bought the book. And what a gem it is!! First, it reads like a novel you can't put down. I was enthralled. It's based on years of experience - going all the way back to his childhood - his rejection notices stuck on a nail above his bed. He was doing that at thirteen. Throughout the book he shares his wisdom and experience in such a way it answers any questions a beginning or experienced writer might have. There is not a book out there that tells it like Stephen King did. I'm still not a fan of his genre, but I'm now a fan of Stephen King! I'm so very thankful to him for writing this book. Anyone interested in writing well and being published needs Stephen King's 'On Writing - A Memoir of the Craft'.
0061726826|3.0|Not gonna give a soliloquy of the story. Either you have read it and know, or you have read several other reviews with summaries so you don't need me to hash one out for you.     I read this book fairly slowly, maybe 50 pages a day, so it took me a week or so. I had no desire to keep reading, you know that feeling of being so wrapped up in the story and needing to know what happens next so much so you can't put the book down. This was not that book for me. However, I was intrigued enough not to want to quit either. I wanted to see how it all turned out. Will I read the following two books in the trilogy? Probably. But I'm sure as hell not counting down the days until book two is released. I also don't think I'd reread the book. I checked it out of the library and will likely do that for the sequels. Not worth the money and not a good enough book for me to consider a 'keeper'.    I read many reviews that spoke highly of Oliver's writing style and I think I disliked that more so than anything else. I hated how often Lena described Alex and his damn leaf colored hair, like I forgot what he looked like when he is described every few pages. I couldn't stand how many times I saw the word 'like' used in a simile. Seriously, go back and read a few random pages and I bet you will see at least 1 simile every other page. It got to the point where I was dreading flipping the page. Don't get me wrong, I like poetic writing as much as the next person, but it was a bit... no it was totally overkill!    I was really torn between giving this book 2 or 3 stars. If there was a 2.5, I'd choose that. The simile thing annoyed me to no end, so much so that I was ready to go with 2. But, I digressed. I went with a 3 becasue all in all, if those two changes were made, this would be a better book, in my opinion. The writing beyond that is solid and it is a decent story.
B000JK8OYU|1.0|The Beatles were the most innovative group of musicians in the history of rock-and-roll.  Their list of contributions to the music world is extremely long and their influence on others extends in every direction for as far as the eye can see.  It is inspiring to hear what The Beatles did with the primitive recording equipment of their day.  That is part of what makes them so brilliant; They created some of the greatest music of all time with machines that were 1/100th of what you can download on your computer today.  And, yet, almost nobody with all the fancy new equipment can hold a candle to The Beatles.    It is heresy to let someone take those hallowed master tapes and create a collage with them, using every form of digital gimmickry imaginable.  It would be like having someone use a computer to etch cool looking designs all over the Mona Lisa.  Sure, the result would be impressive and modern looking but it would also disrespect the brilliance of the original.  It was bad enough when The Beatles \\"Anthology\\" treated a bunch of aborted takes and inferior alternate versions like great gems, worthy of the biggest hype known to man.  It was worse when they molested the classic \\"Let It Be\\" album and re-released it to great fanfare.  Now we have this digital finger-painting by people who weren't even members of the group.    I just cringe at the thought of some young generation stumbling across the various post-Beatles re-workings and thinking that they are hearing the real thing.  Wouldn't that be horrible?  Sure, the surviving members and widows gave permission for this project to go forward.  What will they approve next?  Maybe they can go back into the master tapes, erase all the lead vocals, and have the next winner of American Idol sing on them.  Wouldn't that be a beautiful travesty, on par with \\"Love\\"?  They can call it \\"American Beatles.\\"  Or they can slow down all the master tapes, play them backwards, and re-release them in a deluxe 20-disk box-set titled \\"Beatle Rape.\\"  Oh, how about having George Martin collage together several of The Beatles' hits with a bunch of old tapes of Yoko Ono screaming like a psychotic banshee?  You could call it \\"Revolution Number 10.\\"  The money-making possibilities are endless if you are sleazy enough and greedy enough.  ...Or you can just leave the original recordings alone and let them stand for the works of genius that they are...

B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is the definitive concert that is recorded for every Pink Floyd fan. Roger Waters is not present, but what you have is a visual extravaganza of lasers, huge guitars and vocals that are spot-on. If you are even a remotely casual fan of the group, you'll enjoy watching \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and will be in awe when the song finishes and the lights go dark. An amazing show that thankfully, was recorded for our enjoyment years later.<br /><br />This should be purchased along with \\"Live In Pompeii - Director's Cut\\" to fully grasp what a powerhouse of a group that Pink Floyd was in both early and later stages. This is the group that set the bar at its highest point.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B002RI9S2Y|3.0|I might sound like a total nerd but I really, really love reading about greek and roman mythology. Ever since I was a kid in primary school and I heard the story about Sisiphyus being cursed by Zeus. Don't get me wrong, Pwercy jackson is a great book and I'm reading the next ones in the series but I'm getting a bit sick of writers mucking about with classic legends like they couldn't come up with their own characters so they have to borrow more.  I mean Zeus was a god.  If a writer wrote a story today about Jesus coming along and behaving the Zeus does, there'd be a riot.
030726999X|5.0|This Trilogy has been one of the publishing phenomena of the modern age so this last volume was eagerly anticipated.<br /><br />Does it live up to the hype? Probably. Yes, it is the weakest part of the trilogy, but if the worst one can say of any book is that it is not quite as good as the first two parts then this is hardly blistering criticism.<br /><br />The book is not perfect. It is slow to start but once it does get going it drags the reader into its complicated conspiracy theories. Whilst these can seem outrageous at times they are also entirely believable simply because of the quality of the writing, plotting and characterisation.

I skipped 50 pages in the middle and i still was bored.  I felt the writing repetitiveve and somewhat boring as was the main character...am i being reptitive????

B003K1EYM6|2.0|I purchased these adapters a year ago when I got my iPad and they worked great. After the latest update, they are useless for my needs. The SD card adapter doesn't recognize cards at all when plugged in to the iPad.

So, both adapters are now junk until and unless Apple fixes the issue. Once again, Apple screws the pooch on what was a great accessory. Save your money. Don't buy one of these until you start seeing people amending reviews that say this thing works.

034552554X|4.0|How does an unloved child who has grown up in foster care develop life skills, interpersonal relationships, and trust? How does one eventually become a self-sufficient person under these circumstances? Can one truly find love when their life experiences have fallen short of that emotion?<br /><br />In her debut novel, Vanessa Diffenbaugh relates an unusual, and sometimes haunting story of a young girl who must learn to make her own way after growing up in the foster care system. The Language of Flowers traces the life of Victoria Jones through series of flashbacks and vivid descriptions of her learning to adjust to the new world surrounding her. Although the use of the flashbacks often interrupts the flow of the story, they reveal Victoria's experiences as a victim of social services and foster care. They are important to explain the roots of Victoria's frequently unusual behavior.<br /><br />Flowers become her closest tie to reality. Her understanding and appreciation for the meaning and significance of flowers evolve into her salvation and eventual livelihood. At first Victoria sees flower language as precise and comfortable with one meaning for each flower. Later she discovers alternative meanings for some flowers, and that challenge helps her grow interpersonally. Victoria develops from what appears to be an insensitive, brazen, unbridled and spontaneous social outcast into a sensitive, enterprising young woman.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh creates characters that seem real, especially the emerging sensitive Victoria who begins to rely on caring mentors as she enters adulthood in San Francisco. Her passion for flowers opens up a way to express herself and gain meaning in her life.<br /><br />The author also includes an interesting \\"Victorias Dictionary of Flowers\\" to relate the significance of each flower and what it traditionally has communicated. It gives a whole new meaning to sending a dozen roses to a lover or choosing a bouquet to give for a special occasion. The book explores how interpersonal relationships can mold others in both good and negative ways. I recommend this well written, sometimes mystifying and deeply moving book.bouquet to give for a special occasion.

159562015X|5.0|My wife and I took this test in 2006 and it gave greater verbal expression to understanding our strengths than 15 years of marriage had accomplished (We took the test via the gallup press book \\"How full is your bucket\\" and have since retaken it with Strengths Finder 2.0).  Quite simply, the assessment is the best I have seen for self-awareness.  We worked at a business that had 40 staff members take the test and place our top five themes on the door to our office.  It was helpful in understanding and appreciating the people we worked with.  Since then we have tested every known friend and relative with remarkably exciting results.  The themes (strengths) really give you the words to describe yourself and understand others.  DO NOT worry that the top five themes are all that you are allowed to see.  This is done intentionally because they are the themes that you flow in naturally MOST of the time.  It will take months just to explore the exponential effects your top five can have on your life.  Gallup experts actually say it is better not knowing what your lower ranking themes are because it could just serve as a distraction to shore them up...the exact thing strengths finding is supposed to prevent.  For the price of a gallup press book you get an assessment that is superior to the DISC profile and many other higher priced assessments available.  If you want to assess a married couple, I suggest buying one Strength Finder 2.0 book and perhaps the Strengths Based Leadership book.  This will allow you both to take the test but you actually gain 2 new books for your bookshelf!  Enjoy some rich conversation and self awareness from this fabulous resource.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|I really like this album--as she said in an interview prior to the album's release, you can really hear the African influence of Fela Kuti in many of her songs.  Personally I think this album was more of a risk for her stylistically than lyrically.  The lyrics to the majority of the songs are not very unique or distinct, but her voice is much more raw (as you probably heard when she performed 1+1 live on American Idol) and for some people that's a turn-off.  BUT, this is my favorite of her four albums and though I think some variety with regard to lyrical content (in her albums in general) would be nice, I adore her music and her voice never ceases to give me goosebumps.  It's a yummy listen ;-)
1557420580|2.0|I gave it a fair chance, a hundred pages, before deciding this was not a book for me.  The good part, main character Anthony is convincingly and well made.  The problems?  As a person, I find Anthony so superficial, as intended, that I not only feel no connection to him, but extraordinarily rarely for me, I find him so thoroughly unlikeable that I haven't the smallest desire to find out what happens to him.  Which brings me to another complaint.  I'm not an action fanatic, but in a hundred pages almost nothing happens beyond finding out Anthony's heritage and lifestyle.  The promised female interest has just appeared and at first glance, seems to have no greater depth than Anthony.  Final complaint, the writing is so flowery and verbose that it gets in the way.  It reads like Fitzgerald must have been paid by the word, with metaphors, similes, and adjectives so pervasive to be annoying to this reader (at random, I picked one of his over-the-top sentences and counted it at 48 words!).  If you've read my previous reviews, you'll know that ripping a book is not my style.  In fact, I have suspected myself of being too indulgent to written weaknesses.  Nonetheless, this is a classic author?  A book well reviewed?  Hard to fathom.  I quit and find no compulsion to return to Fitzgerald.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|Since Beyonce starred as Etta James, she has been trying to create songs that would become classic. She tried this with \\"I am...Sasha Fierce\\". That album was at best a good trial of what she really had in her. The problem was there wasn't a unity to that album, even to the point that the album was split into two discs. Beyonce has always been very good at picking the best songs and making them her own. But to step into the big league of a classic album takes more than picking the right songs. She took some time off and did some much needed research, (no offense Beyonce). She was able to experience music at its purest form, in concerts all around the world. Then she took the time to craft an album, not some singles that would definitely be hits. All I have to say is, thank you, Beyonce. I've always known you've been capable of this. I have enjoyed your other music but never found myself listening to an album in it's entirety. You have always proven that you have been a fan of music and have huge respect for some of the greatest artists out there. You have taken the time and responsibility to prove your ability as an artist. I am not going to go into a critical review of every song on this album because this album doesn't deserve that. She isn't making songs to be downloaded individually with this album. She is making something that is meant to be heard as a whole. A piece of music. Beyonce, you reached your goal and then some. For me personally, this album will forever stay in my collection and be placed with the classics. Again, thank you. *Also, everyone, please take the time to not dissect every song but instead put this album in and absorb it as a whole. Music is meant to be listened to, not critiqued to the point that appreciation for the art is lost.

I especially enjoyed the walk down memory lane of all the countries that have a habit of defaulting on their debt. No surprise today, but Greece hasn't been stellar by historical debt standards and guess what, it could be happening again soon.

B0011Z77OK|4.0|First, I would like to say that I don't like most \\"Best of\\" CDs in general. You want to hear all of the songs created to be able to fully appreciate an artist or group, or even a specific album. Each album should have ups and downs with the songs- something a little softer, something a little louder, whatever. There needs to be a pattern, and this type of album usually loses that feel. Several bands have a distinctive sound, and all of the major hits sound incredibly similar (Listen to \\"The Very Best Of Jethro Tull\\" for a good example. The songs all sound the same and even have similar speeds and everything). Other bands, like the Rolling Stones, are too diverse and have just way too many songs to make a fair compilation.<br /><br />This CD is an exception.<br /><br />First, the songs on this CD are all from 1989 to 2004 - limiting them to only fifteen years. The songs are diverse, but not too diverse that you have to wonder if just one band came up with all of the songs.<br /><br />Second, the Red Hot Chili Peppers decided to record a couple new songs in 2004, possibly for a new album that never came out. The last two songs on the album, \\"Fortune Faded\\" and \\"Save the Population,\\" are brand-new. That's gutsy, putting a new single and a song that isn't even one on a \\"Greatests Hits\\" album. This also is when \\"Hump de Bump\\" from Stadium Arcadium was first recorded, as well as some songs that were only released in Live in Hyde Park- \\"Rolling Sly Stone\\" and \\"Leverage of Space.\\" This album is also only one of two which has \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" on it, and the other is a soundtrack for a dated, strange movie.<br /><br />Without these two facts, I would not have bought this album. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I like how many of the songs flow together. This album almost seems like it isn't a compilation. Each song is meant to follow the song before it and precede the one after, much like studio albums do. It has a lot of the radio hits on it, too, so you know these songs.<br /><br />\\"Under the Bridge\\" is the song that made the Chili Peppers famous in 1991. Of course it's first. It basically made the band who they are today, and you really understand that. It's about Anthony Kiedis doing drugs under a bridge in East LA, but the beginning of the song is all about him feeling alone- almost depressed- and having only the city to rely on. It's deep and beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Give It Away\\" is a great, crazy song. It's a huge mush of sound that all comes together into something with a ton of energy and vibrance. If at first you don't like it, listen to it again. And again. And again. It's just a bunch of good friends all coming together to have fun.<br /><br />\\"Californication\\" is a song that holds a very deep place in my heart. It's one of my favorite songs ever. It's about a lot of negative parts about Hollywood and how everybody wants the movie star lifestyle, and is really refreshing since it's coming from four guys who know all about that lifestyle. The lyrics are inventive and good, and I love the bridge.<br /><br />\\"Scar Tissue\\" is a pretty good song. I wouldn't call it one of my favorites, but it's up there. I'd have to call it a typical Chili Peppers song from the past three albums. It's a good wry song, very bittersweet.<br /><br />\\"Soul to Squeeze\\" is one of the lesser-known Chili Peppers songs, and is a little sad and soulful, but ends up being more positive. It has a great high-energy part, too. The line, \\"It's bitter, baby, and it's very sweet,\\" describes it perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Otherside\\" is the dark song on here. It's about drugs, and is kind of negative for the Chili Peppers. It's probably the most insecure and self-hating you will ever hear Anthony Kiedis. I love listening to it when I'm down. It's perfectly moody, and although the lyrics are about drugs, it never really says that, so it often seems relatable.<br /><br />\\"Suck My Kiss.\\" It's flirty and seemingly inappropriate. Everything that can be taken as sweet in a relationship, like kisses, end up being a bit perverted. There's a great bassline, very strong and prominent, and lots of drums. It's the Chili Peppers take on hard rock.<br /><br />\\"By The Way\\" is beautiful while still being funky. There are parts of both in the song, and seems to be a mix between the old Chili Peppers and a lot of the mellower songs on the album By The Way.<br /><br />\\"Parallel Universe\\" is a good song, but unfortunately my love for it slowly died out somehow. I like it, it's nice, but it doesn't seem to stand up to the rest of the songs on Californication.<br /><br />\\"Breaking the Girl\\" is a nice song. It sounds like an acoustic guitar, which is a fun change from all of the electric. There also is some sort of flute or something throughout the song, which sticks out. And then, of course, comes the industrial bridge that sounds totally different than the rest of the song but somehow works with it.<br /><br />\\"My Friends\\" is the only song from One Hot Minute. Most of the other songs on the album sound very different because Dave Navarro was the guitarist, rather than John Frusciante. This not only sounds relatively like the Chili Peppers that most people love, but is about Anthony Kiedis's raging drug problems and is very important to him.<br /><br />\\"Higher Ground\\" is the song from EMI Records. It's a great cover of Stevie Wonder's song, although I prefer a couple other songs from Mother's Milk, such as \\"Taste the Pain\\". The song shows you where the band was coming from and is a great break from a lot of the newer, slower, and/or sweeter songs that surround it.<br /><br />\\"Universally Speaking\\" is probably my least favorite song on here. Yes, it's nice, but it doesn't have the Chili Peppers feel. I'd call it upbeat. It's melodic and pretty, and honestly you have to wonder why it's on here.<br /><br />\\"Road Trippin'\\" is a fun little song that was used to end Californication on the right note. It's drumless and apparently a fan favorite. It's sweet and is about friendship and just hanging around together.<br /><br />\\"Fortune Faded\\" is kind of crazy. It starts out very loud and hyper, with a strong guitar part. It's finally funky, compared to most of the songs on By The Way. It's also a new song, so putting it on here was a real treat and a surprise. It sounds like a song that belongs on this album, though.<br /><br />\\"Save the Population\\" is a fun song that, much as I like it, doesn't belong on here. It wasn't even a single, and doesn't seem to be the kind of song to turn into an album. It has a bright vibe that reminds me of warm islands in the Caribbean. The lyrics aren't the strongest, considering the number of times the words \\"Save the Population\\" are repeated.<br /><br />My greatest dislike about this album is the exclusion/inclusion of certain songs. \\"Universally Speaking\\" was a relatively poor single, and \\"Can't Stop\\" was much better when it came to numbers. The two should have been switched. Even if the Chili Peppers wanted a song that showcased their new sound on By The Way, I would have gone with Dosed, which I like better and was a bigger hit. \\"Higher Ground\\" is the one song that everybody thinks of when it comes to Mother's Milk, and I'd like to hear another song once in a while. \\"Around the World\\" is also an underrated song from Californication that deserves a place here. They should have probably also waited to put out a compilation until after Stadium Arcadium.<br /><br />Also, a lot of the songs in the middle kind of blend together. You forget which one comes before what, and when I listen to it, the CD seems to go on forever as a bunch of similar-sounding songs are played. Switch out one or two songs, or change the order, and you now have a better album.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a list of most of the best Chili Peppers songs, this is the album for you. These are their songs that just about everyone should know. A bunch of great songs from a great band.

B0034G4P8K|2.0|One thing that baffles me, is how someone who was never a fan of the original cartoon and an almost 70 year old producer are somehow qualified to revamp a franchise and cater it to the same kids-now adults that will wonder if they ever watched the series, researched the series or have a clue as to why kids liked it in the first place.  Somehow I can't find the answer and that has been the biggest problem with this franchise.  Besides Prime, nothing is relatable to the original series to tie these same adults to it in a manner that will have longevity.  Basically they got it wrong, when sometimes people get it right and satisfy the youth locked into the 20-30 something adult much like some goof-off movie like Fanboys or recently Iron Man.  Still, all nostalgia aside even as a casual fan, the last two movie totally sucked.  The story's were lame and the dialogue was horrible and almost embarrassing, I would never tell someone to watch it out of feeling shame when they thought it sucked.    I walked into this movie expecting it to be worse, as usually the middle act of a trilogy is the best and thus I had no inclination that this could be drug out of the gutter.  I was surprised.  The movie still suffers from the usual nonsense however.  Steven Spielberg has this penchant for always adding wise cracking \\"Gremlin\\" style characters to his movies and they are in abundance here.  Laserbeak looks like a robotic reject puppet part from the movie \\"The Dark Crystal\\" without the puppet cast and has the most annoying, cliche' 80's sultress cartoon voice.  Imagine a evil female villian from any Disney film and there you go.  These characters use social dialogue which will only date a film years past and are annoying in present day as it is, adding horrible top 40 music doesn't help either.  How can I get into a movie with that girlie guy from American Idol singing in the background, its impossible.  The script is a little better this time around but for a movie targeted at kids and to sell kids toys and other stuff, its laced with adult themes and slander.  I would not take a child to this movie under 10, maybe 13.  When gremlin mini robot says \\"this is a cluster\\" at which time the scene changes everyone knows what they are implying.  So whats the point of that?  To be clever?  This movie is dumbed down like a comedy, but uses adult themes like a drama, but has hardcore action scenes like a \\"R\\" action movie, autobots getting their heads blown off execution style.  Who is this catered too?  Kids?  Adults?  Again I am lost.  The action scenes were well done, way better than the previous films inwhich the director is so impressed with the CGI that they slow it down and ram it down your throats while ignoring the reason they are in the scene to begin with.  I once knew someone that said they thought it was awesome because the affects were so neat.  Thats a sad thing to say about a movie.  This time they ace all the close-ups of the gears and constant motion and use longer shots and more character driven scenes, such as between Bumblebee and that kid who isn't called Spike.  There are some throwbacks in this film, unlike the others that avoided them.  Megatron is still nothing like the character people rememeber.  They debut Shockwave but give no explaination of where he came from, however he is at least similar to the origianl.  They break out a new \\"Prime\\" using Leonard Nimoy, who voiced Galvatron in the animated cult classic.  He is moreless Ronimus Prime gone bad.  The movie imploys the storyline losely of the episode \\"The Ultimate Doom\\" from the 84 season.  Bringing Cybertron to earth.  Cybertron by the way is a desolate shell of a planet with no life...why bring it to Earth via a space bridge is never explained.  Another thing never explained is how this kid picks up hot chicks like his love interest.  That is more unbelievable that anything in the movie.
B000002KXO|3.0|I think I speak for millions of FWM fans when I say that...    This CD (whatever you may think of it) has the audio quality of a cassette from 1990 !    Warner Brothers ?  We're not getting any younger, here...  This album has amazing sonic potential if you'd just get off of your collective asses and do it...    You'll make money, I promise.
B002M2N9JI|3.0|When I got the cd the front cover was already broken off from the cd case. The actual cd was in fine condition and did not have any scratches. I just wish that the case would have been whole when it arrived.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I really thought this was an excellent movie. Couldn't quite understand the ending until 2 hours later.<br />This movie is about a Guardian Angel and what she did to protect her person.
B002BWP4A6|3.0|One thing is clear - this is a superiorly directed movie with the director tightly controlling every single aspect of it - the tempo, the utter joylessness, the creepy and heartless atmosphere (not in the sense of horror), the stiff and unsympathetic faces all across.  Coupled with being beautifully shot, totally appropriately in b/w, this movie appears to be a perfect piece of work with regards to what the authors probably wanted to express.  But, all of that above requires a bit of patience and understanding on the side of the watcher and is unlikely to be universally appraised.  The victory in Cannes is sort of way too high a praise for this piece that often appears way too slow and too bleak and although the story was so carefully thread all along the director / scenarist deprives us of an unambiguous conclusion of it.  Some may consider that a plus (every one takes home his/her own message) but I believe many more will and should object that approach - to just stop the movie requires no effort, to make sense of all that was said and conclusively finish a piece is a lot more demanding.  Then you take what you want from it, not as this, it simply stops with a hint of what might be the crux.  All in all, right about 3*.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|App was working great until the last update. Shake mode now crashes my DroidX (unwarranted restart) Although I'm glad I don't look like a dweeb, half asleep and shaking my phone every morning, it should probably be fixed. On the plus side, I've mastered doing remedial math with my eyes closed!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I had heard great things about `The Dark Knight' and before buying this I was expecting a good film, but not something that lived up to all the hype.  Oh how wrong I was.  This film is simply superb.<br /><br />It is dark without descending into a parody, it has humour but without being in poor taste, action scenes to rival any other films made at this time and a plot that is actually engaging and which is lacking from most actions film and other films in the Batman franchise.  The fact that Heath Ledger is as good as everyone says (and more) is simply the icing on the cake.<br /><br />I was worried that everyone was only saying how good Ledger was due to his untimely death, but he really is excellent in this film and you will never see a bad guy played with such style, menace, humour and twisted charm.  He is spellbinding every time he is screen.<br /><br />Bale is OK as Batman, but his gravely voice made me laugh out loud at numerous points.  He may be able to carry off the kicks and punches, but he is hilarious as an action hero.  Caine is great as Alfred and Gary Oldman and Maggie Gyllenhaal round out the impressive cast very well indeed.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer supplies a suitably brooding, but strangely aimless soundtrack.  I like it (and have bought it) but it doesn't seem to reach any great crescendo like with his other soundtracks.  It has a very similar feel throughout.  Never-the-less it suits the film well.<br /><br />This film has thrills and spills and kept me highly entertained for the duration and it is a film I could easily watch again for Ledgers performance alone.  If you haven't seen it yet, give it a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|While I am a long time runner I have never been a big reader of running books...this is the type of book that could change anyone's mind.  So much has been said about minimal running lately with every shoe company coming out with their version I now understand why.  This book explains it all and is the reason for the fad.  But is it truly a fad or is it really the way to go?  Each person will have to make that determination for themselves.    Any runner that reads this has got to have the urge to chuck it all and head for the hills.  I can see myself moving to the Blue Mountains of Australia and just running day in and day out -- and I am not a 'fit' runner!!    McDougall is a great writer and I look forward to his next work.
B004EPYZOY|5.0|A lot of bad reviews of this movie are coming from people saying they are big Nic Cage fans and can't believe he did a movie like this. Well first, are they fans of Nic Cage in Raising Arizona and City of Angels, or fans of Nic Cage in Kick Ass and Bangkok Dangerous. Mr. Cage is a very versatile actor, so ruling him out of making any particular style of movie is discrediting his versatility. Second, if you're not a fan of over the top action movies, why on earth would you go to see a movie called Drive Angry that clearly showed in the previews that it was an over the top action movie. Now that I've addressed the issues I have with the negative reviews, on to my positive review! This movie was awesome. It had everything a good action flick should have: Action, Sex, Nudity, Blood, Foul Language... and then to top it off, it had all 5 of those AT THE SAME TIME. The acting was good all around, and I never felt like anyone was out of place. It was an extremely fun to watch movie from start to finish, and when it was over, I felt very satisfied with the overall story. The soundtrack was also awesome, and went very well with all of the action. It didn't have 300m dollar special effects, but they were good enough to propel the story. Anyone who is a fan of Shoot Em Up, Kick Ass, Expendables, Crank or any other good extreme action flick, will definitely not be disappointed by this film. Anyone looking for the next City of Angels should maybe watch the trailer before they decide to watch something they have no desire to see.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|without giving anything away, i can say that though this book is indeed heartbreaking, it is one of the most incredible piece of literature i have ever read. a must read.
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Their best work to date and the band couldn't be any tighter or more amazing. Susan is sounding more like Bonnie every album (just a compliment) and Derek, well, I've seen him play live since 9 or 10 years of age and he could very well be the best slide player ever...EVER. This CD is Nothing short of great and warm and fuzzy and soulful and all at once. If I have to pick a favorite tune it would hands down be \\"Midnight in Harlem\\". I could just hit repeat and listen to that one over and over and over. I've heard this album easily twice a day since I bought it and I see no signs of that changing any time soon. Absolute Best Work To Date By Far! Love it, Buy it, Live it.....
B002ZG975Q|4.0|We all know the story of Beauty & the Beast...but never really imagined a modern day version.  I haven't read the book by Alex Flinn, but know it's on the teen best seller list.  I saw the previews and checked it out for curiosity's sake and was pleasantly surprised.  I never saw Vanessa in HSM, but know most of those Disney kids are talented musically...she is actually a decent actress as well.  Alex was hot in this (tho' hotter in \\"I Am Number 4\\")and you got to see a tender side.  I LOVED Mary Kate Olsen as Kendra!!! I didn't recognize her at first, but she totally rocked the witch role!  Check it out, it's worth it!
B003UESJHO|5.0|The Amazon review describes the movie very well. I will say if the movie has a fault is that perhaps it was done too well, as realism sometimes has a way of being gritty. The acting was great as were the accents. The sister's hairdos are comical by today's standards, heck we laughed at them back then too. Christian Bale plays a role that seems out of his idiom, but does it very well. A must for boxing fans.<br /><br />Sex, f-bombs (Hey! It's New England.) No nudity.
B0054SE19O|1.0|...am I the only person on the planet that thinks a movie should have a plot?...and a little coherence wouldn't hurt either...this goofy movie starts with Farrell getting out of prison...an addict friend of his gets him a job as bodyguard for a paparazzi shy celebrity...he falls in love with her but then s___ happens, don't you know...woven into this is a homeless person who apparently is a friend of his but who is killed by a street punk...Farrell wants revenge and gets involved with a gangster played by Winstone...unfortunately, Winstone doesn't want the punk killed because he is supposedly a footballer on whom he has some sort of bet...in the process, Winstone kills off Farrell's friend, his sister and a few other people...although this all may sound potentially interesting, it isn't...everything is thrown together in such an implausible, incoherent manner as to render it ridiculous...fifteen minutes into the movie and I couldn't hardly bear to look at the screen any further, the scenes were so ludicrous...the end of the movie is supposed to be a shock I suppose...but for me, it was merely a relief...
B004WPYNY8|3.0|First, id like to say that im a big fan of Symphony X, Sir Russell Allen, and Romeo.  I am not a fan of this album.  I have a long commute back and forth to work each day and ive been listening to both cd's of this album every day since it came out.  with each listen i am more and more convinced that the band i like is pretty much gone in this album.     first, i think the song writing is poor, especially compared to their previous works.  the chorus for Iconoclast is almost embarrassing to listen to. bad considering this is their title track.      none of the songs really jump out at you.  every other album theyve put together has at least one song that once i hear it i WANT to hear it again and again. this entire album just feels....generic.      the growl has to go.  Russell Allen is in my opinion, one of the most talented vocalists working in rock music today.  you wouldnt know that by listening to any of this album.  i noticed that he hardened his voice quite a bit on paradise lost but he was still singing well.  this effort is much less singing and more of a monotone growl throughout most of the songs.    i will say this....the music itself is pretty good.  the guitars and everything still sound good and perhaps if it were mixed differently, with more singing and less growling, i could enjoy this album more.  as it stands right now iconoclast sounds no different, and no better, than any other generic metal band out there.      in summary, if youre a symphony x and progressive metal fan, this cd will probably do nothing for you.  if youre a big fan of heavy metal and growling vocals this may be right up your alley.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It said I needed to remove the current version to update to the current version. Upon updating, it was a fresh install with nothing saved...  not even prior downloads.
B004QPOVE6|4.0|I have Live at Donington on DVD, and had been considering upgrading it to Blu-Ray because it's just THAT good.  Then, BOOM, the lads release this gem from their latest tour with an insane crowd in Argentina.  So, I figured this would be my chance to \\"upgrade\\" AND get an updated concert.  As several have pointed out, the set list of the \\"hits\\" is almost identical to Donington.  The difference is that the older \\"fill-in\\" songs are largely replaced by new songs from Black Ice.  Personally, I think Black Ice is a strong album, and since I have Donington, I appreciate the different songs.<br /><br />Audio/visually, this Blu-Ray is a stunner.  It was shot with over 20 high-def cameras, and the 5.1 sound is spectacular.  The stage and that crazy crowd add to the visual and create great energy.  I suspect that those who attended this concert were probably buzzing for days afterward.  The bigger your TV, and the better your sound system, the more you will enjoy this concert.  It MUST be played loud (duh).<br /><br />OK, so great review.  Why \\"only\\" 4 stars??  Well, I'm being a bit picky, but these guys are showing a few signs of their age.  If this were the only AC DC concert video you ever saw, you'd think these guys were nuts the way they move around on the huge, elaborate stage.  But, when you watch Donington (or earlier) concerts, you see just how crazy they used to be.  Fact of life, they're just slowing down a tad.  It has no impact on the music or my enjoyment watching the show, but long-time fans will notice.<br /><br />Regardless of that little nit, I highly recommend this disc!
0743277465|3.0|I did not buy this book, but I read it at the library a little back and wanted to see how others reviewed this book. Surprisingly, it recieved high ratings as an auto-biography AND self-help guide. Honestly, I have no idea what parts of the book they think acts as a self-help guide. I read the entire book, starting enthusiastically, becoming less and less as the book went on, and ending in disapointment when I found out the ending consists of a story of how he won the championship. As an auto-biography it could be a great book, but I was not looking for an auto-biography, I was looking for a great learning book by a great chess player and martial artist (both of which I am interested in). Yet, in spite of sharing similar interests, I found this book quite boring and am glad I did not buy it. Also, in response to all these people saying this IS a self-help style book, no, no it is not. If we took everything said which could directly be used as learning tools, you could sum the entire book up in one chapter, and a short one at that. Honestly, I TRIED to like this book, I really did, but after finishing the last page I realized I should have quit as my enthusiasm started fading. All in all, if you are looking for an auto-biography then you might enjoy this book. If, however, you are looking for a book which can help you improve yourself then I would definitely say look for a different book. I hope this review helped and please remember that I WANT to like this book, but I just cant. Honestly, if you are thinking about buying this book then go to the library and if you think it is worth buying then go right ahead.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|Ive been waiting since 2005 for something new and its finally here! i still dont understand why people that hate the band waste their time writing reviews, dude if you dont like it dont listen and shut up! Ive been listening to LB since 1998 im now 27 and still love them and have to argue with lots of people that like rock about why i like them all the time. Anyway about gold cobra,  my favorite songs are Walking away, douche bag(the guitars are out of control on this song), loser,and gold cobra. the rest are great except i cant get into 90.2.10 the weakest song on the album. Overall im happy with the album and hope we get another album in the next 2 years. For now im walking away!!!!!
0345529057|1.0|Especially Angela Thiesfeldt and various others claiming that there's no call for a 1-star review.    You may have not have noticed, but this is not a literature-board. This is a marketplace. More precisely: amazon marketplace.    Here, we do not review an author's skill with prose, metaphors, worldbuilding etc. - here, we rate a product. This consists, yes, of the author's skill with her/his work - but in addition to that: with the form, in which the product is presented. So far, this product -in it's various presentations- has the following issues:    Book version:    - pages are missing  - pages are misplaced  - pages have been cut so unprofessionally that the two bottom-lines are missing for several chapters in a row  - the binding breaks  - the font is so small, that people with imperfect eyesight have trouble reading    Kindle version:    - pages cannot be tagged  - ToCs cannot be accessed for every volume, reverts to the first ever chosen ToC seem to be the norm  - locations cannot be indexed/re-addressed  - search does seem to give out when directed over all volumes      As far as this special product is concerned, these are serious issues. Every one of them. Please remember, all the people you chastise, are PAYING customers.    It does not really matter, whether you have to read the 'American Tokien' on a book missing pages or trying to get a sandwich made on another product sold by amazon and failing.    This particular product seems to be sloppily made and lacking in quality.    Paying customers are well in their right to complain.      ----------------    I am editing this on July 15th, 2011.    First: I thank all of you for your valuable comments. It has been a pleasure reading them.    Second: I gather from your replies, that there's a serious mix-up with reviews \\"on content\\" and reviews on \\"product quality\\". I can see (on a daily basis :(  ) that this is a problem; still: my opinion stands: this here is a market-place and we rate products, not author's qualities.    If you have any idea, how we could get amazon to either separate the topics (and thereby the reviews) or make it otherwise available that customers can voice their complaints about mere \\"technical\\" issues, please let me know. I'll try any way you can come up with.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just as good as the PC version. Definitely worth buying. It runs very well on my HTC Thunderbolt and the optimized interface works well.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I first saw this at the movie theater, with mixed feelings. I was impressed by the fact that it was an uncut Hamlet and by the great performances. The sheer majesty and gorgeousness of it on the huge screen, as it was filmed in Panavision Super 70, stunned the eyes. The sets are ornate, doing more justice to a story of royalty than most productions. It just plain looks and feels like an epic.<br /><br />  On the down side, I grew bored a couple of hours into the 4 hour film. I read Shakespeare in high school but had only seen a production or two of any of his plays. Like most people unfamiliar with Shakespeare, I found it hard to understand much of the dialog. It is true though that a well acted Shakespeare makes more sense to the unfamiliar than just reading it.<br /><br />  Since it's 1996 theater debut, I have seen a lot more Shakespeare, having held a subscription yearly to the Great Lakes Theater Festival for several years. (Due to this, I am also accustomed to watching Shakespeare set in more modern time periods).<br /><br />I also own about 10 film versions of Shakespeare plays. Still I was wary, afraid that 4 hours of Hamlet would bore me to tears. The negative reviews here didn't help that any. It is hard sometimes to tell reasonable complaints from the ones that just reflect an extreme dislike for Kenneth Branagh (his acting or his person). I took a chance and bought it. How much did I have to lose?  The cost of dinner out? Maybe I could pawn it off on a friend if I didn't like it.<br /><br />  I planned to watch 2 hours at a time but instead found myself riveted for the full 4 hours! An advantage of DVD is also that you can put on the subtitles to help with portions that you are having a harder time following. I believe you will enjoy this version more if you have a little Shakespeare under your belt first.<br /><br />  This lush performance is a great addition to a Hamlet library, in which you may like to include the following:<br />2000 Ethan Hawke version - notable for the more modern setting and the addition of year 2000 technology to the story (video cameras and the like)<br />2009 David Tennant version - the sets are sparse as it was originally for TV, but NO ONE plays crazy like Tennant! Superb! My other favorite.<br />1990 Mel Gibson version - I do not like Gibson, so I do not enjoy this version<br />1948 Lawrence Olivier version - considered the classic, although I admit I have never seen ition - notable for the more modern setting and the addition of year 2000 technology to the story (video cameras and the like)<br />2009 David Tennant version - the sets are sparse as it was originally for TV, but NO ONE plays crazy like Tennant! Superb!

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Great book. Excited to read the 2nd in the series. The book is well written with great, original mythology. The ending really left you right in the middle of the story, so be prepared to order the 2nd book as well.
B0051BVQFG|2.0|I've owned it for weeks, still have not been interested enough to finish it    Wait until you can watch it free ...!!!
B004K4AVAG|3.0|There are a few songs on this album that I enjoy, but for the most part it's fairly mundane and uninspired. I loved her first album and was so looking forward to this one, but I'm disappointed in it. I've given it several listens in the hopes it would grow on me, but I'm afraid it's destined for the shelf to remain there along with my other so-so albums as a dust collector.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Finally, young talent that knows how to use her voice! Adele is awesome! Very full of soul, I love her music! It is nice to see new young people coming into the music industry that are actually worth listening to!! Adele, I am a fan!!!
6305657947|5.0|I've watched this movie several times and it always keeps me glued to the screen.  The brash Katherine Banning, who inserts herself into the police investigation, actually makes this a memorable movie.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|This movie is among the great for any martial arts fan, ip man 2 continues master ips life, the action is good and its just as good as part one.
B004SBQALA|5.0|I hadn't heard of the show but when I watched it I was ready for a sequel.  Sci fi is fun entertainment and this must be rated PG 13 because I could watch it without being distracted by bad language and over the top gruesome scenes.
B001YV502C|5.0|This movie is phenomenal. I watched it on a whim last year after seeing it on imdb's top 250 list. I immediately bought the blu-ray the following day and forced my dad and about 3 other friends to watch it. It may have one of the best opening sequences I've ever seen. It's in my top 10 list of favorite movies. Possibly top 5. The final scene (single shot) alone is worth the price of purchase. Those who fancy trite and cliche cinema should steer clear. This film caters to an intellectual audience who can appreciate an original story and beautiful cinematography.
B0055SJVPW|4.0|At first, I didn't want to see this movie, the trailer was uninteresting and not very funny. Then finally I decided to go see it and not judge it, John Krasinski from the Office is in it. So, I got myself a cheap ticket and watched it in the theater. I actually laughed and thought it was pretty good, not the greatest movie ever but it's worth watching a few times. I think this is a good rental, it has a few good laughs.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|HBO's Rome is without doubt the best portrait of ancient Rome I have ever seen. The production is so deep and intricate that it is almost impossible to describe it. I've watched the series many times and I see something new everytime time I watch it. It is an unflinching view of Roman life, morals and beliefs which means savage violence and graphic sex, not at all suitable for kids! The series was so good that the disgraceful portrayal of the Ptolemies in general, and Cleopatra VII in particular, was a really unpleasant surprise. Cleopatra was shown as a sex obsessed drug addict of popular fiction of the male dominated literary past and not, as recent research indicates, a consumate intellectual who was the political equal of her Roman counterparts. The depiction of the Ptolemaic court is inaccurate, in stark contrast to the depiction of Rome, almost as if someone else was in charge of that part of the series! Very odd, and is my only complaint about the series. In spite of all that, a solid five stars, and highly recommended!
0767903862|3.0|Note: Letter grades are given at the end of my reviews ranging from A (highest) to F (lowest).    As a fan of the infamous [[ASIN:0307279464 A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail]], a hilariously poignant novel largely about Bryson's relationship with his frenemy Stephen Katz, I went into In a Sunburned Country (Bill Bryson, 335 pages) expecting a similar level of laughs. I knew it could never top Walk in the Woods, of course, but I was still hoping it would be a bit funnier.    Granted, there are some funny scenes. Bryson's woeful attempt at boogie boarding is cheerfully self-deprecatory, and the improbable scene where he is chased by a pack of wild dogs and mistaken for a mental patient brings to mind the hilarity of his previous works. But Sunburnt Country can't quite keep up; before too long it falls into a repetitive been-there-done-that structure as he visits old acquaintances, none of which have the same oddball spark as those in [[ASIN:B001IAKHY0 The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid]] or [[ASIN:B000BLNP78 Notes from a Small Island]].    It seems Bryson's strength as a writer comes from making deadpan remarks about the ridiculous things someone else is doing - he's the Jason Bateman of his novels, but without a good Will Arnett his delivery falls flat. True, in places In a Sunburnt Country is amusing. But too often it feels like you had to be there. B-
0525425578|5.0|Although this Boone adventure is written with a child-like text it still has adult appeal. Thoroughly enjoyable, fast-paced and with the usual Grisham surprises, it is a winner. Simply put, Grisham is not capable of writing anything but a class-act novel.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I truly love this album i feel that it is one of beyonce's best albums, next to B'day.  The deluxe songs are amazing as well, she has truly grown and matured with this album.  None of the songs sound like the generic, pop songs that are all over the radio today, she decided to take a huge risk and pulled it off flawlessly, you won't regret this purchase!!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|What I liked about this one was the fact it was for a more mature audience.  This isn't Super Friends! Everything from the animation to the story was of the upmost in quality.  Surprisingly.the Joker acts much like his  movie counterpart in Dark Knight.  The character of Batman, voiced by \\"Nowhere Man\\" Bruce Greenwood, did an outstanding job.  If you are looking for the perfect Batman movie in animated form, this is it. I wish that they would adapt Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns with the same actor.
B00506NRBS|4.0|\\"Don't pursue business just for your own gain. \\"<br /><br />Derek Sivers, founder of CD Baby has written this book to share his success story.  It is quite interesting story. You should read it. It is fast to read.<br />When you read this book then you can almost just browse through it.<br />however, it is still very inspiring and you feel like you should try out something new, too.<br />It seems that he almost accidentally founded a remarkably successful internet company, and this seem to have happened long before the \\"internet hype\\" and without knowing anything about the internet and its possibilities.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who thinks about starting a business of his own, or someone who is just looking for something inspiring to read.

B000002LSV|5.0|ZZ Top is, was, and always will be the best three piece band consisting of \\"The Reverand\\" Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard( the only one without a long beard). Gibbons has helped pioneer lead guitar by his unique style and chord grips while laying out smooth crisp solos. I've seen every concert they've had since the early 80's and I'll never forget Dusty Hill jamming on stage and dancing around, when he fell on his back and never skipped a beat. One of the most solid drummers around with the best perm mullets that I've ever seen is Frank Beard.Lol. I think what amazes me most has been their ability to adapt over the decades and still keep their blues base.<br /><br />This album has some of their best work from the 80's an 90's. There really isn't much from the 70's, which is a little disheartening, but the CD still rocks. Maybe they'll do a box set or 2 disc greatest hits one day. They still have the greats such as: Sharp Dressed Man, Legs, I'm Nationwide, Tube Snake Boogie, Gimme All Your Loving, and Viva Las Vegas just to name a few.<br /><br />I have jammed this album on many a road trip with many friends and we were all very happy to air guitar with ZZ Top. I know most people think they are done, but I'm one of the believers that hope they still have a few more good songs in them. Which just means another greatest hits to come. Very few times do I like a full CD, but I must say out of 18 songs, I love all 18. To me that's a 5 out of 5 stars. I hope you enjoy this album as much as I do!
B000TEUSJK|4.0|This version is FOR ADULTS ONLY. It does contain the many porngraphic scenes added by director Bob Guccione. The DVD running time is just seconds close to 2 hours, 36 mins.    Their is full male frontal nudity and female nudity. The sexual acts are \\"X\\" and \\"XXX\\" rated.  It is clearly more than just an \\"exploitation\\" film.    If you prefer to see the movie without the \\"hardcore\\" sex scenes and gratuitous nudity, you will have to find the rated \\"R\\" version (102-105 mins.), 51 minutes of footage will be missing.    Actors Peter O'Toole and Sir John Gielgud did not know they had added the \\"hardcore\\" scenes.      It is Pagan Rome, the time of 37AD - 41AD. Caligula (Malcolm McDowell) is always making love to women, even if it is someone's wife. He wants power. He visits Tiberious (Peter O'Toole). He has many slaves, which he calls \\"little fishes\\" and invites them into his pool. Most of his subjects do not wear clothing. Nerva (John Gielgud) believes he is too old to be living and is unhappy with life. He attempts to commit suicide. Caligula is excited and asked him if he sees Isis. Nerva tells him, \\"No!\\". So Caligula pushes him in the water. Caligula is jealous of Tiberious and his lifestyle. He tries to kill him too, but Marco enters the room and finishes the act of crime. This makes Caligula the Emperor, but he wants to be King of Rome.    Also in the cast: Teresa Ann Savoy, Guido Mannari, Giancarlo Badessi, Bruno Brive, Adrianna Asti, Paolo Bonecelli, John Steiner, Helen Mirren, Rick Parets, Donato Placido.     Audio options: Dolby Digital 5.0, Dolby Digital Mono.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I absolutly loved reading this book. I coudl not set it down after i got in to it . You must read this one.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Finally we are getting games on Android that have nice animation and graphics I love this game for that fact, and that it works flawlessly on my EVO 4g! The game itself is fun and addictive and can last for hours of fun and a great time killer....really can't say enough or show thanks for actually respecting android! FINALLY
0525425578|5.0|Very good book.  Of course all john grisham books are good!  the service was fast also and received it very quick.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love popcap thanks sooo much for finally releasing these stellar games on the Android platform! This is another great fun and addictive game!
B0050LJIRK|1.0|Unlike this other guy which Hates Limp Bizkit in general, I used to love them.          I was hoping it would be more like their first 2 albums, but seems they completely ditched the nu-metal, melodic feel completely. Its mostly heavy guitar, and has no real \\"pull you-in\\" moments. The only songs I liked were Golden cobra and Douchebag.  Unfortunately, like Disturbed,Linkin Park, Papa Roach, Korn, etc. Limp bizkit completely strayed from his roots. I understand LB has hardcore fans that will love anything they produce, I'm the same with Korn, but I just wasnt feeling this album. Great skill, but no substence. Just heavy riffs. This album is all over the place. I'll give it a few more listens, and cringe in the process, but dont expect a fairy tale review on an otherwise mediocre album.    PS,If they're smart, they'll put Douchebag as their next single. Don't get me wrong though, this IS probably the best rock album out this year.  .....let the hate begin
0375414053|5.0|Loved this book.  Reminded me so much of the first year of infancy when the broken sleep is the worst and you ar so tired trying to hold it all together that your eyeballs are dragging on the ground.  I was so knackered at one point that I didnt even want to go on holidays because I couldnt imagine finding the time to arrange it.  Read this book on the bus in 1 week, laughed and cried.  Its like reading a book about me and glad to know I am not alone in feeling this way.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come to android and its finally here! Great game very addictive! Totally worth 99c! Its a must have game. Get it... now!
B003HGKJH8|5.0|I want to congratulate Superman on his review, and Tame Impala, of course, on their music. I heard a few songs from these masters previously, not too carefully,and put them on a potential purchase list. After reading Superman's review, I thought to give it a go. I am bit of a purist when buying records, that means that they have to be 100% according to me. Well, thanks to you I got this CD, Superman. Listen people...If these guys were from the USA or GB, you would have all the world press trumpeting about the new indie wonder, like The Smiths, or The Stone Roses, or Radiohead or what have you. This is ONE GREAT RECORD which can be nothing but enjoyed. Some mention the vocals being similar to Lennon's, thus them not being original. Today there are almost 7 bilion people on planet earth, so there is a very big chance of getting a similar voice here and there. The guy is not imitating. Appart from that \\"misfortune\\", Tame Impala are as original as they come. Geniuses. No melody resembles The Beatles or anything else. And what melodies!!I only hope these guys will keep on recording. This is a great find. A absolute marvel. One of those that, after a long search you finaly come across and cherish like a gem.
B004RC8NUQ|1.0|So I thought maybe this would be a fun movie...nope. Ashton Kutcher managed to bring all of the talent to this that he demonstrated on That 70s Show, which is to say none. Outside of a few funny lines this movie adds nothing to the entertainment industry other than being a giant rotting cabbage that is the garbage heap that Hollywood has become. If you're a fan of Family Guy or Keeping up with the Kardashians than maybe this will be dumbed down enough for you to enjoy, otherwise spend your time doing something more entertaining, like maybe scrubbing a floor with a tooth brush.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is addictive, fun, and constantly challenging. The programmers are creative and have an amusing sense of humor. I highly recommend it.
0679422714|1.0|Well,this book sure will appeal to all anti-China or anti-Chinese readers.    So enjoy all the lies,distorted facts, and made-up stories.
1400052181|5.0|This is a wonderfully accessible story for all backgrounds.  It is educational but reads like a suspense novel. Can't help but fall in love with the Lacks family and Skloot's dedication.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This was one of my favorites as a kid and I bought it to watch with my husband. We laughed together, sang together, and I think cried a bit together! What a wonderful movie! And the special edition has some cool features on it, like a personality test to tell you which character you are most like!
B000LC4B5C|5.0|Von Karajan had re-studied these favorite Wiener bonbons for the concert and it shows in the refreshingly spirited, yet exquisitely polished, playing and Kathleen Battle's best-in-class Voices of Spring. I have the concert on both CD and DVD and never get tired of watching it, year after year.  It's also a great hi-fi demo CD!
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is my new favorite app! easy to use!  I was able to download music videos right to my phone! pretty good video quality. htc sensation
B004L49K20|5.0|These guys are craftsmen.  They've always blended rock and funk beautifully, always been highly skilled and creative, and they have a style that is unique.  They always appreciate the way instruments and sounds work together and balance each other.      This is very much a back-to-the-future album, revisiting the influences that fuelled their music in the beginning.  But it still has a modern, relevant edge to it, notably in the lyrics.  Standouts for me:    `All You Need is Now' is a great rock song.  I grew up with their music so this song speaks to me.  It shows these boys aren't ready to quit yet and still have a lesson or two to teach those newbies about the craft.      `Leave A Light On' is beautiful and reminds me of Julian Cope, circa Jehovahkill/Interpreter.  Nice to see a mature, intelligent song about a relationship.  This is music for grownups.    `Being Followed' starts out like Blondie, with a chorus edging towards slightly panicked paranoia.  It's tense and catchy, which is fitting for a song about the ever intrusive use of CCTV.    `The Man Who Stole A Leopard' is beautiful.  The keyboard melody is kind of circular, it keeps coming back on itself, looping around and perfectly balancing Simon's vocal melody and the song's lyrics.      Two small gripes, though.  While I love the production which is very open and very \\"real\\" (like being in the same room), Simon occasionally sounds like he's in another room, or perhaps another building.  He's a bit shouty at times which makes me want to turn the volume down.    Second, I can't stand `Other People's Lives'.  With an awful, overused \\"melody\\" we've heard dozens of times before it sounds like a joke song on speed.  The lyrics have some bite but that's not enough compensation.  Would happily never listen to this track again.     Still, overall it's an excellent album and it warrants five stars.  One dud song is normal (even The Beatles had the odd dud) so I'm not going to be a stingy bugger and take off a whole star just for that.  Besides, the songs I like I don't just like, I love.
B004SKLFJS|5.0|I am speechless (and breathless) after watching the latest reincarnation of The Lord of the Dance. Flatley is no spring chicken but is a cardiologist's dream in form and stamina. He dances with the vigor and precision of a 20 year old. The production is vibrant, colorful and endlessly inventive as it evolves from scene to scene. The direction of the film version seen here, the technical excellence visible throughout, the perfection of the dance and dancers; sorry to gush but as a long time fan of Flatley, I never thought I'd see the day when he would out-do himself. Dancers, actors, musicians, techies, rabid dance and theatre fans --- order this today. You won't regret it. What a glorious experience!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is one of those rare \\"love at first play\\" games. I couldn't put it down, it is very addictive and fun to play.
B004TLM284|4.0|The four songs trimmed from the initial disc and only included as bonus tracks on the \\"deluxe edition\\" are easily four of the best songs on the album.  These are \\"Up n' Down,\\" \\"He About to Lose Me,\\" \\"Selfish,\\" and the best of the bunch, the awesome dance track, \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting.\\"  Not sure who was doing the picking.  Or why she didn't just give us the full 16 tracks on the original CD, because the notion that several Brit fans will be missing out on these is troubling.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|What took UNIVERSAL so long to release these movies on BLU-RAY?    These movies would be made for Blu-Ray!    I think the problem was that Universal went with the HD-DVD format for their movie titles (which ultimately lost out to Blu-Ray) and it took them alot of time, money and effort to convert their titles to Blu-Ray.    Well... just glad JURASSIC PARK IS BACK on BLU-RAY. (OCTOBER 25th that is).    Just to let everyone know...Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3 are the best movies of the series.  Jurassic Park 2 is really not one of my favorites (however, it comes with the set ...so be it.)    Up next (hopefully) ... TITANIC AND TOYS on Blu-Ray!!
0525425578|3.0|I bought this to review for my 13 year old granddaughter before i passed it along. I found the book to be more than appropriate for her. I am a hugh fan of Grisham and am hoping that she may also like him one day.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This is an excellent movie. I saw it twice and I'm buying it for my granddaughter who just turned 15.It shows that anything is possible with God once we believe in Him and His power.Alot of acton and good acting.[[ASIN:B004EPYZZ8 Soul Surfer]]
B00008MJ8H|5.0|Very haunting soundtrack written by a man who usually scores Spaghetti Westerns. Captures the mood of early twentieth century inner New York Jewish Ghetto. Underrated soundtrack.
B000P12LWY|5.0|tried an episode and was intrigued.  Tried another and liked it.  Decided to buy the season and got hooked! Great show and relatively accurate!
1573229725|5.0|Thanks for the awesome book guys! It was in great shape and I am thrilled with it. Will buy again from you again!!
B00138H876|5.0|I am not a Dylan expert or even lover of his music (im lukewarm about him)...ive heard/owned about 8 of his albums now, counting this one, and let me say this album is INCREDIBLE...if you love music, if you believe that music is supposed to be important (as I do) then get this. What a flawless piece of artwork.
B004ZQBP3Q|1.0|This is honestly some of the worst music I have ever heard. Save your money and keep your sanity. Do not buy this!!!!
0811875040|5.0|I can hardly wait to make some of the recipes in this book.  The photos are so pretty.  I hope everything tastes as good as it looks.
0307595862|5.0|THE SNOWMAN by Jo Nesbo is a novel originally published in Norway in 2007 and translated into English in 2011. It's the fourth in the series, so we jump right in the middle of the life of Detective Harry Hole as he investigates the disappearance of several women.<br /><br />Hole drinks too much and the woman he loved has just left him, although there is still sparks between them. His methods are unorthodox, but successful, and he is called upon to lead a task force to catch the Snowman, a possible serial killer linked to the disappearance of several women over the years. Katrine Bratt is new in the department and assigned to work with Hole. Hole forms his own group of four to dive into the Snowman case, and soon they have a suspect. But, from there, there are many twists and turns as the possibility of who the killer is changes several times.<br /><br />Nesbo, as a writer, kept me interested. He wrote from several points of view, including the victims, and jumped around in time. At times I was confused, but in the end, everything came together.<br /><br />This is a novel in which I really feel you'll get your money's worth. It isn't some mindless pulp, it is a novel that will engage you and entertain you and then stay with you after you read it.
1594202842|4.0|How many of us would be willing to show ourselves in print at our worst? Yelling at our children?   Amy Chua is not afraid to put some really painful family arguments in print. She is brave enough to be honest about what raising teenagers really involves sometimes.  She gives a peek into the world of the parents who raise kids with strong convictions that go against the flow like the Chinese tiger moms, the devoutly religious, or the immigrants fighting assimilation.  The book would be even better if there was a chapter written from her husband's point of view.  The memoir was well told and very entertaining.
0345529057|5.0|Haven't read it all yet, but I love what I've seen until now. Rich in details, George R. Martins takes you a Medieval world full of adventures and involving characters. Much better than the TV series.
075640407X|2.0|So I'm trying to work out why I felt that this book was so tedious and yet why I didn't put it down.  First and foremost, I \\"read\\" it as an audio book - something I don't usually do - but there are chores to do and commuting and such and so why not slog through this book as I slog through the dishes?  It's certainly not so terrible for that purpose.  The other thing I realized is that this book is really not unlike a sitcom.  It serves its purpose to keep you entertained with episode after episode of silly scrapes that our unrealistically gifted and simultaneously stupid/arrogant/irritating protagonist gets himself into and out of with comedic grace.  Then, of course, there's a love interest that's oh-so-wholesome yet inexplicably \\"complex?\\" (groan) and never realized.  I could go on...but I'm bored.  I guess for me what kept me in was the simple pleasure of a shallow cast of characters complementing a fun little hero on his journey through adolescence as a super-genius.  Hey, I liked Doogie Howser, so why not Kvothe? (Really, though, Doogie was much more endearing.)  I guess if you're in the mood for this type of thing and can stomach this type of character, then read on, particularly if you have a sink full of dishes to do.  However, it's not a good book.  It really would make a pretty decent sitcom.  (I haven't read all of the reviews, so forgive me if this comparison is redundant.  I'd be shocked if it weren't.)
B000AMPZF8|4.0|I really like the cd, although it's not as deep as 'the resistance'. The song 'Feeling good' is the initial reason I bought it because I heard it on youtube and loved it. The rest of the cd is also really good. I can always count of Muse to give me good music without a lot of unnecessary cursing. They've a very talented band.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I really enjoyed Sucker Punch. I am a huge fan of special effects and sexy babes in skimpy costumes with big guns, and this very atmospheric movie had all that in spades. I read that the critics didn't like it, but I say phooey on them! I rarely enjoy the high-brow stuff that the critics like anyway.    Will you like this movie? If you saw and enjoyed Terry Gilliam's quirky scifi movie BRAZIL, then I am very confident you will also enjoy this one. In fact the ending of both movies felt exactly the same way to me: Both had disturbing doctor scenes at the end, followed by paradise and bliss.    If you watched Inception and did NOT like it, then you probably won't care for Sucker Punch --because both films interweave at least four different stories throughout the film. There is the \\"real\\" story of the insane asylum; there is the fantasy story of the angry male lead; there is the fantasy story of the female lead; and there is the unresolved and peculiar story of the bus driver.     For me, the mixture of fantasy and reality was very entertaining and captivating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is almost indiscribable.  I couldn`t put it down.  It`s probably been about a year since I read the series, but they were all so great that I still remember how great they are (especially the first one).  If you haven`t read this, stop what your doing and read it!!!!
0006486010|4.0|I understand a building of plot needs to occur, but this was really unrealistic. The moment they KNEW that the prince was there and that there was obviously a plot. 2000 soldiers should have been sent for and surrounded the area and all people should have been arrested and questioned. There is NO POINT to worrying \\"what people might say\\", you take the prince back and punish all people involved. It would have been a good lesson for the other nobles, burn down that castle, kill all the cats, and strike that noble family down. Drag the prince back home and make him stay at Buckkeep until he smartens up or is king and can't leave.
0679745203|3.0|There is no doubt that Michael Ondaatje is a good writer, but I couldn't help but see that this book was just too boring in too many places to give it more than a 3 1/2 star rating. The story is also very choppy, switching between characters and time periods so often I got confused more than once. The only points where I was deeply glued was during the romance between Katherine and the English Patient, which is barely a quarter of the book.    All in all I prefer the movie over the book. I mean come on it won Best Picture, and the story depicted in the film is more flowing and goes deeper into the romance, being one of the most romantic out there.
1936719118|5.0|Anything You Want by Derek Siver Review<br /><br />Whether you are already in business or thinking of starting one, this book has something inspiring to share.<br /><br />So many businesses today seem to have lost sight that the primary reason the company exists to give the customer something that helps them. The pursuit of profits should never take precedence over outstanding customer service.<br /><br />Derek's business, CDBaby.com was founded in 1997 as a way to help his indy musician friends sell their CDs online at a time when none of the big distributors wanted to handle the indies. I actually discovered CDBaby about five years ago when I was helping to promote a friend's band.<br /><br />Derek never planned on growing his business. It started as a hobby that grew because of Derek's business philosophy of going the extra mile to help his customers. It accidentally grew into a business that sold for $22 million. He put himself in his customer's place by asking himself what he wanted as an indy musician and then he made sure he delivered, every time. In turn, his happy customers told others about their positive experiences. All decisions were made by first asking himself what was best for his customers.<br /><br />I laughed out loud at some of his stories about the amusing things he did to make his customers happy.<br /><br />I related to his observation that many entrepreneurs spend decades pursuing goals that some business school or program told them they should pursue, without creating their own paths to success and happiness. He admonishes the business owner to never do anything just for the money but to remember that business is about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to entrepreneurs and wannabees.<br /><br />I received the book free in exchange for my honest review, from BzzAgent.com.
0823095223|5.0|Incredible price for what may be the most necessary book in my workshop.<br /><br />If you work in casting, sculpting, and even painting this is a great resource. But more importantly, if you really want a head-start on how to create your own production-ready sculptures or toys - this book will take you there.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, if you're unsure, and buy this book.
0811874192|5.0|This book is so lovely. I received mine as a gift and everyone who sees it loves it and either wants one for themselves or one for a gift for someone special.  I have ordered six on line already and they always come on time and in good condition. The  price can't be beat.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is so much fun. I love the concept and can't wait for the sequel. I could not stop playing game. The artwork is really well done and I have nothing negative about this game except that there weren't 60 more levels.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|The FiiO E7 is a vast improvement over my ThinkPad's internal sound card. The sound has more texture, more detail, better bass and greater openness. I listen through Sennheiser HD650 headphones. For the price it is a bargain.<br /><br />If using Windows be sure to go into Control Panel > Sound > EiiO > Properties > Advanced and select the highest level \\"Default format\\" you can. The highest for me was 16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality.) It was set to a lower level.<br /><br />One annoyance is that there is an intermittent clicking noise when I run a program or move the mouse.<br /><br />However, after a few days I handed this down to my son and ordered the [[ASIN:B004HJH1PC NuForce Icon HD Black (High Performance Headphone Amp and USB DAC)]]. The sound through the NuForce is stunning. I can finally hear everything on the 24 bit / 96 MHz audio files I downloaded from HDTrack. The Control Panel options for the NuForce allowed me to set the format to 24 bit, 96000 Hz, which matches the audiophile FLAC files that are available.<br /><br />If you can spare the money I'd recommend the [[ASIN:B004HJH1PC NuForce Icon HD Black (High Performance Headphone Amp and USB DAC)]] or other high end USB DAC instead. Otherwise, this is a fine unit. Expect a nice improvement over your computer's sound card.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|The only problem is it stopped at one place and I had to forward to go on with the movie. I was not happy about that
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The game runs flawlessly on my EVO 4G, &amp; is every bit as fun as the original. 2 annoying problems keeps me from giving this game 5 stars however.<br />1. As you progress through the story mode, the size the game gets considerably larger. They need to store the save data onto the SD card. My game takes up almost 17 MB of my onboard memory!<br />2. 2 levels away from beating my 2nd story mode playthrough my game save got wiped. I was understandably upset.<br /><br />Rectifying these issues will make it a 5/5 title.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have watched three different version of this movie and I must say Keira Knightley took me in and I felt deeply what she was protraying as Lizzy.  The tempo of this movie is much to my liking compared to the the two other versions.  I know this version doesn't give all the scenes as the others but I love it.  And Matthew Macfadyen is excellent as Mr. Darcy and I am a huge fan of Collin Firth but Matthew gets it as well as Collin.  The way the camera displays the country side and those homes good lord.  This is a lucious movie to be sure.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I got this on a competing market but have played quite a bit of the game. Each set of 25 levels introduces a new gameplay twist to keep things fresh. I won't spoil any of those here. Unlock the new boxes (each with new game mechanic)... CtR put a smile on my face every time. :-)  Progression through each box presents a near perfect mix of move planning and &quot;twitch&quot; -- never too much of either, where you'd want to give up in frustration. Even so, not so easy as to be insulting. Finally, if you have the choice to play this on a tablet, go that route.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Perhaps the best one yet (apart from the first one). Once again need to have read the book first as there is so much more in that and it would be easy to get confused if you didn't know the why's and wherefors.
B00192IV0O|5.0|There is a good reason that this group has risen to the top.  Their music is consistently creative, with a strongly unifying positive point of view.  This is the kind of music that we need.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Really enjoyed the Half blood prince but some of the complexities do get missed so read the book first.  Good acting and very enjoyable.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Wasn't expecting much, but did this album ever surprise me. Stevie Nicks is indeed a storyteller and she unleashes so much imagery on each song that it's easy to get lost in the music and lyrics. Song Highlights for me: For What It's Worth, Annabel Lee, Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream), Wide Saragasso Sea, New Orleans, You May be The One and Everybody Loves You. But all the songs are good. Also, it really flows well from beginning to end.
B003UESJFQ|4.0|There are a number of movies made that feature the real life stories of situations and people involved in them. It may be true that these stories are a bit embellished in an attempt to compact them into anywhere from 90 to 120 minutes, but the story at the heart always remains the same. And when it's a good story it makes the viewer want to find out more. Such is the case with MADE IN DAGENHAM.<br /><br />Set in 1968, the ladies at the Ford plant in Dagenham, England, work just as hard as the men there. Their jobs may be different, but its work, it's difficult and they sweat the same as the men do. The problem is they don't get paid the same. When their local union rep Albert (Bob Hoskins) talks to them about it, they decide to go on a 24 hour strike.<br /><br />The 187 women do so with the support of their fellow workers, the 55,000 men who work there as well at first. They've been told that the reason for the lower pay was the due to the scales established by work performance studies. When they learn the truth, that it is simply because they are female, the women don't take to well to their situation. Instead they decide to continue the strike longer.<br /><br />The woman leading this charge is Rita O'Grady (Sally Hawkins), a mother and wife who finds herself drawn into the role of leader unwillingly at first. As shop steward she usually drops back to allow her friend to keep things on track. But with the convincing of Albert who sees her as a natural leader, she takes on the job of seeing to it that their grievances are met.<br /><br />The one thing that's interesting here is that it's not just the factory that chooses to abuse these women. Their own union does so as well, agreeing to put their case on a back burner in an effort to get other grievances dealt with first. And as the film progresses, you see the upper echelon of the union choose to protect his own deals, protecting himself rather than stand up for what's right for his members.<br /><br />But the strike takes its toll on the members. To being with the loss in pay affects all their way of life. And when the stockpiled goods these women made runs dry, rather than give in the company just lays off everyone. This leads to a great deal of resentment among the workers, mostly the men. They seem to have forgotten the women that stood behind them each time they went on strike, including Rita's husband.<br /><br />Ford plays hardball with these women, doing their best to break the strike. Their greatest fear is that if they change their rules here, they'll have to do so all over the world. The costs would be high and they aren't willing to do so. So much so that their representative even meets with British Secretary of State Barbara Mason (Miranda Richardson) and basically threatens to pull out all of their factories if she doesn't make this stop.<br /><br />The struggle seen here is not only interesting but inspiring as well. These women were not striking for some penny ante change 5 years down the line in a contract but for the simple right to be paid what they were worth, exactly what the men were being paid. And the sacrifices they made to get there were astonishing and painful.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is the 60s and at the time women were not being paid equally not just here but anywhere. Even though I grew up during this time I was stunned to think it hadn't happened yet. How could it be that equal pay did not equal wages? Even more amazing is to consider the fact that in some cases it hasn't changed.<br /><br />The film could be one of those drawn out boring biopics that seem to take forever to get to the point. Instead it starts with the discussion of the problem and moves it forward, focusing not just on the strike but how it affects everyone. This makes for an interesting film that holds your attention throughout and never gets boring.<br /><br />The acting is above par. Sally Hawkins does a great job as Rita, a woman who simply does what's right. She doesn't set out to be a hero, she reluctantly takes on the role of one, but when she sets her mind to it she follows through to the end. The rest of the cast does an equally outstanding job, showing varying examples of the women involved and how they cope with their day to day struggle.<br /><br />I think the best thing about this film was its showing that there could be wrong on both sides of the coin. Rather than depict the company as only bad guy in the film they offer us a look at the fact that even the union at the time was unwilling at first to help their own members. Its and even handed look at the problem and, as I said, amazing to think that it took until that time for equal pay to be even considered.<br /><br />The movie is one that does what a film should do. It entertains, it informs and it doesn't put you to sleep while combining both of those items. For something that's a joy to watch and that educates, make sure that you rent this movie. It will be worth your while.she sets her mind to it she follows through to the end.

B0050CQY1W|4.0|I think she can sing, but She has stupid songs.   B stick to slow mature songs, let the others do all the stupid club songs.   I do like Best thing, but that 'Run the world' is a stupid song, (and she took that song from Major Lazer) She is good at doing that, she needs to take more time off and listen to real music singers, Take a page from Adele book.  She is not as pretty, but She can sing her but off on mature songs.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|Ended up watching it three times. Great job. Picture and sound quality are outstanding.but of course the main draw here is to see Bon Scott at the top of his game. If you never had a chance to see him live this is your chance to see what all the hoopla was about. You won't be disappointed. Highly recommended.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I've been more than happy watching Firefly on DVD for the past few years. Now that I have it on Blu-ray, I wish I had bought the set a long while ago. The main menus on the discs is a beautiful nicety, and the 'play all' feature is definitely worth it.<br /><br />What is really impressing is the minute details I couldn't have seen in the DVDs. Every scene that looked questionable on DVD is infused with a breath of clarity. It might seem minor to some, but the attention to detail is what I watch sci-fi for - all the pretty tech toys. And the 5.1 sound finally almost reaches what I'd like to hear - I'd love to hear this through a 7.1 program though.<br /><br />I will admit, I was hoping there would be a bit more special features. There is a nice sit-down with some of the cast that was previously unavailable. But it'd been nice to see the 'Done the Impossible' DVD included, to have all the features in one box set. Maybe the \\"Those Left Behind\\" mini graphic novel.<br /><br />I would probably never bought this Blu-ray at the list price, but the Amazon offer is currently an amazing deal. I dare say the details and value are more than worth the price of admission. It's time to upgrade.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|there aren't going to be any # 1's off this album.it just doesn't live up to her previous work and i'm glad i only wasted 99 cents to get this.the music seems as cheesy as the album art work at least what i can stand to listen to.some of it just seems to much like finger nails down a chalk board to even try
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Brooks has made the Zombie phenomena more mainstream than I would have thought possible. While seemingly written just for fun, he also manages to depict some of the menace of the threat from the undead. My sons and I have a lot of fun discussing what we would do if zombies were real. Thanks to Brooks for making Zombies fun and interesting.<br />If you like this books, you might enjoy the following 3200-word short story for only 99 cents:  [[ASIN:B0057HY3ZO Gladitorium Immortuos]]
0811875040|1.0|I find it laughable that in my e-mail today Amazon's recommendations as one of the year's best is this book Miette.  There are so many mistakes in both measurements and directions in this book that Amazon will be sending free 2nd editions to all that have already purchased this book. Look at the reviews for this book, how in good conscience can Amazon send out a recommendation for this book..shame on you Amazon.
B0028DRGDQ|5.0|I'm glad to see REC is finally out on DVD now. I saw this one 2 years ago and just loved it. Very Creepy and very dark Zombie flick. Some will say it's not zombies, it's rabid infected people more like [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]]. I don't agree. Regardless, it's a film any Zombie fan should see.<br />[[ASIN:B001MVYUR0 Quarantine]] was an American Hollywood remake of this film. It looks identical almost frame by frame but for one major issue I had with it. The Zombie, Monster, whatever at the end is not as impressive as the one in REC. I'm not kidding. The Creature at the end of this one is 100% Creepier than what Hollywood could come up with. If you haven't seen either, watch this one.

1401225756|4.0|I just finished my first graphic novel, Preludes and Nocturnes. It is the first volume in the Sandman series by Neil Gaiman. There are several reasons why I decided to try this book. One of my groups is doing a seasonal challenge where we are asked to read books outside of our normal genres. One of the genres I chose was graphic novels, and since the last few books I have read were not that good, I thought a short one would help get me back into reading. Finally, I have a friend who LOVES graphic novels and she recommended this series as one of the best. Since I like Neil Gaiman's books, I thought I would give it a chance.     The reason that I don't usually read graphic novels is because, for some reason, I find the \\"comic book\\" style format very hard to read. That still held true for this book, especially since the page flow was not consistent from page to page. At times the pages were configured in columns, some of them in rows, and still others in more creative formats. To me, that interferes with the flow of the story.     Another interesting aspect of this book was the different fonts used for each character. At first that took some getting used to, just like the page formats, but in the end, I actually liked this. The separate fonts seemed to give each character their own voice.     Negating the above, though, my difficulty with the format was more than overcome by the story. The beginning novel deals with the story of Dream and how he is trying to rebuild his life after being held captive for decades. I found the references to old comic book heroes, mythology and religion, and magic really helped the story develop. In addition, the characters were interesting, and just enough was revealed about them to leave you wanting more. One of the most fun things, too, was the inclusion of all of the Dream/Sandman themed songs from through out the years. What does it say about me that I was familiar with most of them?     All in all, I am putting this one in the win column, and plan to continue the series and see how the story develops.
B004MNVKVO|4.0|Although this is must for any collection it isn't quite perfect. I think they needed to anchor the vocals to the center channel more. At times, it sounds more like 5 channel stereo than independent channels.   The quality of the recording is very good and you will not be disappointed by the liner notes / photos.   The Pink Floyd SACD is still the go to reference disc for me but I will be sure to play some tracks off this too.    SACD and DVDA were great but lost support. Lets hope for more uncompressed music released on Bluray being that Bluray is a standard now.
B0047Y17P2|3.0|Not the best Connelly, but certainly not the worst.  The story moved at brisk pace.  Not a bad summer read.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|If there was ever a movie made in the last decade that divided movie go-ers in terms of \\"is it any good\\" it was Sucker Punch. Panned hard by pretty much every critic worth noting, Sucker Punch seemed to prove that CGI + Live Action Anime Girls =/= success. However, there was a rather large group of movie go-ers that claimed there was more than meets the eye, as the saying goes...    Rather then debate weather or not the movie is any good, lets look at the technical aspects of the Extended Blu-ray Edition:    VIDEO: 9/10    The transfer is awesome! I originally saw this on IMAX, so the scope obviously isn't there, but everything else is! I was rather disappointed with some of the grainy imaging in some scenes (especially when in Baby Dolls REAL world), but you could immediately tell that it looks better on the small screen. Added/Extended Scenes are consistent and unless you had scene the original you would never know the difference. Nothing in this movie is consistent pallet-wise, but that was always the point. This movie really knows how to make dark and dingy into sweet and sexy.    AUDIO: 10/10    The real winner here is the audio track. The 5.1 really comes alive in the dance sequences when coupled with the movie's amazing soundtrack. Its a good shoot-em-up mix that has everything you want in it. This is definitely a movie you would want a soundtrack-only audio track included, but we didn't find one. The added musical number in the Extended Edition (Love Is The Drug)is really cool. NOTE~ If playing this disk on something not named PS3, ensure your player is updated to its latest firmware. 2 test players of ours experienced strange audio/video skips and de-synching. A quick firmware update fixed everything easy.    Overall: 4/5    No matter of technical achievement can hide the fact that this movie REALLY makes no real sense. Its a great flick to watch with your rocker friends after getting sloshed in the rain because of the cool soundtrack. But if there is meaning to be found in the lightly written dialog its gonna take a lot of patients and imagination. Zack Snyder never struck me as a deep thinker/meaning kind of guy.
B002N8A14M|4.0|Perfect for working out, only thing I don't like is sometimes the bottom of the plastic case slides out and the ipod comes out.  Otherwise great product.  Would buy again.
0375842209|5.0|This is one of the best books I have EVER read, and I have read quite a lot! It is so deep and meaningful, that every time I read it, about 9 times now, I come away with chills and goosebumps. I have recommended it to everyone I know, and don't see how anyone couldn't like it. It is truly, as as the New York Times said, \\"a book that can be LIFE CHANGING.\\"

B00127RAJY|4.0|The DVD itself is crappy. It's all flimsy and paper is torn. Same exact thing with Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. Hopefully the CDs work and they're not glitchy, otherwise I'm returning it. I hope to see results also. I'm going to come back after a week and share my results.
B000002C2E|5.0|Absolutely excellent album.<br /><br />Surprising, interesting and rich.<br /><br />After a weak patch in the 80s and 90s, came this superb rich album.<br /><br />From \\"Love Sick\\" we see a more mature Dylan still at the top of his form.<br /><br />Just superb, a must for any Dylan fan.<br /><br />Edmund
B0058VW36U|5.0|I was waiting for this game to show up for the Android phones. The cute little hungry monster and the awesome controls keeps me interested all the time.<br /><br />The levels are great. It's simple and tutorial-like in the beginning, then gets challenging with &quot;quick cuts&quot; needed to pass them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very fun game to play. I'd recommend it for everyone, especially those who enjoy widely versatile games with flexible controls and mindpower roles.
006088732X|5.0|Synopsis: It's the summer between seventh and eighth grade, and Alison DiLaurentis, the queen bee of the group is having a sleepover with her friends Aria Montgomery, Emily Fields, Spencer Hastings, and Hanna Marin, the it girls at Rosewood Day. After a random argument between Spencer and Alison, Alison storms out, but doesn't return. Initially her friends think Alison is hanging out with one of her friends, but Alison turns out to be missing. Weeks turn into months, and months turn into years, and eventually the four girls grow apart. Although they are horrified and sad that Alison went missing, they are also relieved, since Alison knew things about each one of them that no one else did; secrets that should stay buried.     Three years pass, and the girls are now going to eleventh grade. Hanna, who was the chubby one in the group, is now the popular girl in school, but she holds some bad habits to get attention, not to mention things she did to become beautiful, that no one knows about. Aria, the weird girl of the group, went to Iceland because of a secret about her father that only Alison knew about, but is back in Rosewood, and has fallen for her English teacher Ezra. Meanwhile, Emily, who told her deepest secret to Alison, is now falling for the girl who has moved into Alison's house, even though she knows no one will approve. Lastly, Spencer is going after her sister Melissa's current boyfriend Wren, a bad habit she always had with all of Melissa's boyfriends that only Alison knew about it.      While all the girls have their own individual secrets to keep, they also hold a common secret on an incident that they refer to as \\"The Jenna Thing\\", and if anyone found out that they were responsible for the incident, they would be in deep trouble.      Soon, these four girls start receiving text messages and emails from someone named \\"A\\" who hints on things that only Alison knew about, and also knows what secretive things they are doing every minute. Is \\"A\\" Alison, and will \\"A\\" reveal their secrets to everyone?    Review: I loved reading this book. It was nicely written from each girl's perspective, and gave an insight as to what secrets they were hiding. You keep guessing as to whom \\"A\\" could be, and what their motive is to start haunting these girls.     While I enjoyed reading all the girl's perspectives, I think I enjoyed Spencer's story the most, and felt really sorry for her, especially after the way her family treated her after they found out about what happened. I enjoyed Hanna and Aria's story lines as well, but I thought Emily's main storyline with her feelings for Maya was a bit boring compared to the others.     Some parts of the book that I enjoyed was when Aria tries to make Ezra jealous by flirting with Noel;  when Maya and Emily are enjoying themselves at the party, and are suddenly interrupted; and when Spencer and Wren are in the barn, and Spencer suddenly realizes that she's caught in the act.     The book also ends in a great cliffhanger that makes you want to pick up the next book in the series \\"Flawless\\" to find out what happens next. All in all, a great start to a very intriguing teen series.
0670022411|3.0|While Harkness's \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" was worth reading to me for the historical details and the research the author did into alchemy, in the end nothing much happened. Diana Bishop, descendant of a witch killed in Salem and a witch herself, during her research comes across an alchemical book that no one has been able to find or open for centuries. All of a sudden all three supernatural species (witches, vampires, and daemons) are after her. She finds an unlikely ally and the love of her life in Matthew Clairmont, a 1000+ years old vampire. Since romantic liaisons between species are prohibited, between that and the book, there is absolutely no shortage of creatures that want to do the couple harm.      There are lots of side plots, villains, and the occasional burst of actions, but in the end, the story ends very much in the middle of the assorted plot lines, which I don't find very satisfying. The book could also have done with much more rigorous editing - there are long passages where the story just drags. There is rowing. There is yoga. There is a lot of wine (you get left with the feeling that the author, who also writes an award winning wine blog, could not help showing off her expertise.)    Some parts didn't disappoint - I think what I enjoyed most was Diana Bishop's journey of discovery into her own personality, history, and abilities. I also quite enjoyed many of the side characters, especially Matthew's mother, Ysabeau. But when I had turned the last page, the book left me feeling as if I had read half a story. I would probably not recommend this to a friend unless the sequel(s) were already out and finished.
0756404738|5.0|There are issues with Wise Man's Fear (WMF) that stopped it from being great. If you read this book, what should you expect? A page-turner (not in the bad sense), the majority of the focus on characters and set-up, very little forward movement in the plot, a well-drawn world with cultures and three-dimensional people.<br /><br />As with the Name of the Wind (which I assume if you're reading this review, you've already read), the majority of WMF is told from a tight first person perspective, past-tense, with the occasional third person interjection here and there throughout the story. This poses a slight problem - there are occasional breaks in the narrative, normally one or two chapters long, that kill the momentum of the story. I understand why they're there, but they still get in the way a bit, and I was annoyed every time I came up to one of these little interludes.<br /><br />Speaking of chapters, there are lots of them. Over 150 chapters in a 1,000 page book. This means most of the chapters are relatively short in comparison to alot of other books. This helped alot in establishing a nice pace. Furthermore, Rothfuss's prose is wonderful. It's concise, snappy, flows wonderfully. This contributes alot to how easy it is to read this book - normally i'll need to be absolutely obsessed with a story to read 300+ pages a day, but with WMF I covered it.<br /><br />There's tension here too. Simmering just beneath the surface for most of the book, however, as this is part two of a trilogy, very little of that tension was resolved. Things are looking great for book three, but until then you may be disappointed.<br /><br />As I said at the start, most of this book is about characters and set-up. There's alot of character development, though at times it begins to feel like the main character is coming down with good-at-everything syndrome. My suspension of disbelief only just held, and i'm rather generous with that too. Still, the main character developed alot. WMF seems tome about moving the main character through his character arc.<br /><br />The majority of the characters are brilliant. Unfortunately, though, one of the main characters who tends to disappear for periods of time starts falling flat. On the other hand, almost all the secondary characters are delightful, and I wanted to read more about them; characters from different cultures and races were introduced, and Rothfuss has obviously worked quite alot on building these cultures because they seem quite genuine. When you start liking secondary characters better than the main characters though, well, you've got a problem. There were some hints dropped, and some progress made along the way with that relationship, but book three is going to have a hell of a time kicking things back into gear.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, the main character is sort of caught in a rut. He learns alot of new skills, but he doesn't really noticably change. There are changes, some of them only flashing through, but they're much less visible. However, I think this is understandable - it's the middle book of a trilogy, and I think it'd be unrealistic to expect someone to fundamentally change or evolve or adapt at every point in their life.<br /><br />That being said, some of the development of the main character isn't nice, and some of it is downright nasty. Alot of people don't like this; I think it'll be a brilliantly woven piece of story that will make book three all the more intense.<br /><br />Then there's the set-up. Woah boy is there alot of set-up. Most of it is very subtle, though, so it initially seems pointless. But then things start coming together, vague coincidences occur, and there's potential for not just future plot lines and resolutions, but future character relationships.<br /><br />All this leaves the plot slightly neglected though. There is set-up for future plots, and alot of hints as to the nature of the people and groups involved in future plots, but not much forward plot movement in this book. There are several 100-150 pages detours throughout the book which, while warranted, can get tiring. They were wonderfully written, and moved the plot forward, and i've thought about how they could've been condensed and concluded they couldn't, but I can see how it may be frustrating for some readers.<br />There is some stuff hinted at in the frame story, and plot movement there is faster and hinting further, building intrigue, but at this point it's just the frame story, and those parts are few and far between. There's alot of foreshadowing, and it's very subtle.<br />Despite this, I have to give WMF 5 stars. I love a good character-based story, and it's very intriguing and I love the characters, and the writing is superb. The only flaw for me is that I haven't yet been dragged in, to the point where I'm driven to pick up the book. Once I got reading it took willpower to put it down, but I didn't really feel compelled to pick it up again later. But again, it's going to be book three that really makes or breaks this trilogy, and then we'll have another trilogy afterwards that I can only imagine gets better.<br /><br />5/5
0439023521|4.0|THE HUNGER GAMES is a compelling Young Adult novel that will have readers on edge with every page. Katniss is a fascinating main character who anyone could root for, especially when she is torn between her burgeoning feelings for Peeta in a very dangerous situation. An action story of star-crossed lovers and sociological intrigue, everyone should read this book!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read a number of the reviews and quite a few people gave very negative impressions of Mockingjay, the last book in the Hunger Games trilogy, even after giving glowing reviews of the first two books.  I realize that it's impossible to please everyone and finding a way to end a trilogy that was so dynamic to that point has got to be incredibly difficult.  But I have to say I found the ending incredibly viable and engaging.  I'll admit that the ending felt more rushed then the lead-up, but it's always easier to tear down what you don't like than recognize the difficulties and the strong points in something.  All I can say is for me, I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion, though admittedly sadden that it had to end.  In fact, I loved the way the book (prior to the epilogue) ended on a single word that finally made me feel as though Katniss had allowed herself to be just Katniss and know what she wants for the first time.  If you've already read the 1st two books then it's a no-brainer that you have to read the conclusion.  Plus I thought the multiple plot twists added some added excitement to remind you that in love and war, nothing is always just right or wrong or even as it appears.  I felt this book was an excellent ending to an amazing series!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not an avid reader, nor have I read any of Suzanne Collins previous works, but when I read the first few chapters of the Hunger Games, I was hooked.  I could not put this book down.  The details, the emotional turmoil, the story line, the characters, everything about this book just sucked me in.  I work full time and I'm a father of two young boys (3 & 1) that are very active, so I have very little time for extracurricular or leisure activities for myself, especially reading.  The Hunger Games and the proceeding books in the trilogy, had me so captivated that I carried my kindle with me everywhere I went so that any free moments I had I would read, even if it was only for a few minutes.<br /><br />If someone is considering purchasing this book and subsequently the other sequels, I would highly recommend it!
B0046ZG2VG|5.0|I really liked this item, it was easy to order and to use as well. If your looking towards getting something that Makes your pictures look old, this is your thing.  I enjoyed using it and I'm going to order some more soon :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the Hunger Games I immediately purchased and read the next two books in the trilogy.  Catching Fire kept me just as riveted as the Hunger Games and kept me just as glued to the story.  I was completely caught up in the emotional roller coaster endured by the characters and the way the author expressed every aspect of their emotions and the environment around them, it was as though I was watching the story play out in a movie rather than reading it.  If you read the Hunger Games, and liked it, you'll be just as satisfied with Catching Fire.
B0054JURZA|2.0|I'm a big Bon Iver fan, and pre-ordered this album as soon as it was announced.  I'm disappointed.   The album is over-produced, sometimes to the edge of cheesiness and beyond.  In particular, the synthesizers and electric guitar on Beth/Rest are gruesome.   Perth, Holocene, Towers, and  Calgary are all good songs, but not up to the level of his best work.  Two additional nits to pick:  the cover annoys me (backwoods fantasy art?) and the song titles (mostly mid-continent town and city names) strike me as simultaneously affected and unimaginative.  I can't wait for Bon Iver to bounce back from this.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I wish this game worked as well for Android as it does for Apple. My game has reset me 3 freaking times all the way to the beginning of the game.

B003UESJH4|5.0|I saw speech therapists when I was a kid. I still have problems with some consonants. Public speaking terrifies me. My communication problems kept me from promotions. Needless to say, Bertie's situation resonated with me. I thought the acting was splendid by all three main actors: Colin Firth, Geoff Rush, and Helena Carter. Churchill was strangely portrayed. The movie has historical inaccuracies, but I gave up on that requirement in watching movies long ago. The movie portrayed courage, determination and friendship. It made Hitler out to be a scary man so I don't have many qualms with the film. The writing was good. The final speech, the scene packed a lot of emotional punch, so that was good as well.    In summary, the film was well made. Don't expect a documentary portraying all the historical figures accurately in their context and you'll do fine.
159514188X|4.0|Very compelling book. AMAZING ending, I loved it.    Honestly, I loved the story. However, I just read some of the criticisms, and though I had raved about how great it was, I do admit, her 13 reasons why? Kind of weak.     They were valid reasons, however, I think it's very ridiculous reason number 9. That she expected Clay to be able to look at her and KNOW that she was battling inside. The fact that she made Clay a reason daunts me (although it makes sense in terms of the narration of the story.) and I honestly felt angry when Clay said \\"Yes, I should've helped her.\\" I do agree when Clay says \\"You never asked for help.\\" sort of stuff.     This book did move me, drastically, and was a great novel and it really shows you how important is how you treat others. It's very interesting how the author shows the chain reaction of how one person's actions caused another, and how it all linked back around. I did NOT feel Hannah Baker was an obsessed drama queen, as one person said, however, I do believe it was her choice to kill herself and that while those people who did terrible things to her should feel very very guilty for everything they did for her, I just don't know if people like Clay or Mr. Porter per say should be held liable for simple misunderstandings, and/or play on words.     This is a great novel with a great message. Reach out to someone who's hurting. Don't hold anything (including kind words) back. The simple act of telling someone they look great can really turn around someone's day. And the simple act of spreading a rumor about someone. Can turn around their life for the worse. I know critics of suicide victims (I use the word victims very lightly) say 'She was just trying to get attention' or 'They could've done something about it.' would probably not change their harsh opinions off of this book, because as I stated earlier, some of reasons could have been more strong. However, if you are sensitive to suicide, or curious, this is a great, moving novelthat will make you want to do good in the world.    With that, this was a great novel and I would recommend it to anyone.
B0051OZ564|1.0|I am not going to try and fluff this with words that only critics understand, so here it goes. It sucked. A horrible mish-mash of dream montages aimlessly fill the screen. The \\"stop and pose before I react\\" thing is getting old, as is slow motion nearly every 5 minutes. The movie made no sense at all. Scott Glenn needs to be donkey punched, as he cannot act to save his life. (well none of them for that matter) Save your 3.99 and rent something else, anything else.     Glad I didn't see this in the theater, I would have been financially scarred for life. Good luck.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|This is a great psychological thriller.  There are several viable suspects whose lives intersect.  The story was gripping from the first pages.

B0045HCJIA|4.0|Nominated for ten academy awards this film sure was timely when it came out in 1976.  It had a great script from Paddy Chaefsky, great directing by Sidney Lumet, well known actors and a theme that people could relate to.  Set in the world of big time network TV,  it grabbed my interest right from the beginning and I actually laughed out loud.  Yes, some of it seems dated now all these years later, but the concept of people jockeying for position and not caring who gets hurt in the process is universal.<br /><br />In the opening scenes we discover that Peter Finch, a long-time news anchor, is being fired because his ratings have dropped.  He and his pal, William Holden, a network executive, get drunk together, recalling moments in the past.  When Finch goes on the air the next night he tells the world that he planning on killing himself.  All of a sudden, ratings soar.  In the meantime the network is restructuring and Faye Dunaway is on an upwardly-mobile career path.  She suggests capitalizing on Finch's rantings and also changes the network lineup  to include some African American revolutionaries as well as a psychic.  Ratings soar.<br /><br />The film shows us the greed of the network executives, the psychological destruction of the fired network anchor and  a romance between Holden and Dunaway that destroys Holden's long-time marriage and sheds a light on all the political and social changes that are going on in America at the time.<br /><br />Mostly, I really liked this film but at 2 hours and 1 minute it dragged on a little too long.  Also, we are well past the age of the radical revolutionaries and this makes the script a little dated.  I'm glad I saw it now though.  I missed it when it first came out.
B004RKXN44|5.0|I read the one 1 Star review on Amazon, and I just had to write my own review. I adored this book! It was so fabulous, it fulfilled all my desires for Hawke and Sienna's relationship! A lot of people have said they didn't like that Walker and Lara's relationship was such a large part of the book, but I want to point out that Kiss of Snow was much longer than any of Nalini Singh's other books. It would've been nice to see that story in its own book, but I do understand. I don't want this series to turn into LKH's Anita Blake series. Plus, Walker and Lara's relationship didn't move the whole story line along, and its unlikely that if they had had their own book this would have changed. Anyway, the story was awesome. The chemistry between Hawke and Sienna was tangible, and Hawke's struggle was completely believable and relatable. Clearly, I'm a fan of this book. It's definitely one of my favorites.

B00005S6K8|4.0|It takes an exceptionally brave director and actress to tackle a remake of one of Audrey Hepburn's most iconic roles as the title character in director Billy Wilder's 1954 film classic \\"Sabrina\\".  Although veteran director Sydney Pollock and neophyte actress Julia Ormond don't exactly cover themselves with glory, nonetheless they acquit themselves well with honor.<br /><br />The story begins on the Larrabee estate on the former Gold Coast of Long Island, NY.  Sabrina Fairchild, (Julia Ormond), is the very young, sheltered daughter of Fairchild (John Wood), the Larrabee family chauffeur.  The Larrabees are billionaires, with the family matriarch Maude Larrabee (Nancy Marchand), and the elder son Linus (Harrison Ford) focused on doubling the family fortune through their vast business empire, and younger son David (Greg Kinnear), a happy- go- lucky playboy intent on spending it.  Since childhood Sabrina has had a crush on David, but since she is shy and colorless, David never notices her.  On an apprenticeship to a chic fashion magazine in Paris, Sabrina finds herself and blossoms, returning home a lovely, self-assured young woman.  Her very first day back she catches David's eye, and dazzles him, quite the victory as she still cares deeply for him.  However, there is a slight hitch, David is engaged to Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), the daughter of the equally wealthy Patrick and Ingrid Tyson (Richard Crenna and Angie Dickenson).  Tyson has an exclusive new technology that Linus wants to acquire; this business collaboration will reap additional billions for both families and companies.  If David breaks off the engagement this lucrative deal will go right down the drain.  Linus, although he personally likes Sabrina, is not about to let her turn David's head.  When David is incapacitated by an embarrassing accident at his mother's birthday party, (he sits on a pair of champagne flutes, and he gets his butt stitched), Linus arranges a potent painkiller/sedative to keepDavid incommunicado and moves in to court Sabrina away from David.  Little does Linus realize he's playing with fire, and not only Sabrina but he as well may wind up being burned?<br /><br />Here's what works well in this remake over the original: First, the color photography, next the location shooting which has wonderful vistas of Paris, Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard and Long Island.  Being a former Long Island native I particularly appreciated settings I knew very well such as the Long Island Arboretum which was used for the Larrabee greenhouse, and it's back unused entrance that was turned into the entrance of the Larrabee estate.  My favorite though was the village street where Sabrina meets David upon her return from Paris, it was the main street of Huntington Village and many a Sunday in summer my parents would buy ice cream cones for my brothers and me as we strolled and windowshopped.  Eliminating the character of Mr. Larrabee Sr., who was a whiny nuisance in the original, was a wise choice as was building up and liberating the character of Maude Larrabee.  As played by Nancy Marchand she is a sharp, savvy executive who nonetheless deeply loves her sons.  Another plus is the wry, deadpan performance of Dana Ivey as Mack, Linus' executive secretary, or to be politically correct executive administrative assistant.  It's a small part, but she makes every line count. As Fairchild, Sabrina's father, John Wood had a warmer, more affectionate relationship with her than John Williams had in the original.  A nice touch I liked was giving Fairchild who's a widower, a romantic interest, Joanna, the Larrabee housekeeper played by another good character actress Elizabeth Franz.  A dreamy, elegiac theme song composed by John Williams and Alan and Marilyn Bergman entitled \\"In the Moonlight\\" is memorably rendered by Sting in his most persuasive manner.  Finally eliminating Sabrina's suicide attempt was a definite plus, I found it very distasteful and unnecessary in the original.<br /><br />To flip the coin, the Paris sequence is overlong, it should have been trimmed, and Sabrina's transformation from grub to butterfly dawdles along.  Her aborted romance with the French photographer goes nowhere and doesn't advance the plot.  Also, speaking of romance too much time is given to David and Elizabeth's; it gets in the way of the story.  Some judicious editing and tightening in these areas would have helped the film's pace and put more emphasis on the Sabrina/David/Linus triangle.<br /><br />Moving on to the Larrabee brothers, Harrison Ford is light years better than Humphrey Bogart, who seemed too irascible and world weary to pique the interest of the glowingly nubile Audrey Hepburn.  I could never believe she would pick him over William Holden who was younger, more handsome and charming than the dour Bogart.  Harrison Ford is much more appealing, though reserved and tradition bound, he's not ossified.  The viewer believes there is hope for him, as he starts to gradually thaw under Sabrina's charm, he reveals an inner confusion that becomes an appealing vulnerability when he begins to care for her.  Making his screen debut as David Greg Kinnear is a likeable rascal, boyishly handsome, with a quality of youthfulness that works for his character.<br /><br />Now as to Julia Ormond's Sabrina, the big question does she measure up to Audrey Hepburn's?  No she doesn't, but that shouldn't be held against her, Audrey Hepburn is irreplaceable.  On her own merits, not being compared with Ms. Hepburn's, her Sabrina is charming, a keenly intelligent Cinderella for the 1990's.  She's a lithe, elegant figure, comely with her tossed glossy curls and wide sparkling smile.  In short Ms. Ormond makes a most appealing romantic heroine just is lacking the stardust that made Ms. Hepburn unforgettable.<br /><br />Once when Sydney Pollack was hosting a Billy Wilder comedy on Turner Classic Movies, he made a self-deprecating comment to the effect about how hard itwas to duplicate Wilder's master style, and he knew from his own experience.  I think Mr. Pollack sold himself and his movie short.  This is a guilty pleasure all dyed in the wool romantics should experience at least once.

1594202842|4.0|I tore through this book.  It's riveting and highly readable.  Amy Chua's \\"Chinese\\" approach to parenting has been well documented in the media and for a while I felt like I'd read most of the book already in various newspaper and magazine articles.  However I read on I realized that there's a lot more to the book that the sensational headlines it provoked.<br /><br />Chua's essential belief is that we draw our sense of self-worth from our achievements.  She argues that the more than we have worked to master them, the greater the sense of self worth that they generate.  Allowing children to give up on something because it's too hard and they're not seeing enough progress (what she calls the \\"Western\\" approach), is the worst thing that a parent can do.  She argues that it's also the parent's role to direct the child.  She mocks parents who give a child the freedom to pursue their \\"passions\\", which invariably turns out to be spending hours on Facebook.  She also argues that the Western approach is the lazy approach and in her defense she clearly devotes many, many hours to supervising her children's music practice and performances.<br /><br />However the book is also about how you have this idea going into parenthood about the kind of parent that you want to be and how it doesn't always work out like you think it will.  In Chua's case, it works brilliantly for her first child but with the second, it's a totally different situation.  It's about how difficult it can be to disassociate your own sense of self from your children.  I know this is something that I come up against again and again as a mother.  When my kids fail at something, it's not my failing anymore than their successes are mine.  But it can be hard to remember that sometimes.  Chua clearly gets more from her daughters' abilities than she is willing to admit to herself.<br /><br />It's also often very funny.  Some of the most endearing passages are about Chua's two Samoyed dogs.  Chua is mortified to discover that Samoyed rate only #33 on a list of the most intelligent dog breeds.  (The girls' first pets, two lazy rabbits that Chua disliked intensely, \\"mysteriously disappeared\\").<br /><br />Whether you agree with Chua's approach or not (I didn't), this is a terrifically readable and highly thought provoking book.  Well worth your time.e only #33 on a list of the most intelligent dog breeds.  (The girls' first pets, two lazy rabbits that Chua disliked intensely, \\"mysteriously disappeared\\").

0792110188|2.0|\\"El Dorado\\" might more aptly be called \\"El Gordos\\" as the two stars are clearly over weight and out of shape in this 1967 Howard Hawks film. Or you might call it \\"El Doublo\\" since the film is clearly a remake of the far superior \\"Rio Bravo\\" (1959) that also starred Wayne and was produced/directed by Hawks and written by Leigh Brackett.<br /><br />In this film, Wayne plays a deputy sheriff to his old friend Robert Mitchum and he is assisted by a young man (James Caan) who is nick-named after a state (Mississippi) and a grouchy old man (Arthur Hunnicutt). They are besieged in a small town jail because they hold land-grabbing Ed Asner who is responsible for ordering a man's death. The gang is led by gunslinger Christopher George. Mitchum plays a drunk. There is a half hearted romance involving Charlene Holt.<br /><br />In Rio Bravo Dean Martin plays the drunk and the deputy and Wayne is now the sheriff. They are besieged in a small town because they are holding the brother (Claude Akins) for murdering a man. Akins is the brother of a land-grabbing rancher (John Russel). Wayne and Martin are assisted by a grumpy old man (Walter Brennan) and a young man (Ricky Nelson) who is nick-named after a state (Colorado). There is a half hearted romance involving Angie Dickinson.<br /><br />FWIW - Wayne wanted to play the Sheriff in \\"El Dorado\\" but Hawks wanted  Mitchum.<br /><br />We think of Howard Hawks (1896-1977) as a Western director, but in truth, Hawks made all kinds of films, including comedies, gangster and war films. He was nominated 3 times for a DGA award for \\"Red River\\" (1948), \\"The Big Sky\\" (1952) and \\"Rio Bravo\\" (1959) and he was Oscar nominated for \\"Sergeant York\\" (1941). Among his other notable films were \\"Scarface\\" (1932), \\"The Big Sleep\\" (1946), and \\"Gentlemen Prefer Blonds\\" (1953).<br /><br />Leigh Brackett (1915-78) was a science fiction writer who also worked on screenplays.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|I was really excited when Sucker Punch came out in theaters.  I went to see it right away based on the previews.  Here's the deal (with no spoilers):    1.  The film is beautiful.  It's just pleasing to watch.  The female characters and the scenes.  It's a big movie.    2.  It's a great ride, but a bit of a downer.    3.  The story is a little bizarre.  You need to suspend a lot of disbelief to enjoy the movie.  It's Alice in Wonderland meets the Matrix.    4.  Lots of action.  Girls kicking *ss ala Kill Bill, but with big guns too.    5.  Interesting mix of futuristic and old, again reminiscent of the Matrix.    When the movie ended, I wasn't sure if I liked it or hated it.  I was glad I saw it though.  I plan to watch it again.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|An American scientist attending an overseas conference with his wife gets into an accident which places him in a coma from which he emerges with his memory impaired, and soon finds that not even his own wife recognizes him. What's worse, there is another man there who has assumed his identity. What's going on? And why?<br /><br />This interesting film stars Liam Neeson with co-stars Diane Kruger, January Jones, and Aidan Quinn  with supporting roles by Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella.<br /><br />Irish actor Liam Neeson (1952) is best known for his role in \\"Schindler's List\\" and as Qui-Gon Jinn in \\"Star Wars\\". A veteran of 80+ films, he was nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe and a BAFTA for \\"Schindler's List\\" (1993) and a Golden Globe for \\"Michael Collins\\" (1996) and \\"Kinsey\\" (2004). Recently he has been in several films as an action hero - \\"Taken\\" (2008), \\"The A Team\\" (2010), \\"The Next 3 Days\\" (2010) - and this film is part of that transition.<br /><br />You'll recognize Diane Kruger (1976) from her terrific role as Bridget from \\"Inglorious Bastards\\" (2009) and from her co-starring role in \\"National Treasure\\" (2004). She plays a taxi driver who gets involved helping Neeson.<br /><br />January Jones (1978) plays Neeson's wife. She's best known for her award nominated performances in \\"Mad Men\\" and as Emma Frost from \\"X Men - First Class\\" (2011).<br /><br />Irish actor Aidan Quinn (1959) plays the other man. Quinn is a veteran of more than 50 films and as many TV appearances. He was nominated for an Emmy for his work on \\"Bury My Heart a Wounded Knee\\" (2007) and \\"Early Frost\\" (1985).<br /><br />Frank Langella (1938) appears briefly near the end of the film, and is the key to the film's resolution. Langella is best known for his \\"Dracula\\" films but I think his best work was as Nixon in \\"Frost/Nixon\\" (2008).<br /><br />This is the type of film that seems familiar, but the unique twists will keep you guessing.

0062060554|4.0|Oooh, this is GOOD.  A psychological thriller that grips you early on and becomes almost impossible to put down.  It's about a woman called Christine who wakes up every day with no idea who she is or where she is.  When she looks in the mirror she sees someone who's much older than she should be.  Her husband, Ben, has to explain to her who she is - and who he is - every morning.  An accident many years ago has left her with the ability to retain any short term memories, so every night the slate gets wiped clean and she starts again.<br /><br />Then Christine gets a phone call from a Dr Nash who claims to be treating her.  He returns to her a journal in which she has been writing an account of what she does everyday.  On the first page she has written \\"Don't Trust Ben\\".<br /><br />This is a terrific novel.  It's riveting and full of suspense.  We are restricted to Christine's perspective and so there's always the delicious sense of confusion - baffling events that appear sinister may have innocent explanations (and some of them do).  There were elements that I figured out but other parts kept me guessing until the end.  While not perfect, this is a very original and entertaining thriller.
B003E48AYC|1.0|So, we bought this DVD and when we purchased the movie, it stated that it was a new DVD not a used DVD.  When the product arrived, it looked brand new.  It was in shrink wrap and all of the normal Disney inserts were with the DVD.  We open the DVD and go to the Disney website to enter in our reward points.  To our dismay, after entering in the code, it stated that we had already entered in the code.  We proceeded to try it a few more times.  Then we called Disney to see if there was a problem with the code.  The representative explained to me that Amazon rewraps their movies and that it was not new at all.  We had no idea and I was totally upset.  Hear, we bought what was represented on Amazon as a new movie and we did not get a new movie.  The product was totally misrepresented.    Now to be fair, we did call Amazon after talking with Disney and the representative was very nice and did explain that the DVD came from a third party.  They offered a refund for the product.  In our opinion, Amazon should not allow this company to sell a used product as a new one.  This was extremely misleading.  The worst part is that we wonder how many other movies we have purchased on Amazon thinking they were new and they were merely \\"rewrapped\\".

B000065V42|5.0|In the Summer of 1989, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989) played in movie theaters while I was forced to spend time at a family member's house as my mom worked. Life threw me a bone when my mom's friend rented it on VHS and treated us all to ice cream in 1990. Local TV stations showed the film during Thanksgiving in the late 1990's. I would enjoy the film with a plate of turkey, mashed potatoes, and stuffing. ILM special effects artist Joe Johnston directs Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989). This sci-fi-family-comedy is an homage to sci-fi B movies such as The Incredible Shrinking Man and The Amazing Colossal Man. Rick Moranis plays Wayne Szalinski, an eccentric inventor who creates a machine that shrinks ojbects.<br />Szalinski's children and two boys from next door are accidentally exposed to the shrinking ray and reduced to a 1/4 inch high!<br />The kids struggle to get back inside the house and restored to their normal size. They're attacked by bees, scorpions, and lawnmowers. They also make friends with a baby ant.<br /> James Horner(Battle Beyond the Stars, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Krull) composed the music score for the film. Matt Frewer(Supergirl, Max Headroom) is quite good as Wayne's macho neighbor, Russ. The dog who plays Quark gives an earnest performance. The special effects are superb and they were crafted before CGI dominated Hollywood movie making. Marcia Strassman plays Wayne Szalinski's wife, Diane. She's the \\"honey\\" in the title. Amy O' Neill is lovely and charming as Wayne's daughter...Amy. Robert Oliveri is convincing as Wayne's intelligent son, Nick. He also acted in Edward Scissorhands(1990).<br />Thomas Wilson Brown and Jared Rushton play Russ' kids. Horner's music score has an homage to Raymond Scott's Powerhouse B tune. The scene where the baby ant is killed by a scorpion is one of the most \\"tearjerking\\" scenes that I've ever seen in a movie! This film spawned two sequels, a campy TV show, and a theme park attraction called Honey, I Shrunk the Audience. It was spoofed on The Critic(\\"Honey, I Laminated the Kids\\").

You get an item or read a message, go to another part of the house and use it on the very obvious object, receive another item or message, repeat. No challenge whatsoever. I finished the game in under an hour and there is nothing to entice you to play it again.   The developer should be ashamed. This is worth MAYBE $0.99, if that. Do not buy.

B003Y5H5KQ|4.0|What do you get when the director of Atonement, Pride and Prejudice (2007), and The Soloist directs an action movie?  How about if La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element's Leeloo produced a love-child?  Same answer for both:  Hanna.  And not for something completely different...<br /><br /> Both brutal and emotionally delicate, this fairy tale-driven movie follows a young, female, elven-looking Jason Bourne in her journey to defeat the wicked witch.  Hanna tries to appeal to both art house critics and action movie connoisseurs, but succeeds considerably more in the ethereal former than the latter.<br /><br />Hanna begins very slowly, but with no shortage of intrigue, as we are introduced to Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) and her father (Eric Bana) living in some subarctic wilderness.  They make ends meet by living off the grid with zero human interaction and hunting for self-sufficiency.  Like any father concerned for his early-teenage daughter, he randomly assaults her to test her developing martial prowess--for which she has a frightening facility.  Near bedtime Hanna is drilled to answer questions in Spanish, Italian, German...no problem.  We later learn that she also speaks Japanese and Arabic.  Just as we begin to question how this young girl could be so talented as a spy-in-training we meet her deficiency.  She has had no human or world interaction.  All of her knowledge outside of her ployglot tongue and combat grooming have been limited to a single-volume abridged encyclopedia.<br /><br /> Yearning to be introduced to the world, we discover that Hanna's training has been geared to assassinate a CIA agent (Cate Blanchett) formerly assigned to her case; assigned to terminate her, having already dispatched her mother.  This plot element goes largely unexplained.  So if you craft questions about it while watching the movie, they will go unanswered.<br /><br /> The movie has notably two different tones.  One is reserved for the scenes in which we see Hanna interacting with the sights, sounds, and denizens of a world she only understood through her father's explanations as if they were fairytales.  The majority of her character development is cued by a budding relationship with a posh British tween on her family vacation in Africa.  She experiences friendship, acceptance, and a near-first kiss which results in a Spanish teen almost having his neck snapped (a very Leeloo-Fifth Element moment).  Her awkward social encounters are humorous.  When asked how her mother died by the British girl's mother, Hanna casually and informatively replies: \\"three bullets.\\"  While, at moments, this social experiment comes off as shocking, it also has its enchanting moments.  As she experiences new, simple things such as hearing music or having the wind blow in her face riding aback a motorcycle, her haunting expressions remind me of the emotional journey taken by the young, deaf Japanese girl from Babel.<br /><br /> The other tone was strongly forecast by the trailer: Hanna is a stone-cold killer.  Eric Bana brought his A-game Munich bad-assery to this movie and shared a heaping spoonful of kickass awesome with his co-star.  There are several battles between Hanna and her father, as well as between each of them and various covert-types sent to kill them.  In terms of camera work and film-editing, no effort is made for the viewer to enjoy the Bourne Identity¬¬-style fighting choreography.  You \\"know\\" what kinds of moves are being executed, but you cannot really \\"see\\" it happen.  Instead, every effort is made for the viewer to experience the abrupt, brutal, purposeful nature of these trained killers.  Their techniques come off as effortless; instinctive.  Also similar to the Bourne series is how much sprinting occurs in this movie, making for a very fight-or-flight-y experience.<br /><br /> Presented with many elements of fantasy--a young girl (sort of) imprisoned, naively interacting with the outside world, a \\"near first\\" kiss, revenge, a wicked witch,a fairy tale house, and various foreign locales--our more elf-than-human looking heroine strives to defeat her nemesis to have her revenge and gain her freedom.  Her journey ends with an ending that doesn't feel like an ending.  Rather it feels like they \\"forgot\\" to film the last few scenes and abruptly \\"ended\\" the movie on the spot.  Considering the strong, climactic, symbolic endings of fairy tales, this felt like a huge disappointment after watching an otherwise stimulating film.<br /><br /> Despite some large plot holes and an ending that should earn the director a well-deserved kick in the nuts, I'd still like to offer a hard sell on seeing this movie.  It borrows from many, but is unlike any other.

B0051T46XM|5.0|Good special effects, a dash of realistic biology and an interesting story make Trollhunter that which I always strive to find: something entertaining and unlike anything else I've seen.  Clutch writing makes the characters as interesting as the monsters--a task which I feel is generally difficult.<br /><br />The movie opens with a mood-setting disclaimer that it was formed by chronologically assembling footage left behind by an anti-Mythbusters documentary film crew from the University of Volda.  How very Norse-Blair Witch Project meets Cloverfield of them.  The camerawork has all of the appeal of Cloverfield without the headache-inducing shakiness (except when briefly appropriate, for example, running from a troll!).<br /><br />This film follows a group of student filmmakers as they follow Hans.  Originally suspected of being a bear poacher, Hans is actually a somewhat bitter, poorly paid government employee charged with \\"troll management\\".  This sounds slapstick-ridiculous, but I swear it is delivered with a straight face.  Hans is charged with tracking and killing trolls that have wandered from their government-delineated territory--like a secret wildlife preserve.  He hopes that filming these creatures and informing the public could improve future troll management strategies...that, and he's clearly sick of the secrecy and, perhaps, being under-appreciated.<br /><br />Like a teenager on his first hunting trip with dad, they follow Hans' instructions and wash their armpits and crotch thoroughly before applying \\"troll scent\\" which, by their reactions, likely smells like a melted corpse.  Hans is armed with an ultraviolet light cannon as his primary firearm.  One last piece of advice: don't be a Christian.  Evidently trolls hate Christians.  Muslims, on the other hand, should be okay.<br /><br />The depictions of the trolls stayed in the true spirit of classic folklore.  But still there was a subtle attempt to explain a bit about troll biology.  As a biologist, I found this charming.  The extra heads (accessory organs, really) that some trolls develop throughout their life cycle assist them in peacocking to impress females and to intimidate other trolls.  There are also two species (groups), each with various subspecies (types), of trolls.  In as detailed a manner as one could expect from a movie like this, they even explain why trolls turn to stone when exposed to ultraviolet light (and why some explode instead).  Troll detection, tracking, various baiting techniques, gestation periods, intelligence, and the simple fact that they are mammals are all addressed, even if only briefly.<br /><br />The behavior and variety of the trolls they encounter make this film feel like Where the Wild Things Are for fanboys.  There are several different troll scenes and the types of trolls differ as much as the circumstances of their encounter.  While the effects are not amazing, they are every bit as good as they need to be to maintain the credibility of a world in which trolls exist and, more importantly, to keep us entertained.  I never felt that the effects \\"could have been better\\".  If you like monster movies then this is a MUST SEE for you!<br /><br />I you like this movie, then check out Rare Exports and Thale.  Both are also Norwegian folklore-themed movies.a heads (accessory organs, really) that some trolls develop throughout their life cycle assist them in peacocking to impress females and to intimidate other trolls.

142314189X|5.0|If you are a fan of the Percy Jackson saga or know someone that is, then this is perhaps the perfect set of books to own or give as a gift.  I purchased the HARDCOVER set and the quality of each book in the set is fantastic!!<br /><br />What I love about the Percy Jackson saga is how the books are written.  Despite being for the 9-12 age group I find them just as interesting at 30.  Greek mythology has always been interesting to me and Rick Riordan brings it to life in spectacular fashion that could easily get kids hooked on the subject.  Despite being fantasy in design, the books have a nice subtle educational aspect to them; teaching you a little about Greek Mythology throughout the adventure.  Perfect for kids and adults alike I think.<br /><br />Without giving to much away, Percy Jackson and the Olympians is about a 12 year old boy named Percy Jackson who turns out to be a Demi-God (the son of Poseidon) who becomes aware of the hidden world of the Gods around him.  Each book follows Percy as he gets older and ventures out on a variety of adventures.  What is so great about these books is the style of writing Rick Riordan uses.  The books have very little filler and get right to the point.  This makes for constant happenings, and despite the biggest book being only 381 pages, there is more than enough action and adventure to go around.<br /><br />The books themselves, in the Hardcover set, are School & Library bound.  This means the books are extra tough.  The binding is exceptionally strong and the pages are also fairly durable compared to some other hardcover books I own.  I decided not to get the treasure chest and instead got the standard case for the books.  While it lacks the WOW factor the chest might give the packaging is still very solid.  It is laminated plastic that has the cover art for \\"The Lightning Thief\\" on the front.  It is sturdy as does the job of keeping the books safe and organized.<br /><br />OVERALL this is a great set for the Percy Jackson Fan.  The books are made with quality and durability in mind and the print on the books is clear and crisp.  This set would make for a perfect gift to a fan or add to a personal collection.  Rick Riordan struck gold with the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books, creating a wonderful story for both kids and adults.  This box set does it justice by giving each of the books the care and quality they deserve.Fan.  The books are made with quality and durability in mind and the print on the books is clear and crisp.

1594202710|5.0|These days, just about everyone who has read SunZi and can get his hands on a word processor seems to improvise himself a China expert, depicting apocalyptic scenarios in which the Western World is shrinking to the periphery of international affairs while China comes back roaring to rule the world.    Among the scores of self-proclaimed, self-styled and self-absorbed China experts, Henry Kissinger is one of a handful of people who has the resume and the intellectual horse-power to pull the role off.    The book is neither a purely theoretical essay on China's foreign policy nor an historical account of China's recent history. Kissinger only makes what theoretical claims he can later justify with facts and only discusses what facts can be interpreted through his framework. In this sense the book reads neither like a sterile treaty on foreign affairs nor like a chronicle of events without clear context. Kissinger himself being a main character at certain points during the narration does not impinge on the fundamental impartiality of the narration, nor does he overstate his role or his importance. He appears on the scene and then fades away as if he wasn't aware that it is himself he is talking about.    Without a doubt, one of the very few recently publyshed must-read books on Chinese foreign policy.

0312600844|1.0|and I've just decided I don't want to waste anymore time on this book, I don't have much time as it is.  I don't want to rehash what others have said, read what Zashibis says and other one star reviewers, many of them pretty well sums it up for me.    I will say the idea behind the title, freedom, doesn't have to be depressing, it's the choices we make that makes us depressed or happy.  If you allow yourself to be manipulated/controlled by the people around you life will become very frustrating and depressing.  It's too bad it takes some of us well into middle age to figure that out.  If there's something to be learned from this book I believe that is it but, we all have our moments, even stretches of time when things aren't going as we had hoped and we feel despair.    I'm at the point where Walter and his assistant are explaining to Richard what they are working on and I just can't waste another precious minute of my limited reading time  this boring story.  It just goes on and on about ordinary people living mediocre lives.

0345529057|3.0|Anyone who's watched the HBO show should take a look at this fantasy masterpiece. The first three books were really hard to separate from once I've started reading them, the fourth one not so much, but still an enjoyable experience. So why do I give 3 stars only? Well, I wasn't at all satisfied with the postal service. First of, the book set was delivered to my neighbour instead, second, once I've opened the package I've realised it was poorly treated on the way to me, the box was heavily damaged while almost all of the books had marks on them as if the package was being thrown around. Considering the fact that I've paid for expedited shipping I was expecting a better service.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  These characters seem so real and their struggles intimately identifiable.  You have to love the combo of a great script and good acting.  The catwalk scene at the end, fabulous!  Watch this movie, buy the soundtrack.

0307463745|2.0|About halfway through I decided it was not worth finishing.    It's a very short (3 CDs) rerun collection of old notions like 'small   is beautiful' and 'meetings are wasteful' and 'the best laid plans'  and so forth.  Seemed like nothing that hasn't been around for at least  20 years.  They even say these are reruns as part of the 'sell every part'   bit, saying these were sold in blog then as workshops and now again as book.      Presentation is broken fragments, with the persuasion just assertions  (literally saying \\"we're right, they're wrong\\") and no overall structure  or progression to the collection of topics.    Usability is low, there is no guidance on when the topic is more useful or  less so it's presented that how they do things is the only way and always   should be done.  Also there is no guidance on how to get there or ways of   doing business such as now that you're not having meetings what do you do   for coordination and sharing information.    Eventually the arrogance and feeling I was being played by some ADD folks   conning a few more bucks from rerunning stuff got annoying enough that I   gave up on the book.    Gave it a 2nd star because it at least serves as an example that you really  don't need much to have a successful book or company, but I had that by  the halfway point and think you can stop there.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|Lot of other reviews, so mine will be brief. IF you are one of the people who loved the Matrix ( original) right up until Keanu Reeves turned into Superman in the most lame ending to an otherwise fantastic film, you will have that same 'what the...' feeling at the end of this one. The dialogue is bad, even the great Scott Glen can't save his sparse lines from sounding hokey. The girls are pretty. Color and scene composition is very good. And the effect of surrealistic blending of reality and lucid dream is nicely done. BUT - ( semi spoiler alert ) the ending and the pseudo-hip \\"Like, wow, this is all, like,  a great Deep Profound Metaphor for ME and MY life and like, you know, I can BE and I can be FREE and like, you know, stuff...\\" philosophy would only be impressive to someone who finds Secret Wisdom in the Cheech and Chong movies. We get to meet ( but never really know) several young girls who may or may not be real, and who - with one exception - are all killed off in their heroic efforts to escape either a psychedelic brothel or a dark, hell-hole dungeon of a mental institution. The villains never receive justice, the innocent are slaughtered and in general, there is nothing to take away except the knowledge that one has spent tims that can never be regained, watching the pretty lights and pretty colors.<br />I should have gone back and watched Sin City again.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|One of my two favorite writers of the 'thriller/ mystery' genre along with Lee Child, Michael Connelly brings two of his ongoing characters together in one book. Although not his best work, the book is still very good and well written. I like his writing style, descriptions and the way he builds his characters. You always forget that they are not real. At times the switching of 1st person and 3rd person could be a little confusing but not overly.<br /><br />Overall, i rate it just shy of a solid 4 Stars but close enough to give it the 4.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|\\"Limitless\\" belongs to the group of films that explore the effects of medication/drugs on human behavior, the most famous of which is, of course, \\"Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde.\\" The best version of Jekyll/Hyde was the 1920 version with John Barrymore, but the idea is so striking that it is one of the most filmed of all of Robert Lewis Stevenson's novels.<br /><br />Other films that deal with this topic include \\"Charly\\" (1968), \\"Awakenings\\" (1990), and  \\"The Lawnmower Man\\" (1992). Intelligence enhancing drugs and their side effects have also be featured in TV's \\"Lois and Clark\\" and in \\"Dune\\" (1984).<br /><br />The central theme in all of these films is that whatever progress can be made comes as a cost, and the protagonist usually is seduced into the experiment without full knowledge of the long term consequences. The key point comes when the person realizes the trade off and then must decide how to proceed. Sometimes the decision is not left up to the person (e.g., \\"Charly\\", \\"Awakenings\\"), although even in these circumstances the person can choose how to accept the consequences even if he is unable to alter them.<br /><br />\\"Limitless\\" is a nice addition to this small group of films, although it tends to blend the illegal with the legal, which I think is an unnecessary addition. The hero, Bradley Cooper, gives a fine performance as the man who slowly comes to learn that his enhanced abilities come at a cost. Cooper is best known to us from his years as the investigative reporter on TV's Alias (2001-6) and from \\"The Hangover\\" films (2009, 2011).<br /><br />Robert de Niro puts in a brief appearance as an influential businessman and investor who wants Cooper's services as well as access to the miracle drug he uses. Cooper is also dogged by a Russian thug played amusingly by Andrew Howard. The real scene stealer is Anna Friel as Cooper's ex sister-in-law who was one of the first subjects to experiment with the drug.<br /><br />The film moves at a quick pace under the steady hand of Neil Burger (\\"The Illusionist\\", \\"Interview with the Assassin\\"). It's enhanced by the fine acting from everyone involved. This film may not be on the same level as \\"Jekyll/Hyde\\" nor even \\"Charly\\" and \\"Awakenings\\" (that also starred de Niro), but it is an entertaining film.Interview with the Assassin\\").

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Really enjoyed this book. Not only did i have lots of fun reading it but i got to see how incredibly funny and smart Tina Fey is as well as how hard she has worked to get to where she is. She is the person we have seen on SNL and she is Liz Lemon, but most importantly, she is herself and that self is so very likeable. I would love to give this another star as it is a great read for the kind of book it is but this book is not quite comparable to a great piece of fiction or a top history book or biography. Still, i loved reading this and it always had me smiling and in a good mood. I love you Tina Fey! There, i said it.
B004UHPU5E|5.0|This album is a diverse and well thought out KC Projekct that leads the listener away from the regular sounds of King Crimson!<br />Yet it is amazing in itself in that Jakko's vocals are exquisite and hauntingly gorgeous, quite different from Belew's vocals. Fripp is casually at ease creating ambient sounscapes, while Jakko frets effortlessly amidst Fripp's subtile complexity! I have been a King Crimson follower since I first purchased \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" in 1969. I am also a progressive guitarist. Even though this album is a departure from the usual Crimson cacophonous complexity (I mean that in a good way), It is delightful at least, to hear something of a different flavor flow from this band of gentlemen. I applaude this effort and highly recommend this CD/DVD.

All in all I highly recommend this.
B0036EBARO|3.0|So here is the bottom line...    I don't feel like going into the technical aspects and all of the minutiae people may expect from user reviews so I'm just going to cut to the chase because this really can be summed up in a few words: It sounds good but it's ultimately a forgettable album. Goldfrapp was clearly going for a retro/80's vibe with this cut and I was not disappointed with the mix or the mood. All of the problems lie in it's lack of memorable musicality and a shortage of good lyrics. I'm not sure if that was their aim (because most 80's music has forgettable, empty, and hollow lyrics anyways) but after the golden disc that was Seventh Tree, I was expecting more.    Get the CD if you want some good background dance music and/or if you really dig the retro 80's vibe. Otherwise, you may want to just pick up one or two songs off the thing or skip it altogether. It's a bit of a departure for them and while I'm usually open minded when a band/artist tries for that, I didn't feel as though this one hit the mark.    Listen to a sample and after maybe 2 or 3 minutes, see if you can remember anything about the song other than some general idea about how it sounds. I feel as though that's the sign of a good song. Try it!

But, what the hell i loved the movie so its all good. I saw it in theatres until i couldnt cry at certain parts anymore(only one part).

B00005ASGG|5.0|After noting the obvious (the James Stewart character represents the \\"New West\\"; the John Wayne character the \\"Old West\\"), the viewer can take the opportunity to reflect on more of John Ford's messages, because this western offers many, in layers. First, I'd note the playful ones: the antique coach is the Overland Stage from \\"Stagecoach,\\" with the Marshall (played by Andy Devine) having a Mexican family like that of the stagecoach driver (also Andy Devine) in the earlier movie and the drunken doctor resembling that figure as found in \\"Stagecoach.\\"    Then, more seriously, I can think about why the movie's characters take on very obvious identities. My suggestion is that Wayne's Tom Doniphon is not just the \\"Old West,\\" but is also the representative of Force, playing off Stewart's Rance Stoddard, the representative of the Law (capitals deliberate). Force without Law is terrorism (Lee Marvin's Liberty Valance), but Law without Force is impotent. And thus, in this grand allegory of American civilization, all is dependent on the uneasy alliance of the two. And of course both men love Hallie -- she is America: the offspring of immigrants; uneducated and eager to learn; deep in human feeling. As to which she must marry -- the answer should appear obvious.    As for government, Stoddard offers the viewer a primer as he briefly takes on the role of schoolmaster, and the drunken newspaperman writes and speaks all the right words about government and public oversight. America is a place where it is known that \\"all men are created equal\\" but, as the viewers are reminded with superb irony in the schoolroom scene, \\"lots of people forget that.\\" Ford's Shinbone incorporates all America -- Hallie's immigrant parents; a black man (Woody Strode's Pompey); the marshall's Mexican family. America is everyone.    Thus, the wonderful enigma: in this movie Ford offers an America that is all things potentially good, but an America rooted in myth, violence, and occasional outright lies. It is filled with good people trying to do good things, but the good people include those given to drink or cowardice. As for the lead characters, Stoddard and Doniphon are, in measure, the deepest of friends -- but are never overtly friends while Doniphon is alive.       This is a 'vision' movie, a simple movie with a complex message, lightened by a healthy mix of comic scenes and sentimental scenes.

B00171NZE4|4.0|The dvd rules, korn has been one of my favorites since 1997 when I got Life Is Peachy. I saw them several times with the original line up and nothing will ever top that. Regardless who they have help them live anymore. But in 2004 Head and Fieldy were burnt out from drugs and Korn were showing signs of burning out as well.   Korn still rules in my opinion, but this is not there best. Buying this is for the \\"Head and David\\" factor. In the show you see a few mess ups by the band, that during there best they wouldnt of done. Fieldy looks tired and and out of energy the whole time. JD is awesome, but his voice isnt as strong as it is now, IMO.   For the price it is worth it for any true Korn fan. I did enjoy watching the set with all of the 5 of them like back in the day. I think that Korn has improved since Head and David left for the right reasons and continue to rock and rule.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I don't know if this makes me an evil person or not, but I like walking into big stores like Target and scanning the UPC codes with this Amazon app to see how much $ I could save if I ordered via Amazon. Now, conscience kicks in with the Mom and Pop stores -- we need to support those, so, sometimes I check and look at Amazon and learn how much I COULD save if I ordered, but am instead giving to the little stores.<br /><br />Such a great feature. I love Amazon but don't like how many small bookstores have to die because of the cheaper prices found online.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I really like that Kindle has this app for us on Android. It's great and on my HTC EVO, it's just about as many words per screen as a Kindle device!<br /><br />That said, while I love Amazon's Kindle service and the features like \\"back\\" and how you can view all your notes and highlights in a book online, the visual experience on the Nook app is a little better. The page turn animation, quick or slow depending on your swipe speed, is a neat Nook feature. I think Amazon will take some of those ideas and implement them -- overall the Kindle app is best, but the visual Nook experience is very fun.<br /><br />Now if we'd quit this stupidity over whether we should be .amz or ebook and focus on the love of reading instead of the love of money, we'd all be better off.
B001SS3JS8|3.0|I have read so many of Jodi Picoults books and have enjoyed many.  This I read from a condo I rented in Maui as a loaner.  This book is well thought out, but it did not move me or make me really care about Emily the main character Chris or the two families.  While it is very well documented and the court scenes seem very real it did not move me like it should have.    I did appreciate reading Jodi's actual feelings of the subject and how she in real life would have wanted the story to end.  It is not a bad read just not a great one.
B004DF3S7A|5.0|I love Rod Stewart and this one doesn't disappoint.  I find that I play it over and over while driving.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|This book caught my eye because of the gorgeous cover art and the price. The blurb seemed interesting so I downloaded a sample. The first thing I noticed was that the writing style was steady and that the opening scenes a lovely job of both introducing the characters, and explaining their relationship with one another. The second thing I noticed was that the sample was really long. This was important to me; I hate purchasing a kindle book and discovering that I can finish it in an hour.<br /><br />First the bad. I know that this is a petty complaint, but since it bugged me, I have to mention it, there are spots where the formatting is off. It looks to me like the start of the paragraphs are tabbed, but then the remainder of the paragraph justified itself with the tabbing. Like I said, petty, but slightly irritating.<br /><br />My other complaint with the novel is that there are some places where the pacing is a little slower than I would have liked.<br />There are moments when the characters irritated me but it was always in line with the characters personality and background. The author did a wonderful job creating three dimensional characters and was able to create back stories that not only made for compelling stories, but that also made it possible to understand why they were drawn to one another. Beautiful Disaster does not have a lot of suspense, but it does have just enough mystery to keep your reading through the slow sections.<br />Unless you have a daughter who is about to start college in the fall, this is a great read for anyone who is looking for something to read on a rainy afternoon.

0307454541|3.0|I just finished this while on my summer vacation. While the mystery part of the story was compelling, I was turned off by a few things. First - the book reads like an Ikea catalog with all the names and places. It becomes really hard to follow, especially when they will refer to someone as first name, last name, but then, start using nicknames or other ways of addressing people. I can only assume it was the Swedish version of Mr. or Mrs, but it was difficult to read about someone named something like Henrik Polssik for several pages, only to later on get to a Advocot Polssik or something like that, and I couldn't follow if it was a separate person or the use of \\"mr.\\"<br /><br />Those names by the way are made up - not real characters.<br /><br />I also felt after reading 600 pages that I had really only read about 200 of real material.<br /><br />And finally, I don't believe in putting such graphic scenes into books and movies because it gives morons ideas that raping a woman anally or gutting a cat is a good idea.
0316098329|5.0|I gotta say, this book has been sitting on my Kindle for months. I was scared to read it because, well, the premise is a little depressing. But I am so, so glad I finally picked it up. I finished it in two days and I desperately want to go back and read it again.    The story? Amazing. We've all heard similar stories on the news, but the fact that THIS story was told by the child puts it into a whole other ballpark. Some reviewers have complained it's not \\"good\\" story-telling, but I couldn't disagree more. Jack is an incredible narrator, sometimes obnoxious, sometimes unclear, but that's what you get when a 5-year old tells a story. Donoghue finds ways to clarify details through the mother, and she does it so well and creatively.    Honestly, it's been such a long time since I read a book this incredible. I couldn't recommend it more.
B00475AUWW|2.0|First of all, take my evaluation with a bit of salt, because I haven't read the book completely (I could not bring myself to spend more time on it than I have).    I'm not sure what I was expecting when I bought this. I bought it blindly at someone's suggestion. If I had read a sample of it, I probably could have avoided the matinee-movie ticket price. Anyway, this book very quickly plays the supernatural card, in suggesting that \\"Resistance\\" - as the author names anything that gets in the way of the creative process - is a real enemy. And by real, I mean that I don't think it is being used as a metaphor; he actually sees it as evil, like in some cosmic Manicheistic scheme. Coupled with the fact that the author ascribes the creative instinct as being some mystical thing that is synonymous with God and goodness, and what opposes it is evil, I can't help but be disconcerted. He starts off almost immediately with the \\"the Greeks have a word for it\\" stuff, which I find repugnant, honestly. My worldview is purely naturalistic, and for me things simply are what they are; etymology is pointless to me if I'm trying to understand it (I used to be Jungian you see, and so now I'm fighting against it like hell).    I guess my point is that the author's chosen dichotomy of good and evil - Genius and Resistance - is all just more \\"Resistance.\\" It pollutes my mind, and preoccupies my thoughts when it should be my writing that is at the forefront of my mind. I suppose I wanted something along the lines of a anecdote of a writer learning to push the unimportant crap out of his mind, not a value system that suggests which type of crap is good, while condemning this other crap as evil.    Bottom line, if you are an atheist or a \\"Bright,\\" or you just aren't into splitting the world into the \\"absolute good\\" and the \\"absolute evil,\\" you should give pause before buying. The author seems to couch all bad things in the natural world, while all goodness is from God; I abhor this worldview, as I think myself and all other people are pretty valuable and lovely things. I agree with the writer of the Foreward in being hesitant to ascribe my creative force to angels and whatnot, and agree with the Foreward to such a degree that the whole book is very off-putting. If you empathize with the Foreward, I would recommend against buying.
B004GYOQ6A|3.0|I have a similar game on my iPhone called \\"Labyrinth 2.\\" Only this game isn't as polished. But it works the same way: tilt your device and guide your metal ball into the exit hole. It won't take you very long to learn how to play.    I thought this game was just okay. I wouldn't pay $3.99 for it. Maybe a buck. But not four.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|\\"Helplessness Blues\\" is an incredible album. It is one of the very few collections of music I have listened to in the last decade that can stand shoulder to shoulder with what I consider to be truly \\"classic\\" albums in pop music. The melodies, the arrangements, and the lyrics are all so carefully considered and wonderfully executed. This stuff is just plain pleasing to the ear. There's no other band out there, in my experience, making music of this quality. Buy it!
1423113381|4.0|I rated this a four stars simply because I did not like it as much as the Percy Jackson series. Having said that though, let me state, this is an excellent book. The Kanes find out they are descendents of Ancient Egyptian Gods. Through some exciting, adreniline filled days they learn how to do magic and end up saving themselves and many others through their magic.<br /><br />If you have read Percy Jackson and enjoyed it, you will most likely enjoy this book. It follows a similar plot line that Percy Jackson series did. However, it is riddled with information about Egypt, Egyptian Gods and beliefs and daily life of the Egyptians. It is this information that keeps it interesting during the slower times (not that there are many slow times in this book).<br /><br />I completely enjoyed it. My son who is 12 completely enjoyed this book. We are starting on the second book in the series now.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|This kind of \\"corny\\" stuff has never appealed to me. Les Paul & Mary Ford - yes. However, anything Jeff Beck plays, and now add Imelda May !!! Eating my words while smiling with these tracks. \\"How High The Moon\\" is just fantastic. Any track with I.M. & J.B. is superb. The theme from \\"Peter Gunn\\" (old guy's memories); \\"Train Kept A Rollin'\\" - Yardbird fans need to know more? (Check out the movie: \\"Blow Up.\\") Have a party and turn this up very loud for the Summer. Jeff Beck is THE guitar man.

0670022411|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I did enjoy it and I would recommend it, but be aware that she will be very long winded about wines and there is too much attention paid to food and wine in my opinion a lot of this I recommend that you scan which is what I did.

B00574P9EQ|5.0|The second one is a good as the first one.  If you liked the first movie, you will like this one.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|It was a bad mistake to divide this story and the next by characters.  We see little or no Snow, Imp or many of the other characters we have learned to love.  The entire story is about Cersei,Jamaie and new characters that seem to have no place in the story.
B004XIQIPQ|4.0|This album feels pretty similar to Humbug. The Arctic Monkeys show they can still make energetic rock and roll with tracks like \\"Brick by Brick\\", but the tone of the album overall is slower and softer. If you're an Arctic Monkeys fan I'd still say you should get this album, but if you're just being introduced to the band I'd say start with \\"Whatever People Say I Am Thats What I Am Not\\" and \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare.\\" Those are both absolutely must-own.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|I read the book and thought it was awful. The movie is better than the book. I thought it was far more interesting and the story was more mature than the book version.
0316069884|5.0|This book was amazing. It exposed the cruelty of factory farming and questioned morals that are connected with eating animals. Most importantly, this book includes ALL SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT. Foer (the author) gives many different view points from different farmers and industry managers. His struggle with the decision to stop eating meat is relatable and reaches out to every kind of person. The food we eat isn't simply food, it is tradition, culture and family. It is what connects us. This book isn't trying to sell you something or force you to stop eating meat, it simply gives you perspective and information that will help you make a decision to eat animals or to not eat animals.
B004EI2NM2|4.0|Without giving too much away, two strangers randomly meet and decide to spend the night together in a hotel in Rome. It's the first day of summer. From 12 minutes into the film, they are undressed and remain so until breakfast on the balcony the next morning. Surrounded by the chiaroscuro of Italian Renaissance paintings, with all their watching shadows and highlights, their conversation (between bouts of unbridled passion!) sees them emotionally undressing each other ever more throughout the night, telling their stories, until dawn arrives in stunning brilliance over the Eternal City. The camera moves like a soft and subtle choreographical brush across the canvas, so the nudity is, quite literally, artistic. The natural nudity of lovers, though not a nudist film. The film is lyrical, almost Sappho-like in a poetic way, with everything intertwining, even the theme of being watched from above (as the painted cupids on the ceiling do) wraps the story up in a beautiful bow. I liked it. Am also much impressed with the original music -  must get the soundtrack.

B0050CQY1W|3.0|Beyonce right now is still the biggest cross over R&B artist of her time and for quite some time now. she has been able to take different styles of music into her gumbo and get a stir with mixed results.  i still think and feel she still doesn't have a timeless song in her solo catelog yet.\\"crazy in Love\\" was really good, but still not a money track.<br /><br />Beyonce is like the female version of Lebron James, got the Goods to be crazy Great and might one day be in a serious argument about a place on the mount rushmore of there various fields and mind you as a Miami Heat fan, I root for Lebron, however having said that, he like her doesn't have that \\"it\\" when it comes to the clutch moments to match the natural skills and that is what hurts Beyonce.<br /><br />for all her soulful range and ability to have radio friendly tracks,etc.. she is always trying to create an event out of a box of cracker jacks. she is missing on just making music and having fun with it.<br /><br />she wants to be heavy and deeper than she is.  her voice is good and she has some moments here and there, but until she steps up the material game, she will be close,but not very good to Great as she aspires to be and for all the Hype she gets, her material often feels rushed and just kinda there.<br /><br />she needs a real songwriter and producer to push her as to pushing a image.  she has a couple of tight tracks and then filler which wrecks even a almost good album. she ain't close to great, but good be if tweaked into the direction of real songs to compliment her range as to oversinging and trying to build a tower out of tent.
B002ZG975Q|1.0|I usually love a sappy teen romance, but this movie is AWFUL.  The message:  Looks don't matter, but money sure does, especially if you plan to hold the girl you've been stalking prisoner in your mansion. I didn't believe for a minute that these two fell in love or lived happily ever after.  I thought the \\"Beast\\" was a self-centered jerk both before and after his transformation, and was convinced he'd go right back to his old ways after he got his looks back.  And I'm supposed to believe a 'happy ending' where the girl accepts without comment the fact that he lied to her about his identity for a year?  I watched the movie with my teenage son, and the best part was when we paused it to make fun of how stupid it was.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|I would consider myself a semi Beyonce fan,  somethings I like and some I don't.  However there is no denying she can sing and is a great entertainer. For that reason I decided to purchase this CD and boy am I glad I did.  I have not stop listening to it since Tuesday.  She definitely could have taken an easy route and went straight radio friendly hits but this CD truly shows off her talent.  I think it is her best yet and highly recommend it.  This is not a dance CD but to me it is the perfect summer theme...laid back and feel good music.  Not sure if this will be a commercial hit but Beyonce should be very proud of \\"4\\".
0439023521|5.0|So yeah, I have a few dumb prejudices that keep me from almost missing great reads.  Over advertised, \\"juvenile lit\\", written by female authors is one of them.  Perhaps its the Twilight teen angst that turns me away, but if it smells like teen spirit, it takes a lot of pursuading for me to give it a read.<br /><br />Then the owner of my local pizza shop sees me reading my Kindle and we get to talking.  Seems we both agree they are addictive as crack and have found ourselves reading more outside our standard comfort zones.  When asked for his top recommendation...Hunger Games.  Suddenly, it doesn't seem so teen-angsty.<br /><br />So I buy it, read it in one day (in near as one sitting as my schedule allows) and I can't believe I almost let it slip by. Ms. Collins has done more with her chosen plot and characters than you can possibly imagine.  I audibly gasped several times in the book, and was brought near the brink of tears (I am a 40+ y.o. male) in at least two sections.  The future world and its paranoid government control is as brilliant as any dystopian future Orwell or Huxley portrayed.  And the  simple Shirley Jackson's The Lottery meets The Running Man premise is so expertly executed that besides being entertaining it offers a very biting social commentary on the obsessions of today and their possible effects on our future. The main character displays her teenage concerns side by side with her very real kill or be killed dilemna in a way that is not only plausible, but endearing.<br /><br />So please, don't let any bias you may have cause you to miss a great read.  Like Lilian Hearn's Ortori saga, or Rowling's Potter collection, this first book indicates a series that has the ability to transcend its genre and \\"teen friendly\\" trappings to become something so much more...a true work of literature and a great read.<br /><br />PS As of this writing I am a third through the second book of the series and have found that the author's talents have continued to grow.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I was not disappointed, as this Howto eBook under-promises(title tells you it is about how \\"specifically John sold 1 million eBook in 5 months\\"), and over-delivers (by telling you not how only he did it, but also how can any Author also do the same with very simple tips)!     But I can understand if someone is disappointed, as it is human nature to over-complicate what it is truly simple, so much so, that a proven and tested slogan in Sales: K.I.S.S., meaning Keep It Simple Stupid is a daily reminder to any sales teammate before they hit the floor to greet their customers!    -So, if those FEW NUGGETS JOHN GIVES US IS ALL IS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THE PROJECTS GOAL: Then please remember your are better of, it is K.I.S.S.!    -BOOK IS SHORT in page numbers, well is about just what is needed for the goal, not about the ultimate encyclopedia as you the Author do not want to become an internet expert with a degree in Social Media Marketing, no time to write then, but want only the tools you need, if Social Media Marketing 101 is enough, then DO ME A FAVOR AND STOP RIGHT THERE, no need to keep on going up to Social Media Marketing 909 LADDER, no one has time to waste on a useless PhD In Social media: Again K.I.S.S.!    -The 40% TELLING US WHAT A GREAT SYSTEM HE HAS IS EXTREMELY NECESSARY, IT IS CALLED \\"PEP TALK\\" in Sales as any business owner or anyone who managed a team knows, so no need to be disappointed there, as it is usually just what the Doctor ordered, specially when an author is discouraged and down on his luck with sales, as his newly minted eBook is not selling as expected: K.I.S.S.!    -This eBook is worth much more than the $5, and the proof is in the pudding, it is not a \\"theory\\" of what to do, that may or not pay of, as it is what John exactly did to sell the 1 million eBook in 5 short months, so how many $5 dollar bills was that first million? Again: K.I.S.S.!

B00506NRBS|5.0|I used to be a fan of the self-help books, all the way from Norman Vincent Peale to Dale Csrnegie to Anthony Robbins. The point of all of the reading was to just learn about living life at a higher frequency. But I started to move away from these because they made things look so very easy, to the point where I think they are almost irrelevant to the real world.<br /><br />I was brought to this book through Seth Godin's Blog. It was an excellent read to me because it seemed to be a very honest and realistic discourse. The points of inspiration in this book are not Pollyanna-ish in the least. Sivers made errors, retreated, emerged, retreated again and then emerged again. Ups and downs. No smooth path. And he relates it very clearly.<br /><br />I have built a successful business over the past 7 years but I have not enjoyed the ride. I am always looking to the end. But now that things are much better, I look back and see that I could have really enjoyed the process much more, and really it is the process that is the juice for me.<br /><br />Sivers distills this very very well in writing about his experiences. Reading this has shaken me up tonight and brought to the forefront of my mind thoughts that I need to make some serious changes finally that will make me happier and my business more successful.<br /><br />Thank you Derek Sivers for this book!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|This is the perfect \\"how to\\" book for aspiring indie authors.  Whether you're just getting started or you've circled around the block a few times, there is something valuable for every indie who wants to sell their books in this read.<br />What I especially loved about this book was the tone of the author. I admit when I downloaded this book to my Kindle I dreaded reading it and was positive I would cast it aside and forget about it before I got to the third page.  I absolutely hate non - fiction, no offense to those of you who write it, read it and adore it, I'm just being honest. My point is, the author held my attention and that is saying something as I confess to being an obsessive YA paranormal romance book fiend. The book doesn't read like an instruction manual. Instead, it felt like I was getting sound advice and encouragement from a friend.  Mr. Locke takes a no nonsense approach to his business of books. He knows time is valuable to authors (he is one himself) so he doesn't beat around the bush.

0061433047|5.0|Another wonderful story from the amazing Terry Pratchett! Tiffany is one of my favorite characters ever created and this book continues her story with the same style and great writing of the first ones in the series.    The Nac Mac Feegles always make me laugh!    Watching Tiffany 'grow up' is delightful and catching up with Granny Weatherwax is always great fun.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Hitchcock at his best!<br /><br />Cary Grant (One of Hitch's favorite actors) has never been beter.  Eva Marie Saint, the typical Hitchcock blonde, is also excellent.  James Mason  plays a suavely sinister villain.  Martin Landau plays...let's say a very unusual character.  (Is he in love with James Mason?)<br /><br />The dialogue is witty and laced with mildly risque double entendres.  Classic Hitchcock set pieces (the crop duster sequence, the climb on Mt. Rushmore) add to the genuine suspense of the film.<br /><br />Altogether a great and very enteretaining movie!

B002C6A6FY|5.0|In my opinion Casablanca is the greatest movie to ever come out of Hollywood.  A classic blend of wartime drama, romance, intrigue, and suspense, set against a wonderfully atmospheric and exotic background.  All of the actors are terrific.  Bogart and Bergman make a superb romantic couple, Claude Raines is downright hilarious as the corrupt chief of police, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre add a touch of sinisster menace.  All of the characters, even down to the ones with only a line or two give outstanding performances.  It's impossible to imagine this movie with any other cast.<br /><br />The writing is witty and unforgettable, packed with lines that have become immortal. Crisp direction, atmospheric sets and beautiful black-and-white photography make this a superb, highly entertaining film.  Not to be missed!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had been hearing all the hype about Angry Birds long before I got a phone that could support the game.  Now that I finally have an android, WOW this game is amazing!!  It is a lot of fun and though at times very challenging, it's the best!

B004ZGM76A|1.0|I did not catch Sucker Punch when it was in the theater being shown in IMAX.  I had seen the lackluster reviews on Rotten Tomatoes but since I have enjoyed Zack Snyder's other efforts (300, Watchmen) I thought critics were just being particularly hard on him with this newest effort.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />From the very opening scenes this entire turkey of a movie simply stinks from beginning to end.  No amount of gorgeous women running around in skimpy outfits with huge guns and swords can change the fact that this movie has a terrible plot that barely makes sense, action sequences that look like they were pulled from some of the worst \\"B\\" comic books of the past decade, and acting that is just simply completely atrocious.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like big spectacle movies that try to wow the audience with gorgeous visuals.  I LOVED Kick Ass!  I even thought Tron was decent because the visual styling was a masterpiece of light and color and the plot and acting, while sub-par were at least watchable.  Sucker Punch though is in a whole other category of film.  It goes beyond the bubble gum styled visual spectacle that has a weak plot and mediocre acting.  Sucker Punch is basically an ego trip for a writer who thought it would be great fun to shoot scenes of giant robots fighting Germans in WWI trenches.... or maybe it is mental masturbation when you scribble together a few weak sauce lines and try to call it a story.  I did not even think the visuals were that good and I have a top of the line 65\\" Plasma TV to watch on, so I should know what looks good.<br /><br />All in all this is a terrible movie.  I literally watched this disc (which I purchased here), struggled through to the end (by 20 minutes into the movie I was already debating turning it off) and promptly put it up for auction on eBay because I have absolutely zero desire to see this cornball piece of crap ever ever again.  I think at points during the movie I literally felt myself getting stupider.  I feel for those who think that this is a great movie, maybe they should go rent a copy of Raider's of the Lost Ark.o think that this is a great movie, maybe they should go rent a copy of Raider's of the Lost Ark.

0962477060|5.0|This is a great book for beginners like me. I had learned how to read tabs and began copying music until I bought this book.

I don't just recommend this book, I will tell everyone learning the guitar that this is a MUST HAVE!
B002ZG975Q|1.0|Nothing to do with the book! They took away all the fun stuff (the chat group), all the process the character went through! And an Olsen girl for witch? And a tattoed boy for beast? Come on...
B0050CQY1W|3.0|I wasn't expecting this album to be full of ballads, and wound up being a little disappointed. I was never really a huge Beyonce fan(she seemed corny) until she came out with Sasha Fierce. I thought the cd showed alot of maturity and most of her uptempo songs were pretty well done. I'm glad it had received all the accolades, because it was her best work (imo). I thought this cd was ok, I thought the singing on I care and 1+1 were pretty good, but the rest of the ballads just seemed like filler. I really didn't like Party,although i thought it was interesting to see how she honored new jack swing/ 90s rnb. My favorite tracks were countdown and end of time, those two were pretty standout tracks. Run the world girls really wasn't that good of song, I just found it really boring and lackluster compared to other artists music that's coming out. She really should have came out with a stronger first single. While, I didn't care of a majority of the album, there's no denying that she's a huge star and she'll always have alot of buzz when her projects come out. I liked the direction she took with this album, it reminded me of Erkyah Badu, Kandi, and Fantasia's latest releases: chalk full of good singing, with minimal uptempo songs. I can see that she's more serious then Kesha or Lady Gaga, but wound up being a disappointed by an album that doesn't quite hits it target demographic. It's alittle too wise beyond it's years.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|The game downloaded on my Epic 4G without problems. Permissions are minimal.  The game itself looks nice and works well.  No crashes so far (a frequent problem on my phone - especially with Popcap).  I like labyrinth games, and this one works better than I expected.  It's really done very well.  I've only started on the &quot;very easy&quot; mazes, but I think this will be a fun game to keep around.  Not sure I'd have paid $3.99 for it though, but I never pay for apps...
B003H9M1QM|4.0|Why would anyone who now has a Blu-Ray disc player, want to pay so much money to get the Blu-Ray disc, and yet get another copy of it in the DVD format?  In most cases, anyone who wants this movie of \\"Dumbo\\" this late in their life already has the freakin' DVD!  So, why do we have to buy it again?  They did this with \\"Monsters, Inc\\" too where they also give you a Digital Copy (that you didn't ask for) to have to buy.  Four discs when all I want is one movie. I have yet to see that release be less than $30.  Disney sucks!  You are forced to buy so much more than you need just to get the bleeding Blu-Ray version. They did this with \\"Fantasia\\" too where you're paying for four discs when all you really wanted is just the one.<br /><br />Well, Walt Disney sure is over confident that they are worth half a damn!

B0032UYFA6|5.0|I just loved this season. It is smart, funny, shocking and original. I also loved way the characters develop. The quality of the photography and acting of all the cast make it compelling viewing. Can't wait for the next season.So hurry up with the next season's DVD.
B000001GPW|2.0|I should state that this review is primarily in regards to the 2nd concerto which is one of the most emotionally important all all classical works to me and the one that I know best.<br /><br /> I was introduced (putting it mildly) to the 2nd concerto with the Sandor recording with Gielen and the Vienna Sympnony on Turnabout in the early '70s.  In the 90's, I purchased the Pollini recording with Abaddo and Chicago and truly love it.<br /><br />After all the accolades for this performace--it reportedly being the \\"benchmark\\" and such--I couldn't fathom why I didn't have it--budgets not withstanding. I was in need of a Bartok 2nd fix so I purchased it.<br /><br />On listening, I was extremely disappointed in that I had no emtional response to it.  I listened again and again, and compared it to other recordings.<br /><br />My conclusion is that the conducting is heavy handed, the orchestra is weak, and for this work, you need great conducting and orchestral playing as well as a piano master of the first rank.<br /><br />The second concerto, while being brilliant in it's total architecture, is filled with great \\"moments\\" and Fricsay, for the most part, either plows through the moments or overdoes them so they are distracting.  Examples are in the 3rd movement at about 3:50 when the brass have a brief but full chordal figure that then crescendos to the next section.  Fricsay first takes the figure way too broadly and then puts a subito piano prior to the crescendo for the last chord of the sequence. This is not in the score and both the tempo and unnecessary subito piano totally disrupt the energy that has been building.  Another example, in the first movement, is at the very end where, again, the brass have a figure prior to the last line.  Fricsay basically makes what should be a 16th note from a series 16th notes preceding it sound twice as fast--and ruins the phrase.<br /><br />I know this could be considered nit-picking, but the performance as a whole is full of these lapses and ruins the work as a whole.  I also haven't really addressed Anda who sounds great from what I can tell--but I'm so distracted by the rest of it.  I know one can get used to certain performances, but to me, this is more than just subtle differences in interpretation.  To me, it's just not musical!<br /><br />I just don't understand how this performance gets the accolades it does.  Benchmark? I don't think so.
0553386794|4.0|If I had only one sentence to describe A Game of Thrones, by George R.R. Martin, it would be this:  Epic fantasy collides with historical fiction.  And like most accident scenes, the results are often messy.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones, the first in A Song of Ice and Fire series, hit the bookshelves with wild acclaim 15 years ago.  Books two through four soon followed, but then series petered out in 2005.  Now there's a resurgence of interest due to the debut of the HBO miniseries and with the impeding release of book five, A Dance With Dragons, this July.<br /><br />This epic covers a dynastic struggle among several noble families in the kingdom of Westeros, an island vaguely similar to the British Isles.  In fact, it's been said, this series is a fantasy version of the War of the Roses.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book for several reasons:  It was well written, while the characters appeared to be fleshed-out, flawed and three-dimensional, not merely caricatures of good and evil.  As a wargamer, what I liked most about this book was the world building. The author did a fantastic job developing a realistic fantasy world that isn't dominated by monsters and magicians.  A Song of Ice and Fire spawned several gaming spin-offs, such as a strategy game, (now, sadly out of print), a miniatures boardgame, a card game and a roleplaying game.<br /><br />My biggest complaint though,  is the story felt inconclusive--even after 807 pages.  This was merely the opening act of a long saga.  And from what I've read on line, the sequels are equally inconclusive.  So I'm not inclined to pick up the remaining books any time soon.  Instead, I'd rather veer off the author's beaten path and wargame my own misadventures with my gaming friends.<br /><br />From reading some of the rants and reviews, one of the tipping points was the setting and tone of the book, or the \\"world building,\\" I mentioned earlier.  Those who disliked A Game of Thrones, considered the world dark and grim.  I prefer to use the word \\"harsh.\\"  In modeling the story after the War of the Roses, then it is indeed a harsh and unforgiving world, where life has been said to be \\"violent, brutish and short.\\"  Which is why I liked it--the story goes against typical epic fantasy tropes.  I suspect, the other readers who liked A Game of Thrones, also enjoy reading historical fiction, like I do.<br /><br />For now, though, I'm \\"quiting while I'm ahead\\" in my feelings towards the series.the story after the War of the Roses, then it is indeed a harsh and unforgiving world, where life has been said to be \\"violent, brutish and short.\\"  Which is why I liked it--the story goes against typical epic fantasy tropes.

B002ZG980U|5.0|wow and more wow....!  once i see the move the first time i had many questions and now that i have seen it for a few mor times.. i love it... specially because every new time i see it i noticed new things that i missed before... like in a dream.. amazing how much information is on this film and how this is true.. specially because i have done that what Cobb has before... i have been  on his position and i have faced their projections like they mention on the film, but i called them (or better say Carlos Castaneda has named them ) \\"inorganic beings\\" quite nasty as i would say.. but is a reality.. love the film and i am looking fwd to do more experiments like Cobb going deeper and deeper.... eventhough last time was kind of a rough ride and i have refrain on doing it.. but now and after the film.. i ask to myself. Why not.? so let's go and here i come once more...!
0670022411|5.0|It took patience at the beginning..that could have been just me! I found a bit too much detail in some parts.  Once you get started though, it moves along with the main character a powerful witch who won't use her talent.  She is sought by vamps, daemons and other witches.  Action, romance, strong plot..highly recommend!!  Be aware this is first book of the trilogy!! I'm definitely looking forward to the next book:)
0439023521|5.0|Its a book that will immediately hook you because it is so different than what is out there. Starts with Katniss and her best friend Gayle who are out hunting which is forbidden in her District. Both of their families are poor and hungry, along with the most of District 12. Every year there is drawing selecting 2 children ages 12+ up from every district to enter the Hunger Games held in an arena for everyone to watch them battle it out until there is one standing. When the drawing came up in District 12 Katniss's sister who just turned twelve was chosen to enter the Hunger Games; however, Katniss wouldn't allow it and volunteered herself in her place as the Female tribute for the district along side Peeta the male tribute.      I thought this book was really good, action, imagination, a darkness to it, as well as a possibility for a love story that has not gone too mushy. The way the hunger game plays out was interesting and happy with the end result of this book.

0439023513|2.0|Katniss wakes up in District 13 that no one knew still existed. A war is going on with all the other districts. District 12 has been demolished. The President of District 13 President Coin allows Katniss to act as the Mockingjay (symbol of the rebellion) to take down President Snow and capture back Peeta who is still being held as a prisoner in Disctrict 2. Katniss and Gayle have a team to exicute the rescue for Peeta. Once Peeta is retrieve he definitely is not the same loving Peeta and has been brainwashed, tortured, and mentally unstable. This is already saying too much of the story.      I do think that the writer got a little too political with the 3rd book, gruesome, really dark, too many things going on at the same time to all the characters. At the end, I felt the characters deserved a lot more. Really disappointed with the characters that did not survive.
B0057XSCJG|1.0|Where shall I start! No character development. No storyline. Pathetic script and absolutely no chemistry between leads. A waste of time in every way. No surprise it got 1 star from Critics. I should have trusted the experts. Save your money for something worthy. Its not really even a chick flick. It is just bad in EVERY way!
0439023491|4.0|Peeta and Katniss are paraded through the districts as victors of the Hunger Games; but, not after Katniss receives a visit from President Snow questioning whether the portrayed love story between her and Peeta was real or not as to why she pulled out those berries in the last hunger game leaving them with 2 victors instead of the 1. At this time, she was still figuring whether she really did love Peeta or her best friend Gayle. If the love story was not real between her and Peeta then she did an act that may cause a rebellion amongst the districts. After a year has past, because this was an anniversary year for the annual hunger games they held a quarter quell sending again tributes to enter the hunger games for more fights till the death. It was decided that 2 tributes that were the past VICTORS must enter the games again. In district 12 they did not have very many victors which ended up with Katniss and Peeta entering again. This time they formed alliances with the other districts and the secret goal was to keep Peeta alive no matter the cost. Once they entered the arena it was as action packed as the first one; however, the ending to this quarter quell has another surprise then it ends leaving you hanging. Make sure you have the next book ready in hand, your going to need it.<br /><br />Although, I must say after reading the whole series, kinda wish I stopped with this book.
B0040JHLFY|5.0|This pair of runners made an immediate impact on my jogging. I am about 6' 2\\", 210 lbs, flat-footed, and approaching 49. With those stats, proper runners are important. I had, and still do to some extent, knee problems, which brought my jogging routines to a halt for several long months. With my other runners, older, and less comfortable, my knees felt the impact, and I could get up to, maybe, 3 or 4 miles. After just about a month with these Brooks, I am up to 6.5 miles! These Brooks are also lightweight and comfortable: they look durable--time will tell. If you need a good pair of runners, where support for your joints--knees, ankles, hips--is important, then I can recommend these.  A thoroughly satisfied customer I am.    For me, life without jogging is \\"like Dracula without his fangs.\\" The Adrenaline Gts 11s gave me back my bite.  Thanks Brooks.
0618918248|1.0|I am not at all religious.  I think most religions (especially the Abrahamic faiths) are a cause of great discord in our world and need to be deconstructed.  Unfortunately this book is not going to help matters.  Dawkins relies purely on modern logic and evolution as his arguments. He seems to know very little about the actual history of religions and how they have morphed over time from the belief in mortal gods with abilities or technology superior to that of the masses, to the acceptance of an Omnipotent God that created the universe.  He also fails to offer any alternate hypotheses as to why anything exists at all.  Existence is a true paradox, without possible explanation in human terms.  It defies logic and violates our concepts of a time continuum.  God is one hypothesis to explain this that can not be either proven or disproven.  Normal scientific protocol breaks down as we approach this subject.  Evolution is simply a part of the universe, perhaps the most amazing part.  The problem is that the God of the Bible, clearly was not the creator of the universe, but very likely was based on real mortal characters in our past.  Simply calling God a delusion or fantasy is both unscientific, since no other hypothesis for existance is offered, and pigheaded, since he attacks the Bible without describing its history.  His quips and prose are very artful, but attacking believers of the Bible as simply being indoctrinated (brainwashed) or being fanciful by nature is a very polarizing tactic that does nothing to explain either the big question or religious scripture.
031603441X|5.0|I had the opportunity to download an audiobook, and not finding anything else that I wanted, decided to try this and forgo the print version. Amazing! Fans of the Rolling Stones or Keith Richards must definitely listen to the audiobook. It is very well done, like having Keith Richards in your living room (or your head) talking to you.  Keith's story parallels virtually the entire history of rock and roll, really, close to 60 years' worth. When he wasn't making historical music with the group and witnessing the evolution of rock and roll, he got to play with the greats, including Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, or to jam with their sidemen (the Crickets, Elvis's players). So read (or listen) to this book to get an eagle eye perspective on the history of rock and roll, from humble (and downright filthy) beginnings to the privileged and corporate life.    Strange though is that quite a cast of characters narrate the audio book. First Keith gives a brief introduction. Then he hands it over to his pal Johnny Depp, an apt choice, understandably, what with Johnny Depp's parody of Keith in the Pirates movies of late. The first chapter recounts in considerable detail Keith's arrest in Arkansas 1975 for reckless driving and goes to show that while the Law often wants to arrest the Rolling Stones and show off what good they are, the Law just as often cannot quite figure out what to do with the Rolling Stones once they catch 'em! An amazing lesson. Depp tosses off a quick Keith Richards imitation and then is masterful as he recreates the speech of a drunken Southern judge (Depp being also from the South is quite up to it). Then the next several chapters proceed chronologically from the Beginning. Depp's narration is crisp, articulate, and very engaging.    Then abruptly, about 1965, the voice changes. Who the hell is that? The narration is taken over by one Joe Hurley, about whom I cannot find out much from the Internet, but appears to be a New York City-based musician but with either Irish or English roots. Joe Hurley takes over with a swagger to his voice that is jarring after getting through so much with Johnny Depp. It seems like a put-on.   But then you listen further (you have no choice by this point, you are stuck with him), and you realize Joe Hurley is a wonderful actor! He does not merely \\"read\\" Keith Richards, he becomes Keith Richards! With a lower voice, but a smoky sound, a bit raspy, that sounds like he has genuinely lived the rock and roll life. It is infectious to hear his pauses for chuckles, sneers, affection, disgust that are most appropriate to the text at the moment. You are begging for more. Listen to him savor the expression \\"pure Merck cocaine\\" (which appears frequently in the book). Truly amazing. He becomes your friend and confidant.    And then suddenly, late in the book, it's back to Johnny Depp! What the...? Depp is nice, and very articulate, but he is no Joe Hurley. Yet, Depp has this way (when recounting Keith's dialogs) of sounding skeptical at the right moments--you do not want to get in his way!    Finally, the last chapter is narrated by Keith himself. He does a good job, a little slurred, but he has lived the life. Strangely, Joe Hurley sounds more like Keith's thoughts than Keith himself when reading his own words.    All in all, you won't be disappointed. It is a wild ride, and listening to the audiobook, you think you are right there alongside the man, watching some of the weirdest events in the history of rock and roll. (Incidentally, I am a Beatles fan--and they get their due in this book--but I did not want the story to end!) A little sad that his wife Patti Hansen's illness is not mentioned, maybe he could not bring himself to confront it.

B0039W1J0Q|4.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I did not really care for what I was hearing when I listened to this album. Let me start by saying that I have no problem with orchestras (I used to play cello in high school), I knew what I was getting into when I bought this CD; It would be Peter singing with an orchestra. However at first listen I couldn't help but maybe be a bit disappointed. As a specific example, he does a cover of Paul Simon's 'Boy in the Bubble'. I think awesome! That is a great song. However Peter's take on the song has none of the energy that the original has. You could apply this to many of the covers that he did on this CD. Overall I felt, while interesting, the execution here is sub par. Be it from the low energy of many of the songs or some of the bizarre arrangements like the cover of Street Spirit.    So rewind to about a week ago and a half ago, I saw Peter live with the New Blood Orchestra. At that moment, I think I finally got what Peter was trying to do here. This transformed a CD that I thought was ho-hum to probably one of his stronger releases. I again use 'Boy in the Bubble' as an example. He sang this song live at the concert. He prefaced the song by saying that \\"he took all of the Africa out of the song and turned it into just another song by a guy\\". When preformed, what you got was an intimate experience of Peter possibly at his rawest. Another song that was performed that I initially despised on the CD was 'My Body is a Cage', but after seeing it live I get it. Songs that are 5 stars to me on this CD are 'Mirrorball', 'Apres Moi', 'My Body is a Cage', and even 'Boy in the Bubble'.    While not everyone will have a chance to see Peter like I did, I hope that for those that don't \\"get it\\" now don't give up on it. I find that all of the covers here are very personal and are still reflective of Peter's artistry. It takes some guts to do arrangements that in some ways are so different than the source material. I might suggest playing on agood stereo or a good pair of headphones to soak it all in. The dynamics and musicianship of the orchestra or great. My only big complaint might be that on some songs that do use the full orchestra is that perhaps Peters voice is too far in front of the mix.    On a note not related to this CD: I look forward to Peter's upcoming CD with the New Blood Orchestra, where I get the impression it will songs of his that have been arranged with the orchestra. For example during the concert, he played 'The Rhythm of the Heat'. I was blown away by his ending of this version, which ends with an African drum outtro on the studio version. The live performance of this ended with the orchestra playing a high energy segment of music that reminded me a bit of the last movements of 'The Rite of Spring'. It was superb. I would search for a video of it on you tube.

0671027573|1.0|I had the audio version.  It was for my drive to work.  It is sad to have authors result to promoting foul language as common forms of communication to be expected in the dialog.  For the sex parts I found myself fast forwarding them to get back to the main story.  It seems to be typical Hollywood fashion to put trash in the storyline to get it to be sold.  Too bad more effort wasn't put to the actual building of characters and the plot.  I will stick to the authors who have a larger and better vocabulary and leave the dime store romance novels to those who's diction is limited to words with 2-3 syllables and less than four (or seven if you count adding an 'ing') letters.

0525951652|3.0|Let me begin by saying, I love Ken Follett. I have read every one of his books, with only one or two exceptions (Paper Money is still on my list). So I eagerly anticipated this book, another sure-to-be gripping, epic, historical thriller that  immerses the reader in fascinating details from another place and time. There's really nothing better than being swept away on a historical adventure with Ken Follett.     Unfortunately, this book is just not enough like Follett's many riveting page-turners and reads much more like a dry, overly detailed book report on WWI. There are many, many scenes in which groups of people sit around in their parlor and discuss in intricate and confusing detail the politics of their day. Whether or not these descriptions are historically accurate, I couldn't say, but I can tell you that reading about them isn't going to keep you up until 3 am, turning those pages.     I love history, but it was tough slogging through hundreds of pages about the various political factions and the many countries involved in WWI. And sadly, I'm still confused! I think a quick refresher on WWI would have been helpful for me before reading this book. If, like me, the only thing you really remember about WWI from school is that some Austrian guy named Franz Ferdinand was assassinated, then this may be a tough and slow read for you.     All that being said, I still love Ken Follett. He has written far too many novels that entertained me too greatly for me to give up on him now. If you haven't already, read his early WWII novels, such as 'Eye of the Needle' and 'The Key to Rebecca.' I promise you'll be entertained, turn pages all night, AND history will come alive for you!

116932701X|5.0|Lady Chatterley's Lover surprised me.  Having read two of Lawrence's other works (The Rainbow and Sons and Lovers), I felt with reasonable confidence prepared for LCL.  The Rainbow was beautiful, but plotless to a fault--pages of poetic description broken up intermittently by snatches of dialogue--and I often felt that the book was a slog.  Part of this was due to the vibrancy of its characters--I simply wanted more of them than I got.<br /><br /> Sons and Lovers, on the other hand, was the opposite.  The book was a straightforward novel, and lacked much of The Rainbow's poetry.  There was plenty of character development, but most of the characters were either unlikeable or boring.  Both of these novels, however, were family stories--they began with a parent protagonist, who was slowly and ineluctably overtaken and replaced by a child protagonist.  Ursula Brangwen was intelligent, attractive, and full of fight; Paul Morel was self-absorbed, whiny, and weak.<br /><br /> LCL avoids the model of family story, however, and the result is a tighter book without the sprawl of a bildungsroman.  The story focuses on the most important event in Constance Chatterley's life: her illicit affair with her husband's gamekeeper, Mellors, and the resulting fallout.  Lawrence originally wanted to call the book \\"Tenderness,\\" and it would have worked well; hopefully without spoiling too much, Lawrence feels that there is a special \\"something\\" his characters have, a tenderness, that allows them to fully appreciate the sensuality of the human body, without being subsumed by the mechanical Mammon of industrialized England.<br /><br /> LCL's sex scenes are not as racy as they were in the late twenties, but they are real.  Bad sex scenes abound in novels, and apparently a good one is very difficult to write; too often the reader gets something ridiculous rather than sexy.  Lawrence does it well, however, and many authors could learn a thing or two from him.  What I particularly enjoyed was how the scenes between Connie and Mellors mixed high and low rhetoric--while the characters use four-letter words to describe their experiences, the reader gets the rolling of the primordial ocean, and a feeling of esoteric initiation.  Sex here is equal parts spiritual and sensual, with the truly sexualized body being a state few people are able to reach.<br /><br /> Concerning his treatment of women, Lawrence does indeed hold Constance up as an ideal for other women to aspire to, and she's an ideal many progressive women might take offense at.  However, I think the only way one can get furious with Lawrence for this is if one expects Lawrence to do something different.  I am often guilty of faulting a book for not meeting my expectations, but Lawrence's vision is strong, and I trust the life within his characters.  His ideological standpoint does not offend me--as Tolstoy's eccentric standpoint in The Kreutzer Sonata does not offend me--and I am actually thrilled that Lawrence has something to say, no matter how many contemporary and progressive people he's pissed off in the process.  If Lawrence thinks all of Europe is effete, that it's OK to call a woman the C-word, and that simultaneous orgasm is the height of sexual excitement and bliss, then I'm fine with that.  D.H. Lawrence is not where I draw the line, and his book was quite excellent.nnie and Mellors mixed high and low rhetoric--while the characters use four-letter words to describe their experiences, the reader gets the rolling of the primordial ocean, and a feeling of esoteric initiation.

B004EC5IUW|1.0|I have to talk about the sound of this particular version produced by Funimation.  This is the very first time I noticed such atrocious sound recording in my dvd and blu-ray purchasing history.   Yes, it is 6.1 True HD, as it showed on the screen of my 7.1 ch amplifier.  BUT  The Japanese dub comes ONLY FROM THE LEFT SPEAKER, while  the English dub comes ONLY FROM THE RIGHT SPEAKER.  It really feels sick that you hear all the conversations only from one of your sides....  Otherwise, probably thanks to the original Japanese blu-ray production, the sound effect, music and all other sound components are just perfect.  I imagine that Funimation is responsible for this most horrible possibly imaginable decision of monaural dubbing.  I have not personally checked the Amazon.co.jp version, but it must be that the dubbing is stereo.  I strongly recommend you NOT to purchase THIS PARTICULAR VERSION produced by Funimation. They should not look down upon the customers!

B003ERQWEY|5.0|15-year old Mia lives with her single Mom and foul-mouthed little sister in some seamy housing project in the UK.  Alienated from most aspects of life, she knocks heads with girls her own age.  She has a tempestuous relationship with her Mom.  She has no boyfriend.  School is not going well.  Her sole outlet and solace is dancing.  She uses a vacant tenement to practice her hip-hop dance moves and routines with her iPod blaring.  Life is bleak.      Life starts to change when her Mom takes a lover, the charming Irish Connor.  Connor befriends Mia, compliments her, shows kindness and encourages her to pursue her dancing dream.  Mia spots a local ad seeking \\"adult female dancers\\" and sends in a home-made audition film.  Her relationship with her mother's boyfriend takes a sharp turn, setting in motion a surprising sequence of events.    Eventually, Mia packs her bags and decides to move out.  On her way out of the flat, she spots her mother dancing, undulating to Nas and \\"Life's a Bitch.\\"  Her mother barely registers the fact that Mia is moving out.    Mia starts dancing with her mother.  The little sister joins in, dancing in time with the others.  The pet pit-bull Tennant lies on the floor, rapt in attention, looking puzzled.  Great scene!    This story kept my attention for a full two hours.  It is gritty and powerful.  In the final scene, a heart-shaped nylon helium balloon floats ascends high above the grimy public housing project as Mia and her new boyfriend motor off to Cardiff.      FISH TANK blew me away.  Maybe the best film I've seen in 2011.    Tip:  Watch it with subtitles on; the Brit accents are so thick it may be otherwise hard to understand the dialogue.

It seemed to me that Simon included a lot of quotes from previous albums and that brought some smiles and a digging out of the old disks. It also made me want to get in the car and take off on an extended road trip.<br /><br />All the tracks in \\"So Beautiful...\\" are entertaining, engrossing even, but I especially liked \\"Getting Ready for Christmas Day\\", \\"Dazzling Blue\\" and \\"Rewrite\\".  Any listener will find something of a particular meaning here--can't imagine it being otherwise.  Thank you Paul Simon and please keep on truckin'..
B004LWZW42|4.0|The super hero genre in movies has been loading up with adaptations from DC and Marvel Comics primarily from the glorious Silver Age of Comics.  In most cases, these incarnations have taken on a stunning visual realism with state of the art technology and pyrotechnics, but what separates the cream of the crop like Spiderman 2 and The Dark Knight from the rest is great acting and a superior script.  Having scored less than impressive results with X Men: Wolverine and Last Stand, the reboot of the franchise, X Men: First Class, is a prequel that reinvigorates with a fresh cast, elaborate script (Ashley Miller and Jack Stentz) and solid direction by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass) who has proven himself in this genre.      During World War II, a young boy, Erik, is separated from his parents by ruthless Nazis and tormented by a sadistic doctor, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who forces Erik to unleash his power of magnetism over metal. Meanwhile in a mansion in New York, a young, telepathic Charles Xavier befriends a fellow mutant named Raven who can morph into any person.  Years later in 1962, an adult Erik (Michael Fassbinder) searches the world for Sebastian to exact revenge even as Charles is thriving at Oxford University.  In Las Vegas, CIA agent Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) infiltrates a strip club and spies Sebastian Shaw planning to engineer a Cold War conflict with the Russians.  Sebastian is aided by a roster of evil mutants including Emma Frost (January Jones).  Moira and the CIA seek the help of Xavier who realizes that there are other mutants in the world, and he must seek them out.  As Erik closes on Sebastian, he comes in contact with Charles, now realizing he, too is not alone as a mutant, and joins forces with Charles' growing roster of young mutants including an increasingly restless Raven AKA Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence).  Each discovered mutant has a distinctive power and a unique name or moniker (Charles becomes Professor X and Erik is Magneto). After a deadly attack by Sebastian and his mutants at a CIA compound, Charles and an ever vengeful Erik set about to train their raw recruits to face Sebastian as he steers the Russians on a collision course with the Americans in Cuba.  With a global war imminent, Sebastian reveals a deeper, more insidious plan that could mean the end of humanity.  The action filled climax is a visual feast that has a stunning display of military might versus the mutant super powers and sets the stage for betrayal and realigning allegiances.      This is a handsomely mounted production, with visual effects that serve the story and its super mutants in ways that could not be convincingly rendered a generation before.  When a young Erik displays destructive power in front of his Nazi captors, it harkens back to Drew Barrymore's burning apocalypse in Firestarter.  Lending realism to otherwise unworldly characters, the dialogue frequently switches to German, Russian, French and Spanish as the setting dictates, and the fashion styles and news footage lend an air of period authenticity, although trying to integrate events like the Cuban Missile Crisis requires some suspension of disbelief.    The film succeeds in portraying the mutants as a metaphor for racial discrimination and being treated as commodities by each respective side of the impending war.  There are moral dilemmas as these kids express feelings and doubts including the question of whether they should accept being different or conform to the human race.  Witness the interesting parallels with the Nazi genocide of World War II, and how Erik ironically assumes some of the corrupt evil from Sebastian, the very individual he hates.      This is a very attractive, talented group of actors led by McAvoy (Atonement), sounding like a grown up Harry Potter with a commanding presence and a deliciously charming Fassbender (quite effective in Inglourious Basterds) who is destined to conquer heroic or villainous roles for years to come.   Bacon isfeatured prominently and has a field day hamming it up as the scheming Sebastian who is clearly modeled after Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.  The scenes as Charles and Erik search for mutants are quite fun, and there are a couple of clever cameos.      The film has echoes of traditional James Bond films with its iconic evil characters bent on world domination.  That's not a bad thing.  Whether the box office will garner a direct sequel remains to be seen.    Perhaps the one thing lacking is that it does not engage the audience the way films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Spiderman did.  The same sort of thing plagued the original Lara Croft: Tomb Raider film, only more so.  What comic book enthusiasts will savor is a fairly entertaining recreation of what we know as the X Men, and while things don't perfectly mesh with the original X Men canon, this is a slick, intelligent attempt to rejuvenate a franchise much as J. J. Abrams' Star Trek relaunched that series.
1440503257|3.0|I have been a huge Harry Potter fan since discovering the books over 10 years ago and have been cooking on my own for about the same amount of time.  I truly enjoyed reading through this cookbook for all the HP references and English history surrounding the food, but after attempting several recipes have found that they fall short.  For example, the meat pie filling was overcooked after simmering for 2 hours and the apple crumble pie filling was way too dry after having cooking off all the liquid per the recipe.  Also, Molly's Meatballs were so full of onion and liquid that they fell apart and the companion onion sauce was way over the top with onion. I wish there were photos to accompany some of these different dishes, because I think most American cooks aren't familiar with how they are supposed to look or taste.  I also felt that the organization of the book by where Harry eats them or who made them doesn't make it user friendly and is unnecessary since the story accompanying the food appears before the recipe.  I just wish it was organized by courses so I'm not going back and forth to the glossary all the time.  Most of the food preparation is already very time consuming (especially without a wand in hand).  For now, I'm truly enjoying getting to explore Harry Potter's English cuisine, but will be doing my own independent research before attempting any further recipes from this book.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|How in the world anyone could compare this movie to The Matrix, Kill Bill, Inception, or anything resembling a decent movie is absurd. Do movie viewers just have no standards at all? I always watch movies and accept them for what they are, but this... This was epic trash from the depths of pure waste. Even for what it is (and it will never be what it set out to be), it's a worst case scenario train wreck disaster.<br /><br />Visually, some of if it was pretty eye candy, but THAT doesn't make it a decent movie. It's as if the director thinks throwing a cute blonde girl into action scenes that are ripped out of comic books and video games makes a movie.<br /><br />The story is bland and hardly worth caring about, and scenes are broken up into 2 (actually 3) different realities for the main character. One is reality, the other a delusion, the other a sub delusion (or more like filler to take away attention from what's going on in the delusion). Sorry, but this doesn't give anyone fair reason to compare it to The Matrix or Inception, which had stories to back the concepts. The delusional mind of a mental patient in this case is hardly worth being called a story.<br /><br />I had wanted to see it in the theaters, but reviews all over the place kept me from going to see it. Infact, just now remembering that a review from Gawker kept me home. Now I'm out $6 and 90 minutes of my life I can't get back.<br /><br />To like this movie, I would imagine you'd have to be a very shelted 10yr old boy who is easily impressed by mediocre special effects, and a plot that's so boring that an ameoba would fall asleep.<br /><br />In the business world, people who fail miserably are often required to step down because they are an embarrassment... Everyone involved in the making of this movie should be doing just that.

B000784WMW|5.0|I never got to see this when it was on oldtime PBS.  My husband and I watched all of the episodes over the period of a week, and we loved it!  We'll probably watch it again.  The sound and picture quality is better than some of the other older classics I have collected in recent years.  I have the older Jane Austen boxed collection and I can hardly hear the dialog in about half of the DVDS.  I like these actors interpretation of the classic characters.  Rochester is funnier than most other versions, almost goofy at times.  And Jane is at least as passionate as other Janes I have seen, and she much angrier at times than any I have seen.  This is somewhat refreshing.  I enjoyed this and I recommend it for others who like older PBS fare.  It's somewhat less polished and high tech compared to things made today, but it is still very good.  I particularly like it because it tells a long story and that's not common today when they remake classics.
B00008G6EZ|5.0|I really enjoyed this production. There was the unmistakable scent of commedia dell'arte in the performances of Gilfy,Bartoli, Polgar and Widmer, balanced by the 'serious' characters of Donna Anna and Don Ottavio, played by Isabel Rey and Roberto Sacca repespctively. Liliana Nikiteanu played an excellent Zerlina suitably taken in by Giovanni's blandishments. Bartoli's Elvira was magnificently melodramatic and avenging, but come to her interpretation 'Mi Tradi' she was heartbreaking.   I found myself laughing out loud at the facial expressions and interchanges between Giovanni and Leporello. having admired Rodney Gilfrey's Guillelmo and Count Almaviva I was interested to see how his Giovanni fared. I was not disappointed. He was charming, amusing and arrogant by turns and his horror, after his antics at dinner with the 'mini' statue, in the penultimate scene was real.  Matti Salminen was magnificent as the Commendatore.  I was blown away by the beauty of Laszlo Polgar's voice. I have him on the Harnoncourt CD with the Concertgebouwe Orchestra but enjoyed this more.  The anacronistic touches in the costumes ( Leporello's beanie and Zerlina's cardy)is a reminder that in Mozart's day sets and costumes would have been full of anacronisms - and what ever was Leporello packing into his bag at the beginnning of Act 2?  'Don Giovanni' is the only work which disrupts my sleep - this production is no exception.

0140503846|5.0|I bought \\"Peepo\\" after hearing my sister reading it to her daughter (at that time, 2 years old) and her daughter who would join in as my sister read it.      I recently had a baby and I wanted some quality children's books that I could read to her.  \\"Peepo\\" is one of the best ones I have.  I began reading it to my baby when she was about 2 months old - I lay her down and lay down next to her, hold the book up so she can see the pictures and read out loud.      She lays there mesmorised by the pictures and the way the book flows (kind of like a song, with a 'chorus'), it completely calms her.  The story is pretty cool, not like a lot of ridiculous nonsense kids books that you find nowadays.     I love this book and will be reading it to my daughter for years to come (and hopefully any other kids we have!)
B000F8O35U|3.0|Now truthfully, I bought this movie for my sister, which is why it lacks the last star. But I love Ariel's beautiful body, Scuttle's stupidity, Sebastian's crankiness, and the good use of conflicts. I like the ocean theme, and I also like how Ursula is a luring villain, similar to Kaa. And let's not forget the CGI (computer generated imagery) effects like on the ships and storms. The Little Mermaid inherited those computer effects from \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\", my personal favorite classic.<br /><br />However, I will be honest, even though I am respecting and somewhat enjoying this film, it didn't really have a great impact on me, the same way it impacted the people when it came out. I thought it was too much of a girl's movie and that I was \\"forbidden\\" to watch it. I did catch a glimpse of a few shots, but most of them scared me, especially King Triton destroying the grotto, that was the scene that scared me the most! And another thing, after looking at IGN's top 25 animated movie list, I don't really like remembering how it \\"saved\\" the studio anymore. It just makes me feel guilty for liking some of the 1970's/80's films, specifically Aristocats, Robin Hood, The Rescuers, and my favorite The Great Mouse Detective. I  researched them, and they did not do terribly, they were just moderate successes as opposed to \\"grand slams\\"( except Black Cauldron which I know really WAS a failure). Besides, if it were not for \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\", there wouldn't BE \\" Little Mermaid\\"!<br /><br />I know, I know I am sorry, but I just did not like it very well growing up. I fairly enjoy it more nowadays, but the whole fairy tale princess thing just held me back for far too long.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I would self-identify myself as a hardcore gamer and after reading many reviews I decided to buy this controller. I really dislike the joystick layout of the PS3 controller so i was hoping this would replicate the 360 controller's feel.<br /><br />While it feels well built and is cheap it does have a major flaw.<br /><br />The complaints of dead zones are true unfortunately. Its weird to see people disagreeing on such a simple and easy thing to identify. Its true, not only do the analogue sticks have big deadzones but so do the triggers. This makes the controller pretty difficult to use for competitive play. If you play COD or racing games a lot and like to win, dont buy this controller. you lose far to much sensitivity because the deadzone is quite large, id say around 20 degrees. The triggers are bad too, and i have to consciously remind myself to push down more on them and its casued problems with even the simplest games.<br /><br />Just to quickly go over the other features:<br /><br />The grip is fine, it feels good and only hurts if you squeeze the controller very tightly. The rumble is a bit strong for my taste. The six-axis controls work just as good as sony brand controllers. The glowing buttons are nice but hardly worth the flaws, and they are hardly necessary. The charging/receiver dongle is quite spiffy and includes a nice length mini-usb cable. The analogue sticks have a really unique coating, they have more grip to them than any other controller ive used, they almost feel like glue.<br /><br />Overall its very disappointing they controls are so insensitive because otherwise this would be a great controller. Ill keep it just to have a second one so people can play split screen. Would not recommend this as a primary/daily controller.
0393327345|5.0|Fight Club is a very provocative book.     It's a whirlwind of violence, sex, rebellion  -- a story about identity (or possibly lack thereof -- ask Tyler Durden), that takes us behind the scenes of an underworld of fragmented outcasts -- rejects of society -- who look for salvation from their artificial existence through the experience of pain.    All this would make Fight Club a great novel already. . . But in my opinion, the book is a real tour-de-force because at the same time, it's also a powerful critic of our society's obsession with consumption. Beyond the thrill-ride, there's the real question: what's the world we live in about? Is it even real-life anymore?    Interestingly enough, I recently bumped into an 80's cult classic called The King of Clubs [[ASIN:0615437710 The King Of Clubs]] that have the same basic premise -- except this time -- the action takes place with the super-wealthy (making it yuckier!).    In both cases, the expression of violence hides a deeper problem -- our disconnection from natural life.    I was left puzzled after reading Fight Club; wondering what ideal society the characters are trying to create: a Burning man utopia? A UFC championship wonderland?     I secretly wished the characters could bring us better answers.

I also love that it is so simple that kids can go on to make their own - in fact, the publisher's website has a free highly abridged version of the book that you can print out and put together!<br /><br />I've already purchased three copies of this book - it's on my birthday present gift for friends list, and so far it's been a big hit every time!<br /><br />I would love to see this book published as an unabridged board book, to make it even more durable (the current edition does have a solid cardboard cover, which helps), and accessible to the youngest readers.

B0044FEZBM|5.0|As my previous colleagues have gone into some depth with their respective reviews, I will keep this short & sweet.  A wonderful concept for a Ballet to start with and brilliantly danced. The staging was brilliant & scene changes were smooth & effortless.  The music was a little too repetitive I felt, I could hear the same themes returning many times through the piece. But in hole a good score.  The dancing & choreography  were out of this world not to mention the soloists.  Natalia Osipova & Ivan Vasiliev were brilliant in their respective solos & pas de deux's. Vasiliev just tore up the floor with his athleticism & the height of his elevations. I have to agree that the second half dropped a little pace & I felt that the story-line wandered a little, which probably didn't help. But! Overall a brilliant ballet danced to perfection.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Watched the movie I dont know how many times. Keeps getting better with each view. If you like horror and you like good acting. Buy this film. They dont make them like this anymore. This film has kept me out of the water for years. Very Scary film.

0756404738|2.0|I just read through a whole bunch of reviews that gave the book 1 star. I think that's a little harsh. It wasn't awful. I wasn't really angry when I read it, and it didn't really feel that I was wasting my time (maybe I just didn't have anything else to do).    However, I do agree with these 1 star reviewers in all their points: the book was ultimately quite boring. There was no real plot to speak of, and what little there was in terms of actions could have been copy-and-pasted from tedious episodes of the also-much-too-long Robert Jordan series. In fact, following this argument a little: there are a lot of parallels between the second Patrick Rothfuss book and the Wheel of Time series, and that becomes most obvious when Kvothe gets trained by female super-warriors who are oh so much better than their male counterparts. What is it with male fantasy writers and their weird relationship towards sex? Why do men always have to be belittled by women in fighting, only to have one boring sex adventure after another? Was it really necessary for Kvothe to get a year-long education in how to become the world's best lover? That doesn't smell of Robert Jordan, that stinks of Raymond E. Feist, who is the equivalent of \\"Two and a Half Men\\" in the Fantasy world.    Unfortunately, while Patrick Rothfuss has tried to bring us closer to the main character by giving him more detailed back stories, what he actually has achieved is that a formerly really interesting and intriguing character is now just your standard usual \\"I can fight better than others, and my sex is better than others'\\" kind of fantasy hero. I have to say, I wouldn't have cared if he had died at the end of the book, he is quite inconsequential now. And his extremely boring love interest doesn't add anything to the story, apart from even more pages of tedium.    I'll probably buy the third book, hoping that Rothfuss finds back to his old form, but if that one is as much a dud as this one was, that will have been my last book of his. Quite disappointing, and not worth the read (unless you do enjoy extremely predictable fantasy books).
B0058S0OMS|5.0|Probably the best sequel ever made. The movie continues right where Halloween left off. Been waiting years for this blu-ray to come out!! Hopefully the hd transfer is as good as the first Halloween.

It doesn't take long for the action to start and the bodies to pile up - recommended. S.Rosser - Author TIPPING POINT thriller.
1400079144|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  The storyline was mostly predictable, but there were a few surprises.  It had enough suspense to keep me wanting more.  My biggest complaint is the ending.  It really should have ended a couple chapters earlier, if it had I probably would give it another star.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this version! And you will too if you want a true to the novel adaptation. The nuances and details that would be lost in a shorter version add strength to this one, so that, even at over four and one-half hours, Pride and Prejudice rarely loses momentum.    The main plot thread traces the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), the second of five sisters, and a wealthy young gentleman named Darcy (Colin Firth). The two are not immediately attracted to each other -- a fair share of pride and prejudice separates them ) -- but, as the story progresses...WELL WATCH THE MOVIE!    Of course, Pride and Prejudice unfolds more than just Lizzie and Darcy's tale. There's a parallel love story between Lizzie's older sister, Jane (Susannah Harker), and the charming Mr. Bingley (Crispin Bonham-Carter). We also follow the thwarted marital plans of an odious, simpering cleric by the name of Collins (David Bamber), and learn dark secrets about the character of the seemingly open and generous Wickham (Adrian Lukis).    As the critics say, \\" Austen's wry, incisive humor is much in evidence. In fact, it is this quality, along with deft characterization, that prevents the movie from descending into the realm of a nicely-costumed, brilliantly-photographed melodrama. The acting is uniformly flawless. One of the most difficult aspects of adapting a classic novel is imparting the thoughts and feelings of characters to the audience without resorting to intrusive internal monologues. Ehle's expressive face and carefully-controlled body language make this a surprisingly easy task.\\"
B00197POXG|1.0|My husband and I are avid series watches but have never received anything like the shocking quality of this set of dvd's, Quality Control is non existant. 80% could not  be viewed in any way.

B000002GWN|5.0|If you like Joni to begin with, you certainly will not be disappointed in this. The songs are well performed, and most of the recording and reproduction is well done. There are arguably a few points where overall level could have been adjusted up a bit, but it would be quibbling to make much of it. Joni also speaks briefly a time or two, aside from singing, and makes a good point. Plus, there is one of the classic shout-outs of all time, from an audience member: \\"Joni, you have more class than Gomer Pyle and Richard Nixon combined!\\"

B004UJAOLM|4.0|The first thing a lot of people who have read this are probably going to ask is \\"Why not 5 stars?\\", and indeed, one may be subjected to stoning for giving only 4 stars to such a well respected piece of classic literature. However, I have my reasons: for one, the book becomes a bit difficult to follow at times- when you have Cathy Linton Earnshaw, and Cathy Earnshaw Linton, and the one who is dead won't stay dead, that gets a bit confusing to begin with. There are a couple of other similar instances when the reader may have to turn back to see just which character is involved in a given encounter. Also, it seems to never be very well established just how Heathcliff went from having nothing upon his departure, to being wealthy upon his return. Perhaps not necessary for that to be fully explained, but at least some explanation would be welcome. Emily Bronte does one thing exceptionally well, which is painting a picture of Yorkshire and The Moors with words. Maybe people who are better readers than I will enjoy this more. I did enjoy it, by all means, thus the four stars, but I was not as enthralled with it as many others have been.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|I am more than disappointed about this one! I cannot find anything good to say about the music. I can only say that the photography inside is fabulous. A big fan up to now, I regret buying this sorry excuse for an album from and by such a great singer.
B0057XSCJG|5.0|Okay, so some could give this a bit of a poor review, but it is a modern spin on an old tale.  It is predictable, true.  However, it is quite lovely.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|An admirable attempt to accurately portray the environment of The 30 Years War.  Like every movie of its type it has the formulaic additions that work on today's audience but all in all this is a good one.
B000JCEVK4|5.0|On paper, this album should never work. Take several parts Jazz / Swing, mix with gypsy music, pepper with metal riffs, and serve with a heaping helping of operatic vocals. It's a dish that would make anyone cringe, but it all works, and works beautifully. It's no wonder this album has stayed in the lead over on the Creative Commons-licensed music site Jamendo, and will continue to amaze the curious folks who wonder what all of the fuss is about.    Fans of slightly off-beat music will absolutely love this. Give it a few listens, and you'll understand why this album is destined to become a classic. Highly recommended.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebouf) now working as a mail deliverer in an office building, but he thinks he deserves better since he saved the world 2 times \\"yet, he leaves out that his giant robot friends helped...or did most the work\\".  Sam has also replaced the other hot girl who was just there for eye candy, with Carly Miller (Rosie Huntington) who's also just here for eye candy.<br />  While the Decepticons are back and Dylan (Patrick Dempsey), a rich playboy is working for them and wants to use Sam to get information from the Autobots. The Decepticons also want to bring there planet to Earth and wipe out mankind, yet Dylan thinks he'll be spared of course. You also have Optimus Prime having to go up against his former mentor, Sentinal Prime who's helping the Decepticons.<br />  Transformers: Dark of the Moon is about as loud as part 2 with non-stop action that involves Transformers clunking together and ripping each other apart , but it's more fun with a better story \\"what there is of one.\\" While there's some nice visuals, like when the soldiers are gliding through the air through the city on hang-gliders. When Witwicky and friends are hanging from a falling building is also a pretty well done disaster sequence.<br />  However, Michael Bay needs to stop thinking that he's making Gone with the Wind, when he's just making a Transformer movie, lol. What I mean, is that these films are too long and there's not enough story for them to be so long and then just give us a similar ending with Optimus Prime giving another corny speech. Megatron is also wasted as the villain yet again and always seems to just be there, so he can eventually be ripped apart by Optimus, yet again. If Michael Bay doesn't come back for part 4 and is replaced by someone more talented, I won't shed a tear.

With 4 children, it's extremely difficult to find a movie that the entire family can enjoy.  We just watched Cars2 at the movie theater.  My 2 year old never moved throughout the movie and my 16 year old son laughed the entire time.  It was a great!  Everyone knows that Mater made the original movie so funny, that's why he is the main character in part 2.  He does not let you down!  My husband, all 4 children and myself all agree that this beats the original movie.  Way to go Pixar!

B002VR9QXW|5.0|This is probably the Xth Giselle that I have watched on the screen for years....<br /><br />This is also one of the most satisfying Giselles that I have ever watched, and not for the reasons that are usually attributed to a 5 star performance....<br /><br />Tsygankova? No.. not anywhere as convincing as Cojocaru, not because of her dancing, but her attitude towards Giselle. She has to take a leaf out of Cojocaru insofar as acting is concerned, although her technique and dancing seem absolutely flawless... Tsygankova seems to be more in the Zakharova mold, which requires shedding of a few pounds of ego.<br />The Mad scene is nowhere as good as Cojocaru's in the ROH production.<br /><br />But Myrta? Jongh can give the best of the best a run for the money. She is one of the best ever Myrthas that I have seen, Marianella Nunez notwithstanding.<br />Yes, as some critics have pointed out that the second act seems devoid of overt emotions as Nunez is so successful in bringing out, but Jongh comes through without having to exert herself in observable expressions to bring out the cold blooded intents.<br /><br />The conductor has done a great job with the music, and the recording, unlike in the ROH version, is far far better. The choreographers have worked overtime to present some dances different from the other productions, without losing any artistic stuff. Thank them for it. The corps de ballet seems to be extremely well utilized, and dance beautifully, without being mechanical in the first act dances. They seem to be having fun as peasants, without inhibitions and dance thus.....<br /><br />NOTE:- If one has a complete version of the Giselle on a CD audio, one will immediately notice that this version has many more beautiful numbers committed to dance, that almost ALL other productions of it neglect, especially in the Act 1 in the pas de quatre and towards the end. The treatment of music is very beautiful, elaborate bordering on the ornate..... rare, I would say....<br /><br />All in all, a perfect companion to the ROH production, which ironically, I have given one star less than this, for very different reasons. But this is far better than the Paris Opera production, according to me....<br /><br />BUY IT...H production, which ironically, I have given one star less than this, for very different reasons. But this is far better than the Paris Opera production, according to me....     BUY IT...
0061997811|5.0|This book contains secrets for filming the movies including wardrobe choices, scenery, models used, filming techniques, and a look at characters.<br /><br />My Thoughts: I really loved the in-depth look into the Potter world. It made me want to go back and have a movie marathon. I didn't like the fact that there was nothing about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2. I can see not having in the book for spoiler reasons, but then I wish they had waited to release the book when the last movie appeared because it feels so unfinished without it.<br /><br />The book set-up feels similar to that the DK style - with lots of pictures and a page or two of information on each subjects. I loved all the photographs, sketches, and drawing made by the crew. It's a fascinating read - just perfect for fans of the Harry Potter movies.

B004GYOQ6A|5.0|Works in gTablet. The axes were reversed but the settings menu let me reverse each axis, separately if I needed to. The graphics adjust while you are playing to show the angle; they seem a bit jumpy, but you can turn them off in the settings too (show board movement). Also includes sensitivity levels which I didn't touch. There's even a 2D option which I didn't try or need. Nice implementation with enough options to make it work for different devices with various default settings.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|What can I really say?  Being that it is popular to hate on Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, giving a positive review almost sets me up for accusations of my \\"inferior intelligence\\" and that I am \\"easily entertained.\\"  Well, I'll tell you this much, I am neither, and yet I found Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be an incredibly entertaining experience and leaving the theater I had no idea people would be treating like one of THOSE movies; one of the ones people just love to rant and rave about without end.  This film is light years ahead of the first two Star Wars prequels and easily better than those dreadful Transformers movies that have been making so much money lately.<br /><br />Okay, to start off this movie is clearly the lesser of the Indy films, but I feel lots of people have been overly harsh on this movie for not living up to its older siblings.  The greatest action-adventure film trilogy of all time is one hard act to follow, and so Spielberg and Lucas clearly wanted to try something different.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what many audiences hated most about this Indy: too different from the originals.  It is flawed, but I never felt this movie came from greed.  It was the nostalgia, and recollections of two friends, who only wished to recreate the entertainment of their youth, and that fun factor was present throughout Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, in the end I do think the good aspects of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull easily outweigh the bad.<br /><br />For starters, Indiana Jones as played by Harrison Ford...do I really need to say anything else?  This is the best action hero to ever grace the silver screen and no one will ever crack a bullwhip the same.  I really don't think I should have to defend this character, or explain what makes him great.  Welcome back Mister Jones.  In an age of giant robots dominating the box office I welcome your return with open arms.<br /><br />Also back all the way from Raiders of the Lost Ark is Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, who is sorely underused in the film's plot.  I'm fine with bringing back one of Indy's previous love interests, but she really doesn't contribute much to the plot.  She drives some cars during the jungle chase scene and aside from that is nothing but an extra face in the cast.  If they were going to bring back Indy's original love interest they should have given her more to do.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett's Irina Spalko is, in my humble opinion, the best antagonist in an Indy film since Major Arnold Toht (the Nazi in the all-black get-up in Raiders, for those of you who don't know his name).  Here is a female villain whose tone is cool, precise, yet can slip into vicious blood lust when the situation becomes violent, and Blanchett nails it.  This is a huge step up from the femme fatale of Last Crusade, and I appreciate how Blanchett's gender is not overly sexualized for the benefit of enticing male audiences.  She wears a crisp uniform that doesn't highlight her sex, and is quick to draw a rapier when she needs her captives to comply.  Never does she flirt with Indy, nor does she waste much time in classic villain mistakes such as rambling about her plans.  This is a serious female character that is treated seriously by the script, and Spielberg's direction, which cannot be said for 95% of Hollywood's attempts at female villains.  I think this character is one of the most sorely overlooked aspects of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />And this brings me to a character many have criticized the film for...Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams, a 1950s greaser who drives a motorcycle, wears a leather jacket, talks smack, and is quick to draw a switchblade.  Now, let me get this straight:  I hate, and I do mean HATE most of the work of Shia LaBeouf.  He has had roles where I've liked him (Holes) but for the most part he's one of the most annoying male actors I've ever seen.  Almost every role he's ever had he spendspanicking, overacting, and stammering like a madman and it is enough to make the ears bleed!  The Transformers movies alone almost made me want to smack the annoying twerp upside the head with a mallet, if only to momentarily shut him up...luckily for Shia, and to the surprise of those who may be reading this: I actually liked his performance in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  In fact, I honestly forgot at times he was the actor playing Mutt.  It's a nice performance, that really did combine honest character acting with a bit of camp that poked fun of 1950s teenage culture, and I really do think he gave perhaps the best performance of his career thus far (not saying too much, but hey: when Transformers is the alternative, this is a huge improvement).<br /><br />No, instead of Shia, the most annoying character in the film is Mac (Ray Winstone), Indy's traitorous former colleague.  Above all the nitpicks such as the refrigerator, and CGI, that so many fans complain about, this is the one aspect of the movie that annoys me above all other errors.  Winstone plays the part well enough, but the scripting is horrible.  He betrays Indy multiple times in the movie, and yet Indy trusts him whenever he comes up with some weak story to explain how he's been on Indy's side the whole time...only to betray him again five minutes later.  Once or twice I might have let this slide, but by the third time it made me want to scream \\"COME ON, INDIANA!\\"  Indy in the old films would have never made this mistake three times.<br /><br />I think the film has some really great action, and set pieces, but there are some moments that really make it clear why so many people hate this film.  CGI gophers, a dreadful vine swinging sequence (I get it's a homage to Tarzan, but what makes me draw the line on \\"Based on serials\\" as an excuse for the movie's actions, this still a poorly  thought out idea that could have easily been cut), and of course the refrigerator (in all fairness, my reaction to this moment was the same as when Indy survived the raft in Temple of Doom), but quite frankly...when have the Indiana Jones films made much sense?  Despite the amazing intro, and one of the best final actions sequences in movie history, Temple of Doom was just as riddled with flaws as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.  I think many people really were trying to count the ways this new film couldn't live up to the originals, and due to the original films being classic, everyone put a magnifying glass to every flaw.<br /><br />Aside from the moments mentioned above, I believe CGI was used effectively, and, honestly: it was 2008.  Would it have been awesome if Spielberg filmed the entire movie with the same methods as the he used in the 1980s?  Without a doubt, but to expect that is just being too harsh.  It would have been better, but for what we get there is plenty of good stuff here.  A motorcycle chase that uses real stuntmen with occasional effects to make it seem as if Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf are actually there, a great car chase through the South American rainforest (I know, CGI isn't as thrilling as, but there are real parts sprinkled throughout, and you know what: actually doing an action-chase through dense rainforest would have been suicidal, so I fully understand the use of CGI), but most importantly: Temples and tombs.  That isn't CGI, and the team did a great job creating enormous set pieces for Indy and his companions to explore.  Also great is a series of thirteen crystal skeletons modeled personally by the late and great Stan Winston.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg and George Lucas created Indy as a tribute to the Saturday morning serials they grew up with and it seems to have always been a labor of love for the pair.  The first three films took place in the 1930s and reflected it.  Now, twenty years later, Harrison Ford's age dictated an older Indy so the setting moved to 1950s.  Indy, having always been a creation of Spielberg and Lucas' nostalgia for thefilms of their youth, shifted from the more serious 1930s treasure hunter serials to the more fantastical, implausible series and movies of the 1950s.  This isn't betraying the fans, this is two friends remembering why they created this character in the first place and it just happens that this may seriously annoy the fans who wanted a far more serious Indy movie.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not as good as the classic trilogy, and people who go in expected it to live up to its predecessors have set themselves out for disappointment.  Yes, it would have been great if this new movie could have at least lived up to Last Crusade, but I was just happy to see Indy on the big screen again.  Indiana Jones has always been based on the fun B-movies that Spielberg and Lucas love, and in that regard I believe Kingdom of the Crystal Skull accomplished what it set out to do: be a light popcorn entertainment that transports the viewer back to a time when movies weren't so obsessed with being edgy or \\"Realistic.\\"  As for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, I'm happy that Lucas and Spielberg understand what makes an entertaining action movie.

0307346617|5.0|I am not a fan of zombie books. In general I find the idea of a zombie kinda stupid (I don't know why that is, since I read a ton of UF). I got this book on a total whim and I'm so glad I did. It was original and well written. Each interviewee was characterized superbly. The atmosphere was dark and properly moody. The portrayal of the different reactions by some of the world's governments seemed almost too chillingly accurate. Super entertaining often frightening thriller.

The author is a true wordsmith , I am sure many of the words/ideas will stay with me.   Congratulations on the Pulitzer...well deserved.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|The script is silly, and I have not seen either Depp or Jolie look this bad in a movie before. Depp is a total frump and Jolie is frighteningly skinny and badly made up, with hair that looks like it needs washing and is probably not her own. The premise is hard to believe. It's not a thriller. It's a watered-down Hollywood confection. But, there is Venice and stereotyped Italian cops -- where is Giancarlo Giannini when you need him? As one reviewer pointed out, it starts slowly. It just doesn't really go anywhere.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|At once a movie for young, aspiring dancers, and perverts. And it is a horror flick. Being all 3 in one makes this the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't even want to give it one star. The director, and Fox Searchlight, should have chosen one genre instead of 3 - pornography, horror, or children. Hopefully the perverted, horror film children audience is small....

The only thing that bugged me was the ICQ conversations in forced \\"leet speak\\" (missing vowels and such, but not actually leet speak). Professionals, even computer security professionals, do not communicate in the language of script kiddies (sometimes written as kitties in the book...).

B004NSHBCK|5.0|Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto is one of four iconic vehicles for fiddlers composed in the 19th Century. The others are by Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Brahms. Of the four it was this one that was greeted with the most controversy. The famous Viennese music critic Eduard Hanslick (reputedly the model for the odious Beckmesser in Wagner's Die Meistersinger) accused the composer of beating the violin black and blue and creating \\"music that stinks in the ear.\\" Hanslick, of course, was a close friend of Brahms and had just greeted his violin concerto with rapturous praise following its premiere in Vienna. Tchaikovsky witnessed the premiere of HIS violin concerto in December 1881 and lived long enough to see its European acceptance if not yet its iconic standing. The Sibelius concerto - his only one - dates from 1905 in its final revised form. It is a symphonic work: austere, almost glacial, with a somber autumnal beauty that is haunting in its muted resignation and brooding innigkeit.<br /><br />David Oistrakh provides a luminous, gorgeously conceived and executed performance recorded in December 1959. Of the three great Soviet era violinists: Heifetz, Milstein and Oistrakh, it was the latter who most memorably combined thrilling technique with a refined lyrical sweetness of tone. This performance is Classical in its control yet it always exhibits the open-hearted Romanticism for which Tchaikovsky is renowned. The Philadelphia Orchestra in its heyday under Ormandy makes an ideal accompanist. Their famous \\"silken sheen\\" is a perfect foil for Tchaikovsky's lush melodies.<br /><br />This is the same performance that was previously released in 2006 under the Great Performances banner. If you have that disc this will be an annoying duplication. Both are DSD remasters with the earlier release sounding a bit brittle and slightly less warm and full. It is difficult to ascertain whether the remasterings are exactly the same but there is a noticeable difference in sound quality to my ear. If you want Oistrakh's dark, brooding Sibelius concerto you will have a decision to make. The (apparent) difference in the Tchaikovsky's sound and the exemplary Sibelius performance mitigated my anger at Sony for releasing what is essentially the CD layer of a Hybrid SACD without making the higher resolution multichannel layer available. The DSD remastered stereo placed on a standard redbook CD sounds superb, especially when using my receiver's native Dolby PLIIx decoder. There appears to be much ambient surround information inherent to both recordings that an SACD would have gloried in. Sony seems determined to destroy the SACD format that it helped to create and which is going strong everywhere but in America. In the end I think the SACD format will survive and even thrive, given the superb recording quality it can offer to audiophiles.<br /><br />Mike Birmanwant Oistrakh's dark, brooding Sibelius concerto you will have a decision to make.

1599218011|3.0|I'm a big believer in the raw vegan way of eating, just not a big practicer, because it's really challenging and I'm kinda lazy :)    Kris Carr is a very enthusiastic writer. A littler over-the-top for me. I find her style unprofessional. I'm not her girlfriend, and get quickly annoyed by the overuse of cutesy catch-phrases (For example: your body is no longer simply a body in CrazySexyLand - it's a God-pod. Blech.).    I also question how much science she has to back up her recommendations. Common sense absolutely tells us that we are not eating well in America, but she has chosen a big battle and seems to have brought a big rainbow-colored, butterfly-shaped balloon rather than big guns to fight with.

The 4th book was, as admitted by the author, a disappointment as he had to end the story due to the book becoming too large - hence the need for a 5th book.    The only thing I didn't like was that I couldn't refer to the maps or the Appendices without losing my place. Have I missed a shortcut?

B000001ELR|4.0|With the sliding guitar and pounding drum roll introduction to the opening title track, you can feel that 1982's `Creatures of the Night' is Kiss returning to energy and hard rock. After four years of pottering around in adult respectability, disco, pop, bubblegum and prog rock, it was a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Producer Michael James Jackson captures a huge drum and a grinding bass sound that drives the entire album, linking together nine songs that tap a variety of styles without sounding like they are from different solo artists - as had been the case for Kiss in recent studio recordings. Apart from a return to hard rock, there is an urgency on this record that had been desperately missing on `[[ASIN:B000001ELP Music From the Elder]]', `[[ASIN:B000001ELN Unmasked]]' and `[[ASIN:B000001ELL Dynasty]]'. But it also wasn't a return to the big, often dumb, Kiss of old. Darker and heavier, the sound was subtly updated with an injection that incorporated some of the coldness of new wave and the attack of the new, evolved post-punk hard rock and metal.<br /><br />While Paul Stanley and Gene Simons wrote separately with different co-writers (Stanley with contract writer Adam Mitchell and Simmons with Bryan Adams and his long time writing partner, Jim Vallance), they also collaborated with Ace Frehley replacement, Vincent Cusano (Vinnie Vincent), which aids in uniting the overall sound of the album.<br /><br />Stanley again proves the superior writer and singer with the cold driving attack of the title track and the tortured, epic hard rock ballad, `I Still Love You'. `Keep Me Comin' and `Danger' are also his. The remaining five are Simmons with `Saint and Sinner' and `Rock and Roll Hell' standouts. The razor sharp `Killer' and threatening `War Machine' help round this effort out as one of the band's best.<br /><br />Though it was the fourth is a set of wildly different albums, it not only spelled the end of kiss with make-up, but also the end of the band's golden era of songwriting.

0920668372|1.0|This book is downright creepy.  The only morals I can see in this book is that it's important to set firm boundaries with your parents and that you'll be on your death bed by the time you see your first grandchild if you wait till your 40s to reproduce.  I think there's a few pages missing in the middle too, after the mother keeps sneaking through the window of her grown son's house to rock him at night there has to be a side story where the police show up after the neighbors saw her or something about how he had to take a second job to pay for all the therapy he needed after she walked in on him and some chick getting it on.<br /><br />In addition to making any adult want to scream \\"BAD TOUCH!\\" the books freakishly catchy writing will have your child bring it back to you over.  And over.  And over.  Leaving you in the uncomfortable position of having to decide between breaking it to your kids that you won't read it anymore because it's basically a PBS special on unhealthy parent child relationships or burying it beneath the moldly lasagne in the trash after they're in bed and claiming you don't know where it is the next day.

B000JML7EC|3.0|First of all I have to say that English is not my first language and that is the reason why I gave this book a 3 star rating, it was a little hard to read because it is written in an old fashioned way that I am not used to. Another thing that kinda made the book less enjoyable (and this is not the author's fault) is the fact that there's been a lot of pirate movies lately and most of them seem to resemble certain parts of the book, I guess if I hadn't seen the movies that wouldn't have been an issue. Overall I'd say that it is a very good book and great for young people to start to get to know the classics.
B000001ELP|3.0|After 1976's Bob Ezrin-produced `[[ASIN:B000001EL3 Destroyer]]', it would have seemed a no-brainer for Kiss to record a soaring metal concept album. So, when the venture finally came to pass in 1981, I imagine a reteam with Alice Cooper's producer promised a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, with Kiss all over the place after their disco bubblegum musings with `[[ASIN:B000001ELL Dynasty]]' and `[[ASIN:B000001ELN Unmasked]]', and public and behind the scenes line-up changes, the final project - `Music from The Elder' - took its place as an unfortunate, if interesting and ambitious, misfire.<br /><br />The problem with this album is that, rather than pick up where `Destroyer' left off and produce another soaringly energetic hard rock opus, it is infected with too much of the glossy pop stylings of the previous two albums and too many middle of the road leanings. It is heavy and serious in parts, while slight, comic-book-like and a bit dumb in others. It veers wildly from being complex to simplistic; thunderous to Disney-eque. Not only does it feel too planned and thought through, it never manages to be abandoned, which was the winning quality of `Destroyer' - and of successful rock in general. It always feels constrained by its ambitions, which in turn tends to give the unfortunate impression that the band's reach was beyond their abilities.<br /><br />That is not to say that it is poor. Over half the songs on `The Elder' are very good. They just needed to aim for metal and energy, rather than portentous prog rock. Aside from Alice Cooper, Bob Ezrin had also produced Lou Reed's `Berlin' in 1973, which might account for Reed appearing as co-writer on a number of songs here. Former Brill Building contract songwriter, Tony Powers, is also a major co-writer. This hodge podge of creative input could have delivered big dividends, but it doesn't. This is most notable in Powers' `Odyssey'. Though it has a mythic quality, the Broadway-esque tone and emphasis on piano take it far away from anything Kiss had or ever would record. Despite being beautifully sung by Paul Stanley, it just isn't Kiss. Elsewhere, strings and choirs - things that worked on `Destroyer' - lend a suitable theatricality to proceedings, but weigh the album down.<br /><br />None of the individual songs are terrible (a major achievement for Kiss!) In fact, some are outstanding. The yearning ballad, `A World Without Heroes', sung and co-written by Gene Simmons (with Stanley, Ezrin and Reed) is absolutely stunning. `The Oath', sung by Stanley, comes close to a `Destroyer' rocker, though is knee-capped by restrained production and an over-reliance on falsetto. `Just A Boy', again sung by Stanley, sounds like Kiss despite its medieval style and the bombastic `Under the Rose', complete with baritone choir, is durgey, heavy and powerful. Ace Frehley's songwriting (`Dark Light' and the instrumental `Escape from the Island') is relatively weak and stylistically out of place (maybe an indication of his disdain for the concept) and the final stab at recapturing `Rock and Roll All Nite' in the anthem, `I', is adequate and less embarrassing than incessant later attempts by the band to do so.<br /><br />Dedication to a more rock/metal approach might have saved this record. As it stands it is sadly, seriously flawed but undeniably interesting - and far better than critics would have you believe.anything Kiss had or ever would record.

B001F7XIJW|4.0|Coming off of the surprisingly huge mainstream success of 2006's eye-opening \\"From Mars To Sirius,\\" Gojira now find themselves at the point where just about every band ends up at some point in their career. It is at this time when they take a break from experimentalism and innovation, and are content just to refine their now very widely-known and respected trademark sound. (Their sound is one of technical death-influenced grindcore laid over firm roots in industrial metal.) So no, no, they will not turn nearly as many heads this time around; because \\"The Way Of All Flesh\\" cannot be said to be as godly or groundbreaking as, say, 2003's \\"The Link,\\" or Ought-six's \\"F.M.T.S.\\" But in no way should that mislead you intro thinking that this is album is a disappointment. In no stretch of the imagination is \\"BLANK\\" a bad (or even mediocre) effort, or one that leaves much to be desired. It is yet another strong album from Gojira, who have already established themselves as true, titans in the modern music scene.<br /><br />The vast (vast!) majority of this record finds Gojira unabashedly attempting to completely satisfy all fans with visceral heaviness. As brutal as anything they've ever recorded, the band hurl one monstrous bombshell of audio napalm upon your eardrums right and left. The musical arrangements are essentially equal to an overstuffed Thanksgiving Day turkey -- they have more of the good stuff than you can absorb all at once. There are more snarly, tar thick distortion, technically-impressive guitar leads, excellent, and devastatingly heavy, angular, inventive, staccato, deeply crunching, post-Masotdonian riff collages (that are sure to get drilled into heads everywhere) , equally-as-monstrous grindcore blasts, driving thrash beats, steady bass lines, positively brutal, bellowed vocals, tricky, math-centric time signatures, huge breakdowns, and steamrolling, back-breaking rhythms on hand, here, to feed ten armies.<br /><br />To its credit, though, the music is kept interesting. This is thanks in part due to a handful of \\"new\\"-ish elements being lightly sprinkled into the mix, here. (Although it is such a light dusting of experimentalism that it might be hidden and/or buried in the background.) For one, skinsman Mario Duplantier doesn't dole out his first blast beat of the year until the time that the fourth track, \\"Yama's Messengers,\\" rolls around. And when he eventually does, he makes the tune come across sounding like an At The Gates b-side because it has that same horse hoof-pounding galloping quality. (From that point forwards, though, Duplantier uses the \\"when it rains it pours\\" technique, making his drum patterns frequently revolve around grinding, jackhammer-fast blasting.) Next, \\"The Way\\" has heavy leanings towards genuine industrial music, and some of them are, at times, darn near danceable. Surprised? Well just take a listen to the \\"A Sight To Behold\\"'s surprisingly catchy and melodic electronic bass line, rhythmically blippy beats, simplistic, rock `n' roll timing (4/4),  prevalent, Nine Inch Nails-flavored synthesizers, psychedelic atmospheres, droning feedback, rhythmic and hummable rhythms, nu-metal-flavored hip-hop sample/elements, and so-so clean backing vocal refrain. The end result is ultimately comes across like a cover of some rap-rock artist - like, say, Korn, Mushroomhead, Linkin Park, or (*gasp!) even gangsta hip-hoppers Cypress Hill. (Rap-inspired death metal/grindcore?! This isn't Emmure, Candiria, or Soilent Green we're talking about, right?!)  Another example is the surprising opener, \\"Oroborous,\\" which has an industrial-tinged stoner metal intro (complete with webs  of guitar melodies); as is the \\"Catch 33\\"-era Meshuggah-like use of three percussionists -- two of which being drum machines or drum programmers  -- throughout. Lastly, it is impossible not to dig the wicked pure black metal vocals from Lamb Of God's Randy Blythe in \\"Adoration For None.\\" (Some of the shrieks that he lays down, here, are sure to send chills up your spine. Also, they are made even more effective when placed alongside and duel with Joe Duplantier's usually growly death metal barks.) Plus, it is all topped off with tasty pick slides and a bouncy drum fill, too.<br /><br />For the most part, though, business definitely remains the same as usual for Gojira. \\"Toxic Garbage Island\\" is another highlight, being the extremely thunderous and mosh-pit-ready number that it is. It rips speakers apart with its smart tempo changes, harsh, Meshuggah-ish atonal screams, crushing rhythms, and an endless cascade of great, pounding, rock hard, adherently groovy, Fredrik Thorendal/Krisiun-worthy machine-gun riffing. Sure thing, the interplay between seven-stringers Duplantier and Andreu, here, is as heavy as a ton of bricks, and it spits sparks the way that a waterfall spits H2O. Other standouts include the clearly Crowbar-inspired pure doom guitar interplay anchored by blistering drum slamming of \\"The Silver Cord\\"; scorching, Slayer-esque death-thrash fireworks of \\"All The Tears\\"; misleadingly harmonic intro that slams into the pure grindcore assault \\"The Art Of Dying\\"; and the bass that periodically shows its head throughout \\"Wolf Down The Earth,\\" and does so with a deft and funky-sounding slap technique. Plus, of course, one must not forget to mention the ferocious, buzzsaw picking, grinding blast beat pummel, distinctly industrial breakdowns, and trippy, robotic-tinged spoken-word vocal parts that are found in \\"Vacuity.\\"<br /><br />When all is said and done, \\"The Way Of All Flesh\\" should only expand upon and further the reputation of real greatness that the band established for themselves long ago. It is but further proof of the fact that Gojira are quickly and indisputably building one of the sweetest, mightiest, and most consistent discographies of the past decade.  And this record also cements their status as being simply untouchable in the world of modern-day/new millennium industrial-grind.

B002ZG99IG|1.0|****May be a spoiler or two below****<br /><br />I had this on DVD.  I had heard when watching DVDUESDAY that it was stupid.  But, I like to give things a chance.  Let's just say I'm an idiot.  This movie was SO pointless.  Ok, first the story.  It is about a girl who goes to college.  When she gets to her dorm room she meets her roommate.  The roommate is crazy.  That's it.  That is the entire story.  Then, the nut roommate starts obsessing with the girl who moved in.  Like the girl finds a cat and she can not have them at in their room.  She is going to movie out and take the cat to her friends.  So, the crazy girl kills the cat.  She threatens some people and maybe kills one.  Now, if these seem like they could be interesting, they are not.  One after the other, whatever the girl likes or who ever she starts doing this with, ends up missing or dead or they just stay away from her.  How she could not realize that it is her roommate doing the stuff is beyond me.  There were so many little things that led nowhere.  Just left dangling.  This was not worth the 1.99 red box rental.  It ends the exact way you think it will.<br /><br />Another thing is there were no special features.  I am sure they would have been as meaningless as the movie, but it would have made me feel a little better about renting it.  Then, It is about 11 at night and I am watching it on my PS3.  I kept getting some message that said not verified or able to play the audio lease check out some website for help.  This is the first movie that would not play on my PS3.  SO, I had to freaking pay 5.99 to rent it from FIOS.  When this comes on TV, watch and regret it.  But paying for it will give you one more thing to regret.

Besides the Duke, I really enjoy Jorge Riverio in this movie, he helps make it cool and a little unique. Just like Wayne's son Pat, I always liked Chris Mitchum in Wayne's movies. And what All-American, western film fan does not appreciate the ladies of Rio Lobo. Sure, some canned acting, but an enjoyable John Wayne western.

B003NTMREM|5.0|To those who slammed the acting I ask: Compared to what?  What do you expect from a scifi TV show?  There is nothing particularly wrong with the acting.  As for the Puritans, spare us your admonitions.  Some of us actually live in the real world.  If anything, this series would have benefited from a bit more graphic sex and general noir.  Price-wise, this was also a good deal.  BBC America is charging an arm and a leg for the DVD's of this series.  Likewise, iTunes is charging 50% more for the same HD download of Torchwood -Series 1.  The $12.87 Amazon price is a good value by any measure.<br /><br />As for the service -<br /><br />I am someone who has been a regular Amazon customer since 1997 and, yet, I have avoided Amazon Prime.  It now appears that there is some kind of advantage to being a Prime member where video is concerned.  I will have to reconsider becoming a Prime member since the customer service I received from Amazon was exemplary following the initial problems I had viewing the downloaded Torchwood  series via the Unbox player.  Amazon's phone rep Dustin was pleasant and he referred the matter to a tech guy, Cody, who patched up my Unbox player and allowed me to view the videos with no problem.<br /><br />I am happy with the both the show and the Amazon.

There is only one complaint and its that at one point in the movie (when the girls steal the boys' clothing) you get an up close and personal view of one of the boys...boys (yeah he squats down to get a shirt RIGHT in the view of the camera and apparently this was ok back then?). I never knew that until recently as my sisters used to cover my eyes at that part lol! so I would watch out for that. Other than that its a great movie and I will watch it for years to come!
1591844096|5.0|Seth is good at reminding me (and maybe you) that passion is pretty important. If you aren't creating something meaningful then why the hell are you bothering to go through your day? That's what I got from Linchpin. When I started reading Linchpin I was working as a director in a large construction company and I was pretty unhappy. Now I'm working as a mentor in an even bigger company that is even worse then the last one at making human beings feel like cogs in a machine. What's different? It doesn't matter because I know have a specific plan, thanks in part to Seth's good advice.<br /><br />I won't quote him extensively but I have some of his words posted on the door of my room here in Kabul, Afghanistan. Linchpin motivated me to start writing the novel series I've been sitting on for more than 10 years. Will that make me indispensable? To myself, yes. Maybe others will benefit as well. Seth talks in depth about giving others whatever it is you have to offer. Whether I'm in my day to day job or writing from my heart I am taking his advice to heart. Do everything with as much passion as you can. Ignore the naysayers. Pursue your passions.<br /><br />We don't all have to be nameless, faceless parts of a giant machine. Sometimes, though we need to be reminded of that. Standing out from the crowd and marching to the beat of your own drum is a recipe for happiness. Thanks for reminding me of that Seth.

B002ZG975Q|2.0|There have been other stage plays, musicals and films that recall the old fairytale of Beauty and the Beast and the message they all hold - that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder - is a solid one. BEASTLY, adapted from  a 2007 novel by Alex Flinn, is 'a retelling of the fairytale Beauty and the Beast set in modern-day New York City from the view of the beast. Flinn researched many versions of the Beauty and the Beast story to write her book. Many of these are playfully alluded to in portions of the book, particularly the chat room transcripts in which the character of Kyle talks to other teens who have been transformed into creatures.' Not having read the book may be an advantage or disadvantage depending of how well Miss Flinn placed words in the mouths of her characters.  But writer/director Daniel Barnz adapted the story and the screenplay is an embarrassment.<br /><br />Kyle (Alex Pettyfer from 'I am Number Four') is a cocky, conceited handsome rich son of a popular television personality who runs for high school office on the platform that looks and social standing and popularity and money are the only important values on which to elect a person to a position: he is a cad who steps on anyone to climb the ladder of accelerated ego. He snubs his opponent Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) and marches to victory.  At a party Kyle encounters Kendra (Mary-Kate Olson) a ridiculous appearing strange girl who is a witch and puts a curse on Kyle: he will become ugly for a year and only be able to regain his handsome raison d'etre for living if he can find a girl to say she loves him before his year is up. Kyle faces his equally obnoxious superficial father (Peter Krause) who, in horror,  finds an apartment for his now grotesquely ugly son and leaves his housekeeper Lola (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and home tutor, blind Will (Neil Patrick Harris), to care for him.  Kyle attempts to hide himself from the world but with Lola's and Will's advice he returns to the streets at night where he observes a now beautiful Lindy attempting to protect her drug addict father (Roc La Fortune). He follows her, watching her from afar until they finally meet and Kyle allows Lindy to see his ugly beast face expecting Lindy to be repulsed (she is not) and thus begins Kyle's wooing of Lindy to extremes that lead to what we all knew would be the ending of the story.<br /><br />Alex Pettyfer is a British actor who shows promise and has the looks to make him a teen idol (even with his silly 'beast' paste  on makeup): he deserves better.  Everyone in the cast seems uncomfortable with the oh-so-pop dialogue and the aspects of the film that could have left a worthy message are buried in the mess of the production.

1440503257|5.0|This book is wonderful. We checked it out from the library and loved it so much that we bought it. I should mention that \\"we\\" are my ten year old son and me.<br /><br />It was filled from cover to cover with recipes from the book that are both delicious and written well. Every recipe tells you where it is found in the Harry Potter series and the circumstances surrounding it. In addition, there are historical facts behind the food itself given for each recipe. These little blurbs of information are placed in a way that they don't interfere with the recipes and they add to the pleasant tone of the book.<br /><br />We came home after doing some grocery shopping and we decided to make Kreacher's Creamy Onion Soup. It was AMAZING. Max loved it. The recipes are not always a quick fix. The cooking time of this recipe is about an hour, but that should never keep you from making something as wonderful as this soup was.<br /><br />Good job Dinah Bucholz. You are a true friend to Muggles and Wizards alike!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Beautiful cinematography with the exception of some race scenes that were too digitally tossed together. Otherwise the script was amusing. The cast was well chosen. The movie is family clean!!!!!!!!!!! The story has value and is engaging. I wouldn't want to own it, but definitly recommend seeing it.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Ugh. I loved the series. The first movie was \\"OK\\". This movie is horrible. It's demeaning to older women. Actually its demeaning to women in general. It's unfavorable in its view of marriage and motherhood especially. Just awful. SJP looks HAGGARD in the first 2/3 of the movie and she's so unlikeable, just has this unsmiling expression that is so unflattering to her face. The makeup artist who was in charge of her should be ashamed, she looks like a tranny and her eyes look way tiny, buried underneath all that goop. I started to think that she was angry about her role and it was showing on film...if so, she had every right to be. Towards the end she actually looks a lot better but even so, the girls need to hang it up now, it's pretty much over after this one. The actress who plays Samantha looks horrid, puffy and botoxed to the nth degree -and the hair....the way she's dressed -I'm sure the clothing costs mega bucks but GHOD most of the fashions are so ugly -I can see why people can't wear those outfits twice. Samantha is an embarrassment, I couldn't imagine having her as a friend, constantly in heat and going through menopause/aging denial. The only one who seems to have held up nicely is Miranda. I just couldn't stand the plot of this movie, it was awful, most of it took place in Abu Dhabi...it was like the plot of one of those cheap imported cartoons geared towards tween girls -so unbelievable and hokey. I was rolling my eyes when Carrie met Aidan, her old flame, again in Abu Dhabi...how stupid is that. As I stated earlier, the movie made me kind of uneasy in its portrayal of older women -it's like the director just decided to turn on the characters and just bring them down to a really bad level or something and just kill off SATC once and for all. Us common folk have nothing in common with these overpriveleged, spoiled brats and it's hard to give a crap about their plight...one of the worst movies I think I've ever had the displeasure of viewing -atrocious.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I think the polarised views expressed on this release come from people judging Clapton's recent work against expectations of Clapton as a ground-breaking hard rocking blues man instead on the qualities of the work itself. I personally love it, not because it knocks me over with its brilliance or originality (I don't think either adjective applies to it) but because it's an interesting collection of songs, beautifully arranged, consummately performed, and, perhaps most importantly, delivered by someone who appears to be doing this for the sake of the song, not to break records, startle or impress. And hey, I love to rock hard, but I can also get inside a work as tasty as this. All that said, 'Diamonds Made from Rain' slips a little too close to schmaltz for me. But for the main part, this is Clapton exploring the roots and traditions that have long been grist to the mill for the man, and doing so with class.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|Midnight in Paris (comedy, fantasy, romance)<br />Directed by Woody Allen<br />Starring Owen Wilson, Rachel McAdams, Michael Sheen, Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody<br /><br />2011   94 min   PG-13   1.85:1   Theatrical Release Date June 10, 2011<br /><br />***This review contains spoilers***<br /><br />The Film 5/5<br /><br />Woody Allen has directed more than 40 movies and Midnight in Paris is one of his best. It's a gentle comedy with a strong fantasy element. Like most of Allen's movies, it relies on good writing and clever dialogue.<br /><br />The fantasy element changes the entire feel of the movie, and although it's revealed early in the story, I don't want to ruin it for anyone. However, this would be a very short review if I didn't mention it at all. So please be warned that the remainder of the review contains spoilers. If you don't want to know, it's time to stop reading.<br /><br />The story is built around Gil Pender (Wilson), who arrives in Paris with his fianc&eacute;e, Inez (McAdams). He's a writer hoping to find inspiration and she wants to see some of the local sights. The two explore the city with friends Paul (Sheen) and Carol. Paul claims to be an authority on everything and Gil is annoyed by him, but Inez used to have a crush on Paul and enjoys his company.<br /><br />One evening, Gil decides that he will take a walk alone to get away from Paul. He's a little drunk and manages to get lost, and eventually finds himself sitting on some steps at midnight. It's here that the entire movie changes. A vintage car stops and the people inside urge Gil to get in. They take him to a party and he discovers that Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald are among the guests. He's surprised at their names, and even more baffled when he's introduced to Ernest Hemingway.<br /><br />Gil has traveled back into the 1920s.<br /><br />What would you say to Fitzgerald and Hemingway if you were an aspiring writer? Gil is both astonished and thrilled to be in their presence and mentions that he's also a writer. The trip to the past isn't permanent and he wakes up in the present the next morning. Was it just a dream, or was it real? Allen never explains how Gil returns from the past.<br /><br />He tries to reenact the event, taking Inez with him, but she leaves before midnight. When the clock strikes, the car appears again and he's back in the past. He's introduced to other famous artists, singers and writers, and Gertrude Stein (Bates) critiques his manuscript. Gil seems at home in the 1920s and happier than when he is with Inez in the present. The people seem to understand him better and he fits right in.<br /><br />The story is filled with interesting encounters. The characters spend a lot of time talking, and Allen's imagination keeps things more than interesting. I found it quite gripping. I particularly enjoyed the scenes with Hemingway and was reminded of Dan Simmons' fictional book about him, The Crook Factory. Every encounter with people from 1920s Paris was both charming and intriguing. I found myself imagining how they must have lived, and what it would be like to exist in such a creative environment.<br /><br />The audience in my theater laughed often and everyone left with a smile on their face. It was a magical experience seeing people such as Dali (Brody) and Picasso before they were famous. The setting was perfect, showing the contrast between modern Paris and the city as it was almost a century ago.<br /><br />Wilson was as good as I have ever seen him in the role that Allen presumably would have played in his youth. I like Wilson's quirky delivery and his character wasn't too far removed from the one he played in The Darjeeling Limited. Gil enjoys defying expectations and isn't understood by his friends and potential in-laws.<br /><br />All of the acting impressed me and Sheen was just about perfect as the insufferable Paul. The story was imaginative and different, and not at all what I expected. I left the theater grinning and charmed by the whole story. Allen's last Oscar came in 1987 when he won for Best Screenplay (Hannah and Her Sisters). I wouldn't be surprised if Midnight in Paris received a couple of nominations, and he might just win a fourth Oscar.<br /><br />If you enjoy Woody Allen at all, Midnight in Paris is well worth a trip to the theater. Its charm will draw you in and the dialogue will make you laugh.sters). I wouldn't be surprised if Midnight in Paris received a couple of nominations, and he might just win a fourth Oscar.

B004RLPTT0|5.0|I wasn't really sure about \\"Sucker Punch\\" movie. About halfway through I was ready to turn it off. Then it started coming together a little bit better, so I hung on. Not a bad movie at all. The one thing that stood out through the movie was the soundtrack. Some excellent covers and remixes. I've always loved \\"Army of Me\\" by Bjork, but this takes it to another world.  Anyhow I'm not going to review every song, but I will say that even if you remotely liked this movie you should love the soundtrack. Some spacey goodness.

I respect her more now that I've read this book and she makes me proud to be a women. She's honest and open and I feel like I've really gotten to know her by reading this book. Great purchase and I'm glad I got the hard copy so I can let my family read it too.

B003UESJHE|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, what have you been doing? :)This is truly a great movie, with strong performances from all the actors involved, but for me what almost steals the show is the cinematography. The shot choices, the steady cams, the choices of depth of field and inventive angles all make this movie flow, and allows the actors to just move freely through the beautiful environment that has been created for them. This is a movie that all filmmakers should see and learn from. PLEASE!! We need more films that focus on the skills of the actor in portraying a well written story than movies that cheat by on the sleaze factor or relying on popular current ideas(aka: superheroes, vampires, or the pirates saga(which has truly crashed and burned)). So in summation support this film and here's to more movies like this one.

Highly recommend. My husband and I have watched it probably 100 times!!

184113421X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moJ6JBTE6T6WHR]]HERE IS ITS AMAZING HISTORY DATING FROM THE TWELFTH CENTURY<br /><br />An Appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Who would have thought it?  With its long and illustrious (sometimes notorious) history, The Middle Temple is certainly known mainly to the worldwide legal fraternity - at least the English speaking part of it - as one of the world's pre-eminent centres for legal education and practice.<br /><br />Yet, before this quite fascinating History of the Middle Temple was published in  2011 few people, not even that many lawyers, knew how many of England's movers and shakers, who changed English history, not mention American history, for better or worse, were members of this Inn.<br /><br />Inn?  Yes, the Middle Temple is one of the four Inns of Court situated in that part of central London known to some as `legal London'.  Dating from the twelfth century, the Middle Temple, with its associations with the Knights Templar, boasts among other beauties, a Tudor Hall competed in 1574, when Shakespeare was about ten years old.  The first performance of his Twelfth Night was given here.<br /><br />Not surprisingly the atmosphere is collegiate, reminiscent of an Oxford college.  The Middle Temple and its neighbouring Inns, Inner Temple, and Gray's and Lincoln's Inns, offer green and tranquil oases of contemplation and legal learning quite secluded from the nearby cacophony of London streets. In Elizabethan times, apparently, the Inns of Court were known colloquially as `the Third University of England.'<br /><br />Understandably, the Middle Temple attracted many luminaries to its membership.  There was a time when you didn't have to be a lawyer or law student to join.  Among the most prominent were - and here is just a short list - Sir Walter Raleigh, William Congreve, Henry Fielding, Edmund Burke, William Cowper and William Makepeace Thackeray.  (One wonders if he wrote large chunks of Vanity Fair sitting under a tree in the Middle Temple gardens.)<br /><br />Those of you with American connections will probably be somewhat astounded to learn that five Middle Templars signed the Declaration of Independence on 4 July 1776.  Another Middle Templar, John Rutledge chaired the committee which drafted the United States Constitution, along with six other Middle Templars who were among its 39 original signatories.<br /><br />John Collyer's most illuminating chapter on `The American Connection ` attempts to explain exactly how the Middle Temple came to be connected so closely with such pivotal events and institutions in American history.  Note, for example, the story of Sir Edwin Sandys (1561-1629) who's Virginia Charters gave to the Virginia colonists `all the liberties, franchises and immunities of English subjects.'<br /><br />Predictably, the libertarian and outspoken Sir Edwin was one of those upholders of freedom of speech and of conscience who ended up in front of the Star Chamber for his egalitarian views, but who, because of his popularity was soon released.<br /><br />Lord Judge, the current Lord Chief Justice has called this `a monumental work' and so it is.  Like the most reliable histories, it is written on the basis of research gleaned from the study of original sources.  It's eminent and certainly diligent contributors have done precisely that, creating this impressive work of learning from their researches in the archives of the Middle Temple.  (What a hitherto little known treasure those archives must be!)!<br /><br />As the very proud publishers at Hart Publishing quite rightly remark, the `History of the Middle Temple is `a treasure trove of information about the Inn, its diverse history and influence'.  A riveting read as well as a fascinating history, and enlivened with illustrations, this is a book which should attract a wide readership, not just within the legal fraternity, but among the general public. Curiously, although perhaps not socuriously, many of the issues raised in the book remain topical today - all of which makes this splendid work a must-have acquisition for anyone's library.- all of which makes this splendid work a must-have acquisition for anyone's library.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|This is the greatest AC/DC live film ever made. It is even better that Live at Donington (91') and Live at River Plate (09'). It is all original songs, old style hardcore AC/DC, Led by the greatest singer ever, the one, the only, Bon Scott. Whilst there is some content missing or changed when compared to the original VHS release, it is none the less a great re-make. I also would have prefered more band interviews, especially with Bon if there are any left, instead of 1.5 hours of other musicians and writers talking about how great AC/DC are, which is a fact that anyone who owns this should already know.<br />Let There Be Rock (LCE) Copy 13298/90000<br />AC/DC FOR LIFE, RIP BON SCOTT

I have played the game both on a PC and an iPhone, and see no degradation of quality.   The game's premise is simple and approachable without being tedious or quickly boring. There is enough variety to keep a player occupied for many hours, and I definitely think that the game is worth the price.

My heartbreak is to discover that this is the first in a long line of unwritten books.  This is a huge factor for someone who was scarred by the Wheel of Time epic - as in 'when will the story finally end??!!'  We waited for years and years.  Was it worth it?  Maybe but my bet is that this series will be much better and we will all have something to pass on to our grandchildren!
0553582038|1.0|Mr Martin has jumped the rails with this lost in the woods tale. I could tolerate the changing character POVs in the first three books even though I found Mr. Martin's habit of killing off the most interesting of the lot annoying, but in this book he not only kills, maims and discards the good he keeps and focuses on the bad. Why would anyone move on to the inevitable next book, when there is no one of any interest left. Surely the base for this series is not so desperate for reading material they will keep reading when nothing is left to read. I hear there is a fifth novel, glee! Only at gunpoint, I'm off to find a graphic novel or kiddie book, something with some substance. After this Great Expectations sounds like an exciting read. Do the right thing stop at book two and make up your own ending. You'll be happier and better served.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This movie, which we received in a timely manner, is delightful.  We enjoyed it with our grandchildren who thought it was scary and hilarious.  The funniest thing about this movie is that Danny Devito, the bad guy, is the narrator.

0062060554|4.0|Watson creates a harrowing scenario in which Christine Lucas is trapped in an existence where all memory is lost after a night's sleep. Each morning she awakens to the terror of not knowing who she is- or where the last twenty-four hours have gone. Her young face replaced by that of a forty-seven year old, a series of photos taped around the bathroom mirror remind her of an unfamiliar world, sleeping with a stranger who says he is her husband, Ben. At the suggestion of a therapist, at first only a disembodied voice on a cell phone, Chris has begun keeping a journal. Dr. Nash believes a precise account of each day may have a cumulative effect in stimulating memory, but urges Christine to keep her writing secret. Bit by bit, fragment by fragment, shards of memory resurface, only to be discounted by her daily reality: an accident that left her with amnesia, a son killed in Afghanistan, a minor life easily erased as Ben patiently explains her past as the day goes on.<br /><br />Experiencing Christine's daily disorientation, the reader is privy to the jarring dislocation of the daily cycle, the journal a pale substitute for reality for a woman with no past and no future, only the present. This patchwork of explanations suggests a discrepancy between truth and lies, awareness slightly out of sync with intuition, snippets of memory from photographs and random stories of marriage to Ben. In this isolated scenario, Christine's vague paranoia and unease is contagious, a slow walk from surety to suspicion, from doubt to danger as a carefully-constructed life unravels and Chris clings to the scribbled pages of her journal, her only link to self. A waking nightmare that begins anew each day, the novel slides into sinister territory. What you think you know proves insubstantial, facts slipping away on a sea of confusion and a sense of imminent threat. Christine's amnesia takes on a life of its own as she tumbles into the world of memory, one with deadly consequences. Luan Gaines/2011.
B004VUP8WK|2.0|Never was a HUGE fan of Morbid Angel since the Death Metal \\"scene\\" really died off about 10 years ago or more. But i did like a hand full of their tunes back in the day. With original singer David Vincent back in the mix i thought it would be pretty good. Well it is, but it's far to trendy and not really how they use to write or sound at all. This stuff is really no heavier than Lamb Of God, God Forbid, Unearth or any other of the \\"metalcore\\" type bands out there. Sure there are blast beats and double bass a plenty but it's just not the usual Morbid(Morbid Angel) most knew and loved. Some songs deserves a nod and some are just well, strange, with electronic bits, marching chants, and straight forward drums beats on a few. And don't even ask me about the song radiculk, i have no clue what they were trying to pull out of their hat with that crap. Blahh. Sounds like a Static X, Slipknot or Dope song, really odd. Oh well, i have never really been a fan, so no matter. I just wanting something different to listen to, and that's what i got. But then again Carcass's Swansong was different, but great, so i think i'll go listen to it now.
0439023521|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" series has become the must-read Millennium trilogy for the middle school set. And like Stieg Larsson's \\"Girl Who...\\" books, it maximizes its engagement factor by \\"going there\\" -- as close as Suzanne Collins dare go while remaining safe for the books' preteen audience.<br /><br />Horrible things happen in \\"The Hunger Games,\\" starting with a reaping that is like Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" dropped into the dystopian society of Margaret Atwood's \\"The Handmaid's Tale.\\" The shock and horror of events just escalates after that. Human lives are destroyed at the pleasure of the dictatorial Capitol. Cannibalism is mentioned, starvation is a key theme, and plenty of blood flows.<br /><br />Although there are a lot of deep, challenging concepts to be explored (oppression, the cruelty of human nature, questionable science -- see \\"muttations\\"), the page turning is more enjoyable if the reader just lets the entertainment value reign supreme. Each chapter is almost a mini cliffhanger, and the final scenes are fully rewarding.
0061251321|4.0|A modern twist on good old-fashioned team building. That's really what this book is about.  Instead of teams, it's tribes.  Instead of teamwork, it's loyalty and productivity.  Instead of team success, it's high performance culture.    The authors have taken the concept of teamwork and adapted it to the recent explorations of the tribal concept. How can a group of people, connected through some common bond (working for the same employer, for example), evolve into highly productive and innovative teams?  Through the five stages described in detail in this book.    By applying theories of basic psychology and scientific research, the authors lead readers through a process of growth, from hostility and self-centeredness  to a culture where knowledge is power but not shared, to a culture with common purpose and shared values.  Tips and tools are shared to help leaders take their teams where few actually go, stage five, where the focus is solely on achieving potential and in which pure innovation exists.    I'm not sure any substantially new theory is shared in this book, but familiar information is definitely presented in a new way.  If your mind has shifted from team to tribe, you'll probably find great value in this resource.  There are several nice touches in the book's format; coaching tips are called out throughout the book, there are easy to understand summaries of key points at the end of each chapter.    All in all, Tribal Leadership is a useful resource for developing highly successful teams.  For leaders seeking a systematic way to assess and develop the cultures of their tribes to achieve maximum greatness, this book presents the process in a useful and very readable format.  It's a good addition to a leadership or management library.
B00204AA0O|4.0|My Regina Spektor CD was in perfect condition, still in the wrapping, and I couldn't be happier with it. The only thing that was out of the ordinary was a little silver sticker on the front of the album case but I don't use the case so it wasn't a big deal to me.
1595826971|5.0|I have been interested in McGee's Alice game for some time and this book is definitely worth the purchase since the price is good. The hardcover is nicely made and the pages were thick and the artwork are awesome, gruesome and pretty creepy. And horror genres are not my type of games! Give the book a look if you're interested in weird and creepy games. Words of warning: This book has potentials of spoilers for the game.
B002ZBT84G|5.0|I purchased this CD the day after I learned Gil Scott passed away.  Listening to the monologues and music, with the sense of remembrance, thankfulness and reflection on his life, I somehow felt, he was saying goodbye to us... as if he knew his time was coming soon.    Classic Heron poetic rhythms... a great cd to listen to when you want to simply... think.
B004GYOQ6A|1.0|It downloands/installs fine, even launches fine, but as soon as a select a level and press play, it crashes.  Yes, I tried several different levels, they all crashed.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|Stopped watching the movie after 40 mins. I just did not see how this movie was entertaining.  The Special Effects where ok but they were not convincing. Lame acting and this<br />movie was just flat out boring.<br /><br />If you want cool special effects any Matrix movie will do. If that does not tell you how out dated and lame<br />the effect where in the movie..
B000OVLINI|5.0|The book was gripping, memorable--dark and haunting. I loved every second of it. I can't wait to read more of this author! If you are on the fence, just do it--you will not be disappointed, but if you don't...you will always wonder...
B004RC8NUQ|1.0|Please movie writers, we need more sex and drugs in our movies. Please??? There is just not enough these days and I think what society is missing is more degenerates that make this country so great.     If you thought the above comment by me was a correct analysis of what we as people should be, then you will absolutely love this movie. So enjoy. For the rest of us with a brain in our heads, move on and hope someone will make a great movie one day. TC
B00127RAJY|5.0|Today was the first day that I tried this dvd, it is intense and really makes you sweat. The routine isn't one move over and over it features a variety so the workout doesn't even feel like 20minutes. It was hard but 25lbs from now I know it will be worth it. This is a great dvd
0393338827|4.0|This is a great book, by a great writer. Lewis shows us the idiocy of many on Wall Street and their inability or incapability of recognizing the huge problem that was subprime mortgages. He profiles those who predicted the market crash, going into their thinking, their doubts, and their various maneuvers to bet on the housing crash.    My only criticism is that even in Lewis' great simple and beautiful prose, it was hard to wrap my mind around Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), credit default swaps, and the various other instruments created to make money off of bad bets and risks. Still I highly recommend this book and enjoyed reading it right after reading Lewis' Liar's Poker.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|When I saw the commercials for this film I had high hopes, I thought the premise had potential, when I noticed it had an \\"R\\" rating I thought just maybe here is a comedy that has not been censored and \\"Dumbed down\\" for the 13 yr old movie crowd, perhaps it should have been because 13 yr old boys are the only people who will find this film funny. At several points during this film I actually felt both embarrassed and sorry for the actors for having to make this film, (I almost walked out halfway through it) it is chock full of some of the lowest grade humor I have ever seen. (Spoiler alert!!!) Did some producer actually think that a scene with Justin Timberlake (playing a clueless imbecile of a teacher) dry humping Cameron Diaz doggie style, then actually showing the wet spot in his pants would be funny??? All the best parts were used up in the commercials. Perhaps if they edit out all the low grade humor and bad dialogue they could take the remaining 10 minutes of film and show it on the art film circuit as a \\"Short film\\". Like I said the premise of the film had potential, it's got a good supporting cast, all it needed was a more intelligent script and better production values to make it a reasonably good summer film. I really hope Cameron Diaz makes a better film soon because her career is going downhill fast.  As much as I like Cameron Diaz as an actress, there is no way this film will ever make it into my DVD collection.
B004ULEEY8|3.0|Really REALLY frustrated and annoyed right... I had ordered \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" a couple weeks back primarily for the \\"Resistance 3 Demo\\" that was advertised as included with this single-disc BD edition (but also because we wanted to see the film, and watch our hometown get blown to bits).<br /><br />Well, my shipment finally arrived today, I opened up \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\", popped it into my PS3 ready to give the demo a whirl, and... it's not there. Tried it on my second PS3, same thing. To say I'm incredibly disappointed right now (and a bit angry) is a huge understatement.<br /><br />I don't know what's going on with Amazon's copies, but the demo absolutely is NOT on every single-edition BD. I don't know if a batch of discs was erroneously packaged with the incorrect disc or what... but others have commented on missing demos as well, both here at Amazon and elesewhere.<br /><br />Guess I'll have to demand a return and hope for the best with a replacement copy... but something tells me I'm gonna get screwed again. After what I just went through this past week (two deaths in the family, hacked accounts, my wife suddenly requiring eye surgery, and more news along these lines), the last thing I need to deal with is \\"simple\\" stuff like this that consumers should never have to deal with. *SIGH*<br /><br />Thanks Amazon.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I had the Garmin 305 for a year before I bought the 405 CX. I wanted a watch that was smaller and my Garmin 305 also had problems turning on sometimes. I have had this watch for about a month now, and absolutely love all the features. I thought the touch bezel would be really finicky, but it turned out to be easy to use. I like how I can just watch within 3 meters of my laptop and my recent workouts are automatically uploaded. My only complaint is that when I look in my history, I can't see my weekly mileage. It just shows daily and then totals.

B000JML7EC|5.0|I can now see where Johny Depp gets his inspiration.  This is the great granddaddy of pirate stories.  Treasure Island cast the mold for all such tales to come.  A true classic!  Now read it and away with ye!
0143038419|5.0|I must say i am a bit dissapointed of the reviews, it's sad to see that so many people did not like it. I was fascinated of this true life story, it's not just a novel created by somebody rich imagination, it's author's personal life experience, it has everything, happiness, sadness, food, travel, friendship, past, soul search, depression, strengh, faith....If you liked the movie, you'll definetly love the book, just because it has much more to it. I can say that this is one of the few books that i will probably read all over again, it's a great book, it's an amazing story and the way it's written just keeps you connected to every idea. Get it, you won't regret it!

B003Y5H54W|1.0|I was quite excited to see \\"Red Riding Hood.\\"  I love period movies,  adore updated fairy tales, and, well, the color red has always attracted me.  Apprently, that's all the creators of this complete mash of a movie felt was neccessary to present.<br /><br />I really wish I could have been in the pitch session.  I believe it went something like this:<br /><br />\\"We're going to do a movie.\\"<br /><br />\\"What kind of movie?  We've never done a movie before.\\"<br /><br />\\"How about...and updated fairy tale?  With costumes?  Set in a vaguely Renaissance village?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes!  Everyone loves movies with costumes. The viewer always feels...smarter for it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Right.  Now, which fairy tale?  Not Cinderella...\\"<br /><br />\\"No, that's been done to death.\\"<br /><br />\\"Right.  Rapunzel?\\"<br /><br />\\"JUST got done.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh, yeah.  Wait!  I know...Red Riding Hood!\\"<br /><br />\\"YES!  A girl...a wolf...a red cape.  PERFECT!\\"<br /><br />\\"But wait...if this is an update...maybe we should.....\\"<br /><br />\\"MAKE THE WOLF A WEREWOLF?  BRILLIANT!  We'll be like all those other movies that have used werewolves so well.  You know, Harry Potter...Twilight.  We'll be just like them.\\"<br /><br />\\"Good, yes,  so we have the werewolf, we have the fairy tale, we have the red cape.  We need music.\\"<br /><br />\\"We have nothing in the budget for music.\\"<br /><br />\\"What do we have lying around?\\"<br /><br />\\"I've got some 80's synth music still programmed into my Casio keyboard.\\"<br /><br />\\"Weird....but I like it!  It's going to give the movie and even MORE updated feel.\\"<br /><br />\\"Okay, how about a cast?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, we need someone who's good at costume movies.\\"<br /><br />\\"Gary Oldman is available.\\"<br /><br />\\"EXCELLENT!  He's great.  Who else?  I know...Virginia Madsen goes to my pilates class.  I'll ask her!\\"<br /><br />\\"She's not exactly known for her period acting.\\"<br /><br />\\"Doesn't matter.  She's great, and she has a recognizable name.  NOW, we need some young talent.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh, there are young actors lying around here someplace, find a couple of good looking ones and plug them in anyplace.  Oh, and maybe they should have...I don't know...British accents?\\"<br /><br />\\"Why?\\"<br /><br />\\"Because don't all these period movies have actors with British accents?\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, yes.

B0058VW36U|4.0|the game is great but glitch needs to be fixed. it randomly exits out of the game back to my home screen. was worse when game was installed on tue phones memory but helped a little when i moved it to the sd card. I have the droid 2.2.2 Other than that the game is awesome!!
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|This is an addictive and fun game. The only problem is that as you reached the higher level, the goals became impossible to fulfill. Finally, I unistalled. I did enjoy it a lot before that though.
B004H8GM3K|5.0|A must read for leaders and operators being deployed.  This incident led to the development of the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines to help reduce \\"preventable\\" deaths in combat.  Check out MSG Paul Howe's (US Army, Ret) book Leadership and Training For The Fight.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|looks good and works without any setting changes on the xoom. a major plus is it has user levels and additional levels that we can download. also if you are creative you can even create your own levels and share them with friends. that's cool. fun game to play and I enjoyed playing it. one of those games that's better on a tablet than a phone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Awesome graphics and levels that keep you thinking. Perfect for passing time and being able to walk away if needed. Love it!
0786838655|2.0|The book starts out well, the hero, Percy Jackson, is introduced as an average American boy with problems. Then he starts having real problems with monsters no one else sees as he does. from there on, it is all down hill from one perspective, the surroundings are all normal except when percy gets involved with monsters, At this point time seems to halt, the ambience changes but only Percy notices this, the other normal characters, or even only spectators, see nothing abnormal; their senses are distorted into seeing events as normal occurrences and their accounts of what they have seen fit into what is normal and media accounts follow this line. In accordance with this method of writing, Percy's mother sacrifices herself for her child, and Percy winds up in a school for the Greek God's children. Now Riordan goes wild, he starts bringing in Greek myths and their characters. He has a lot to choose from. Greek mythology is ripe, there is the Iliad, the Odyssey, Hercules and his seven labors, Perseus and Medusa, Jason and the Golden Fleece, hundreds, if not thouands, and I have no idea how many Rick Riordan has brought up in his books. Still, a good way to introduce a classical education.       Percy is given a quest and in the pursuit of it his father, the god, Poseidon, reveals himself. Other Gods come tripping in, to show their character, at least those who have revealed themsxleves to the school Percy is now attending. He has been kicked out of six other schools in six years, now it is reveaked whym it is because he is this god's son. Superman sprouts, Psercycan call on his father for help when necessary, and the battle between the gods and the Titans is mentioned. It seems there is to be a resumption of it, the old gods want to be reborn and become top dog. artifacts are stolen under unbelievable circumstances, wrong people are accused, and war seems imminent. But hold on, Percy to the rescue. The artifacts are recovered and returned to their possesors, by Percy andfalse accusations are dropped. The story ends with Percy discovering the true thief and things smooth out. Now it is time for the second book.
0143034901|5.0|I'm always in the market for inexpensive, yet interesting books, and this one looked like it would fit the bill. I'll admit that I found it a little slow to get started, but I'm glad that I persevered and continued to read; a lot of great books start out slow, and this was no exception! It wasn't long before I was embroiled in the lives and loves of the characters, and began seeing parallels between certain characters. I loved how the city was painted, and how the individual characters were portrayed. I found the plot to be riveting, and once I was about a quarter of a way into the book, I found it nearly impossible to put down. I have recommended this book to many of my friends who in turn have read and enjoyed the book. Kudos to the author - I will be seeking out his other works in the near future!
B001G9LV9S|5.0|Disc 1 is the original album.  The mixing is spacial and really quite perfect, whether or not it's the same as the single-disc 2000 remaster.   Tea For The Tillerman is a truly beautiful album in its own right, but the compilation of live tracks on disc 2 make this the one to get.  They are fantastic.  Coming with a chunky liner notes/lyrics booklet and dust cover, these deluxe editions are the way to go.  If you don't have the album already, don't think twice about which edition to get.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|My eleven-year-old daughter and I are total Gleeks. We love this show so much. We like the actors, but we especially love the singing and dancing. My daughter wishes she could be part of that new reality show The Glee Project, where they are having tryouts to pick a new character for Glee, that's how much she likes it. All her friends love this show, too.<br /><br />My daughter and I watch the shows live on TV, and then when the full season is released, we've bought the DVD's for both Season 1 and 2, and also some downloads of the music alone.<br /><br />As an adult, my personal favorite on the show is Jane Lynch as mean coach Sue Sylvester. That actress is so funny! I went looking for her after seeing her on Glee and got [[ASIN:B002RSDW80 Julie & Julia]] because she was in it. Meryl Streep plays Julia Child, and Jane plays Julia's sister. She's great in that, too.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|Free apps are no longer free if they require modification of settings that were previously acceptable. I love this dev and this app has evolved into a great purchase at any price.

B0034G4ORC|3.0|I read the bad reviews but every time I saw the trailers I just had to see this movie. Unfortunately, the bad reviews were right. It had so much potential. Great action, great special effects, a good premise. Where it failed was a bad story and the action was literally non-stop. You never really got to know the characters. You had glimpses into the main character, the Staff Sgt., but that was about it. I have to mention though, why is he still a Staff Sgt? He's been in the military a long time, he should be a higher rank by now. The majority of the movie centers around this Staff Sgt and a group of Marines sent in to rescue civilians while being under attack from aliens. As much action as there was, I actually started to get bored. It was just one action scene after another of shooting & things being blown up. After awhile you kept waiting for something different to happen. Maybe if we knew the characters better it would have added a level of suspense since you would feel more of a connection. This was definitely a disappointment. It could have been a great movie but it turned out to just be a mindless action movie of stuff getting blown up.

B001RXB4FY|5.0|Wow ! A breathe of fresh air long needed in the metal community. Volbeat brings us an amazing array of musical genre all blended together into some hard driven rock. The big difference in this band is the vocals  for once in long time we have someone actually singing not yelling, not screaming, not shouting, actually singing and a great vocalist he is. This sets it apart for me. This band is fun giving you a little taste of everything but allways returning to the hard driving rifts of rock.    Its no small wonder that they are continuing to build up a reputation in the music world. Every release is a guaranted keeper. Not only are the cd's great but this band is a rush to see live. If they come around to your neck of the woods go out and see them. You wont regret it. Volbeat may not be the anwser to everyone especially the far right hard metal fans or speed metal heads but if you give them a try they could be. Thanks Volbeat for being so rocking and especially bringing the fun back into it. I love driving to Volbeat I just have to keep an eye on the speedometer when I do.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is a super page turner i could NOT stop reading it. I hope Jay Asher writes more books like this :]
030726999X|2.0|I had such hopes for this series after the joy of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, but it may have been merciful that the series ends at three. The first novel was positively Hitchcockian, with its gray moodiness and flashes of action and proof that escapist stories can still shine with craftsmanship. The second was a mess that only Michael Bay could love, an endless stream of absurd fights, cheap Dan Brown-style cliffhangers and characters whose quirks became inhuman. This third entry felt like little more than a long and slow epilogue to The Girl Who Played With Fire. A healthy early chunk of the book is spent ploddingly recapping the second. The meat of it plays out in the straightest and narrowest of lines: bad guys plot lazily, good guys out-think them and evil is thwarted in an emotionless climax. I suspect Larsson was planning to use this novel as a transition, tying up loose ends and setting a clean emotional table for the fourth novel. Despite the news that his partner is cleaning up his work on a fourth (or possibly fifth) story, I'm checking out now.
1582701709|5.0|Wow! After reading some of the reviews of this book, I'm astounded that anyone would try to discredit something that costs about $12, requires nothing more than reading and thinking, and offers inspiration.    For me the movie has been empowering and uplifting. I haven't read the whole book, but what I've seen so far is more of the same -- empowering and uplifting. I always feel great after reading or watching material created by the producers of the Secret. I believe its principles. They work for me. I don't have to justify or prove that to anyone.    No one is forcing people to believe the Secret, or to buy products related to the Secret. The movie is available for DVD rental which is a very low cost. The books are less than $20. The books and movie are most likely available to borrow from public libraries for free. The Secret web site has a tremendous amount of information (including inspirational videos) for free. People can watch the movie, read one of the books, or browse the web site, and then decide for themselves if it's something they want to pursue.    I think some of the reviewers of this book are wasting a lot of time and energy arguing about it. If they spent their time in more positive pursuits, they might actually benefit from the principles of the Secret. :-)
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I didn't think a younger actor could follow Tenant and make the role equally his own, but Smith surprised me.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Am in the process of watching this now. So far--I love it. [As with the first 4 seasons.]I would have liked an episode guide like the one included in the 3rd season. This entire show is great! Find it hard to stop watching so stay up too late. [Want to know what is going to happen next!]
B004X8W42M|5.0|Most biographies are filled with self serving BS. You won't find any of that in this book. Ozzy's honesty is very refreshing. This book is a joy to read. I found out rather shocking things about Ozzy, warts and all. It is wonderful  to read about someone who doesn't have a pretentious bone in his body!     Don't get me wrong, Ozzy is no saint, but he is brutally honest about his life, feelings and flaws, This is such a rare quality in the members of the human race these days, especially if that person is putting out a book about him or herself.       Ozzy did some awful things in his life and had the guts to expose them. He could have easily left out some of the more shocking things that he has done out of his book  but he didn't. I don't know for sure, but I don't think he included these details to ease his inner demons. I think he included the more terrible things in this book  as a warning to the reader.    People can say horrible things about Ozzy and most of them would be true, but I don't think anyone can deny that he deep down he has a lovely heart.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|I really loved this Disney movie it has a great story. I don't have a favorite scene in the movie i like all of scenes. The bonus scene was awesome. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|Excellent storyline and exceptional acting. This series is as good as The Good Wife. I look forward to seeing more episodes.
0385335989|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books in this series. I just finished Book 4 \\"Drums of Autumn\\" and think it really didn't live up to the previous books. There were parts of this book that were wonderful, but it tended to wander off track. Several chapters could have been deleted entirely and it wouldn't have hurt the overall story. Toward the end, I started skimming a bit because things just seemed to move too slowly -- the whole episode with the Mohawks was entirely unnecessary and really off track. I think I will take a break before tackling the next three installments.

B0000047CX|5.0|Este cd , realizado en 1964, es un testimonio vivo del revolucionario ritmo que invadi&oacute; America por esos a&ntilde;os y cuya cuna, Rio de Janeiro (Brasil), ha legado una serie de temas musicales imperecederos donde la inventiva del gran compositor Antonio Carlos Jobim brilla en toda plenitud.<br />Stan Getz, legendario saxofonista norteamericano y los esposos Gilberto (Joao y Astrud) nos deleitan con una serie de temas cl&aacute;sicos de este embriagante ritmo como \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\", \\"Desafinado\\", \\"Corcovado\\", \\"O Grande Amor\\" donde escuchamos m&uacute;sica delicada, posesiva, cautivadora y que sigue embelezando a medio mundo.<br />Escuhar la interesante, profunda y cautivadora voz de Joao Gilberto es toda una experiencia. La restauraci&oacute;n sonora de esta producci&oacute;n es realmente excelente. Disfrutemos de este maravillosos disco.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|I remember playing a similar game on iPhone, and it was one of my favorites. The controls are a little sluggish, but what's great about this app is that you can tweak them. Also, you have full control over Open Feint, so you can log out if you don't want to be connecting over the Internet. Such a great feature that other games tend to hide.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played on a phone. Great graphics, clean UI, Scoreloop integration,  genius puzzles, and music that gets stuck in your head...what more can you ask for?
B004H6YVDK|5.0|This book was not what I expected, but I was far from disappointed.  The book runs the gamut of every emotion and leaves one laughing and crying.  I was quite pleased with the book and I think the author did a great job.
B0054JURZA|1.0|Justin seems to be attempting to express profound emotions here, but I can hardly relate to them given the over-synthesized production of the music that accompanies his lyrics.  There's just nothing authentic that escapes from his endured falsettos, and these, paired with his painfully slow and mellow instrumentals, provide for a very confused combination.  These tracks sound more like .midi computer files than anything I'd seek out for listening pleasure.  What pitifully self-indulgent drivel.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|Beyonce's voice sounds as good as she ever has, I just wish she had better songs on this one.  It's very, very slow and that's not always a bad thing.  But \\"4\\" just drags and drags.  And I still can't stomach \\"Run The World\\".  Better luck next time, Bey.  I'll still go to the concert if she tours, though.
0060936223|5.0|As someone who saw Patti Smith perform, as well as read her poetry, a number of times in the early '70s, and having had a general familiarity with Robert Mapplethorpe, this book was a must-read. It didn't disappoint, both in terms of story and the quality of the writing. I felt as if I was with them, sharing their struggles to define what types of artists they would become, as well as the ever-present realities of dealing with rejection, and coping with financial survival. As Mapplethorpe slowly became exclusively gay, they parted as a romantic couple. Their friendship, though evolving, always remained important to both of them. More than anything else, this book is a testament to the value of true, committed friendship, and a tribute to Smith's devotion, to the moment he succumbed to AIDS. Lucky the person who can say they have a friend as true as Patti Smith.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|It wasn't a surprise this movie was bad, it was surprising just how bad it could be.  The script seemed like it was written by a 13 year old, and the direction is ridiculous.  To say it's stupid is such an understatement.  How does a wooden boat sink?  How does a sword stick into a marble column?  How does a knife sever a 2 foot thick stalactite?  They turned a hero into a grumpy juice-head, they threw in a gratuitous \\"strong female character,\\" and the so called story is the minimum amount of dialog to string together over the top, silly fight scenes.    Supporting actors did a good job acting their parts, but when your part is written like crap, directed like crap, and edited to be a steamy pile of crap it doesn't help that they have strong supporting actors (many of which have about three lines).    Don't watch this movie.  All it will do is upset and disappoint you.
B0034G4P8U|3.0|Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a stupid summer movie, but it is a huge improvement over the last film in the series and features some of the best CGI ever. The story is oh so familiar, you know, giant robots from outer space fighting the other space robots that have taken a liking to the human race. This time we learn about a secret 1969 mission to the moon that had to do more with stealing alien technology than just the accomplishment of the landing on a moving space rock before the Russians.<br /><br />Like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, this is a long movie (nearly 3 hours with previews) and you will definitely feel the length. As great as the visuals are, director Michael Bay never lets up in the last hour and it becomes a draining experience. But hey, there is some beautiful destruction as the robots demolish Chicago. Not to mention that the fight scenes are shot well enough to tell who is fighting who.<br /><br />The cast is huge and they do a good enough job, though most of the dialogue, as expected in a Michael Bay film, is very weak. I will admit that some of the jokes landed this time around. Shia LaBeouf was less annoying here than in the previous two and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replaced Megan Fox with ease. She looked good and her character's personality was way more likeable. Not bad for a Victoria's Secret models first acting role. Francis McDormand added a bit of believability to all the stupidity, while John Turturro, John Malkovich and Ken Jeong provided plenty of weirdness. At least they seemed to be having fun, but we all know the real stars of the series are the robots. We get a bunch of new ones and the old favorites. Leonard Nimoy provided excellent voice work for the former Autobot leader (I loved the Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan reference).  Hugo Weaving still gives Megatron the right amount of ferocity, but the standout, as in the previous two movies, is Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. His voice adds a quality of strength and compassion to an already noble character. When he is not talking, let's just say that Optimus does not mess around in this one.<br /><br />I tried to see it in IMAX 3-D. To my disappointment the theater was only showing it in digital 3-D, so I went with that after reading that 3-D is the only way to see it. I was very impressed. Probably the best since Avatar. I noticed almost no blurring and the picture was crystal clear.<br /><br />To my surprise, half the theater clapped when it was over and that rarely happens. As for myself, I wasn't expecting what I predict The Dark Knight Rises will deliver next summer. It's a good summer movie that never pretends to be anything more. The CGI is worth admission alone, but there are a number of good laughs, more action than anything in existence and the moon landing sequence might trick you into believing that you won't lose as many brain cells as you did with Revenge of the Fallen, but don't worry, they will be gone forever by the time the end credits role.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 starseady noble character.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|I purchased \\"4\\" today.  Prior to today, you could describe me as a casual Beyonce fan.  I've always appreciated her music and her talent, but from a distance.  I purchased B-Day Deluxe Edition and the Destiny's Child #1's CD recently for no other purpose but to expand my music collection.  However, after listening to \\"4\\" practically non-stop today, my status as a Beyonce fan has risen from casual to obsessive.  This is an outstanding CD.  As other reviews have pointed out, her singing is sensational throughout.  The quality and attention to detail of the production and instrumentation is superb.  My top five favorite tracks in no particular order are: 1+1; I Care; I Miss You; Party; Rather Die Young.  My only complaint (a minor one at best) is the brevity of I Miss You, perhaps my favorite track on the CD.  This song is simply too good, too intoxicating, too appealing to be only 2:59 minutes long.  I want the ecstacy to last, and last, and last.    Buy this CD and savor its deliciousness!  Beyonce is incomparable.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|Sedaris' descriptions of his pathetic attempts at various endeavors throughout his life made me laugh out loud.  Everyone shares similar experiences of failure and the sense of inadequacy, and Sedaris makes his incredibly funny.  I loved the descriptions of his crazy family members, especially his parents.  His description of learning French is realistic to me since it was my college minor.  I've sat in that same chair.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|This is a great game for people who need to work on fine moter skills, you can increase the tilt sensivity as you get better control.<br />As for the price, how do you price something, do you charge by time of initial writing, by upkeep, or poularity?<br />I don't know about others but i would pay more for something i enjoyed and/ or benefitted from.
B004G600A4|5.0|Good movie. I got it for niece to watch, it was her favorite for like a week. My favorite part is when she is feaking out that it's the best day in her life and than immediately into being the worst day of her life.
B000VKW7AK|4.0|Disc one was my favorate disc on warchest it was composed of songs from \\"killing is my buisiness and buisiness is good\\",  \\"Piece sells but who's bying\\", \\"So far so good so what\\", and \\"Rust in piece\\" all of the rust in piece songs on this disc were demo's except for hanger 18 this disc also had a session take of anarchy/problems which was very good. The casey mckagin version of holy wars was prety cool though i liked the origional better, but it was very cool to have the dark themes recording before you heard holy wars it aded a sence of insit. They also did a cover of alice coopers no more Mr.Nice guy which was pretty good to.  Disc two was very cool as well this was composed of songs from \\"cowntdown to extinction\\" and \\"Youthenasia\\" the songs \\"Skin o my teeth\\", \\"High speed dirt\\", \\"Ashes in your mouth\\" and \\"sweating bullets\\" were live at the Cow Palace and they were very well preformend i enjoyed those as well as the \\"Breakpoint\\" session take. The cover song on this disk was Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\". \\"Keeping score\\" was another dave mustaine interviw leading to \\"symphony of destruction\\" which added more insit like on the first disc.  Disc three was definintly mey least favorate disc of all of them though it was very good it was composed of songs from \\"Youthenasia\\", \\"Cryptic writings\\" and \\"Risk\\" which was Megadeths worst time for songs but of course everything Megadeth is great this just wasnt as great it had a cover of \\"duke Nukem\\" and \\"Never say die\\" they were alright i believe there were also songs from \\"the system has failed\\" on this disc as well but not very many.   Disc four was the live audio cd which was pretty good the only problem i had was david ellefson's bass mix was way to quite it was recorded in 1990 so they were just releasing there fourth album \\"Rust in piece\\" at the time so dont be suprised when i say no \\"symphony of destruction\\" no \\"trust\\" and no \\"a toute le monde\\" though all those songs are on disc two and three.  Disc five was the live dvd alsohad nothing more than the material from the first four albums being recorded in 1992 however it was an incredible show though it skiped spaces inbetween songs so you couldnt conect with the audience so much but thats ok it was a good show dave mustaines guitar was a little to low in the mix but you could still hear him perfectly it was great.  overall i give it a four out of five it was worth the purchase i would have pyed a bit more for another disc and it could have used another disc with songs like \\"Rust in piece ... Polarous\\", \\"Mary jane\\", \\"Mechanix\\", and \\"99 ways to die\\" I didnt expect it to have the songs \\"dawn patrol\\" \\"My creation\\" or \\"poisen was the cure\\" though it would have been really cool to have them another disc with these and a few more on it would have mad it the perfect megadeth purchase keep in mind endgame was not out when this was released so there will be no \\"head crusher\\"
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Love this movie. I was super happy that I could pre-order it as well so I didn't have to worry about picking it up on this date because it was going to be cheaper to buy it on the first day.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|At first I didn't recognize this story when I got the book for my nephew recently, but I later realized it was based on a holiday cartoon special I had seen as a child on PBS (But I didn't think I cared for it as a child because of the unsatisfying ending...talk about a CLIFF-HANGER; it totally left me at a loss!). Today, however, it has grown on me and I think it is one of my favorite holiday specials of alltime! I seem to remember PBS introducing it as \\"Frosty the Snowman\\"...<br /><br />  Frankly I didn't remember much of the film as a child except the fact that the snowman had a huge impact on me and I was soo touched by his special friendship with the boy...I don't think I watched the movie all the way thru until recently but I totally remember the ending. I knew what was going to happen when James awakens to the sun shining the day after his magical night with his special friend the snowman, and my heart was breaking as I watched him making a beeline outside to find that all that remains of his beloved friend has become a puddle, a hat, a scarf and some pieces of coal...(still makes me weep). When he melted, I felt like I had lost a best friend...I felt/ feel like he had become my friend, as well as James's. The Snowman had totally captured my heart!<br /><br />  What is truly interesting is getting other peoples perspectives on what I initially considered a tragic story. My nephew saw the movie with his first grade class and he is just as sensitive as me and he claimed he didn't think it was sad at all, and that nobody else cried. They all loved it...as a child I loved the snowman but couldn't stand to watch the ending.<br /><br /> I just watched the Snowman movie again all the way through and it is delightful. I laughed and I cried. It is definately a favorite. I am SO GLAD that James runs back and hugs the snowman when they say goodnight...I think that is soo important. It reminds us to live every moment as though it were our last and not take loved ones for granted...you never know when it will be the last time you will see them.<br /> First time I saw the movie, at the end, I misunderstood about the scarf James is holding. I thought he was holding up the snowman's green plaid scarf to remember him by--which is truly sorrowful--when in fact it is the blue snowman scarf Father Christmas gave him on their trip to the North Pole. The significance is that it proved the adventures of the night before were not a dream after all. Love, love, love!! This is one of the BEST movies of all times. It triggers so many different emotions. Check out the bleak godforsaken whiteness surrounding James and the remains of his beloved snowman--you can feel the desolation. It makes your skin crawl. If I could change one thing I'd change the ending. I'd have the snowman go to the North Pole with Frosty.<br /> For all you snowman fans, be sure to check out the official website: [...] (they won't let me post the address here but google The Snowman and you should be able to find it)!<br />Also, I watched Father Christmas. James and the Snowman make a second trek to the North Pole to meet up with Santa Claus again!! I was sooo overjoyed!!! Obviously, the snowman is still alive LOL.it will be the last time you will see them.   First time I saw the movie, at the end, I misunderstood about the scarf James is holding.

0553801503|1.0|Unless you have a lot of time to kill and are incredibly bored, simply read a summary of A Feast for Crows online.  It will be more enjoyable and a better use of your time.    The book goes on and on about plot points that seem irrelevant, especially with newer characters.  There's no progress in any of the key plotlines that readers are interested in from the previous book (especially Games of Thrones), nor is there really any ray of light of hope that there will be progress or anything will get any better for them.   Many important characters in the series don't even appear in Crows and are replaced with characters that seem irrelevant and unnecessary.    It feels like the series has stalled out and GRRM is stringing the series along with filler until he gets to the final book.

B00026WU7I|5.0|I was not so much of a fan of Bob Dylan when he first began to record.  He was the local kid.  The Stones & Deep Purple were more exciting.  I Decided to go back & check him out.  I was amazed at the wry wisdom of the social commentary & the very human condition, as well as the pleasure in the music.  Bobby was the first \\"rapper\\", he mostly talked his lyrics, rather than melodiously singing.  There was a melody in his compositions which he often ignored. Leo Kottke described his own voice as \\"geese farts on a foggy day\\", but I think the description perfectly suits Bobby's singing.   Good stuff, I will continue to add more Dylan to my music library.  Now that I think about it, I will also check into Leo Kottke again.  Dylan is a good investment in all respects for the diverse, thoughtful collector.  His music perfectly reflects the times in which it was written.  If you are young and want to know what was really going on during the 60s& 70s, way back then, listen to Bobby, not the Beatles.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|This movie was Great! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. You could feel the brotherhood of the men, it was so real in the emotion, that you forget that this is a \\"Sci-Fi\\" movie and you focus on the characters and there mission. I am going to watch it again just to see the things I missed the first time. 100 times better than Independence Day... Just an all around Awesome movie!!!!
1594744769|5.0|working at a small-town bookstore gives me the opportunity to \\"preview\\" books.  I was instantly intrigued by the pictures.  I did not expect the story line that followed.  After picking up the book, I found a loved one in a hospital. Having nothing else to do but play the waiting game, I found myself tearing through this book.  It was such a lovely storyline.  I think this is the only book I would like to see in film.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome game, great music and beautiful smooth graphics. I love it! Great replay value and game gets quite complex and fun! Addicting and beautiful, if you like puzzles and relaxing zen type games you will love it. One of the best games on Android now! very impressed by the whole package. Looks amazing on my Galaxy S Captivate. Ultimate puzzler, highly recommend to everyone.

0439023521|5.0|YA post-apocalyptic world where kids are forced to fight each other to the death in amped up Gladiator-like games with better technology.  Need I say more?  Oh wait, there's also great writing, well-paced suspense, and endearing characters who show room for growth and development.<br /><br />Collins takes us to some point in the dark future or alternate reality where North America is instead known as Panem with a Capitol and 13 districts.  The districts eventually rebelled until the Capitol squashed them and completely destroyed District 13.  After the rebellion the Capitol established the Hunger Games, a sick and twisted annual \\"game\\" where each of the remaining 12 districts hold \\"reapings\\" to randomly select 1 boy and 1 girl (the \\"tributes\\") to fight to the death, televised in a huge outdoor arena, until 1 tribute remains.  The Capitol cruelly forces everyone to celebrate the Games as a festivity to add further humiliation and to remind all of the districts how they are totally at the mercy of the Capitol.<br /><br />Hunger Games follows the main character Katniss Evergreen (ugh to name), a 16 year-old girl who lives in District 12, who is pushed into the world of the Hunger Games.  Like any good heroine, Katniss is smart and resourceful with absentish parents and several potential love interests.  While Katniss' world is bleak and grim, she's managed to carve out an interesting and manageable life that readers can take pleasure in reading and imagining, all while remaining in the safety and comfort of lush in comparison homes.  Collins has created a survivor character we can live vicariously through and root for, while keeping her from being a total emotional zombie by adding Prim and Gale (and later, other characters tied to the Hunger Games) to the mix.<br /><br />When you pick up Hunger Games, be sure to do it when you have free time over the next few days because as soon as you finish it you will be on to the next one, and then the one after that, and then you'll be sad that the series is over but glad to not have to wait on a cliffhanger for a year as you wait for the next book (Bah - I'm looking at you Alchemyst series!).series is over but glad to not have to wait on a cliffhanger for a year as you wait for the next book (Bah - I'm looking at you Alchemyst series!).

B004K4AUZW|5.0|This album is by far my favorite Lady Gaga CD yet. It does vary from her preious music a bit, but I would go as far as to say that it is an improvement when compared to her previous albums. My personal favorites were You and I, Marry the Night, and The Edge of Glory. A must-have for all Lady Gaga fans!
B003UESJHO|1.0|I found it so tiring having to wade hip deep through an endless litany of the F word......  The film presents ((((((ugliness)))))) at its height in terms of humanity.  The only bright presence in all of this was Wahlberg's character who seemed to reach above the muck  I feel genuinely sorry for Lowell if this is the best they can produce........  I found the characters in The Town much more interesting and sympathetic than any in The Fighter.  I realize it received NUMEROUS accolades but to say it presented any sort of redeeming value would be putting it mildly  I realize my opinion means nothing but I felt the need to comment here.

0307887960|2.0|Went on the diet with my spouse. After 4 days on the attack phase, I started to have some redness on my feet and a left swollen foot.   I slammed the break on the experiment right away. I was OK with it until then. I was was on vacation and it was easy no to have carbs. However, due to my inflammation issue I went straight back to eating veggies, cut down eggs and sea food and most meat. Had quality fish oil, turmeric caps, wild blueberries, cinnamon and lots of other anti-oxydants I basically had to throw the kitchen sink at this inflammation as I had to go back to work three weeks later. It tok a bit over 2 weeks to get right 100% of any signs of inflammation. I am stil on a diet but I am using a beter approach (for myself). Oat bran, beans, brown rice, olive oil,coconut oil,foods with anti-oxydants like : wild blueberries (frozen), turmeric, fish oil, etc, etc. along with plenty of veggie. Can't go any hire than 2 on this diet as I had a bad reaction to it. My spouse is doing fine other than the fact that she often needs to do some yoga-like contorsions here and there to squeeze out a bowel movement. The 3 table spoons of oat bran (great suggestion) are not enough. I give a two mostly because I lost that type of nervous craving I had for crabs at work under stress (muffin, etc.)    Just so you know, I don't suffere from arhtritis or any thing like that normally but a 4-5 days 100% proteins: eggs, ground meat, sea food, etc. was a lil' too much for my system. I do think that my alkaline balance got screwed real bad. Fortunatelly, I knew how to bring it back up pretty quick. GIve it a shot and see for yourself.
B003XUKVXK|3.0|I found this show to be poorly recorded and flat.  KWS's tone is super weak and his playing isn't getting better --it is very muddled and lacking excitment.  I bought this along with the new Joe Bonamassa live disc and the JB show BLOWS this one away.  They are just not in the same league.  My three star is kind and reflective of all the pros that joined KWS on stage that made the disc listenabe.  This isn't even SRV lite, it is just kinda blah.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|One of the MOST underrated animated television series of all time in the history of american animation(and probably international animation.) From what I read, even though it received generally positive reviews from so called professional media critics and generally positive reviews from general audiences, it received no awards  for its sharp witty  writing, its , animation quality, the voice acting and many other animation subcategories that animated shows are usually nominated for, Despite being on a mainstream channel and despite how hugely popular the show was , even during the last final seasons of the show. So many other animated shows have received emmy awards and other  animation awards despite the poor animation quality , and the poor writing in the animated show , and just overall lacking in orginality.(Family Guy instantly comes to mind) . Daria was truly one of a kind and it is a damn shame that this show is not getting the level of recognition that it truly deserves.<br /><br />Echohing the air of cynicism that is often associated with generation-x culture and the grunge/riot girl culture of the early to mid 90's , the show Daria premiered in the late 90's during a time when boy bands and pop princess singers were reaching  toward the height of their popularity and when the grunge culture/riot girl culture often associated with the music subculture of generation-x, was declining in but ,apparently it still had a sizeable audience that the MTV execs thought it was worth the investment in the show. Because you know, they are all about quality programming as long as it they have a wide general audience.<br /><br />The character Daria is an introverted , cynical intelligent teenager , who has cynicism that is so sharp, I suspect that it can cut through Wolverine adamantium anatomy :) who doesn't change anything about her personality and who is practically comfortable in her own skin, despite outside pressures placed on her directly(her mother persuading herto associate with more popular students) and the people in her environment that cover larger surroundings she does not indirectly interact with.  She is also an aspiring writer who is into writing short stories . She doesn't start to manifest her , \\"inner demons\\" for a lack of an appropriate word until season 5 in the episode Boxing Daria, that explains the root causes of why she is so anti-social  . She has a partner in crime name Jane lane who she meets at Lawndale high school in her self-esteem class,  who also shares her level of cynicism and who is an aspiring artist  but is a tadbit more social than Daria(initially firsts one of the two to have a boyfriends, joins the track team,  contemplates becoming a cheerleader) , but at the end of the day, she marches to her own drum, just like Daria.<br /><br />A spin off of Beavis and Butthead, Daria and her family moved to Lawndale at a generic high school. Beavis and Butthead isn't referenced directly at all in this show and the indirect references that they receive are VERY subtle , that the audience will not understand the references unless they previously watched Beavis and Butthead. She has a mother who is a lawyer who is obsessed with work but who tries to keep tabs on both of her daughters lives despite doing a poor job of it, and a father name Jake who is kinda neurotic , and barely seemingly doesn't know whats going on in their family affairs half the time who recollects past events of his father perpetuating abuse on him as a child at military school.  Then when have her seemingly self-absorbed , fashion obsessed, boy crazy sister quinn who feels she is forced to had her real intelligence and portrays herself to be less intelligence than she actually is because of deep seated insecurity issues and her low self esteem. She secretly doesn't like the crowd she chose to associate with, and  has confessed that her \\"friends\\" vapid and shallow on a few occassions, for the sake of maintaining her popularity statusand conformity for her own survival sake.<br /><br />There are a menagerie of other wonderful characters that are both exaggerated high school stereotypes, and who don't really fit any high school stereotypes that I won't go into depth about, not because they are not important or interesting, but I want to cover more points about the series before I hit Amazon's word limit:)<br /><br />When I first watch Daria at age 14, I really haven't seen any tv show like it before(nor have I really seen a show like it since)  and was instantly hooked. Its  refreshing to see a main  character in a teenage oriented television series who isn't obsessed with being popular or who are popular mary sue type characters who are perfect at everything with everyone in every situation they are in.  Its also very refreshing to see main characters not be in a  relationship with a different character every week or the plot center around JUST around sex and the dynamics of that relationship or in Daria's fortunate case, not centered around boyfriend/girlfriend relationships very little(meaning , not most of the time.) . Yes, Daria had a crush , and she didn't formally acquire a boyfriend until the last season ,  but that wasn't the main focus of the show. The main focus of the show was seeing how daria perceived the chaotic world around her, and the personality of an introvert like daria, and how the people in her surroundings perceived her and her continuing development as the seasons of the show progress.<br /><br />Just as Daria was an oasis in her town and at her high school amidst a sea of what she perceived as cultural decadence and mindless conformity, the series daria is the oasis of teen oriented shows. It is now 2011 and I started watching this show in 2002 , and it has aged very well for me and I would consider buying the DVD , if they had the original music on the show and I wasn't such a slave to free stuff.MTV has seemingly completely eliminated all programming targeted towards the small  counter culture audience they had and replaced it with mind evaporating tv programming , that ironically would have been satirized on Daria. It would be like some of the characters foils on Daria getting their own spin off shows for MTV's current programming.<br /><br />Would love to see the show be resurrected, and see how Daria would operate in a social setting in a corporate controlled environment.
0316056863|2.0|I hoped  this would be a genuine memoir, but I went through this book in less than an hour as it was revealed as something she had to suffer through as opposed to something she wanted to do. The writing was disjointed, uninformative, and generally a collection of small events that she'd stretch into a chapter and admittedly -- pad -- to meet the word count. Just look at the sidebars and scripts she plugged in there...  It was painful to read unamusing anecdotes that had little or no point. For real comedy autobiographies, read Steve Martin's Born Standing Up or, for more laughs, Jay Leno's Leading With My Chin. Infinitely better.

B0050LJIRK|1.0|i actually bought this album on the basis of all the good feedback i read, only to find the idea of limp bizkit to these fans is correct and i was extremely confused when three dolla bill came out. it comes to mind what is this band thinking great talent but the frontman fred durst or as he now is called the polar bear, is a joke that pre pubescent excuse for effort as a vocalist or writer of lyrics is sickening. i would much rather listen to brian welchs attempt to move on after korn. not to mention it seems like they put more talent into the artwork of the album than its music.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This gritty, updated version of James Bond is the most exciting of all of the Bond films to date -- and I've seen them all. References to two of the greatest of the Bond movies, \\"Goldfinger\\" and \\"Thunderball,\\" only add to the pleasure of \\"Casino Royale.\\" Judi Dench is superb as M, and Mads Mikkelson is a terrific, relatively subtle villain. The character of Bond grows and changes -- a miracle in itself -- bringing believability into the fantasy mix. I recently purchased a new copy for myself, since I'd \\"worn out\\" my old CD with frequent handling, along with another as a gift for my brother, who likewise loves this new Bond vision.

1594202710|4.0|In \\"On China\\", former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger paints a broad picture of Chinese history, from the three kingdoms period through to the voyage of British agent McCartney, the Boxer rebellion, the cultural revolution and the current day. The greatest focus is on the opening up of relations and the second half of the text could almost be called \\"History of Kissinger-China relations\\", but that does reflect Kissinger's important historical role.    Early in the book, to demonstrate the differences between Chinese and western strategic thinking, Kissinger compares chess to wei qi, known in the west by its Japanese name \\"Go\\". Chinese strategic thinking, as stressed in the writings of Sun Tzu, does not stress absolute mastery, which is the name of the game in chess. Chess is a game with a clear victor and a clear winner, where total domination of the other player is the key. It ends when the opposing king meets the grim reaper. By contrast, wei qi is a game of subtle victories, with a lot of close matches where a game has a slight winner, but barely. In addition, the strategic priority in chess is to gain control of territory with the pieces already on board -- everything is explicit. In wei qi, which translates as \\"game of surrounding pieces\\", strategy is to be found in the pieces not yet placed on the board. Chess matches begin with a struggle for control of the center of the board and for the elimination of enemy pieces in head-on clashes; Wei Qi players move into empty pieces to mitigate the strategic potential of their adversaries. Quoting Kissinger \\"Chess produces single-mindedness; wei qi generates strategic flexibility.\\"    This leads into Kissinger's analysis of historical Chinese geopolitical strategy. Tradition in China was to rarely directly militarily engage enemies, instead preferring subterfuge. The strongest army was the army that never needed to fight. The strategy with respect to the barbarians surrounding China was to play \\"barbarian againstbarbarian\\", a narrative Kissinger implied continues through to the present day.    Playing barbarian against barbarian was a strategy that worked for China due to its historical position of strength. Its emperor was ruler of \\"all under heaven\\" and trade with other countries was contextualized in terms of tribute to the emperor - an ideology which meant an absence of trade with Japan. This strategy would near its end with increasing trade with the west, particularly Britain. China viewed Britain as a \\"far barbarian\\", an offense to Britain. Britain was not allowed an embassy in China as horizontal state to state relations would be an offense to Chinese state ideology. Trade with China was limited to a single port. After the opium wars (opium being the one western import that was immensely successful in the Chinese market), trade with China was expanded to six ports, and embassies were allowed. Not wanting to give advantage to Britain, they gave the same deal to other imperial powers hoping to spur competition. The Chinese court concluded that playing barbarian against barbarian was the wise choice, and that they should play France and America against Britain. However, they had no real means to make that happen. What would follow was a \\"century of humiliation\\", including the Boxer rebellion and the occupation of Manchuria, whereby China was consistently subject to the will of foreign powers. There were individuals in the Chinese court pleading change, but conservative forces would consistently win out. Plans for military and technological catch-up to the west were rejected on the basis that \\"China would no longer be China\\". At some point, I'd like to better understand why China fell prey to conservatives and oligarchy whereas Japan underwent the Meiji restoration and industrialized? This is not explained by Kissinger. As I read the anecdtoes of the incompetence of 19th century Chinese leadership, I could not help but think of the current American leadership, whose priority is to maintain oligarchy at all costs, even at the expense of the future.    The ongoing humiliation of China, the boxer rebellion, the carving up of Chinese territory by Russia and Japan could only end in the complete eradication of the previous Chinese ruling class, and the rise of Mao Zedong (Kissinger's preferred spelling). Kissinger speaks approvingly of Mao, and all of his major actions except for the cultural revolution are spoken of with praise. All three of China's major wars since Mao: The Korean war, the Sino-Indian war, and the third Vietnam war, are portrayed as Chinese victories. In the Korean war, China shocked the world by entering the conflict, and achieved its goal of creating a Korean buffer state and not having Western troops on its border, of falling victim to the wei qi strategy of encirclement. In the Sino-Indian war, Kissinger spoke approvingly of how Mao was motivated by a previous conflict ~1000 years prior, when China deterred future Indian aggression. It would take over territory and give it back, and give back captured weapons, a successful move of preemptive deterrence, and since that time India has not dared attack China.    Interesting is the third Vietnam war (France and United States made up the first two). As recently as 1973, China and Vietnam had been allied, but the exit of the USA changed geopolitical considerations in the area. Vietnam, a historic Chinese vassal state, wanted to reunite all of Indochina, such an empire of ~100 million people under Ho Chi Minh would challenge regional Chinese hegemony. It signed a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 1978 or so, and China saw the risk of being encircled, a la wei qi. As such, in a move of aggressive deterrence, it invaded Vietnam, wiped out enemy forces at huge cost to its own forces, and then pulled out. Vietnam no longer had the means to create a united Indochina, and a mockery was made of the Soviet Union, who failed to live up to their treaty obligations. Surprisingly, this obvious victory for China is one that Kissinger states was perceived as a failure by the western media and strategic analysts at the time. Why? Kissinger laments the fact that the best alternative to keep Vietnam out of Cambodia was to align with the \\"execrable\\" Pol Pot.    The rise of the Sino-American alliance is presented in the book as being primarily a consequence of Soviet antagonism. China was recruiting the far barbarian (United States) to help fight the near barbarian (Soviet Union).  Sino-soviet relations began to sour in the Korean war, where Mao was upset at the lack of Soviet assistance. There were also frequent border clashes in China's north. Over time, Chinese propaganda began referring to the USSR as \\"revisionist\\" rather than \\"communist\\" or \\"socialist\\".    Kissinger does ask why rapprochement did not happen earlier. In the 1950s, it was impossible on the part of the USA because state department thinkers were embroiled in the debate of \\"who lost China\\", referring to the nationalist defeat at the hands of the communists. This led to soviet experts taking over the positions of intelligence command. In the 1960s, China was torn apart by the internal instability of the cultural revolution, an impact that Kissinger compares to the effect the second Vietnam war had on the sociology of the USA. Once both countries had settled down, and the issue of Soviet intimidation became to serious to ignore, the case for rapprochement became stronger and stronger. Kissinger also claims that Mao was hedging because he thought the Vietnam protests in the USA could unleash a revolution there -- this sounds hard to believe. It is also claimed he equated the timelines between 1918-1939 and 1945-1968, and thought another convulsion was around the corner.    I didn't pay as much attention in the sections dealing with 80s, 90s and early 2000s as I found them kind of dull. There was some brief discussion about the Chinese shock with respect to the negative world reactionfollowing Tienanmen square, they didn't get why the rest of the planet cared. Had I been more informed I might have been more captivated by the commentary that China is returning to Confucian values, rather than its post-revolutionary Marxist-Maoist ideological structure.    Forwarding to the future, Kissinger asks if China-US relations are under the same framework as Britain-Germany relations of 100 years prior. He brings up the Crowe memorandum of 1907, which concluded that Berlin-London antagonisms were inevitable and independent of behaviors and beliefs of their leaders. Kissinger realizes this may be the case but urges a different future. He points out that whereas European leaders in 1914 were unaware of the destructive potential of their weapons, the same is not true of current leaders and nuclear weapons. He urges the creation of a pacific community, much like the post-war atlantic community, so that Sino-US relations can be moved through the prism of a shared future rather than a competition. I wonder if he really means to endorse global government. It's a nice picture, but it seems all of these politics end with a rosy epilogue showcasing a vision of a possible bright future.    In an interview on TV I saw of Kissinger with respect to this book, he said that the concept of \\"China's rise\\", was a mislabel. China, he said, believes it has always been at the apex of civilization, and the period 1800-2000 or so is merely an exception to the historic norm. That is the impression I get from his text, and of Kissinger's view of China.
0670022411|5.0|One of my top ten books that I have read.  A necessary read; cannot wait for the next one!
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is a cool game, it's got exciting audio and good graphics too.  Fast-paced and simple to play, no need to read a 5 page handbook on controls LOL  Seems to be easy on battery and ram and my Droid X handles it easily.  Recommended!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This was really interesting book to read. It tells about the authors way to publicity and how he did it. He tells the facts of marketing and what worked for him and what did not work for him. He details how his sales went up with certain efforts so that the story was believable. he also explains how he targeted his books to certain target audience and how he was sure that he can make it the way he did.<br /><br />It was great that he liked to share his success stories with other people. I'm sure that all the independent writers and also main-streem published authors are eager to read this book.<br />What I was missing was that what is going to  happen next? He already had a great career in insurance field, and now he is a freelance writer, is there something else he plans to do next.

B004GYOQ6A|5.0|Was looking for a game my 3 year old could play.  It's a little complex at times on very easy due to narrow gaps, but I think he had fun with it as did I.  No excessive permissions, opted out of the social plugin.  Graphics are fun as the walls give a shift in perspective making a 3d feel as you look done.  Recommend for something to pick up and play quick without feeling like you have to play longer unless you want to.  Check it out while it's free!
B0041KKYBA|3.0|At face value, this is a pretty compelling documentary for a person who does not follow news events closely.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are up to speed on daily news and economics in your everyday life, there is nothing new here you don't already know.<br /><br />The only reason I give it three (3) stars is the film seems to be biased towards placing all the blame on Wall Street executives and gives many politicians and Washington a sort of pass on all the blame.<br /><br />The overall mantra of the film seems to be \\"Private Sector is Evil, and Only The Government Can Take Care Of You\\".<br /><br />A perfect example of this complaint ......<br /><br />In discussing the home mortgage crisis and how home prices got inflated when too much \\"easy money\\" was made available by way of red-line loans and Washington's grand idea of trying to make home ownership possible for everybody regardless of income or credit histories ---------- They interview BARNEY FRANKS of all people !<br /><br />They interview him as though he is a wise prophet on the matter when in fact we all know his contributions to the mess as part of Fannie and Freddie.<br /><br />So while the film does a good \\"Timeline\\" of how the financial sector has gone haywire, it seems to only blame the people working on Wall Street and places little accountability or responsibility on the heads of the folks and agencies in DC that are supposed to legally monitor this stuff.<br /><br />Remember .... Deregulation does NOT mean the government has no ability to monitor an industry to prevent fraud or corruption ---------- It simply means they don't have their hands in the daily operations of it  (ie .. Medicare & Medicaid for example, not that this runs without waste, slop or corruption either).<br /><br />So a good overview of the craziness that has taken finances down the wrong train track -- but weak in properly identifying those that have been the biggest culprits or shirked their duty of protecting US citizens
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|I also played the free trial and had fun with that. I'm glad Amazon decided to feature this game as their Free App of the Day.

1576754227|2.0|Brian Tracy (the author) is like your know-it-all relative who likes to pontificate at family functions. Most of what Tracy says is some combination of boring, obvious, and predictable.  Also, he's fond of citing dubious statistics at every turn (example: \\"Only 2% of people can work effectively without supervision\\".  Really, Brian?  Where did you get that factoid?).  \\"Eat that Frog!\\" does contain some valid advice -- but don't expect anything surprising, insightful, or new.  If you just need a kick in the pants to get going, you may find this book useful.  If you're looking for something beyond run-of-the-mill advice, look elsewhere.
B004GYOQ6A|3.0|Its okay. An okay game to maybe pay a buck or deal with ads in a lite version. But for $4 they're silly. Much less make it free app of the day. :p

B003H6KRIE|5.0|These movies are great and I love having them all together...and it was a great price...cheaper than buying sepertly at Walmart
B002RL7VKC|4.0|I bought this for my 2.5 year old, and he loves it.  He enjoys pulling the wagon and loading it with all sorts of goodies.  He has difficulty putting it together and requires his brother's help who is 4.5 years old.  It is great for fine motor skills and will grow with him over the next couple of years.  I am only giving it 4 stars simply because of his frustration of not being able to put every piece together himself.  He does really well on his own with most duplo legos, and I was expecting this to be no different.
0920668372|5.0|My dad read this to me, and now I read it to my daughter. I find it amazing that the little song in there, is sung differently by all parents who read it to their children. So everyone has this unique version of the song for themselves. Highly recommend it to all parents :)
1416972242|5.0|Clare has been able to create a amazing thrilling sequel to City of Bones.  In this Book Clary has to face more problems on top of everything that is already changing.  Learning more about the shadow world and shadowhunters.  Clare introduces new characters such as Maia, Maryse, Max and the Inquisitor.  There are many new twist that make this book thrilling.  I read this book in less then two days it was so good.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book starts with a unique and interesting concept. I liked the book, but I didn't love it and the reason is that II read this book about two weeks ago and I can barely remember the details.  I do believe a really good book should linger with you for a long, long time.  What I remember the most is the tie-in to war, Nazis, Jews, the photographs and how frustrating the main characters parents were. I felt that the action was contrived a bit too much and then, abruptly stops and necessitates a sequel.  I would not buy this book if I had to do it again.
1416955070|5.0|This book was fantastic, fun and exicting.  With twists making me not wanting to put the book down, I absolutly loved it.  My aunt told me she bought a book series that she read good reviews about, but she didn't have the time to read yet.  I didn't expect it to be very good but, within a week I finished it.  I instently fell in love with Clary and can very much relate to her.  I hope Cassandra Clare goes on to write more fantastic books just like City of Bones.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Lady Gaga can do no wrong! I love this new album! I love how she's always changing things up. It's not just the same music over and over again. The only bad thing about this CD is that it's edited! I wish they would release an explicit version. Other than that though, it's a winner! I would definitely recommend it!
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I bought the book in e so that I could reread it before I started the second volume in the series. I originally read it as a deadtree book. I don't remember that edition as being riddled with errors. The Kindle edition has too dang many mistakes for my taste. Words run together, paragraphing dropped, and enigmatic dotted underlinings with labels that read \\"[number] highlighting\\". If you're going to take my $$$ Gollanz, you could at least pay for a proofreader.
B00428ZRFY|4.0|This is a good album. The songs definitely make you want to dance. However, I hate the fact that it is edited. I still listen to it over and over though. I also wish I would've just gotten the regular edition because the only difference is a DVD. Maybe a more hard-core Rihanna fan would enjoy the DVD more but I just wasn't impressed. All-in-all it's a pretty good CD.
0553573403|5.0|The mass media tends to ignore fantasy stories, especially high fantasy stories. After all, they require actual imagination.<br /><br />But one of the few stories that has wormed its way into our consciousness -- partly because of the brilliant TV adaptation -- is George R.R. Martin's fantasy epic A Song Of Ice And Fire. And the first volume, \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" is a powerfully complex, gritty story, plenty of grime, blood and a tangle of convoluted plots and counterplots.<br /><br />The castle of Winterfell is thrown on its ear when King Robert Baratheon of Westeros arrives to ask Eddard Stark to be his Hand. But soon after he agrees, he receives a message from his mentor's widow, informing him that Queen Cersei's family, the Lannisters, are secretly plotting against the king -- and that they are killing off anyone who might be a threat to them.<br /><br />One of his younger sons is gravely wounded when he sees something shocking, and the acid-tongued dwarf Tyrion is framed for the crime. And across the Narrow Sea, exiled princess Daenerys Targaryen is wed to the barbarian lord Khal Drogo, so that her brother can invade Westeros and take back the throne. Daenerys quickly grows in strength and wisdom, but will pay a terrible price.<br /><br />And Eddard's illegitimate son Jon joins the Night's Watch near the Wall -- but has little idea of the horrors that are approaching. As Stark takes to his new duties, he begins investigating the death of his predecessor, and begins to uncover a shocking secret about the queen and her children. Treachery, death and war will be brought to Westeros, and a war will begin with the blood of the good-hearted.<br /><br />\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is truly an epic story -- it takes place over the length and breadth of Westeros, and stretches across to Dothraki lands across the sea. There are countless plot threads woven into one enormous, bloodsoaked tapestry, linked together even if they are technically separate. Lots of plot threads are left dangling, but in such a way that you end up wanting to know what happens next.<br /><br />And Martin writes in a vivid, unromanticized style -- his world is a bleak, wild place shrouded in winter, full of cold stone walls, grimy medieval atmosphere, windswept steppes and dark seedy plots. He doesn't shy away from graphic violence or sex, but the focus here is always on the clashing families, battles and seedy plots of the queen. And despite that focus, there is still a hint of the magical in this fantasy -- talk of dragons, the White Walkers and their undead wights.<br /><br />It also has a wide-ranging cast of characters, from fiery little girls to dissolute kings. The most powerful are Eddard Stark, an admirable and charismatic man who seems destined for ruin because of his search for the truth; Daenerys grows from a pale, frightened wallflower into a strong queen who loves (and loses) people close to her; and a bunch of rich characters like Tyrion, Jon, Catelyn, the evil Cersei and her brother/lover Jaime, and many others.<br /><br />\\"A Game of Thrones\\" is a truly spellbinding experience, tearing away the rosier veils of high fantasy. Bloody, complicated and full of richly-developed characters, this is a modern classic.you end up wanting to know what happens next.

0345529057|5.0|Just finished reading the bundled set on my Kindle--formatting was excellent, and certainly easier to tote around than those huge books!  This is a masterpiece in epic fantasy; all the characters created in ever shifting shades of grey instead of black and white, even the seemingly truly evil like Cersei, or the seemingly noble but too cold Catelyn.  Can't wait for the next book!!
0393338827|4.0|This is a great book, by a great writer. Lewis shows us the idiocy of many on Wall Street and their inability or incapability of recognizing the huge problem that was subprime mortgages. He profiles those who predicted the market crash, going into their thinking, their doubts, and their various maneuvers to bet on the housing crash.    My only criticism is that even in Lewis' great simple and beautiful prose, it was hard to wrap my mind around Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), credit default swaps, and the various other instruments created to make money off of bad bets and risks. Still I highly recommend this book and enjoyed reading it right after reading Lewis' [[ASIN:039333869X Liar's Poker]].

0670022411|5.0|I was originally led to A Discovery of Witches by a review that called it \\"Twilight for adults.\\"  That was enough to get me to buy it but once I started reading, I could quickly see that there is so much more to this novel than another simple girl-meets-vampire story.  Author Deborah Harkness has created a brand new world that incorporates vampires, witches and daemons and it never fails to entice and engage.  A history professor, Harkness incorporates her intense knowledge of and love for history into her debut novel (and what better way to do this than with a vampire who happens to be 1500 years old!).  So, along with a thrilling plot involving a love affair between two species who, heretofore have been forbidden to intermingle, she introduces us to historical events which enrich the plot and characterization significantly.  In addition, the locations she utilizes -- Oxford, England; Sept-Tours, France; upstate New York -- add colorful and interesting backdrops to the proceedings.<br /><br />Diana Bishop is a witch who has denounced her bewitching abilities so she can focus on keeping her scholarly research as pure as possible.  But, when she calls up a book from the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library -- Ashmole 782 -- she is suddenly surrounded by witches and daemons and one very handsome and intelligent vampire (Matthew Clairmont).  It seems everyone is intrigued by Diana's interest in this book, which has been hidden for many years, and they want to see how the magic in it affects Diana or how Diana's magic will affect the book.  But, their interest in Diana and her magic puts her in grave danger so Matthew steps in to protect the young scholar.  He flies her to France to keep her safe in his family's castle.  There, the two can no longer deny their love for each other, which introduces an even more dangerous situation -- the threat of The Congregation (made up of witches, daemons and vampires), whose mission is to keep the three species from intermingling.  But, most threatening of all is a witch named Satu who is ordered to learn just how much magic Diana has in her soul.  Diana and Matthew must use their wits and considerable abilities to stay one step ahead of the dangers that threaten to end their lives...and their enduring love.<br /><br />I was completely swallowed up in the world created by Harkness.  (And, this from a reader who has never fully embraced the fantasy or science-fiction genres!)  The book includes a compelling plot that incorporates interesting moments in history but it succeeds because of the two main characters.  Diana is a feisty, strong and intelligent scholar who does not shirk from danger.  Meanwhile, Matthew is a powerful, smart and protective vampire whose history (and passions) run deep.  Together, they are a complex pair who work through their difficulties in an intelligent, mature way.  But, complicating matters are the mysteries each keep secret from the other and by the emotions that develop from keeping these secrets; this is where the soul of the book is found.<br /><br />This is the first of a planned trilogy of books and the conclusion of this volume has apparently disappointed some readers because of its lack of a typical conclusion.  But, the ending excites me and makes me hope the second volume will be published sooner rather than later (it is planned for 2012).  Harkness has introduced us to a plethora of intriguing, complicated and engaging characters who truly get under your skin!  Imagining their adventures in Volume 2 promises even more fun for the reader.<br /><br />If you are looking for a simple love story, this book is not for you.  But, if you are ready for a mature story that incorporates mature characters, deep emotions, moments in history and a wild-and-woolly plot, you should go straight to to the 1-Click button and buy it!

B001E75QH0|5.0|Just bought this set for my 14 year old grandson for his B'day (his request).  Since I sold my original Indy series (VHS) on Amazon, and am currently Indiana Jones-less, I'm hoping my daughter will return the favor and give me this same set for Christmas.  I love the series and can hardly wait to see it again.  That's the trouble with keeping up with technology, sometimes you have to give up your favorites and hope someone buys them for you in the latest \\"thing\\".
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This books is refreshing because it is a such a different topic and characters than I have ever ready before. I could not put it down and I wish there was a second book.
B001KZVQJI|3.0|Peter Jackson is a master of creating big, epic action/adventure films. His three-film adaptation of [[ASIN:B0026L7H20 The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]] is a masterpiece of modern film. So I went in to his remake of [[ASIN:B000EHQTZO King Kong]] with great anticipation. Sadly, a nagging feeling I had about the film turned out to be true. At 188 minutes, this film is just too long. Now, don't get me wrong, there are a number of three-hour plus movies in my collection. But with this film, what could have been an intense, action-packed film turns out to be just one elongated scene after another, nearly derailing the film. And the presentation of a \\"love story\\" between Kong the Ape and a human woman is kind of handled weirdly. The cast does as good a job as it can with the extended script, and the visual effects and James Newton Howard's score are really good. But this film definitely should have been under two-and-a-half hours. This is only a film for those with a huge amount of patience.<br /><br />Movie Grade: C+

As a newbie to epublishing, I looked forward to learning from someone who's walked the path. This book has me thinking. And strategizing. And noodling. All good things.<br /><br />What I loved:<br /><br />1. His anatomy and tutorial about how to write a blog post revolutionized the way I think about my own posts. I've been a blogger since 2004, but haven't stumbled upon his method. This week I'm going to write some new posts using his insight and see how that works.<br /><br />2. He gave me confirmation for what I've been doing all along, building strong fans/friends. I've spent several years responding to every reader email. I have an email distribution list of folks who go to bat for me. (This is humbling and heartening!) So I'll keep loving people, seeing my Twitter and Facebook interaction as vital to my career.<br /><br />3. He writes conversationally.And he's generous with his information.<br /><br />What niggled me:<br /><br />1. I'm a craft person. My goal is to write a better book each time I write one. This means I spend a lot of time writing and improving. Though I don't think Locke would advocate writing terrible books, he does dance the line.<br /><br />2. It appears (I certainly could be wrong) that he violates CAN/SPAM laws when he sends emails out to his fans. If you're not familiar with that, I have a guest post on my blog outlining it succinctly. Emails you send out en masse must be permission based (which his are), but they also have to have an unsubscribe feature to be legal. Again, I haven't received an email from him about his books to say if he does or doesn't do this. But I believe he needs to be very clear about this. I wouldn't want to see people's websites get shut down because they violated these laws.<br /><br />All in all, I found this book to be valuable. It's rare that I read a marketing book (and I read hoards of them) where I feel energized and empowered. And it's doubly rare that a marketing book has me up at night thinking of new ways to present myself to my readers.<br /><br />Mary DeMuththat a marketing book has me up at night thinking of new ways to present myself to my readers.

B002RKSZKI|5.0|Emma by Jane Austen is one of her more unknown works, and yes, it does seem tedious to read. However, those readers out there who say that they are &#34;very disappointed by emma&#34; are not thinking the right way.     If everybody in the world were disappointed by books that are &#34;boring&#34; or &#34;tedious&#34; to read, nobody would ever have read Moby Dick or Les Miserables. (Not saying I think those books are boring, but in today's increasingly unappreciative society those books are considered boring to read).     The real charm of classic books is digesting it and comprehending it, and in Austen's case, simply enjoying the satrical humor and wit that she subtly managed to sneak into all of her works.    I know, as a middle school student, how easy it is to wander while reading or to just skim over the pages. Just keep on trying and one day you won't be disappointed by Emma. Just read slowly and get all those little gems of humor that Austen employed in her books.    Also, who ever said you need to like the main character? Of course, everyone loves characters like Elizabeth Bennet. She's personable and likable. However, main characters are &#34;imperfect&#34; for a reason. What is the point of using literary examples in an essay if the literature doesn't depict realistic characters?    Yes, Emma can be a snob, ignorant, and a little vain, but appreciate her for the human being she is and enjoy the classic Jane Austen book!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|There's not much that I can say about Sucker Punch that hasn't already been said, with the exception of my own description and recommendation.      Trying not to give anything away, my main point is this: Zach Snyder has created a modern-day masterpiece of a live-action adaptation of a fantasy anime film.  Phantasmagorical, fantastical, imaginative, enthralling, impossibly entertaining, Mr. Snyder has managed to transport the viewer into a world unlike any other, full of possibilities.  Reminiscent of mid to late 90's anime, this film makes real the imagination that was thoroughly fleshed out in films of the day, such as Metropolis, Akira, and Evangelion.  Just imagine those films, with live actors, and stunning visuals, and you'll get an inkling of what this film can be for you.    I was completely entertained by this film.  The story line is a steamroller of fantastic design, but without much character development.  The characters seem to pinball from one crisis to the next, until the eye-opener of an ending, heart-stopping in its intensity, but thoroughly addictive.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone willing to listen, if I could sit still long enough trying to describe it.  Beautiful scenery, stunningly attractive actresses, dramatic demands on characters, this is a wonderful film.
B00506NRBS|5.0|you know what i like about derek? if i write him an email he will respond personally. his book keeps that personal feel. i believe him when he says to email your reaction to his story and hope that many of you who read it will. this collection of his experiences and insightsgets at the core of why many artists veer off the path of the known. i have two cds on cd baby and in 2006 when he still owned the company i can vouch for his goal to satisfy every one of his customers. his insight into the core reason for having any business of your own should remind even the most successful person why they started doing what they do. derek made me think about ways i can tap back into that passion for my art and therefore i highly recommend this book to anyone starting or running a business especially arts based. ppl will say no when you think out of the box. this book helps remind me to keep going! --melissa kate.net

0385523912|5.0|I took a book out of the library the other day: \\"Nothing to Envy, Ordinary Lives In North Korea\\" by Barbara Demick (2009; Spiegel and Grau) . The austere cover got my attention. North Korea is a closed, weird society. It is hard to get good information about this place. The author, who covered the Korean peninsula for the Los Angeles Times, interviews six defectors from North Korea about their lives over the last twenty years.<br /><br />In case you haven't heard the news (and judging by the socialistic phobia of the Tea Partiers, some haven't): The Soviet Union collapsed in 91, ushering in an era of change within their former satellites. Only Cuba and North Korea attempted to maintain some form of Industrial Socialism--with North Korea being the more Stalinist of the two hold outs. Cuba, I've read about how they made the transition away from having a benevolent host. North Korea, I didn't know so much about.<br /><br />Oh, back in the 90's, I heard about the famine in North Korea. This book tells the story of what it was like for a common person to live through those awful years. I couldn't put the book down. The characters are every day folks who lived within a crazy regime that makes everyone dust the pictures of the Two Kim's once a day. In fact, you have to have one whole wall of your apartment devoted to the hero worship of the \\"Great Leader\\" and the \\"Dear Leader\\". Secret police make unannounced visits to your home to make sure your tidiness extends to the photos.<br /><br />Repressive. And also a bit telling for us should we ever lose access to cheap oil.<br /><br />When the Soviet Union fell--all the sweetheart deals also went away: no more cheap oil. Industry stopped. Industrial agriculture (North Korea is the last country on earth that still has \\"collective farms\\") had vastly reduced production. The weather also took a toll and crops failed.<br /><br />And the Communist government fiddled their own propaganda as the people starved to death. Estimates range from 600,000 t0 2.5 million people died. One of the people profiled was a teacher, who watched in sorrow as her class was reduced from 55 elementary students to 15. Environmentally, every last bit of wild meat was consumed by a starving population. The frog population was decimated.<br /><br />Books written about defectors can be shrill propaganda pieces. This book is not. I highly recommend it. The stories rattled me. No amount of commitment to ideological fervor should make a country suffer like North Korea did in the 90's. If it ain't working: change it. I hope the North Korean people, somehow, are able to toss off the yolk of 70 years of brainwashing and totalitarianism, and experience freedom and justice someday..

I have to agree with the others about the price for the game, it would probably receive a much better response if it were a .99 cents app. No problems with the tilt sensing and whatnot on the HTC Evo. I have played all of three levels and know I will probably get into it, reminds me of the similar app on the iPhone.
0316098329|4.0|There is nothing interesting about the plot of \\"Room.\\"  It is entirely predictable and linear, and all too familiar to modern-day readers living in a media saturated world.  What makes \\"Room\\" so interesting is that it's told from the perspective of a five-year old boy who must struggle with navigating the limitations of language while at the same time navigating the limitations of the adult world.  That Emma Donoghue has re-created for us so authentically and powerfully the mind of a five-year old is what makes this book so compelling to read.      Above all, then, this is a work of love for Donogue's children, a distillation of all the thoughts, love, and worrie she has invested into her children.  With this book, she's telling her children:  I love you so much I can now see outside from inside of you, and in so doing you are me, and I am you.

While you may think to yourself that this has a maze section in it and that precludes all other sections from being mazes, that simply isn't the case. They are all mazes. Some mazes are a mine field of holes you have to negotiate around. Some mazes have multiple trickery objectives you can't access. Some mazes have plausible almost solutions. Don't be fooled! There is only one solution to each of these maps.  If you are not good at judging the difference between one small gap and another, this is not the game for you. If you hate having to back out to start over because the ball is such in a made trap, this game is not for you. If you have hands that are in any way unsteady when you get nervous/angry/frustrated, this game will be hard for you.

1936719118|3.0|While there is little here that you can't find in many other business books, it sounds like a very honest account of one man's journey.  It's a short book that details the decisions (good and bad) and events that happened on the way to creating and eventually selling CDBaby.  There's no secret in the book that will help you succeed in a similar way, but there are some important mantras that can be taken away, such as the importance of focusing on the customers above everything else.  Due to the length of the book, it's hard to rate this book as you would a 300 - 500 page work.  The book is worthwhile, but not great.  Think of it as an opportunity to sit down with the author for an hour and having him tell you about the experience... definitely worthwhile.

0812550706|5.0|I knew part of the ending, but I decided to read it anyway. This is a pretty grim book, and while it's about children, it doesn't seem like a children's book. Although maybe it's in the tradition of exposing children to harsher things. I guess Ender is the child all children wish they could be, or adults wish they had been- vulnerable, weak in some ways, but with the resources to overcome his harsh, indifferent, and sometimes cruel environment.     There's a lot here, and it's much better literature than most books aspiring to be literature- just as \\"The Shining\\" is a much better story about family life than anything John Updike or John Cheever ever wrote. The loneliness and fear of childhood, the hate and cruelty or love and tenderness of sibilings, the cynicism of the military- all covered much better than in the books about \\"people vaguely dissatisfied with Connecticut\\" as Dennis Lehane put it.     I think there are some Mormon themes here, but I don't know enough about Mormon theology to say. It's not a perfect book. I don't know if I buy the ending. But there is so much there.
0140143505|5.0|Letter writing is such a pleasure in this technology driven age of e-mailing and texting, partly because it is such an intellectually contemplative and slower paced act. The fluid clarity of thinking and conveyance that letter writing requires has by its own right made it a beautiful and all engrossing art form, and there are a plethora of literary artists in which to choose from whose own letters are a delight to read. As an example, I would cite the letters of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings to her editor Maxwell Perkins or Vincent Van Gogh to his brother Theo, just to name a few. But with Helene Hanff's 84 Charing Cross Road, a small yet delightful book that consists of only 94 pages and approximately 100 letters, give or take, there is something a bit more robust in its expressions, perhaps it's the simple bluntness and to-the-point opinions on a wide variety of topics, from how to make Yorkshire Pudding to Queen Elizabeth II all the way down to the numerous antiquarian books that Helene Hanff ordered from the Marks & Co. booksellers.     Besides the vast interesting topics that are addressed, it is really the developing twenty year relationship that was forged between Helene Hanff and the staff of Marks & Co. that makes for the best part of the reading. All of the letters are very short, even brusque, and while some are affectionate, others are bossy and acerbic, but there is always an undertone of affection and respect. Hanff would always place mail orders for rare British and obscure books, and that would send the staff of Marks & Co. all over the place to find that specified book, for nothing was too laborious for their American client. They appreciated her sense of humor, and her gruffness was always viewed as part of the act. In the letters, Hanff would tell the staff that she was a poor writer with champaign tastes in fine quality books, and they always obliged in her needs and wants. When she made it big as a television writer, her book orders were nonstop, andI'm sure that was much appreciated by the staff. Additionally, due to the world War II food shortages, she would send them food, presents and other valued commodities that they were lacking. They in turn would gift her with remarkable books that no value could be placed on. And there was always an open door policy for Hanff to come and visit them.     84, Charing Cross Road was a genuinely enjoyable read. Although the correspondence was separated by an ocean, it just goes to show the power of literature and of the written word and of the good deeds that back them up. If a reader needs some uplifting reading, try 84, Charing Cross Road; you will not be disappointed.

0393316041|5.0|Feynman's genius comes from his ability to make you relate to him as a friend and mentor, even if you've never met him yourself since he is no longer with us. There isn't a moment of this book that can bore you, and I'd read it in one go if food and sleep weren't hinderances. You'll leave this book with a friend, a passion for science and a fresh view of the person you'd like yourself to be.<br /><br />Before I bought this book, I knew this would be a informal recollection of humorous events from Feynman's life. It appears that many anticipated an autobiography. It is important to note that this book does not describe any of Feynman's major contributions to physics in the fields of Quantum Mechanics and Particle Physics. I have read many reviews that have criticized the book for not dealing with these topics. These reviewers should understand that this book is simply a collection of anecdotes that is mainly intended for the non-scientific reader and those who follow Feynman as an idol (to emulate his character, science should not have idols!). If one is looking for a text on Feynman's scientific works, he or she would be better off reading '[[ASIN:0679747044 Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman]]' by James Glieck.
0670022411|4.0|Twilight for adults and I mean that in positive way.  Everything that Twilight lacks due its teen audience this book provides in away that I hope other reader of the fictional occult will appreciate and enjoy as well.  I highly enjoyed this book.  It has a strong plot, well created characters that peel off their various layers of personality as the story develops and the settings (Oxford, France and the US) are well done.  I particularly enjoyed the early parts and descriptions of Oxford as it took me back to the time I spent there so many years ago.  It is the prefect opening setting for a story of the supernatural in the modern day!  THe research and time that went into this book are truly impressive.   I can also honestly say that I am actually excited to be waiting for the next books in this series to come out and see how thing turn for the characters going forward.  I feel as if this is a  There are few things that prevented me from giving the book five stars.  First, I though the \\"romance\\" in France dragged a little.  Second, I thought Diana's lack of self-recognition of her strength towards the end of the book was a little bothersome.  She should not need the Vamp to point that out to her in the later pages.  Third, I know that Knights and their Orders were male traditions in the middle ages, but I think the female vamp should be been allowed in to it-- it is now based in the 21st century.  Four, some of the dialog seemed stilted and forced--which may been an attempt to get the draw out the characters--but I just found it distracting.  All and all, a good read!

B00000JPH6|5.0|I've loved this movie since it first came out.  I had made a copy on VHS when it was on HBO or one of those channels and hadn't watched it for years.  When I went to get the tape to watch it again, gone!  (And yes, I do still have a working VCR.) I decided that it was time to come into the 21st century and buy a DVD copy of it.  After all, it's not just great entertainment. There's an underlying story about life and about the combining of our everyday selves (ego) with our spiritual selves in order to be more complete and best benefit our world.  It's a wonderfully told story that's great viewing for children and adults as well.  If you haven't seen it in a while or if you've never seen it, I highly recommend it!

B000069I1H|4.0|Reality television has been around long enough that it is time to make movies that parody what they do, and how they do it. This film does that, while also skewering the concept of a cop buddy movie. For one, these cops are not buddies and may never be, they don't even like each other. In the film a real cop Robert DeNiro is antagonistic about being ordered to allow a film crew to film him while he works. Worse yet they settle him with a cop who is also a struggling hammy actor, played to perfection by Eddie Murphy. Before you know it the show is bending the reality, changing their clothes, office, cars and home to be more TV friendly. The real question is does this draw out the real person inside the cop, or does it make a cheesy imitation of the real cop? The lines get blurry and the answer is not so simple. The movie is a lot of fun, big blowups, big laughs, an over the top villain, and all in all great popcorn movie.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|I saw this movie in the local theater a couple days after its release, and it really engrossed me in the world Cameron & company created. The visuals were beyond anything I expected, and despite the story being a 'Pocahontas' type love story, I felt the visuals and the world it was set in brought it beyond just a simple tale. Anyways, when it was released on Blu-Ray/DVD, I bought the original theatrical version on DVD, not having a system capable of playing Blu-Rays. By the time the extended edition had been released, I had a great HDTV and a decent Blu-Ray player, so I went ahead and bought it. This being my first movie to ever watch on Blu-Ray, it was insane. I never expected the video & sound quality to be so far ahead of the DVD presentation. It really did surprise me.     Moving on, I thought the packaging of this edition was quite decent, and it hasn't fallen apart like many special editions I have picked up over the years. And the fact that they included all three cuts of the film is also a plus; so if you prefer the theatrical or the special edition re-release, you can watch that as well. This set includes a host of special features...from deleted scenes to commentaries, it's jam packed with all sorts of interesting things. And with BD-Live, you get even more. Overall, it was a good investment and I quite enjoyed what I paid for. Five Stars. Recommended.

0802130208|2.0|I had this book recommended to me by a friend and so I was interested in reading this. Also, I had read a great deal of positive reviews on this. So, I started to read this book rather eagerly expecting that I would be greatly entertained. However, as I got through the first 30 pages, I had to force myself to continue reading. I already despised the main character and had little interest in any of the other characters in the book. This book, unlike other great books, became a chore to read.    In its defense, the book does get mildly more interesting as it goes along. This was perhaps its only redeeming quality. I found a couple of incidents in the book mildly amusing. However, having just finished reading this book. I can only recommend that you save yourself the time. This book leaves me feeling that I wasted my time.    I'm honestly puzzled that so many people liked this book. It sucks. The only reason I gave it two stars is because certain statements that Ignatius made were mildly amusing.

0380820846|4.0|I think this book has the most romantic ending out of all the Bridgerton books that I've read so far (about to finish the 6th one).  And as someone who used to be quite an introvert, I have a great deal of sympathy for Penelope, and I think Colin, as someone who is outgoing and loquacious, is a great match for her.  Having said that, I feel like this novel wasn't quite as well-structured a narrative as the better Bridgerton novels.  The development of the whole romance felt a bit vague to me, and I wasn't really able to follow along with the emotions of the characters very well.  At times, Colin is trying to wrestle with his new-found feelings toward Penelope and ends up being kind of an ass, and Penelope is offended by it, but those episodes seem to just kind of get swept under the rug when he proposes.  Overall, the emotional arc of the narrative didn't seem to feel as smooth and natural as The Duke and I, because I feel like we're missing moments here and there from both Penelope and Colin.<br /><br />Of course, this is written with the polished and naturalistic prose that Julia Quinn is known for, and so I feel that this story is certainly a worthy member of the Bridgerton series.  If you have been following this series, you will probably want to read this book.  If this is the first time you're reading Julia Quinn, I would recommend you start with The Duke and I first.
B004XE0P5E|1.0|Like most that purchased this album I was a huge fan of \\"For Emma\\" and was looking forward to this second outing. What I wasn't expecting was his sound to change completely! I hate when brilliant artists (and I really do feel that they are brilliant) feel that they need to completely overhaul the sound that brought them success. If it works, stick with it. If you want to branch out then branch out but do it as a side project. I will probably end up buying whatever they come out with because there is always hope that they will realize their mistake and go back to the sound that works for them. For now though, after three listens, Bon Iver's latest outing has become my new favorite coffee coaster, and it's not even really good at that.
B004GYOQ6A|5.0|This is one of the few games I've played that I can just play a level or two of without getting too sucked in.  I've had the free version for almost a year and just dealt with the ads so I was really happy to see the full one for free today.  Runs very smooth on my Droid X.

B004GXZ69W|4.0|If you have thumb or wrist pain from computer mouse use, consider trying a vertical mouse.  I've been using the Evoluent Vertical Mouse 4 small mouse laser 6 buttons wired USB for over a month.  My pain is not eliminated but is much less than before trying this mouse.   After reading reviews of other vertical mice, this one sounded the best.  The mouse is programmable, but I have not programmed any buttons.  The laser is not as sensitive as I am used to, but I really do not like pain so I deal with the insensitivity.
B0051OZ564|1.0|I was skeptical about seeing Sucker Punch in theaters, and as it turns out, I should have trusted my intuition! The plot is shallow, laughable, and nonsensical, and the acting likewise. I admit, the CG's and the visuals of Babydoll's 'fantasies' are superb, which are Snyder's specialty, but they make zero sense. I found myself checking my watch every 15 minutes waiting for this atrocity of a movie to end. If I could revoke my one star, I would.
B000FC146C|5.0|The Thorn Birds is an eloquent depiction of forbidden love and tragedy. A tale of desire,loss and sacrifice this novel teaches countless lessons about life and relationships.<br /><br />Each character is unique and whether they are loved or hated the reader knows them intimately and is invested in their ultimate destiny from beginning to end.<br /><br />This is a must read!
B004XWMXX8|5.0|Beautifully blossoming from Disney star to mature music artist, Selena Gomez's third CD, When the Sun Goes Down, shows the true talent that has been laying in wait to explode into being fully realized. Her first two albums were great, but she has something truly special here. She has broken free from the Disney hold.    At first listen, you will hear her beautiful voice maturing more and more with experience. The mark of a truly great artist is an album on which all the songs have the musician's distinct sound but all the songs are unique and different from one another. She has done this here.    I think every song is a winner. However, in my opinion, the stand out tracks are \\"Love You Like A Love Song\\", \\"Bang Bang Bang\\", \\"We Own The Night\\", \\"Whip Lash\\", and last (and possibly my favorite) \\"My Dilemma\\".     \\"Love You Like a Love Song\\" has great lyrics and reminds me of something of a forgotten era, maybe from the 20's. \\"Bang Bang Bang\\" is an upbeat, catchy song with a great hook. \\"We Own the Night\\" is a slower, downtempo, hypnotic song about just being free and enjoying the company of someone you care about. \\"Whip Lash\\" is an upbeat techno that has a bit of a throwback sound to early 80's Blondie-type tunes with a modern twist. \\"My Dilemma\\" is a song that I can't get out of my head!! This song, to me, is wonderfully, deliciously ADDICTING! And the rest of the tunes are just as fabulous.    Selena is certainly a child no longer. Not only does she have more of a hand in her music, she has collaborated with the likes of musicians like Britney Spears and Katy Perry, which is an excellent sign of things to come. I look forward to what's next from this talented lady.     On a side note, make sure you purchase the actual CD instead of downloading it digitally. The CD has a beautiful insert booklet featuring gorgeous photos of Selena spanning about 70 decades (the 1920's through today). Thank you so much for including this little gem for the fans. This is the reason sometimes downloading music can't even come close to buying a true CD.    If you haven't had the chance to listen to Ms. Gomez's music, this is the starting point for you. When the Sun Goes Down is hands down the best release from any musician this year thus far. Lady Gaga (whose new CD is awful) can learn a thing (or MANY) from Selena Gomez.    I give this CD a 5... out of 5.
044654146X|5.0|This is an amazing book about a determined and passionate people building their country one innovation at a time.  I never realized how many major US companies like Intel rely heavily on their Israeli R&D teams for significant product innovation.  The book reveals many of the unique circumstance for this economic miracle.  It makes clear although these can not be expected to work in most other societies or countries there are functionalities that are transferable.  The authors write with informative detail and  outstanding storytelling style so you never want to put the book down.  In this time of economic struggle in the US it would be well if our legislators and educators studied and tried to implement some of these successful principles.
B004I11VZ0|3.0|I really enjoyed the first Ip Man movie, but there seems to be something missing from this installment.  There aren't as many interesting supporting characters as the first movie and many of the returning characters from the first movie are relegated to the background roles of little importance.  For example, Ip's family, especially his wife, played a huge role in the first movie as it stressed the tension between the combative life Ip Man led and the stable and happy family life his wife desired.  In the second movie, the family is there, but it is more of a side note and hardly a main component to the plot.  Character development certainly isn't a focus in the movie as it was in the first.    The plot, that is another major barrier I found with getting into this movie.  Not only does it seem to use the same plot points as the first movie, only done in a less polished fashion, but it seems that the writer(s) of the movie had watched one too many Rocky movies, especially Rocky IV. (*minor spoiler alert*) This movie imitates so many things from Rocky IV, it becomes borderline absurd.  I mean, it has everything from a reenactment of the Apollo Creed match-fiasco to the \\"If I can change, you can change\\" speech after the penultimate fight, with the subsequent conversion of the hostile crowd to his philosophy -- though, I must admit the training montage before the final fight was a lot more subtle as you didn't have to watch Ip Man running up any large mountains.      Also, just like Rocky IV, Ip Man has a strong nationalistic message at the root of its plot, just like the first movie. It attempts to show the viewer that Chinese culture is superior to the \\"foreign devil\\"  Brits, who are just like the Russians in Rocky IV.  Just as the Japanese were portrayed as vicious inhuman two dimensional villains, the Brits are portrayed as uncultured two dimensional barbarians that act like comic book villains, maniacal laughter included. It's fine if the writers want to write about the British occupation in Hong Kong, but the writing makes the British into caricatures that are unbelievable outside of a movie script and  there seems to be a pro-Chinese culture agenda similar to the pro-American agenda of Rocky IV, which I guess is fine if you are from the country being portrayed as the superior, and not so much for the country being portrayed as the inferior. It doesn't help that the British actors in the movie are atrocious at best.     Also, I'm sure there were Western Boxing vs. Eastern Boxing matches that took place in the past, but I doubt they were as drawn out and absurd as they are in this movie.  I mean, seriously, you put a guy with boxing gloves on, who follows traditional Western Boxing rules, against a guy who kicks, knees, grapples, throws, and is allowed his full range of martial arts ability, which includes punching a guy in the face while he is being held on the ground, and we are to expected to believe that would be a good fight? Maybe in a Street Fighter game that is believable, but in a \\"loosely-based\\" biopic, it is laughable.  I guess it is as believable as Rocky winning a boxing match by just blocking with his face.    Anyway, people watch Martial Arts movies for the fighting and this movie has a lot of good scenes, in particular the one between Sammo Hung and Donnie Yen, but there aren't as many good scenes as the first movie.  In fact, there just aren't as many fighting scenes as the first movie and that is a shame, since they are a beauty to behold.    I think the plot drags the movie down too far and is not as well told or put together as the first movie.  I do suggest watching this movie at least for the fighting scenes and just laugh off the plot as I do when I watch Rocky IV.
0060234814|1.0|Nothing wrong with the content, it's classic, but the book material is ultra low end for a hard back: light hardback cover, super-thin paper (basically transparent), spine has no reinforced cloth strip, spine glued with no stitching. Dust cover okay. Don't bother buying the hardback series from this publisher. I can't see it standing up to much more wear than a paperback, which this book will get no doubt.
B004SKEHP2|5.0|This is not the sums best album, so if you're new to sum 41 I would skip this album. And start off by listening to AKNF or UH. The songs need to have more verses and choruses in some songs. I rate this album a 4.5/5.<br /><br />1. Reason to Believe- This song was supposed to be on the album Chuck. But never made it. But the piano part in this songs is excellent. Drums are crispy, guitars are clear and the bass is deep. 8.5/10<br /><br />2. Screaming Bloody Murder- One of the best songs on here. The more you listen to it, the more you will like it. The solo sounds some what like Dave( the old guitarist of sum 41) would play. Lyrics are good on here as-well. 9/10<br /><br />3. Skumfuk- If it never had the intro, I would like this song a lot more. It's not bad, but could be better. The ending where Deryck sing without nothing but the piano in the background is the best part. Lyrics are very good on here. 8/10<br /><br />4. Time For You to Go-  This song reminds some people of Green Day. But it's nothing like them. This is one of the more pop punk songs on here. Solo is nice and clean and the vocals are some what different sounding. Not too bad of a song. But I son't really like other than the solo. 7/10<br /><br />5.Jessica Kill- This song I just can't warm up to. It's not a bad song musically, but I don't really like the lyrics to it.<br />6.5/10<br /><br />6. What Am I To Say-  This is one of the best songs on this album. Starts slow but builds up on the choruses. Lyrics are excellent and the vocals, and guitar are excellent. 10/10<br /><br />7. Holy Image of Lies- The first minute into this song is boring but the rest is just awesome. The piano and the drums go together perfectly. 8/10<br /><br />8. Sick of Everyone- This song is another excellent song. It just needs more choruses and verses, to make it epic. But I still like it just as much without it. 10/10<br /><br />9. Happiness Machine-  The is a great  song to end  \\" The Dark Road Out of Hell\\". Verse are heavy and the choruses are light. Except for the last one. The guitars are repeated a little, but you don't really notice.<br /> 9.5/10<br /><br />10. Crash-  This is is a all piano song, except for the chorus. The chorus messes up the whole song. Everything would be perfect if the chorus's chords had been change and without the distortion on the guitar. 8/10<br /><br />11. Blood In My Eyes- This should have been the next single. Everything is perfect. 10/10<br /><br />12. Baby You Don't Wanna Know- One of the blah songs. Skip it. 6.5/10<br /><br />13. Back Where I Belong- Not bad, not too good. But it is still lyrically very good. The bridge is my favorite part. 7.5/10<br /><br />14. Exit Song-  To me this sounds like a sad song. But if you listen to all the songs, they kinda tell a story. This is the end of the story, this song. 9/10<br /><br />The Sums could have done better, but I'm still very happy with this album. I would buy it if I never had the chance to.<br />It's worth all the money. Overall I rate it: Guitars: 8/10, Drums:10/10, Bass: 8/10, Piano: 10/10, Vocals: 10/10<br />Total: 9.5/10eated a little, but you don't really notice.   9.5/10    10.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|As a pastor of two congregations, I find this wired microphone to be easy to use, easy on batteries and unobtrusive. It works well - as this is my first experience with a microphone, I was concerned about placement, being able to speak into the microphone, etc. Just clip this to your tie, turn it on and speak! Great for amateurs like myself. Affordable.  Fast service from the vendor. Factory new packaging. Even had a battery!
0810989956|5.0|This particular series has gotten my first grade grandson reading so much more readily than any other book series. So much so that he saved his allowance to buy this book. This particular book let's the reader create his own cartoons and comments. It can be purchased repeatedly if the reader wants to create his own series. Great idea!   We are now waiting for the latest book to be released in November.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|The Fame & the Fame Monster were both 5 stars. Some of the best pop music in recent times. Every time you listen to those albums you will here something new. Born This Way is so poorly produced I can't even listen to an entire song. It sounds like really loud white noise. You will find brain is tired after only a few songs. It isn't even possible to evaluate the creativity of the album because the production is that bad. It makes for good bar music I suppose.
B00003CXB4|3.0|The movie plays great on DVD players, but when we went to play it on a laptop, the DVD didn't even register with the computer so we couldn't watch it. You can choose between the original theatrical version or the version with the new song, but all-in-all, for $15 with shipping, this was a decent product. It was probably a Chinese rip-off though.
B00005JL78|2.0|As other reviewers have noted, this movie has some logical flaws. That alone is not necessarily a show stopper. But the problem for me was that the major logical flaw (Cruise's \\"crime\\" being seen by the precons) was just too big a mistake, and effectively destroyed the movie for me. It's too bad because the movie contains some interesting ideas and compelling visuals, but I felt pretty deflated when I realized that the screenwriters took a major shortcut, which to my mind, means they didn't accord their audience the proper amount of respect. I also generally like Tom Cruise, but I didn't like his performance much in this movie. Part of the reason is probably because Colin Farrell was in this movie and I don't like his energy as an actor.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My husband and I were hooked from the first few minutes. The only downside to this show is that it only lasted one season and one movie. SUCH a shame! But the writing is top notch and it's funny and dramatic at the same time. Forget Star Trek, Firefly is for the true sci-fi geeks!!
B0051RP4DA|5.0|This is not an album for people looking to rock-out to Pearl Jam whilst flashing the sign of the horns. However, if you find yourself attracted to the more mellow side of Pearl Jam, and especially if you enjoyed the soundtrack to \\"Into the Wild\\" you will really appreciate this album. While variety is fine, I do enjoy albums that I can play and expect a certain vibe throughout; this one is decidedly mellow and contains no interruptions from massive electric guitar solo blowouts. Each song is unique (except for the Ukulele of course!) but all keep the same mellow, thoughtful vibe, without any screaming or related chaos. Sometimes that is exactly what's called for.     On it's cover this album informs you exactly what to expect and it delivers what it promises -- Ukulele Songs! It's great. When I want to rock out there are plenty of other albums to choose from. Everyone is different, but as for me I think I will get a lot more enjoyment out of this than any of PJ's recent stuff.
B004SEUJ82|4.0|This movie (and the book to a greater extent)is a much-watch. Yeah, I know that there's some serious inaccuracies (in real life there were more prisoners, the kid would have been murdered at his arrival at the camp, and German citizens weren't clueless about the Final Solution) but the overall point is still pertinent. It's not too often that we see the Holocaust from the perspective of a child, and that point of view illustrates that the way racists categorize human beings is wrong. Since Bruno is so innocent, the irrationality of the Nazis is striking. Personally, I liked the book better because it emphasized his innocence which made the end much more shocking.      ******POSSIBLE SPOILER*****   The best part is that when they're dressed the same, it's impossible to tell the boys apart even though one is from the 'master race' and the other is an 'eeeevil' Jew. In the book it's even better because Bruno has a shaved head. How can a person be inhuman if they look like a human when they're dressed like one?
B004C00EM8|5.0|As I look at 50+ 5 star reviews on Martyrs, I can see that my fellow reviewers have already praised the film more eloquently then I can.   This brilliant film is going to haunt me for some time.  I had planned to watch a second film tonight but what can follow this magnificent masterpiece?    About the blu-ray...  I don't know if it's region locked but it plays on my region 1 player.  It's in French but English subtitles are available.  French is the only audio language and French and English are the only subtitles.  There is a spartan menu but the only other menu option is scene selections.  No other extras.  The sound is 5.1 DTS Master Audio. The aspect ratio is 16x9.  The video is 1080p.  Coded for 5.1 or not, it really sounded more like stereo... not a lot from the surrounds. While the picture was pretty good, it's not a reference disc either.      It's not everyone and it's not a family film.  But if you love horror, you'll love this film.  I rarely give a film five stars but this one earned them.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|I'm not a Beyonce fan but I really like this album. I'm glad that she did something different because to me all of her music was beginning to sound the same. If you are a fan of her pervious albums you may not like this one because it more R&B than Pop. The \\"Run the World\\" track is misleading because it really doesn't fit with the rest of the album and seems more like a Bonus Track. Overall I think that it's a classic.
B0051OZ564|2.0|I was so disappointed in this film. It was so depressing due to the subject matter. I really believed this movie was going to be some kind of action yarn with an upbeat storyline. Instead it  had some very dark twists to it. The special effects were good, but I couldn't really get into it because of the plot was so depressing to me.I probably went into this movie with very high expectations due to the trailer I watched.I can only give this movie two stars.
1439133948|2.0|I read this book when it was first published. It would have been an OK read if it had been written by any other author. Given this author and the other books in the series, my expectations were high. The magic wasn't there. It was hard to even finish reading it.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I had to write one about this toy. I agree completely with the first reviewer. My son received this toy as a gift when he as about 2 and a half months and he's been playing with it every day since then. It's currently my go to toy to make him happy. It goes with us everywhere and I was actually looking to buy a second one to keep in the car.  This is an awesome toy.
B0052U59F4|5.0|As many other readers, I first started and finished this story in FF, and although I was a little aprehensive about whether I would like or not the character's names change, I definitely forgot about it the moment I started reading Fifty Shades of Grey. I bought it in paperback, and haven't put it down ever since...I'm looking forward to buying the rest of the series...This book keeps you interested, emotionally invested and on the edge of you seat!I promise you, you will get obsessed and attached to the characters, there's just no way you wouldn't...5 stars for me!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I casually bought this book when I saw it mentioned by an author I admire. I say \\"casually\\" because I bought it with little to no expectations. I've spent plenty of time, money, and energy on similar products that left me jaded and still feeling like there was a missing piece to the puzzle.<br /><br />I'm happy to say John Locke fit every piece of the puzzle into place.<br /><br />I read this book from beginning to end in less than three hours. I could not pull myself from the page until I was done. This is full of amazing detail of how he reached success as a self-published author. One particular detail about blogging was so simple I smiled to myself as I read it and thought, 'Now why didn't I already think of that?!'<br /><br />This is brilliant. I really love Locke writing voice. Personal. Real.<br /><br />If you're thinking of self-publishing this would be a great place to begin.

B0031QVW2U|5.0|The strap does a great job of keeping my RS-7 (and consequently my camera) in place while moving around.  I first used it in Yellowstone where I was not only taking photos but moving a baby stroller up and down stairs.  The RS-7 stayed on my shoulder and my camera stayed right at the small of my back where I put it while moving the stroller and many other baby accoutrements around.  The strap is comfortable and easy to use.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Amazing that the Kindle price is almost as much as the hardback edition. Amazon says that the publisher sets the price, but do we believe that Amazon doesn't have any leverage. On top of that, we have the investment in the Kindle to recoup. I say, shop around people!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Why did this not happen sooner? I had been wondering how long it would take for husband and wife, Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi to collaborate on an album of their own.  When I heard that there was finally a Tedeschi-Trucks Band blues album to be released soon I immediately placed a pre-release order.  My first thought upon finally hearing it was that they had exceeded my high expectations!  This CD has hardly been out of my stereo since, and my enjoyment has grown with repeated listenings.  I've enjoyed their solo work, as well as Derek's playing with The Allman Brothers Band. But Derek's stunning slide guitar and Susan's soulfully expressive voice really bring out the best in each other.  They've chosen really fine bandmates as well.  I sincerely hope this was just the first of many releases to come from the Tedeschi-Trucks Band.

159420229X|4.0|This is a great book. I enjoyed reading it. It has vibe similar to 'The Game' by Neil Strauss. i.e. A reporter who has some shortcomings (memory for Foer/dating for Strauss), develops a fascination of an area (winning US memory championship/becoming a pickup artist), goes to different places and learns from the masters, ultimately comes out on top and writes about it. This isn't a self-help book per see. I really enjoyed the theory behind memory and all of Foer's adventures.

B004EPYZU8|5.0|After the dissapointing and overlong \\"Watchmen\\",director Zack Snyder had to step his game up on his next feature,and he did not dissapoint.Sucker Punch is every bit as good as his \\"300\\",visually inventive and arresting as it is dramatically gripping and suspenseful.Much credit has to be given to Snyder and co-writer Steve Shibuya for creating a stunning action fantasy in the finest traditon of \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"inception\\".But Snyder goes further to bring us a world inhabited by medieval dragons,\\"I Robot\\" like gun-toting cyborgs,zombie nazis and feudal ancient warriors as tall as a tree.All implausible,i know,but man is it fun.And unlike \\"Watchmen\\",the cast is exceptional,especially Emily Browning and Jena Malone as Babydoll and her balls-to-the-wall mental prison mate Rocket.An equally arresting villain is born in Oscar Isaac,who is commanding as a soft-spoken,but deadly administrator.Long story short,this film should have gotten better credit than it deserves,but this is one hell of a surprising \\"Sucker Punch\\".
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I purchased this album after hearing \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" a few times.  This is not my typical listening music, as I am more mainstream. When I listened to the album all the way through I was a little disappointed.  I kept going back to it though.  Now I appreciate each song on the album.  There was nothing wrong with the music the first time around, I needed to grow a little bit to appreciate it.  I am really glad that I did. This is an amazing album.

0553386794|1.0|From all the hype I had expected an exciting new fantasy series.  What I found was a fifties throwback to the all-powerful he-men and their pitiful subordinate women.  Really?  In 2011?  About as cutting edge as L. Ron Hubbard.  Worse than a waste of $10 and an hour - don't bother.
0062060554|5.0|Imagine waking up every morning not knowing where you are, not recognizing the man in your bed, or the face in the mirror?  What if, each morning, you had to be reintroduced to your husband, learn what a cell phone is, trust a strange man who says he's your doctor, but won't let you tell your husband about him... what would you do, if you couldn't remember?  Who would you trust?<br /><br />I spent the entire novel glued to the pages--the story was so gripping and filled with suspense that I couldn't put it down.  Watson is a genius; her writing floats off the page and captures the reader, making it impossible to do anything else but read on to find the truth.  Chrissy suffers from amnesia, unable to remember more than a day at a time, and as the story progresses, Watson creates a magnificent \\"who done it\\" suspense novel.  At one point or another, like Chrissy, I accused each character, making them the prime suspect, only to find out I wasn't even close to the truth.  I really love novels that cause me to change my opinions so rapidly, and I loved the suspense behind it all--my chest actually ached as I read; all the pent up anxiety for Chrissy had me so nervous that I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I love this story, as you can tell, and Watson's writing style and characterization are both beautiful.  I can't get over how well the story flows together, and how perfectly the pieces all fall into place.  I loved being in the dark along with Chrissy, trying to figure it all out, and it wasn't until the very end that I finally had that \\"aha\\" moment, only one half step ahead of Chrissy.  I can't get over the finale and the suspense leading up to it... there is so much betrayal and intrigue within this novel, and it's just superb!  I especially love that this novel takes place over the course of one day.  Chrissy wakes up disoriented, meets her husband, learns a little about her life and amnesia, and is then directed to her journal, where she writes down each day's proceedings in hopes of remembering.  Most of the book revolves around Chrissy reading the sections of her journal, beginning with November 9th, and it is as Chrissy reads her own story that she begins to piece together her life.  Yet, not everything adds up, and it's the constant shocks the reader has as snippets are revealed that make this novel amazing.  I would recommend this novel for adults, mainly because Chrissy journals a bit about her sexual escapades with her husband, and some of it is intense, so I feel like this novel would be best suited for 18+.  Five stars!s of remembering.

B001CC7PKS|2.0|I have to say I was really disapointed when I went to see this movie in the theatre. I considered it one of the worst super hero movies that I had ever seen. I found out there was a director's cut version released and I heard some good things about it so I went out and bought it. I have to say that it is a way better movie than the released version but it still doesn't hold a candle to say Batman Begins, Spiderman or Iron Man. The main problems I have with this film are pretty obvious ones. First I was expecting more of a legal drama, second Daredevil has hightnened senses not super human abilities and last his cover identity as a blind man wouldn't be doing flips on a seesaw in the middle of a park in front of everyone. They could have made a way better, more true to the comic version of this easily. You would think that Batman Begins and the first Spiderman movie would have set the bar for what we would expect all the movies of this genre to live up to. Well that's just my opinion anyway.
1594744769|4.0|This is a wonderful novel.  I heard a lot about how creepy/scary it was, and the cover of the levitating girl alone creates a feeling of foreboding.  So, between the cover and tidbits of information I gathered from tweets I read concerning the book, I knew I needed to pre-order it and read it stat.  And, I have to say, I am not disappointed in the least!  This was a phenomenal read!  I was reminded, in part, of the writing style of Lemony Snicket, but Riggs' story is more for adults.  I don't mean that in terms of appropriateness, because Riggs' novel is very clean, but I think Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children has much more pull for adults than Snicket, who I feel writes for more of a MG/YA crowd.<br /><br />The beginning of the novel drew me in very quickly and I was fascinated by the stories Jacobs grandfather, Abe, told about his life on the island.  Events speed up very quickly and a tragedy leaves Jacob questioning everything he ever knew, and his struggle with fact versus fiction was very real and kept me on the edge of my seat.  I struggled along with Jacob as Riggs creates many reasons to believe the tales, but also juxtaposes each with reasons not to believe, and for a while I teetered on the fence trying to decide, until Riggs made the decision for me--a point of no return, a point I wasn't expecting and threw me for a loop.  Novels that do that are my favorite type, and I applaud Riggs for creating such a great fantastical story that captivated me from the start.<br /><br />I love the use of pictures and the fact that they are not doctored at all by Riggs, but were used exactly as they were found, coming from different collectors around the world.  I loved how Riggs was able to tailor the photos for his story, describing them and making them a true part of the novel and not just random photos.  The fact that he was able to search out these photos and create a beautiful story surrounding them is a testament to his sheer writing genius.  I never would have thought to do something like this, and I've never read another novel that comes anywhere near what Riggs has created.  It's completely original and I had such a great time matching up the pictures with Riggs' descriptions.  His writing is so fluid and easy to read, and having the photos further aided my imaginative process.  I just loved everything about this novel.<br /><br />Riggs' novel is great for both YA and adults alike, and I was truly captivated by it.  Although it was a little less creepy than I originally expected, the creep factor was definitely there, and I believe parts of this novel could give younger readers nightmares (MG and below), so I'd say it's definitely for the YA+ crowd.  Four and a half stars.ght to do something like this, and I've never read another novel that comes anywhere near what Riggs has created.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|** This is a Review for the 4-Disc Box set **<br /><br />Blade Runner is a masterpiece of a movie which presents a fantastic sci-fi vision of the future; that over 30 years later still stands strong.  The movie has a very \\"cyber-punk\\" feel to it, and does an exceptional job of integrating the viewer into this visionary style of the future.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Blade Runner; The Movie is about a man named Deckard who specializes in hunting \\"Replicants\\".  A Replicant is essentially a clone of a human that has a fixed lifespan and exists in off-world colonies.  Well A bunch of Replicants have escaped and come to Earth and it is Deckard's job to hunt down these replicant's and kill them.  In doing so this tests Deckard's understanding of what it means to be human and the value of life.<br /><br />This is a movie that in 1982 was ahead of its time, a brilliant masterpiece that perfectly molds Science Fiction, Drama, and Detective work together.  What the 4 Disk Collectors Edition contains is a vast amount of bonus content that will please any Blade Runner fan, and make a great piece in a movie collection.<br /><br />Disk 1: The Final Cut(2007)  This is a completely restored version of the movie.

B004J4WLPU|2.0|I was very excited for this book seeing all of the great reviews plus it was highlited in people magezine so I forked out the $11.99 (which I think is on the high side...especially when the book is so BORING!)  I am so disappointed with this book...it was slow and very drawn out.  I struggled just to finish it.
B0000844I8|4.0|** This is a Review for the DVD Ultimate Edition **<br /><br />Stargate(1994) managed to merge Egyptology with Science Fiction, creating a unique look at ancient Egyptian gods.  While the movie is not perfect it proved to be a great hit amongst the sci-fi fans and spawned a number of shows; including the extremely popular Stargate SG-1 which ran 10 seasons.  This Ultimate Edition DVD almost gives you the Ultimate experience of the movie, but falls short in a few areas that holds it back from being a 5 star DVD.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />Almost everything is here with this DVD.  The movie was completely remastered in 16:9 widescreen and re-cut into an Extended Edition.  The audio and music has been remastered and now supports 5.1 Dobly and 6.1 DTS.  Throw in Audio commentary with the Director and Producer, and a small Featurette: \\"Is there a Stargate\\" and you have quite a nice package.  The remastered movie looks great on my 1080p upscaling DVD player, looking crisp and sounds great!<br /><br />THE BAD<br />To use the term \\"ultimate\\" edition might be pushing it.  I was a little let down over the lack of bloopers/gags and the lack of deleted scenes.  While they did provide an extended cut I just have this feeling there are more scenes left out.  Also the lack of behind the scenes and interviews is a let down; especially when this is supposed to be the \\"ultimate\\" edition.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />Despite missing some bonus features the movie itself is great!  You are getting a remastered, extended version of the film that will look excellent on DVD.  Even with the lack of bonus features this still is the DVD to own for the movie.
B004ZH66XO|3.0|this game is good for my kids but it's kind of slow. and the controls don't work that great. but the graphics are cute and the concept is too. it's just not that exciting.
0061784788|3.0|The novel was good but I was hoping for better especially after almost a year delay. I think he brought up some interesting things about our founding and what could have happened and the nanotech stuff was interesting as well. Have to wonder why we can't duplicate a process today that was done so long ago. The action was ok as well but it left me wanting for more maybe it was because of how he split up the teams this time. I'm not sure. I look forward to his next novel though.

0061784788|5.0|I have read numerous books by Mr. Rollins but never one in the Sigma Force series. With all the talk about this being his best novel and how his crazed fans have waited two years for a follow up, I figure now was as good time as any.  And it was.  I'm a sucker for this genre and Rollins writes it like I've never read it.  I've said before that I don't like reading history unless it's wrapped in fiction, and this book is a big fat breakfast bacon burrito!  The founding of this country has ALWAYS been awash in conspiracy theories, myth, and secret societies.  `The Devil Colony' plows through on the premise that this country was founded with the help of the very culture we almost wiped out, the Native Americans.<br /><br />The scope of this novel is vast!  Take Lewis & Clark, Egyptians, Hebrew text, the Founding Fathers, nano-technology, Yellowstone, a super-secret society, black OPS, and mix them up you'll get this book.  Like I said earlier, I have read Rollin's other work so I expected the same breathless pace.  It was definitely here but in a different spirit.  I'm one of those guys that don't go all \\"ADHD\\" if I don't read a series in order because if a story is good, then it's just that... GOOD!  I can catch up with their history once I catch my breath from their present.<br /><br />So, `The Devil Colony' is a story about a hidden artifact/secret that has roots that date back to BEFORE the thirteen (+1) colonies.  Yes, if found this secret will devastate mankind.  Yes, if found the world will end.  What is fun about this book is HOW it will happen.  How a secret so ancient could be based on a technology not even fully understood yet is brilliant.  How the wisdom of the ancient Native Americans baffles the greatest minds of today makes you wonder if their frightening myths are not just myths after all.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite their ingenious cryptic clues, a secret society is close to gaining access to that clue; and they will stop at nothing to get to it.  Innocent lives don't exist in their vocabulary.  So it becomes a race.  A race to find the hidden spot, a race to decipher the language, a race to stay ahead of the assassins, and a race to stop the world from blowing the hell up.  Faithful fans that have followed Sigma from jump will spend two days (or less) in heaven with their friends.  \\"New\\" fans like me will go back and add a few past Sigma novels to their wish list.  So... bye.don't exist in their vocabulary.  So it becomes a race.

B0051OZ564|2.0|So the best part of this movie was probably the trailer. Usually I'm decently entertained by a movie but this one for some reason made me wish it was over. I can't put my finger on it, and I was a bit disappointed by the end of the movie.    Great visuals, that is about all. I really wish I could say this movie was awesome, but I can't. I'll probably never watch it again, I may watch parts of it though

B003V4AK8E|1.0|I was getting hand cramps from the ps3 controller, so I switched to this hoping it would help that problem. It did, but there's two major problems. First of all is the dead zone in the joysticks, they are real and they are frustrating if your a hardcore gamer- they're very noticeable. Also the right joystick is too far to the left. I have huge hands and I was struggling to use it, to turn the camera left and shoot was a task that seemed nearly impossible. I gave it a few days to see if it grew on me, it didn't and I'm back to the Ps3 controller.     Good luck in your search for a more 360 like controller for ps3... you'll need it.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|I can't say enough on how great this cpu is.  It runs amazing, avg. temps. and with the new Asus new EFI this chip is so easy to OC.  I played with it a bit, but really, you don't need to OC this chip at all besides bragging rights.  I guess I should have gotten the 2600 instead of the 2600k, but for a few bucks more, you can practice overclocking very easily.    No negatives at all.

0882709194|1.0|As much as I love the Origin of Species, I absolutely detest the perversion Ray Comfort has put on this classic work of science. Not only is the specifics absolutely nonsensical, it is a disgrace that making changes to this classic is not entirely illegal without making sure readers know they are buying intelligent design mumbo jumbo. Shame on Ray Comfort for attempting to use these kinds of tactics to convince someone of non-scientific nonsense. It truly is a new low by the intelligent design extremists.    Look somewhere else for a real version of the origin of species. It is truly is a historical piece of scientific document and well worth reading. Just not this version.
B002RWKSII|4.0|This album is exactly what it says it is: Brian Wilson reimagining Gershwin songs.  Brian does his own versions of Gershwin classics, plus two \\"new\\" Gershwin songs. (He and Scott Bennett finished two Gershwin song fragments.)  The album begins and ends with brief excerpts from Gershwin's epic instrumental \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\", and many of the other songs include short excerpts from \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\".  The \\"oldies\\" are all done in interesting ways, particularly the four songs from [[ASIN:6306496238 Porgy & Bess]].  \\"I Loves You Porgy\\" is sung from a woman to a man, but Brian sings it anyway.  \\"I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'\\" is done as a [[ASIN:B00005ASHM Pet Sounds]]-ish instrumental.  This album was obviously a labor of love for Brian Wilson and most of Brian's fans will dig it.
B000M341QE|5.0|The scenario presented by this movie seems like a problem out of game theory, control theory, or non-linear systems.  X has planted a mole to spy on Y, while Y has planted a mole to spy on X.  What are the parameters that correspond to system stability or instability?  Here X is chief bad guy Frank Costello played with malicious relish by Jack Nicholson, who has planted bad cop Matt Damon to spy on the police organization headed by straight arrow Martin Sheen.  Sheen, in turn, sends undercover cop Leonardo Dicaprio to spy on Nicholson.  I am sure that the reader will not be surprised to learn that this system does not prove to be stable--for if it were, from whence would come the carnage for which the movie-goer yearns?  Oh, and added to this strategic mix is Mark Wahlberg as the maverick investigator who will just not take \\"no\\" for an answer!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book. Donoghue has an amazing imagination and an incredible way of explaining things from a child's perspective. I found myself unable to put the book down. Loved it from beginning to end. The progress of the child is realistic, his learning curve is natural for him. I just found it a delight. Just amazing!
B004GYOQ6A|1.0|I don't see how this game can be fun. I played it for a little bit and didn't find it to be the least bit interesting or fun.  You just go through maze after maze after maze after maze. There are many great alternative games to waste time that are actually fun. This is not worth it for free and for $4 I would actually have more fun watching 4 $1 bills burn.
B002ZG980U|2.0|If you're captivated by debating which parts were dreams, dreams squared, or dreams cubed, then the comic book store still holds sway over your disposable income.     If you believe Inception's time fictions and twists are ingenious, then you've never seen La Jetee.    If you think Dom and Mal are searingly complex, then you haven't watched In The Mood For Love or 2046.    If you think there's anything happening underneath the surface of Inception, anything at all that required dreamscapes, memory, projection, or self-deception, then you either haven't caught or didn't understand Waking Life, Heavenly Creatures, Mulholland Drive, and Billy Liar.    And if you think all the aforementioned films are indie, international and hifalutin, go see The Limey and learn what flashbacks are for in an action film.    Because Inception spends all its time on one ludicrous goal (in reality, at the highest levels of management, multinationals consider divesting assets all the time, no first-world government is going to allow for \\"an energy monopoly,\\" and we're expected to believe the \\"second place\\" company is willing to engage in sabotage for moral reasons and/or market advantage, and their best shot is to get Company Number One to sell off assets...let's just move on).     And that's before we get to the whopping screenplay problem: once we know Leo misses the kids, the film has to resolve there...dream or no dream, the end is spelled out in the first ten minutes, and the rest is pyrotechnics, explanations, and waiting for the inevitable.     So what are we left with? A possibly imagined billionaire believes an intuition planted in a dream, and Leo remains trapped in a dream, possibly willingly. Because dreams are, like, this double-edged sword, dude.     Inception gets two stars for looking great, but it can't get more, not when it's a meaningless, unimaginative film, wholly taken with its own logistics.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|\\"Independence Day\\" is one of those movies that I can watch anytime, even if we had recently seen it. This is just a fun movie that has a very likeable cast, great special effects, exciting action scenes, a lot of humor, and more scientific flaws and plot holes than just about any movie other than [[ASIN:B0000AKCKM The Core (Widescreen Edition)]] (which was not a fun movie to watch, even the first time).<br /><br />The plot is fairly straight forward, aliens are here and they do not come in peace. With their overwhelming technology (remember, they brought their entire civilization light-years across the vastness of space in ships 1/6 the mass of the moon), they should be able to easily wipe out mankind and just take what they want, but they obviously didn't count on Will Smith (a very self confident fighter pilot) and Jeff Goldblum (an under achieving technical genius) to team up against them. There are a lot of plot devices to move the show along, mostly in the form of a string of improbable coincidences, stereotypical characters, and unlikely technical wizardry.<br /><br />All that taken into consideration, this is still an incredibly watchable and enjoyable movie (we own it on DVD, Blu-Ray, and have even used \\"On-Demand\\" to watch it on my PC when stranded in an airport).<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0048IMZMG|1.0|Taylor Swift is a nightmare of awfulness.  Her voice is awful.  Her songwriting is absolutely terrible.  Every song is incredibly lame and sounds the same as the one before it.  Her billionaire father purchased a career for her spoiled brat little daughter and now the American public has to suffer her brutal sonic assault on our radios and ears.<br /><br />All these fools giving overblown positive reviews are either paid shills or agents working for her lame record company.  She actually has a section on her website that instructs her stupid little fans to go out on the internet and combat, flood, or refute negative criticism of her pathetic product.<br /><br />She's terrible.  Her music is awful.  Don't buy into this stuff.

B001HN6922|5.0|The original [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars]] had great animation going for it, with all the detail and spirit that Pixar has led us to expect. The story tended toward the drab, however - a stick-by-you-friends plot elevated past ordinary only by its Pixar presentation. Enjoyable, on the whole, but not epochal. Given the near inevitability of sequel slump, my hopes for Cars 2 were only a little higher than what I expected of the theater's popcorn.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. The car in-jokes were better, the plot had more to keep me paying attention, and pitting the James Bond crowd against the Bondo set worked brilliantly. Jokes about lemon cars mingled easily with an eco-message, as the two major plots (racing & spy stuff) advanced individually and jointly. The fact that Mater took the lead this time only added to the charm. It's not always the smartest or strongest who saves the day. Whatever you do well will matter some day, and just a little bravery can stop cold anyone with none at all.<br /><br />Beautifully made and kid-safe, this one blows the doors off its predecessor. Oh, and the \\"Hawaiian Vacation\\" short rose to Pixar's stratospheric standards for short films.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B0057UVLQ0|4.0|I was a little dissappointed at the moderate cussing, wish it wasn't there, BUT \\"love you like a love song\\" is my new favorite song. I won't be buying the entire album because of the language but I hope that Selena can keep making awesome music like this.
B004XS97QS|5.0|So far I've watched the first 7 episodes of the HD version.  Loved it.    When David Tennant left the series a couple years ago, I was skeptical about how well Matt Smith would fill his shoes.     Matt Smith is superb as Doctor Who. And the ensemble cast (Karen Gillan, Arthur Darville, Alex Kingston) is great as well.     One negative is that, when I downloaded the HD episodes to my Tivo Series 3, they were so jittery that I couldn't watch them on my Tivo. I ended up streaming the episodes to my Roku player, which was a fairly good experience. But generally I prefer to watch HD movies/shows, that I've purchased, via download instead of streaming, since downloads guarantee that you get the best HD video quality (streaming will dynamically lower the video quality if the current streaming bandwidth is not high enough).
B0045HCJKS|5.0|Kind of ironic how this film was directed by the same man that one day would write books about theme parks where dinosaurs run rampant. Yul Brynner was perfect at the demonically robotic gunslinger and both James Brolin and Richard Benjamin did greast jobs as the hapless vacationers who are terrorized once the park goes berserk. I wish one day a special edition of this great film would be released. I know there is a \\"making of\\" dvd about the film but the docu is kind of vague and doesn't do the film justice. Also the price was great.

(Mounting the H4N to a Canon 7D DSLR, very common since the audio quality is so great!) Also is a great quality mic to do voice overs into, which means you then just need one mic on a small shoot instead of a shotgun mic and a wireless mic for your voice overs.

B0041YI4ZO|4.0|Good martial arts flick and nice to see that a decendant of Ip Man was asked to play a character (Ip Chun plays Leung Bik) within the film. I wish it had followed more closely to the actual story of his life but I understand the \\"Hollywood spin on things\\" no matter if it is an American one or a Chinese one. I was impressed with the film's dipiction of Wing Chun and the \\"adaptation thoughts\\" that Leung Bik plants in Ip Man. Adaptation is afterall the corner stone of Jeet Kun Do, the martial art made famous by Bruce Lee, the most famous student of Ip Man. All in all, I would have to say that it is a film very much worth your time to not only see but own for future viewings.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Super addictive game, for those of you who played the PC and DS version, this is very similar.  The music is excellent, as is the gameplay.  One downer is this appears to be only for phones.  I tried this on my Galaxy Tab 10.1, and while it works, the graphics are big and blurry.  I hope the authors update this to use hi-res graphics.
0756404738|2.0|I seriously loved the first book and was completely taken with the characters and story line.  I was fully expecting this series to win a permanent space on my bookshelf.  Having said that, the 2nd book was a fun read...but the sex was SO overdone--come on Patrick, clean it up a tad!  If someone wants to read 300 pages of sex, then they can buy a book in a different genre.      I liked the first book enough to be excited for the next book, but I was generally disappointed with TWMF.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|This is a wonderful evolution and expansion of Bon Iver's sound, and I was thoroughly captivated from start to finish. Resist the urge to compare this with For Emma, Forever Ago. That was a lightning-in-a-bottle moment that can't (and won't) be repeated, because it captured a moment in time -- and this is another: equally beautiful, strikingly arranged and exquisitely melodic. The lyrics stand apart as the most poetic and impressionistic in contemporary music. Ignore these insane one-star reviews. This is a stunning achievement and Justin Vernon proves he's in it for the long haul and no one-hit wonder: easily one of the best albums so far this year.
1401924352|5.0|Truly an amazing book. Maybe its not a great peace of \\"literature\\", but its a book that can change your life if you read it carefully and absorb the message she is trying to portray. After reading this I really changed the way I think and live my life. I'm more positive and I really love myself and accept myself. I think thats one of the most important things in life, and if it helped me it could really help you. Glad I bought this, I had been waiting for it to be released for a while.
B004GYOQ6A|4.0|Fun game, works fine on the Samsung Charge. Not sure if I would pay for it, but for a free app not bad.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Over sized boobs... I feel that this kinda ruined it I enjoyed the action, story, charactors, but its just wierd... I mean big boob girls fighting zambies with almost nothing on... uh? What was I talking about? Oh right, hope there's a season two. A cup or B cup girls plz C is fine too just don't over do with with double D's
0316056863|5.0|A must-read! Tina Fey is as funny on the page as she is performing on television, so this book is best for fans of 30 Rock and her work on SNL.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a classic teen comedy directed by the late John Hughes and stars Matthew Broderick, Mia Sara, Alan Ruck, Jeffrey Jones, Edie McClurg and Ben Stein and features a cameo appearance by the infamous \\"Tiger-Blooded\\" trainwreck Charlie Sheen. This flim involves high schooler Ferris Bueller, who is an expert at cutting classes by staying home and travel around Chicago with his two friends, at the displeasure of his principal, who will stop at nothing to get Ferris at his game. The special features includes a behind the scenes look of the film, interviews with Broderick, Hughes, Ruck, McClurg and a Ben Stein featurette. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is, quite possibly, one of the best Chicago movies ever made. :)
B004UOCF3W|5.0|An absolute must for your Foo library, simple as that.  My top three (for now) Arlandria, Back & Forth and Walk.
B000000ISM|5.0|I'll start by saying that I'm an audiophile and I like '80s music, particularly pop and metal, so this album fits the bill. This album is rare but if you manage to find a copy for under $45, you'll be VERY lucky. I paid that much for this album, and boy was it worth every cent. This album personifies what all music should sound like once released on CD. Unfortunately not many people care about fidelity in their music, they're too busy worrying about capacity, not quality. I really wish more of my favorite artists were available from Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. I once checked out the original CD release of Hysteria by Def Leppard from the library (not the one I'm reviewing). I still have it ripped to my computer in an uncompressed AIFF format for comparison with this one. I listened to this entire album after I got it and also ripped it uncompressed, as I do with all my music. I will tell you that this CD is 40% (or more) rich in sound, the vocals are absolutely phenomenal, and everything is just better than it's 1987 counterpart (this one was released in 1993). I recommend this rare album to anyone who cares about audio fidelity, that likes Def Leppard, and/or metal music from the 1980s.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The thing about this game that I truly love is that it runs well on my older phone (versus angry birds which needs more power for sure). Also the hundreds of levels which never get old make this my go to game when I need to kill some time.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|I loved getting this from my husband for our anniversary. I love this show and I want to watch it over and over again!!!    I left off a star because although all the episode were there and were as awesome as I remember. There weren't to many extra features like subtitles featurettes or languages or anything.     But most episodes had deleted scenes. And the last disc had three different extra features where the actress talked and everything.
0790731940|5.0|DVD came promptly after we ordered it.  No problems with shipper or the movie.  Case is not a typical hard plastic case.  I believe it's a paper snap case.  But no worries.  We bought the movie, not the case.  Looks great and we all enjoyed it!
1932100660|1.0|I ran across the raw data for this book and was very disappointed. The data is contradicts everything this book claims. What this book does prove is that data can easily be skewed in anyway (in this case pro vegetarian)in order to prove a false hypothesis and turn a profit. The data actually suggests that those who participated in all plant based diets were actually at the highest rate of CVD. Those with the highest levels of animal fats, proteins, and other animal based nutrients showed a dramatic decrease in cases of CVD. This book is a great example of marketing, and truly a success, but I would be skeptical about it's message. Reading this book leaves out lots of data points and leads the reader to one conclusion, while a quick look at the whole data set argues  strongly against the major hypothesis of this book. Look for the data and see what you think, it's eyeopening. Also check out the documentary \\"Fat Head\\" for an alternative opinion on the basis behind the China study.
0740797719|5.0|Gave this to my brother.  He is an artist and really appreciated the artists insight into working with light and color.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|As a longtime Trek-watcher , i found this \\"neo-Trek\\" movie a GREAT addition to the family of TREK . original characters , places kept well to the series . Now the BOOK readers may have more to say , but i found this an EXCELLENT \\"alternative-timeline\\" story to build a TREK future on . few characters left out , but the \\"flavor\\" of the original accentuated some  and still believable . WRECKING the beautiful corvette must be sacrilege to antique owners !!  But sure opens movie with proper \\"mood\\" .<br />  Still \\"David & Goliath\\" story as well ....  \\"OH CRAP !! what have we gotten into ??!!\\" taken a little step further ; well & GOOD .<br />  not quite a \\"family\\" flick , thoe . A couple scenes not for youngsters . others seem built FOR younger kiddos ; scotty's little \\"helper\\" certainly a cute addition .... yeah !! buy the movie and go find him/her :o)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|One of my favorite apps. After looking at all the sticky's on my desk, I realized how useful this could be on my phone.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The movie opening will certainly set the WILD RIDE of near boredom scenes preceding WILD ACTION and humor that will knock your socks off !! John Malcovic may not be the big character , but will leave you in stitches !!<br />  yep , alot seems cornball and is part of the appeal . Bruce Willis sells the action still and gives a minimalist style personality to great action . when Debb has a bad day at work , she wants humor a EXPLOSIONS ; it work to cheer her heart .<br />  ENJOY !! and dont forget the pop KETTLEKORN
B0055FR5PS|4.0|The first half of the movie is lagging and not at all intense. There were some scenes which I thought were a little too much like the staff sergeant tying the shoe lace of the kid while trying to console the kid. I get the idea behind it, but it was a little too much and unnatural, I think.     The second half of the movie after the protagonist takes the charge (as staff sergeant), is on a whole different level. Its good. Inspirational speech (or I think it is just venting his feelings out), great ending to the movie are big pluses.     I definitely recommend to watch this if you like action/alien/military genres. cheers.
