B009M7G1PU|3.0|I purchased this book because amazon recommended it, loved that it was $1. I really enjoyed the story and the character development I just wish someone would have spent an hour or two fixing the horrid quantity of typos. Going to look to Project Gutenberg for my classic e books instead...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I give coin.dozer a 162738991927352810 of 1 my little brother takes my k and runs to his room and plays out all my #!$ coins
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Really need your spouse to read it with you, mine wouldn't. It does help a woman out but it take two to tango not one.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought this watch to wear on a daily basis.<br /><br />I was concerned when I bought it about it's ability to stay accurate over time due to the fact that it's so inexpensive, but so fat it is withing -10sec/week, which isn't bad considering it's less than a minute a month and I can re-synchronize it whenever I change the date for the months that have less than 31 days.<br /><br />I've been wearing the watch for more than a month and I have already given it a couple smacks on some hard metal shelves and door frames that were hard enough I was afraid to look, but it didn't get a scratch and it is still keeping time the same as when I first started using it.<br /><br />I've gone as much as 36hrs with it sitting idle on a desk and it was still ticking and had an accurate time when I picked it up to wear it again.  I work in grocery retail so I'm pretty active and my hands and arms are moving a lot. I imagine if I was working in an office or in school I wouldn't be active enough to keep it wound, but that's just an assumption.<br /><br />My work environment is business casual, so this is a perfect watch to go with my work clothes. I don't think it would make good formal wear, but considering today's fashion, I'm sure someone could pull it off.<br /><br />While I liked the band it came with, it was cheap looking (but still durable) and I wanted to dress it up a bit. I was also concerned about possibly snagging the watch on something and pulling a spring bar loose and having the watch fall to the ground and get damaged on a hard floor (not because the spring bars or the watch seemed likely to fail, it's just something I'm paranoid about), so I bought a leather nato style watch band that looks much dressier and would also prevent the watch from falling off my wrist if a spring bar failed.<br /><br />Lastly, the clear glass back is awesome. Most people don't know what an auto winder is so it's nice to be able to show them instead of trying to come up with a brief description they would understand in passing.<br /><br />Overall I give this watch 5 stars and I would recommend it to anyone interested in an affordable mechanical watch that can take a little abuse and still keep on ticking.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|super entertaining.why is there a required word count when a 1 or 2 word blurb is all most people have the attention for?
B004WY2M8I|5.0|Was kinda disappointed when i finished totally enjoyed reading this whole series.  Would recommend this to everyone i know. AWSOME
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Suspenseful throughout the entire story but unsatisfying conclusion... if you can call it that. Overall, I'd say it was worth reading but not a favorite.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Favorite qpp I use 5his the most I have lots of bools and I constantly read from my phone love it
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While I did enjoy the book, I was rather disappointed in the ending. It was a bit convoluted and hard to follow, but in the final pages it did finally come together in a fairly coherent form.
0345803485|3.0|I read the books from the 50 Shades trilogy. It was entertaining. I resembles twilight but hey, I had fun with that to. If you are looking for great writing than stay away. That's not what the book is about. I finished it wanting the books to be more, to be better. For starters I wish she wouldn't flush, blush, stare at her finger, bite her lips or hug herself so much. I could do without the \\"Jeez\\", \\"Holly S***\\", \\"Cra*\\", \\"Damn\\", \\"Argh\\".I wanted him to stop with the grin and half smiles. I hoped his eyes weren't always, ALWAYS, described as gray. I wanted her not to be so young and him not to be so rich. 100K an hour, seriously? The guy isn't even 30 years old. I'd remove the free propaganda for Audi, Apple and Blackberry. And the recurring one-line emails (with full header and signature. Can't she text him? The contract also needs to go. I want to put a silver tape on the half moon glass subconscious's mouth. But above all, my primary issue is making the inner goddess shut up! I gave it a shot at FiftyShadesBetter blogspot. A story free of all this nonsense. If you wanted more out of this book you might actually enjoy my story. If you just want this trilogy to go away, let me entertain you before you leave. There are 58 quotes of the inner goddess (just in book one). Join me in wanting FiftyShadesBetter writing:<br />1 of 58: My very small #innergoddess sways in a gentle victorious samba.<br />2 of 58: My #innergoddess glares at me, tapping her small foot impatiently.<br />3 of 58: He groans again. Ha! My #innergoddess is thrilled. I can do this.<br />4 of 58: My #innergoddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves.<br />5 of 58: My #innergoddess has stopped dancing and is staring too, mouth open and drooling slightly.<br />6 of 58: I sashay into the house, part of me wanting to jump and punch the air. YES! My #innergoddess is thrilled.<br />7 of 58: My #innergoddess sits in the lotus position looking serene.<br />8 of 58: My #innergoddess nods in silent zen-like agreement with her.<br />9 of 58: My #innergoddess is jumping up and down, clapping her hands like a five-year-old.<br />10 of 58: My #innergoddess stops jumping and smiles serenely. Oh yes... she mouths, nodding at me smugly.<br />11 of 58: My #innergoddess shakes her head at me. She and I know it's a lie.<br />12 of 58: My #innergoddess glows so bright she could light up Portland.<br />13 of 58: My #innergoddess makes a very vulgar and unattractive gesture at him with her fingers.<br />14 of 58: My #innergoddess frowns at me. You can do this, she coaxes.<br />15 of 58: My #innergoddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms shouting yes at me.<br />16 of 58: Christian does not glance at me. My #innergoddess is not pleased.<br />17 of 58: My #innergoddess is doing back flips in a routine worthy of a Russian Olympic gymnast.<br />18 of 58: My #innergoddess smacks her lips together glowing with pride.<br />19 of 58: My #innergoddess bounces up and down like a small child waiting for ice cream.<br />20 of 58: I squirm. My #innergoddess is panting.<br />21 of 58: Oh the possibilities... my #innergoddess roars.<br />22 of 58: My #innergoddess is going to explode.<br />23 of 58: My #innergoddess looks like someone snatched her ice cream.<br />24 of 58: My #innergoddess has woken and is paying attention.<br />25 of 58: Do it! My #innergoddess pleads with me.<br />26 of 58: My #innergoddess is prostrate... well at least she's quiet.<br />27 of 58: Bewitched... my #innergoddess is staring open-mouthed. Even she doesn't believe this.<br />28 of 58: My #innergoddess is lying on, eating grapes and tapping her fingers, waiting not so patiently for Sunday.<br />29 of 58: My #innergoddess is beside herself, hopping from foot to foot.<br />30 of 58: Go girl! My #innergoddess has her pom poms in hand - she's in cheerleading mode.<br />31 of 58: My #innergoddess is spinning like a world-class ballerina, pirouette after pirouette.<br />32 of 58: My #innergoddess has a `do not disturb' sign on the outside of her room.<br />33 of 58: My #innergoddess grins at me. Hell... two can play that particular game.<br />34 of 58: My #innergoddess sighs with relief.<br />35 of 58: Fortunately, he seems oblivious to her, but my #innergoddess is smoldering and not in a good way.<br />36 of 58: My #innergoddess nods in agreement, a satisfied grin over her face.<br />37 of 58: My #innergoddess pops her head above the parapet.<br />38 of 58: My #innergoddess pouts at me, failing miserably to hide her disappointment.<br />39 of 58: My #innergoddess is doing the dance of the seven veils.<br />40 of 58: My #innergoddess glares at me in desperation.<br />41 of 58: No my #innergoddess scowls at me, not too beautiful for me.<br />42 of 58: My #innergoddess is still basking in a remnant of post-coital glow.<br />43 of 58: My #innergoddess leaps up cheering from her chaise longue.<br /><br />44 of 58: My #innergoddess gazes at him in quiet, surprised speculation.<br />45 of 58: Truth or dare time - my subconscious and #innergoddess glance nervously at one another.<br />46 of 58: My #innergoddess pole-vaults over the fifteen-foot bar.<br />47 of 58: My #innergoddess is standing on the podium awaiting her gold medal.<br />48 of 58: My #innergoddess has back flipped off the podium and is doing cartwheels around the stadium.<br />49 of 58: My #innergoddess - she's under a blanket behind the sofa.<br />50 of 58: Jeez, my #innergoddess swoons.<br />51 of 58: My #innergoddess is hopeful for one type of mood, my subconscious, like me, is fraught with nerves.<br />52 of 58: a look of sensual carnality that calls directly to my #innergoddess<br />53 of 58: I try to connect with my inner sub. She's there somewhere, hiding behind my #innergoddess<br />54 of 58: My #innergoddess is swaying and writhing to some primal carnal rhythm.<br />55 of 58: My #innergoddess closes her eyes, reveling in the feel of his lips on me.<br />56 of 58: My #innergoddess is endeavoring to lookbrave.<br />57 of 58: My subconscious is shaking her head sadly, and my #innergoddess is nowhere to be seen.<br />58 of 58: Deep down, a nasty, unbidden thought comes from my #innergoddess, her lip curled in a snarl. End of book one.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Charlaine could have wrote the first 300 pages into one chapter.<br />So bogas. Old characters fly in, chat, have a really well described<br />meal, fly out and bla bla bla. I was so disappointed in the writing.<br />I didn't care who Sookie ended up with, but the the whole book just<br />fizzeled out. Bummed. Should have been titled &#34;Dead For Ever After<br />in the Water&#34;.
B00008G7UF|5.0|A favorite of mine for years, just had to own it on DVD! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lighthearted fun funny movie.
B008602KQI|3.0|Heard great reviews, got very excited and then watched it.....3 star rating just because it was not boring, but it certainly did not meet expectations.
B008NMT684|4.0|Pefect for a three year old when you are trying to get them interested in putting puzzles together. She enjoys doing them by herself.
B00669MFA2|5.0|Movies 6 and 7 are just simply well done... Cinematic elements are great in part 1 and 2, almost better than all the other movies..
B008ALAHA4|4.0|I have a spare power supply for a MacBook Pro laying around the house, and a brand new shiny MacBook Air from work.  I thought it would be great if I didn't have to haul the power supply for the Air back and forth from work to home and back.  But, there was one problem, the connection had changed and I really didn't want to pay full price for a whole new brick.  After a bit of searching I found that Apple had in fact made this adapter that lets you use an older MagSafe power supply with a MagSafe 2 computer.<br /><br />I did notice that the two power blocks that I have are different sizes/wattages so I had a little concern over using the much bigger brick with the MBA and burning it out.  After asking Apple directly about this they assured me the MBA would only draw as much power as it needed, no more.  So it's perfectly safe to use the bigger brick with the smaller machine.<br /><br />The adapter came in at $10 for me which is a lot cheaper than a whole new power supply.  So it wins out on that front, and lets me re-use existing hardware instead of further cluttering my house.<br /><br />The downside of this adapter is that it is tiny and only secures itself by magnets to both the power supply and the laptop.  This makes me worry that if I trip on a cable it might pop off and go flying, or I may set it aside by accident and have a hard time finding it.  Or I might stick it in a laptop bag and it'll go hiding in one of the corners.<br /><br />So, definitely some concerns about the size of the adapter and the ease with which I might lose it.  But, kudos to Apple for making an inexpensive adapter when they changed the connection type, and it does work brilliantly.
030758836X|5.0|haven't read it yet....  I'm saving it to read outdoors on the Deck. When I finally get the patio furniture out..
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The Hunger Games was the first movie we watched on amazon instant. The movie was good and the picture and video quality were equal to watching a DVD.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|A surprising, charming, thoughtful movie....an interesting follow-up to the original.  Realistic in its portrayal of heartbreak following the tragic death of a loved one, and the physical and emotional price paid by the surviving partner.  It's always uplifting to think that everyone has a second act and a second chance at love!  A very cute movie which I highly recommend..however, it definitely helps to have seen the first one to put everything in context and to understand the doctor's current outlook on life.  It's always refreshing to have a happy ending in a gay movie..so many seem to have the opposite.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|This is the second season for the girls  and it was just as intresting as the first. The ending of this season make you ready to see more and I can not wait.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|My grandson says it is the great.  He plays it all the time and does great and he is 6.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|I found this book very interesting . I really enjoyed the different<br />Types of God's created in this story. I was sad to be finished.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I loved everything about this and can't wait to get any future copies when they are available. Will be watching for the series to come on tv.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I love all of her books and really hate to see them come to an end. It is like loosing an old friend.

Thanks for giving me hope in music again.<br /><br />Jackie S.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Fun to take your anger out on him by pulling his tail, but he purrs so cute when you rub his head.
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Having said that, so you know my bias, this story is a study of cruelty.  Two grown men tantalizing two young teens and finally ruining their lives.....brrrrrrr
B000001F45|4.0|This was a very good album when I was growing up and is still a good album. If you like lots of great synthesizer music then you will love it.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I liked being able to take it with me, and not have a bulky book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After many years of waiting, reading and rereading the entire series.....its finally over. I'm satisfied more with this last book than the last 3 books. Brandon Sanderson did a fantastic job building upon Robert Jordan's story line and notes.
B002APU580|5.0|What can you say about Jane Austen............this is my favorite.  It just comes to life in this adaptation.  Love it!
B002R25THI|5.0|I remember seeing this in a movie theater as a young girl, along with my best friend and my mom. We literally jumped out of our seats at &#34;that moment&#34; in the film. What fun. What great memories. So innocent compared to today's too scary films. Gotta love Hebpurn, Crenna and Arkin in this film. Great vintage... and so revealing about the times.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great book like most of Nicholas Sparks books.  I couldn't put it down for a few hours one day.
B004G0DN7W|5.0|Anything with Yul in it deserves to be enjoyed at least once. This, maybe one hundred times. Maybe more. Just watch it.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|You get why you pay for... The quality of this<br />Movie is very poor. Lines are visible on the screen, color is horrible and the sound is hard to understand.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|It is an easy program for my kids to use.  I love seeing them work at problem solving to get all of the pigs.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|Great last book, tied up the loose ends nicely and everyone lives (or stays dead) happily ever after, and Sookie gets the best man in the end. :)
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Cannot wait to watch it again!! Dave Grohl at his best. An absolute must-see for any person who listens to music.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|this game is amazing but i think to make the game even better is to let  the player make his\her own player and clothes and names and have a pet helper to help take care of the lost animals and help its owner and this game needs an upgrade to complete my opinion thank you for understanding  and i hope you people will agree to my review and decide to use it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is awesome! Well written and filmed, this show is filled with wit as well as showing true human emotion in the characters. I recommend this show to anyone who loves a good mystery and to laugh along the way!
B00873GRU4|4.0|Difficult to put down once you are into the story which happens in the first two chapters.  The start is an interesting twist, not what was expected.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Who would not love Mary Poppins!  I wish I had her as a relative in my family.  Timeless and priceless movie ...
B00985E3UG|3.0|I knew processed foods were bad for us, but this book looks at everything that goes on behind the scenes. It was interesting to learn about the history behind some of my favorite childhood foods.<br />At times the book was a little slow and it felt like it ended abruptly. I love that author took tine to define scientific and industry terms and abbreviations in easy everyday language
B001QW8QYS|5.0|A great biblical love story that can be seen by all ages.  It is true biblical depiction.  I wish it was longer in length!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I wish it was longer but I loved the puzzles! Not too easy, not too hard. I can't wait  for more games.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I LOVE THIS. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IN THE WORLD. I ALWAYS LOVE COMPETING AND BREEDING ALL THIS DRAGONS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT GET IT
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I absolutely love Game of Thrones. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. The First Season is just the start to complete amazingness ;)
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I got this game for my son and he loves it. Nice game, and easy to play. I would reccomend it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|AWESOME SEASON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE GAME OF THRONES!! i can not resist watching them over and over again. I def recommend this
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Inspiring, funny, meaningful with great depth.  Made real as it was based on a true story.  If only there were more films like this.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|best app ever? maybe if it came with a coupon for free stuff :D<br />The fraction part is really good. My son uses it for school (i had to use my brain dealie).
B003M6EAXM|4.0|I  have watched all 8 seasons of 24 and have enjoyed them very much, Season 8 is pretty much the same action as the others, but for al the things that happen wouldn't all happen in 24 hours. Perhaps over a period of a week. Even though it is pretty unbelievable I enjoy the series. It has lots of action and drama.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series has a nice balance of action, comedy, and drama.  They manage to create an old west feel in a futuristic Sci-fi series; which is not an easy task.  The characters are all unique and the cast was chosen well.  There are nice subplots and even some entertaining twists on society.
B00133KFGW|5.0|August Rush is one of the best movies I've ever seen!  A musically gifted orphan boy believes his mother is still alive, so he sets off to find her.  All along the way, he can feel the music in his soul. The rich, imaginative concepts of music and love presented in this film will refresh your soul!
B0033AI48Y|1.0|Unfortunately the Blu-ray is coded in American system which means that I can not use it at all.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Runar
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love hill climb its the best car app i have ever had amd my coisin showed me it and its so fun and i love love it it makes me happy happy happy
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app!! It's easy to use and is great to keep in touch with friends!! I have a friend in London, and it used to be hard to talk to her because I didn't have long distance!! Now I can talk to her all I want :)
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|work great we got a new puppy and he ate my other one, was able to patch it together till the new one came.Was suprised to have received it so quickly
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Wonderful portrayal of bipolar disorder as well as alternative therapies that can be used to treat the disorder easily! Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper were fantastic as always
B00A8ECU24|5.0|If your a fan of mlp then you will love this game and that it will entertain you for  hours
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|This game isn't all that bad.  I never played the story through, so I won't regard that.  About the multiplayer, let me start with explaining some pros and cons.  This game has rediculously good graphics for a kindle game!!  It also has a fully customizable control system and HUD, so the game is very controllable and easy to play.  The concept is brilliant.  Now for the dark side of the moon, the overall experience.  They charge $7 for the game and still continue to charge rediculously high prices for coins to buy things.  The problem here is this, if you don't buy your way to the top, you're gong to sink to the bottom.  Sure you can earn the coins, but it's a tediously long process.  To top it off, any weapon worth using is 80,000 coins.  If you buy any under that, it will be taboo and non practical in the world of MC4.  &quot;I'll just earn the 80,000 points and perform as the best players do&quot;.  Sure that's great and all, but this promotes a game where only 1-3 weapons are remotely effective.  My biggest problem is, this game is literally ONE BIG SCAM.  This game ended up annoying me to the point where I just quit all together.  Play at your own risk, the multiplayer has little to do with player skill and is filled with people who took the easy way and paid big money money to big daddy Gameloft.  Great graphics, smooth gameplay, but the experience this game provides is the worst.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Beautiful use of chronodisplacement!<br />Having lived through the time span as a youthful adult, the portrayal of the zeitgeist was spot on.<br />A great read that I was sad to see end.<br />King's best in quite a while.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have several places for family members on this and can go to that site and see what the weather is.  Also like it for locally where I live.
B007HO392S|5.0|Great album Carrie. You have a fantastic voice. I thought you would win female vocalist of the year at the awards show. Hope you get it next year. Oklahoma thanks you to for your donation of a million dollars.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|The cast of characters is too numerous to keep in mind.  In the early part too many French words and their explanations.  A pretty good yarn if you can wade through the detail.
B00637D114|5.0|Not the old smurfs, at least like we grew up with.same characters and all, but all-around seemed like a good flick.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I really enjoyed this story.  The characters were really different and well drawn out.  I loved how the author connected them all to each other and the story. As a real book lover, the bookstore was the best character of them all.  The relationship between the ancient and the newest technologies was well written.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I am 12 yrs old and I love wonder zoo.. It is one of my favorite games.  A few things I dont like are: if you have a kindle you cant get the free daily peanuts, It is way to easy to accidentally use your peanuts which are way to hard to get unless you use real money which I cant. It is frustrating when you are saving up for something that you can only get using peanuts and you think you hit go on a quest and it says you skipped it and takes your peanuts. They need a do you really want to do this button then I would give it 5 stars
B004OBQDHK|5.0|Point Break Blu-Ray.  If you need more convincing, you don't want this.  Great movie to play in the background if you're waxing your stick.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This is so cute, even my parrot loves it! He really gets excited when the cat tells him what a pretty bird he is. Fun for me too!
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Great TV Show...<br /><br />Great show, they should have kept the character Corin Nemec played--- Jonas Quinn...<br /><br />Don S. Davis, made the show believable.<br /><br />Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, Richard Dean Anderson
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Great soundtrack! But I'm still trying to find an album recorded by the current Broadway cast. This great masterpiece never ceases to impress me! Every time I'm in New York I go to see it!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book had me so emotional, in a good way. I couldn't put it down! It is one of the best books I've read this year.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|Steve Martin, Rick Morales, John Belushi, and many more, plus they have a Tupperware party! And, Audrey II is the best!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations. It had me from beginning to end. I hope there will be other books with these characters.
B000007WQB|1.0|I love Dionne Warwick's pure and beautiful voice. I don't own the CD but have listened to samples available from online music shops and the tracks, to me, do not seem to be the 'original hits' you hear on the radio.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! It had me from beginning to end. I hope there will be other books with these characters.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This book does a great job mocking all of the tropes of sci fi shows (especially Star Trek).  It is really funny and lever.  I definitely didn't expect it to go the way it did.  Also, the 3 codas gave an interesting perspective on the effects of the story and were really well written for greatly varying perspectives.
0142424277|5.0|My son has read many other Roald Dahl books and wasn't disappointed by this one: \\"I liked it because she can lift things with her eyes. I also liked that she played tricks on her mom and dad. Most of the parts were funny.\\"
B001XV09UG|1.0|This was a real disappointment...they are both good actors, but they certainly didn't need to be, for this film. I didn't see a rating, but I know where I would place it!
B009NY43NY|1.0|This was my least favorite book of the series...  And I really dislike how she wrapped it all up... Wish I didn't spend the money
B009R659L8|5.0|This was another one of her books I could not put down.  This book had me guessing throughout about certain characters, some of my hunches were wrong.  There were a lot of twists and turns.  It was a great book and her books are at the top of the list for me.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Can't beat it.  Clean design, Good charging time and holds charge for that on the go in a hurry trip that always seems that you forget to do something.<br /><br />Saved my bacon already for a couple trips.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Just getting into this series but really enjoying it.  I would recommend this series to everyone.  Plan to continue watching till done
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love C Harris's books. consistent all the way through. characters developed well. the Sookie we know and love was back. Just fun to read
B006MW3UZW|3.0|The second season on Downton Abbey is much more like a soap opera.  Assorted love stories and affairs threaten to derail some character's lives.  While not as enjoyable as the first season, I believe Downton Abbey is still one of the better shows on TV (though that may not be as much of an endorsement as a commentary on the lack of good programming)
B0044IABFS|3.0|While it is still enjoyable it lacks the suspense and drama of the previous seasons. I have only 2 more episodes to watch. I have watched all of the previous seasons within the past month. It was so good I couldn't stop.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|The GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS Receiver worked perfectly.  It was easy to set up using MicroSoft Map Point. Unfortunately my computer display was not bright enough to view easily while driving. I needed a GPS receier/viewer that was functional and readable while driving.  I do not blame the receier, because it performed exactly as advertised.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book is a great, quick read. It made me laugh from beginning to end! I highly recommend it for anyone!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|As a long time Eagles fan, the documentary and live concert was great. The insight from the actual group members past and current and the mangers and producers past and present were spot on and of course the music as classic as ever.
B00C0YQLDE|3.0|As a HUGE Bonobo fan (have all previous releases) I hafta' say I'm a bit disappointed by this newest release. After 2-3 weeks of listening to North Borders It seems that there are only 3-4 great tracks, none of which compare with older works. Bonobo has always managed to bring passion and head-bobin' beats n'grooves to a genre which often tends to sterility and boredom. Overall I feel this newest album to be a formulaic and tired shadow of previous endeavors, not bad...just not the best Bonobo. SUMMARY: If you Have never listened to Bonobo, don't start here (Black Sands is a good start). If you are already a Bonobo fan, borrow from a friend or listen some other way, and pick tracks. (at least 5 of the songs on this album are pure filler). To be fair the production/sound quality on North Borders is the best to date.<br /><br />Happy Listening!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A careful, sensitive examination of one of our most revered political figures. At the same time engaging and intriguing reading.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book! Very well written, well researched with believable story lines. Can't wait for the final book from this trilogy!
B00BLF9FOK|2.0|I really like Arnold's movies.  Sure, he hams it up, but they do have good action.  While this film has action, the plot is silly.  Seriously, our southern border is so porous, it isn't funny.  The whole idea that this drug lord can only cross the border in this one place is just plain stupid.  The shootout in main street belongs in a cowboy movie and just doesn't translate to the modern day.  I was really disappointed.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was amazing!!!  I couldn't and wouldn't put this book down, it was right up my alley with its honesty and crashness.  I'm offically in love with this author and her writing.  I also absolutely loved Drew's POV, which quite frankly was refreshing.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|First let's start at the beginning.  Everyone in the south is not a stupid hick, as they are portrayed in the movie.  Aside from that, the story just isn't all that interesting.  The characters remind me of the Addams Family, except this movie isn't supposed to be a comedy.  I can't believe all the hype about this movie.  It is all hype.  There is nothing redeeming about this picture.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Truly a great book.  I usually take time finishing books, but I couldn't stop reading this. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great story.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|Simple but well executed. Nice graphics, decent sound, plays well. Nothing particularly innovative about it but it is well done.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Running used to be a passion of mine until bad shoes, bad advice, and many years of training on a bike ruined all of it. This book motivated me and re-kindled my desire to get back in touch with who I really am as an athlete.<br /><br />The book uses a series of stories to tell an all too important story of one aspect of being a human. It brings together a unique set of real life characters that will improve your own personal experience in being a runner or any athlete.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any athlete or coach who is seeking on how to improve their own or their charges performances.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have always loved this game and was very happy to find a version for my KindleFire.  So far I have had no problems.
B005I65BHS|5.0|A novel covering the life of  several generations of American, English, and Russian families, starting just before WWI.  The first two volumes take you through the end of WWII.  I am waiting for the third volume, not yet written.  A master work, reminds me of Buddenbrooks.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|even though the movie was not that great. The sound and image was great. I even was able to use subtitles
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This Cruise movie has a bit less action in it that I thought from viewing the trailer, but it was a great movie to watch with the family.  We all came away with the feeling that it was a well spent 2 hrs.  Tom Cruise is good in this role and continued to be full of surprises throughout the movie.  Great to rent!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a very addicting game. Once I pick it up I don't put it down for hours. It really keeps you on your toes, and the new obstacles are a blast.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I loved this case from day one! The complaints from other reviews regarding charging while closed was easily fixed by simply turning around the Kindle as the case is designed to do. Definitely a 5 star product at fantastic price!!
0316224588|2.0|My first reading of an Ian Rankin mystery. Rankin identifies the culprit near the end but never explains how the culprit was able to avoid suspicion for an extended period of time. This to me is a very unsatisfying detective novel.
B002E01LL6|2.0|The plot moves slowly due to the fact that there is little acting. What acting there is, is weak. With the exception of Terence Howard's portrayal as a hard-luck loser, the producers should've just chucked this movie or found better quality low paid actors. Don't waste your time if you actually like fight movies of quality. Fight Club is, IMHO, the ultimate. The fighting Edward Norton did in his solo scene is far superior to ANY fight scene in this. Straight to dvd? No surprise. Seriously. -.-
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Flight was just an ok Movie. It seemed to be really drawn out and took forever to get to the story.  Not my favorite.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|Very good comeback, not as good as Down on the upside or Superunknown (it's too dificult to par these ones)...I celebrate this comeback
B000I8ERVC|1.0|I don't have too much to say about this movie, mostly because I already wasted too much time simply watching it - I'm not going to waste even more time detailing out the many reasons why I hated it. I just wanted to add my 1-star rating in the hopes of lowering the average. Hopper and Nicholson have performed better on their respective crappers. (I'm not a fan of Fonda's.) This movie was about as bad as watching a stranger's home video of their toddler's first trip to the petting zoo.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|GOOD PRODUCT, I LIKE, WORK WELL AND ...DONT WRITE MORE BECAUSE MY ENGLISH IS BAD, BAY , I LIKE YOUR APPS
B000I8ES2A|5.0|The is a tremendously good sci fi movie that has come to pass in the 21st century. This stuff is real today, amazing what the aliens have taught us about technology, Right?
B007VUCAVO|5.0|IS APP PERFECT, I LIKE VERY VERY MUCH, SHOW ALL PARAMETERS VERY WELL, DONT WRITE MORE BECAUSE MY ENGLISH LANGUAGE  IS BAD
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Although the (Wall-E) Producers firmly deny the Fact that Wall-E is a spin-off or take off of the Robot number 5 from movie \\"SHORT CIRCUIT,\\" they can't deny the similarities and identical personalities! Wall-E sounds and acts almost IDENTICAL to Robot Number #5....do you're own comparison, watch both movies back to back and you'll release the strong similarities! I love both movies and strongly recommend them! Give credit where is DUE!

B00B7FXYJG|5.0|For the story being an animated 2 part feature, it blends in well with the Batman Universe and at times you are entranced by the story you might as well be watching actors in a Batman Movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is so amazing! I enjoy the plot lines and costumes immensely. A must-see for all those who enjoy period dramas!
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|The characters are believable for the Fantasy world they are based in. I liked how seamless the CGI has become.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After reading very good novels written by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, Julia Navarro, Dan Brown, Fernandoa Gamboa, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others, this book was too elementary and predictable.  Don't waste your money on this book,  Don't get discouraged there are plenty of good books around.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Considering all the Fantasy Love stories since Twilight, one of the better ones.Jeremy Irons gives credence to the backdrop story.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm bit sure i like the way it ended but i live that all the loose ends were tied up
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Kids can and should see this as it teaches some simple life issues and the voice actors were spot on for their respective characters.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show only stood for one season and I loved it.  They got you used to the characters right away, story line was entertaining.  Be sure to watch the move that wraps the entire season up.<br />Very good, you should check it out.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Absolutely perfect storyline and seamless action. The world and story presented in this Fantasy Horror story blends easily in this alternate world history.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! its so much fun looking through the different pages and at all the unique places and things to do! then sharing with your friends on facebook!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The second day of the story telling holds your interest as much as the first day. His life story grips the reader and will not let them go. Hard to put down.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|fantastic series............................this has to be one of the best series ever put together, the acting ,it is riveting and captivating.
B003NX76BM|3.0|Did enjoy the book as it kept me interested.  Enjoyed learning what it takes to train dogs, was fascinated with the patience. Though I felt it tortuous waiting for when Fee would finally end up meeting the serial killer!
076790592X|5.0|This book was wonderful! I had to read it for a Death Ed class I had in college! It is full of great lifelong lessons. I wish that I had the chance to meet Morrie in real life.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Probably makes a good photo-editor, but am still looking for a paintbrush program that is compatible with Kindle, so I can select canvas size, tailor colors by Red-Green-Blue combinations, and have all the features found in the MS Windows XP Paint program.  Any suggestions?<br /><br />But for  now, am keeping the photo-editor, because I like it.
1616550414|5.0|Excellent reading material to learn about the history of Hyrule, information about each game currently released, and additional information about the makers of the game! I'm happy with my purchase!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a great book and I definitely recommend it to  anyone!  Story line was good, loved that it was a based on getting hitched in Vegas which happens a lot! #must-read
B001MTENOC|5.0|I am a Christian, but always thought there was something more.  I have always been into apologetics and although this is not that, the case studies brought a new awareness into my life.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Five stars. Why? Because John Green. Once you start reading a John Green book, you must accept, right away, that it will change your perspective, your everyday thoughts, and kinda your life, if you're like me.<br /><br />John Green, what an amazing human being you must be
B009NY43NY|3.0|Anticlimactic, but understandably so as the author was trying to wrap up the series and appease the masses. All things considered not a bad read if you've followed Sookie from the beginning. Can't wait for the supplemental short story to come out in October to fill in some gaps and catch us up on the characters' lives.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Its a good book, gives more then the movie. That's my opinion after reading with book. I usually don't read much books.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you like to solve riddles and puzzles this a game you will enjoy. Definitely exercise the mind. Well worth the price.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|This series keeps up the magic that Dexter has created and leaves us with yet another absolutely shocking cliffhanger ending. Incredible writing and acting.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is much shorter and therefore the character development and story line aren't as detailed.  I have to admit I enjoyed this book more the second time I read it since I understood the main characters a little better and their approach to each other.  The first time I read it I think Gideon's approach was bizarre and thought he might be psycho.  Later in the book you realize why he approached Eva the way he did and it made it a lot easier to enjoy him.  The author could have given a little more background or character development for Gideon but I guess his mysterious ways might appeal to some.  I did enjoy reading this book and really look forward to the next book in the series.
B005S9ELY4|5.0|Very good Blue ray I love it.  It is what I expected from Sean Penn.  He is a great Actor
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|That should pretty much sum it up but I'll add more.  The characters were well developed, story was believable and the romance & sex made it impossible to put the book down.  The author did a great job developing the love story and the male lead character, Travis Maddox...OMG!  This book was a total page turner and even though I read the book several times I can say that each time I found something new that made me love the book even more.  Great story, highly recommend!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|J.J. Abrams might have taken some creative liberty for many trek fans, but that doesn't diminish the fact that this is very entertaining movie that honors the legacy of the Trek series...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was so much better than the first.  By this point you know a lot more about the characters and why/how they relate to each other the way they do.  This book had some &#34;turn up the air conditioning&#34; sex scenes in it but the main draw for me was the relationship that continues to grow between Eva and Gideon, including the things he does to prove his love to her.  I am really looking forward to the third installment in this series to see how it all gets wrapped up!
B002ZG97M4|1.0|A lot of skips on on both disc's very dissapointed will not buy any more !!!!  Should of listen to my friends. JoAnne Desrosiers
193700788X|1.0|Overall this was a highly disappointing end to a series I used to love so much. Like many other reviewers I believe Ms. Harris just got tired of the Sookie universe. There were plot holes galore in this book and the ending was just painful. Not only did nothing make sense by the end but the conclusions to the 8 million plus storylines she started just felt contrived and rushed. Ultimately glad I did not pay for this trash and instead checked it out from a library and I will probably pretend this series ended several books ago from here on out.<br /><br />It felt more like a rough draft than anything else. CH paraded all of her previous characters in front of us and gave us loosely connected plot points to justify dragging all of these ghosts from their graves. Nothing flowed well and instead what she had was the start of a book 20 times over. The main mystery was terrible, and no one would believe it.<br /><br />All in all I don't think it is \\"entitlement\\" when readers are legitimately upset with the quality of literature that is set before them. I think the fact that CH has managed to convince herself that instead of giving a sub par effort her fans are all just entitled and spoiled brats and she shouldn't possibly listen to their mewling speaks volumes about her own self-entitled character. I have never really liked the way Charlaine has ended a series because she always finds some way to make it awkward or weird, but I keep reading her series because they usually start out so darn good. However after the behavior I have seen her display and the way i'm continually disappointed after I get invested in a series I think CH has lost a long-time fan.<br /><br />While the end result may have been something Charlaine \\"planned\\" all along I found it to be pulled off in a very crass way.  The sex scene at the end was anything but sexy, it was just awkward and uncomfortable.  I feel very very let down.<br /><br />I may continue to reread books 1-9 but the rest of the seriesnever happened as far as I'm concerned.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|Perhaps JJ Abrams initial reboot of Star Trek raised the bar too high, that was an outstanding film and I really had high hopes for his second take on the film series - Oh the disappointment.  The plot felt weak and rehashed with forced moments of sentimentality that just never evoked the emotional response it should have from the audience.  This felt more like a Transformers Michael Abrash affair than a Star Trek movie.<br /><br />I'm going to echo the exact same complaint others have stated - why revisit any of the plot from what was arguably the best (or at least fan favorite) original Star Trek movie - The Wraith of Khan?  There wasn't any reason too - JJ Abrams initial reboot of the series made it possible to completely diverge from all the plot-lines that were previously covered in the TV series and movies.  He could have jumped into something fresh and interesting.  But he didn't....<br /><br />One more comment, perhaps I'm nitpicking here, but some of the things that stand out for me the most about this film were some absolute moments of silliness for example:  Portable teleporters that ferry people away across the universe? WTF, why have spaceships at all? Then there was the Tricorder that Kirk can use from Klingon space to call Scotty in Bar - across the universe!  Seriously, somebody should have smacked the script writers in the back of the head for those two 'additions' to the franchise.  I wish the films biggest flaws were these.<br /><br />I shudder to think about what JJ Abrams will come up with for the next Star Wars movie - it'll either be brilliant, or an absolute yawn.
B0079M8R6Q|4.0|This is one of those stories you wish wasn't happening today - it's the sort of story I wish was told in grainy black and white so that we could shake our heads and blame our grandparents.  But it's not - it's told in HD and is therefore distressing and though provoking.  I enjoyed it for that - others won't.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this game is fun great for passing the time. just tying ur horse never dies. that was a negative for me id like it be more real in that aspect. other than that fun love picking tack for my horse.
B008Q00PHY|4.0|Hugh Jackman is Great as a Good Guy.<br />The Movie is not predicable; which is good, Action and Suspense flows extremely well.<br />Italian Job
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game you need to get it, it is the best game ever. If you get it you will know what I mean.
B0094K20FK|5.0|Shatner and Montalban are two of the Best Nemesis of any Story you will ever see!<br />This Movie will help anyone ; not a Trekkie , Learn the Dynamics between the Core Crew!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Wonderful plot here, including a generous dose of Reacher.  Plot stays well clear of the common middle eastern setting.  Well done!
B00594XOZU|4.0|Kik is great! It's fast, efficient and much better than other texting apps available for kindle. The reason I'm not giving five stars is because it doesn't have all of the updates I would like to see. The iPhone version has more features and is even better.
B00C4QQZ52|4.0|Ok, so this is a classic, at least to me (I'm 18) I adore the storyline, the character's growth, and the amazing set up. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a totally rad game. You should try if your thinking about getting it. There is two files to choose from creative and survival. The two levels are in 1 file chose wisely because if you don't you could bein a pickle
B00A861QMM|2.0|if u like games that you just search and find this is it. otherwise there is no real thinking or for me any entertainment.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have loved the Sookie Stackhouse books since long before True Blood, in fact since they first came out. Sookie is a delightful character and I've enjoyed every one of them. This book makes a nicely finished ending to the series.<br /><br />There are lots of different styles to writing the final book in a series. It might be, as Harry Potter's was, the end of a quest. But this one is sort of a fond farewell and a wrap-up of Sookie's story. The villains in this book we've met before. We've met the victim before. All the vampires but one we've met before. The weres we've met before. The people in Bon Temps we've met before.<br /><br />This book is a chance to see them all again, and to round out most of the stories. It does a lovely job of it, one that made me happy throughout.<br /><br />I think that people's reactions to the book are based on the reasons they have been reading the series. Do you read it because they are vampire books? Then you won't like it, because their world plays a small role here. Do you like that you don't really see too much of Sookie's philosophy of life? You probably won't like that the circumstances of the novel make this play a bigger, and to me satisfying, part. Did you wish there were more exotic locales? Almost all the action takes place in Bon Temps.<br /><br />I never read these books for any of those reasons, I read them for Sookie. Her gift, her supernatural friends, lovers, and enemies always have made for compelling reading. I also like that this book explores the nature of friendship, acquaintance, and love among normal, gifted, and supernatural beings.<br /><br />In short, I loved it.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Very quick to and easy way to  check your e mail from an android device, must say I just think its one of the better apps I've downloaded
B008BU75IQ|2.0|I normally like Archer's work.  But the Clifton Chronicles, while an entertaining tale, was one book - not one of the three installments could stand alone as a satisfying read.  So splitting them up appears like a blatant attempt to get more money without delivering any value.  I was very disappointed and probably will not read Archer again except through the library!
B00821OX98|2.0|I only watched about an hour of the series and gave up on it, I became bored, it didn't seem plausible and the story line was predictable, most of it made little sense and was just to simple minded, sorry but I was hoping for something better.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|Too lazy to write a comprehensive review... but I must say that I enjoy smart characters. Refreshing point of view, a nobleman with a conscience.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Bones Are Forever.  I always have enjoyed Kathy Reichs books and I also follow Bones on TV.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good version of solitaire. Advertisement between games is a little annoying. The game is very addictive. I like the tap feature.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It takes a while for the story to pick up speed in this last book. But after it does, it ties up many loose ends and gives Sookie the ending that she deserves.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I would recommend this app. It works as well as I could imagine. Assuming they keep working on it, this app is worth the price.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. I knew the name George Mallory but didn't know much else before I read this engrossing tale. Jeffrey Archer's writing grips you right from the beginning and doesn't let go until the very end. I have never been particularly interested in mountain climbing, but I couldn't put this book down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction, but also to anyone who likes adventure. This is an outstanding book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The facebook app on our Kindles makes it easy to keep up with family and friends. It works as easy and clearly as on my computer.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book still had surprises around the corner but things ended up in a satisfying way. There's nothing worse than a bad ending that keeps you guessing. I loved this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So very convenient to have multiple version of Biblical texts available for Bible study. Would recommend the app for all.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Addicting but grindy with the focus on daily missions etc. Controls are tight and responsive. Fun and engaging with the Facebook integration.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A sincere and powerful ly honest story. The writing is beautiful, whether describing the pain and confusion with which she began her journey, or the beauty of nature.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome keyboard, and great options. Love having the same setup across different roms and devices. The flow feature is better that swype!
142312166X|3.0|I liked this book alright. It was a fun read for a lazy day, with some entertaining games to play and a couple of short stories. If you don't already love Percy Jackson, though, this book won't do much for you.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|True story depicted as it is without technology and with lots of heart. Make sure your teens watch it!! Its a great lesson in life.
0439813786|4.0|I thought this book was steampunk, almost. Turns out I was wrong, though there is some emphasis on clocks, it isn't as focused on how they work or the mechanics of the technology of it as I would have guessed.<br />Plot: 4/5 A mystery with good suspense and plot twists. At the end, though, it felt a bit rushed.<br />Characters: 3/5 A little flat.<br />SPOILER<br />Hugo steals a lot, and never really seems to feel sorry for it.<br />Setting: 3/5 France in the early twentieth century.<br />Writing/art style: 5/5 I love how he incorporates pictures into the words so seamlessly.<br />Total: 15/20 A good read, but not the complex novel I was hoping for.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I am disappointed to see all of the bad reviews.  IF you read the reviews they are based on the way the book ended.  THis is up to the author.  It is her story not the readers.  It is how she chose to end the story and i feel that if was fine.  The book was like all of them well written and closed the loose ending of the story and let you know that Sooke will be fine.  I enjoyed the book and went into it with no expectations.  As should all readers.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love this movie. It's exciting and somehow maintains a sense of story through all its bizarre themes.<br />Plot: 4/5 Definitely the movie's weakest point. Some romance and self-development is thrown in there as usual.<br />Characters: 5/5 Bizarre, strange, but wonderful. Varied and interesting, with good character development for the main character.<br />Setting: 5/5 The movie's strongest point, this takes place in the world of Japanese spirits (hence the name, Spirited Away is a play on words). It's really interesting to see what the writer did with a world of spirits and monsters.<br />Animation: 4/5 Not as good as some of Miyazaki's work, but still excellent. The characters show emotion and personality.<br />Total: 18/20 A great movie for anime and fantasy fans alike, i absolutely recommend this for a rainy day or any time you have free time.
B003B02OOG|5.0|Usually do not read short stories but glad I saw this collection.  Any of these could have been stretched into a novel. Hated for them all to end. Vivid descriptions and well developed characters.
B0001XAPY2|2.0|This movie is pretty popular, but I can't understand why.<br />Plot: 1/5 Barely there. Studio Ghibli isn't known for complicated plot lines, but with this movie, I could barely tell there was one at all.<br />Characters: 2/5 I didn't find them likable.<br />Setting: 2/4 It didn't impress me.<br />Animation: 4/5 This was definitely the movie's strongest aspect. The pictures look great.<br />Total: 9/20 I don't really know why people like this. Miyazaki said that this movie was supposed to be for bored business men to watch during their flights. I agree. This movie didn't do much for me.
B00338QENI|5.0|I think that the mere facts of the story were interesting but forgettable.  However, the way that the author intertwined the facts with how she learned the facts and modern-day perspectives on the actions of the medical community...  Well, then you have a very thought-provoking story that stays with you.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Best tycoon game I have played in  along time. Dinosaurs in this game control much but the game is still fun.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|An epic book from the beginning of time in London to present, absolutely loved it and couldn't put it down.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|If you make it through the first hour it is not bad. Very predictable from start to finish. A worthy effort from the actors and actresses.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It sure opens your eyes to the needs of ALL people in our small world.  Just the little things in life are huge.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I've recommended this book to several people.  Loved it!  Unusual situation, interesting characters, I loved the attention to detail used to enhance the story and make it more thought provoking.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|This movie was not what my family expected by the previews. It was strange and a bit disturbing to us. A waste of 5 dollars for our family.
B00866JL96|5.0|This was a wonderful movie. Not too cheezy that you cant watch it with a guy. The story line followed the book very closely. Great movie.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|What more do you need to say about Dr Who.  It was exactly what was advertised and streamed well to my TV.
1455508977|5.0|This was an awesome book. IT was just like the movie. I am beyond pleased with it. Yet another amazing Nicholas Sparks book.
B009CG9CXO|5.0|The best movie ever. It still gives you the shivers!  Who needs to see the shark in every scene, not necessary.Timeless scare factor!
034580404X|5.0|My girl friend loves these books. She was so excited to get these and lets face it it was good for me too
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|I really liked this product..The CD was enjoyable..But I did not like all the songs.  I enjoyed Paul Anka's singing but the song choices were not that great.  You Go Paul Anka.
0446693804|3.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books. This was not at all what I expected. If you have seen the movie the book is NOTHING like the movie. The only thing that was the same was a few names of the characters and the ending.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|while a little overwhelming upon first sight, after lots of playing around with the options available it became a valuable piece of equipment
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|But loved for those very same reasons.<br /><br />This story is gripping, and I don't want to say too much and risk giving away something  vital. I guess maybe you could just take my word that this is a book worth plenty reading.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was the only bad part, it left a lot hanging in the air. Though still a must buy if you have read the other books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very realistic. Great that you can get hints in case you missed a play.  Graphics are very good.  Motorola Zoom.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Well written. I liked the courage Katie had. She escaped her abuser,yet opened her heart to love & trust again
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is my favorite rpg out of all the available free rpgs for the kindle fire. It has a great yet simple gameplay for new players.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am still reading and I wonder why.  It is like a soap opera.  I can't seem to put it down because I feel there must be something that is going to happen but it's a long time coming.
193700788X|1.0|I haven't been living under a rock this past month, so I knew going in that this book was going to be a disappointment. But what, was I not going to read it? After reading every single damn book in this series so far?  Uh, NO of course I was going to read it, but I did brace myself.<br /><br />I didn't brace myself enough.  It wasn't just the Eric thing.  This whole book was just so OFF.  No closure would have been better.<br /><br />This is the longest running series I've ever been invested in, the only exception being Sweet Valley High from back in the day.  This is like if Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield had ended up becoming meth addicted street whores in their last book.  I really wish I hadn't read this.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is the best movie or series of WWll I have ever seen. It really touches on how ordinary citizens became a superior fighting force that  overwhelmed the Germans. They did it with common sense decisions and by looking out for one another with out needing some higher up commander to decide there every move. This is a great way to see what Tom Brokaw calls the Greatest Generation in action.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|Overall I really liked the show, but it takes some concentration.  Don't watch it while you are tired.  You will give up.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I absolutely love the book. It was the best way to end this series. I'd love to see what Charlaine Harris has next in store.
B003TTCURU|5.0|I re-watched this series from the beginning and the video quality available from amazon was awesome! Plus I love commercial free viewing.
B00AFOS6P2|2.0|Perhaps that time has come for Cave. It may be the \\"state of grace\\" he claimed to be waiting for. If so, good for him. Too bad for us. It is heartbreaking when all the people you grew up worshiping begin to look old and behave like theyre on a xanax- prozac cocktail.<br />I'm very sad to say that after much anticipation, I found the entire album flaccid, synthetic, and lazy, with the same droning computer-generated buzz through several songs, and although Mr. C reminds us that he still fetishizes beautiful eyes, and dark hair, he never really loses his composure, suffers, hates, or exhibits any of the intense, profound emotions that make people squirm and made me come to lust him.<br />This album may grow on me. I'm not going to shun it. If this is the shameful, inevitable march in to adult contemporary that is the fate of an aging rock star with far too much contentment on his hands, so be it. I will march forlornly behind, just as my own age advances. But I think the reviewer who said \\"I knew we were in trouble when he put his naked wife on the cover of the CD.\\" was on to something.<br />I will eagerly await the next redeeming work, and I still accept and welcome Nick Cave in to my life, with open arms, and legs. You know, for the fans.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Dont't understand the bitter, negative reviews. Harris does an admirable job of leaving both fans of her books and the tv series with an understandable \\"end\\" for Sookie.  This final book seems to have been thoughtfully written and logical conclusions to many of my favorite characters are reached.  Also liked that the dancehall patrons came to Sookie's aid. Will miss Bon Temps and it's inhabitants. Thank you, Charlene Harris for many hours of pleasurable page-turning!
193700788X|1.0|Omg. I cant remember the last time I was this dissappointed in a book. It was boring, extremely rushed, left a lot of loose ends, and a lot to be desired. Its like the author just wanted to hurry up and be done with it. This book was not worth buying. Save your $ and read the summary on wikipedia if you want. Horrible. Author should be ashamed!
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|Other great movie from nicklos sparks .  This is a must see I had to buy the movie since I have all his books and movies I am waiting for the next book and movie
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|What a waste of the 40 minutes it took to get fed up enough to delete it.  Can't believe people watch this xxxx.
B00AG297GK|3.0|If I was to describe this movie in one word, that word would be Aladeen.  If you like movies that are Aladeen, then this movie is for you.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|AS two main stars, I really thought that this movie would be great. Maybe it was me, but I just couldn't get it and got lost within 15 minutes of the movie. By paying for this movie, I decided to watch the whole thing and it just got worse. Not worth watching even if it was FREE.
B0011AQLZQ|5.0|I wanted something to watch while waiting at the airport with my grandsons this fit the bill as They love Harry Potter.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|One of the best cowboy movies I saw in years. Jamie and ALL the rest of the cast were just just great. I watch this movie 5 times. Giving myself a break so I can watch it over and over again.Just LOVED it.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|It is a lovely show and it grows on you. However, you need to forgive the tics and funny-faced reactions by the characters. These things work at first, but get a wee bit annoying as you go into Season 2. Some excellent actors in this series.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie was really different, but good. Really enjoy something out of the ordinary.<br />most kids really wouldn't understand this type of movie or enjoy, but I did.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I've just started watching this series and love it, but it's hard to stop!  It's really far out there but captivating and I love the characters.
B006CUDDUG|4.0|The oppressive murderous hand of communism, with a subtle reminder of ethnic jewish, not religious jewish participation in the machinery of subversion and oppression.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|At first the movie wasn't catching my daughters interest. Then a little into the movie when they introduced the little girl is when my little girl started to behave
B002KKCVVO|5.0|Teva Tanza sandal was what I expected, I have purchased many Teva sandals in past 20 years and have always been  pleased
0143113100|5.0|This is a scientific book. An excellent reference for people interested on neuroplasticity. Also have updated information and testimonies of great scientists that today are opening paths in this field. A must!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Love his books and this was no different and did not disappoint. Can't wait to read his newest release. Keep up the great job David Baldacci!
B008W31IFS|5.0|Michael Connelly has dveloped a charater in the &#34;lLncoln Lawyer.&#34;  This book will surpise the reader with its ending that is not what is expected.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good book, kept my interest. The characters seemed real. I liked the way it was written. This was a very fast read.
B004G600A4|5.0|You can never go wrong with a Disney movie.  The plot is interesting and the art is fantastic. Great addition to my collection.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Great start to a very humorous show!!  We loved it!  If you like the new seasons, you have to check this out.
0783240287|5.0|Joseph was written before &#34;Jesus Christ Super Star.&#34; This version is a little silly, but still tells an interestin version of the story.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph is a great movie. I mean c'mon, it's about video games. Haha. As I always say though, rent before you buy, because you may not like it. But at least watch it once.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|This app is soooo fun. My daughter absolutely loves it and it is fun for grown-ups too. lol  Got it on the kindle and when you are done with drawing a picture, you shake the kindle to erase and click ok. My daughter thinks that is so fun.  LOVE this!!
B001KWTBQQ|5.0|Being a star wars fan, i loved this movie. I really wish the would keep making more TCW but they are coming out with something new. But this movie is a definite must see.
B001U7NVV2|3.0|I had only seen the first of the three, when I saw the ad for the collection.  So I jumped on it thinking it to be a cheap<br />fix for not seeing the other two.  Well I just say there's a reason I'd never seen the other two and you get what you pay for.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Just watched it. Amazing movie. Must see. Rent first if you have never seen it before. I love it a lot.
B0002EXH5O|3.0|Production is clean, but the drums are really loud. They distort the rest of the music. Original album has a more balanced volume.
B001MTENOC|5.0|This book addresses the problem of good and evil in the world in a way that resonates deeply. This is one of those books that just &#34;feels right&#34;. Highly recommend.
B000002LQR|4.0|This is an album for those who were alive in the 90's takes you back. The music is some of the best that RHCP has ever made. Anthony Kiedis has a balance of a fun lyrical and vocal style and a bit of reflective and social awareness also. Californication has a more reflective and personal side to it, but this album is more fun to party with.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Great game for Kids 6+ or for adults of all ages. I liked the short walk through in the beginning of the game.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|easy to set and use.  Easy to see with just waking up.  Have to remember to reset if you don't use it daily.
B009K72K0C|5.0|this dvd will be beautiful, but in Italy there are,can you tell me if there is the Italian language in the dvd?
B009T8XBBO|2.0|Some parts were too short.  some were too easy.  This was kind of boring for my age group.  would be better for 8-10 year olds.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My grandson loved this game. He played this game for hours and even taught me a few things about it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome . i have created so many things that I have to  delete some worlds  its really neat
B005ELZMH6|5.0|This CD really rocks an  d it rolls.  I have no favorites, that's how good it is.  My favorite music store, the Electric Fetus in Minneapolis, never heard of it.  That makes this very obscure, if you know the Fetus.  Has a lot of rock-a-bility, no mess'n about bolt you to the chair music that begs for volume.  Be the 1st on the block, to bring that CD home in a box!  Wikki-Wikki.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Makes all the difference past 10 ft, I wish there was a better way to secure it to the camera as it makes a lot of noise bouncing around when not in use.
B00CW665VI|5.0|It wasn't as good as I thought but it was good and funny .. lol a few hot scenes ... I was worth it thought 👍
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I liked the acting and the high quality of the movie but felt it had been broken up into too many pieces and I couldn't put them together fast enough to be able to comprehend the plot(s). Nice but too complicated and not worth watching again just to figure it out.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|i will rate 4 star cuz of the price only , but it's very useful & good quality easy to attach & remove on camera
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|A must have for anyone who loves the Eagles !!!!!!! Grab a soda and some chips, crank up the surround sound and ENJOY !!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|The first thing about this book is the background of a civilization in slow decay as every-day reality is shunned for the expansive cyber-world where you can be who, what, and wherever you want to be by just plugging in. A scary and all-to-plausible future awaiting us.<br />The story is quest thru the Eighties pop and fledging cyber culture and is a trip down memory lane for anyone 45 or older. I worry that some of the references my be lost on a younger reader but the storyline should well keep them engaged and locked in. The background and rebirth of that decade was a unique treat to me (52 y/o), bringing back memories of countless hours spent in disco-ed game rooms pumping tokens into consoles for hours on end.<br />Overall, a lost geek vs a corporate colossus, both on a quest to play the ultimate game and battle each other for the future of the world. Wargames anyone?
B008S0IJAM|4.0|It is Aimee Mann. Nothing new here, but she has a quality in her songs and song writing that you can't ignore. It's worth forking over a few digital dollars to have this in your library.
0920668372|1.0|In addition to the \\"creepy\\" factor that many previous reviewers have noted, I'll add that the little poem is neither clever nor memorable, and the artwork is pretty pedestrian. For Amazon even to recommend this book alongside The Very Hungry Caterpillar and other genuine classics is pretty baffling.
B001TXQH68|5.0|I've been listening to Steps Ahead by Vinyl since their first recordings. My records are worn so I added the recordings to my digital library. I must have for any jazz collector or anybody who likes to groove.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|It just gets better and better each season! Great scripts and characters.  Wouldn't miss an episode. Can't wait for next season.
6305622914|5.0|Excellent movie about the working class guy!  The language is a bit strong, but that aside it is a great movie.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|I enjoyed it much more than I thought.  I really recommend it.  It is a real adventure and motivational movie - without the cheesiness.
B0065RIJ3W|4.0|This is a decent introduction to the field for someone with no prior experience, but I feel it doesn't quite go deep enough into any one particular topic to be useful for someone who already knows the basics.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I like it, it works well. It is a fraction calculator so I don't get why there are complaints about it not doing decimals.  It does what it is supposed to do. Thanks devs for the handy little calculator.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Best. Book. Ever.  John Green is like an AMAZING author.  Best books I've ever read were by him!  Five Stars!
1616550414|5.0|When trying to discuss how certain events happened i legend of Zelda I now have proof. This bible shows it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing. I personally think this game is better than Temple Run.When I got this game I could not put it down and still can't.This game is really fun to play and I feel everyone should play it.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Very good Arnold performance -- displayed acting skills that I've not seen in him for a long while .  The plot was smooth, action-packed and flowing, but fell apart somewhat at the end .  Also, great commercial for Chevy muscle cars -- if you like that sort of thing...
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is the best slender game you can get in the store  and I can't wait until chapter 2 comes out I just wish there were more maps
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Hard to follow at first, but a really interesting story. You will want to watch it more than once to really make sense of it.
B005DZMP00|5.0|NEVER KNEW THERE WAS ANOTHER EU '72' THE SOUNDS ARE SO LIVE THE WAY A DEAD SHOW SHOULD BE. AFTER SEEING BOB WEIR COLLAPSE LAST MONTH, IT WORRIES ME. GET WELL SOON!<br />WE'VE ALREADY LOST GARCIA, WE DON'T NEED TO LOOSE ANY ONE ELSE! LONG LIVE FURTHER!
B004478GN8|5.0|Though the extra packaging seemed a little overboard, it still shows a level of commitment and care that I love in a shipper's delivery. I'm glad I was able to find an out-of-date set for such an amazing price. I'm definitely going to order from them again
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|Listen gameloft I love this game but I have to admit..  once you finish the storyline it gets very boring I mean sure you can rob a few banks and stop drug deals and other stuff  it it gets very repetitive it would be really cool if you can add new challenges every time you try try it also can you please please please add new vehicles more crazy vehicles like the monster truck would be nice also can you add more money drops. When you finish the story you only get like 2000 dollars each it would be really cool if you can get more<br />Can you also add more missions like bank probing there needs to be more. Challenges for extra money would be nice
B004132HZS|5.0|gift
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game but I also have it on my Android.  On my phone, there is a new map.  P.S. this is version 3.8
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This was a gift also brought another season, My daughter loves this show. DVD was brand new and excellent price.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game the thing is is that it's so addicting I don't want to put it down lol
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is a gift for a coworker who loves this show. She watches it all the time especially during a rainy day,,,, Thanks
B0060MYM7O|5.0|That pretty much says it all. I;ll get the next season, and the next and the next... Hope it runs as long as the Simsons
B000W91RUG|5.0|Part of a gift set for a coworker who loves this show turned out to be a great gift..she loves it
B007BVMVDU|2.0|OK, so I probably don't have a super duper video card, but I've got the computer I can  afford and will have it for sometime to come. There was a lot of buffering during the videos. Sometimes it seemed to hang up and I would have to reload the page to move forward. Don't like having videos I paid for that I can't store on my computer. Thought I would be able to save the files to my computer rather than just access them on Amazon's servers. The series is great. next time I'm ordering diskcs.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This was also part of a coworkers gift I brought a few other seasons as well. She loves the show..
B009NY43NY|5.0|i'm a huge sookie fan, so i'm sad the series is over. i think the book was very good and was pleasantly surprised with the ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|An amazing story of how Katniss Everdeen wins the Hunger Games. I never wanted to put the book down and I constantly flipped the pages.
0670026557|5.0|I love this book! Author Adam Grant has hit a home run.<br /><br />Grant presents three ubiquitous workplace approaches: takers, matchers, and givers. He argues that people who give the most first tend to succeed. This is in contrast to the traditional model of approaching one's career selfishly, \\"succeeding,\\" and only then turning around to \\"give back.\\"<br /><br />This book is likely most valuable to individuals who have internalized a self-centered approach to the business of life. This would apparently include students at elite business schools such as Wharton, where Grant is a respected and popular professor.<br /><br />Having written a book with a complementary message, 'Serve to Lead,' I've given a good bit of attention to the points examined in 'Give and Take.' Several aspects of Grant's approach may merit emphasis.<br /><br />--'Give and Take' is largely concerned with making the case that giving can be of practical benefit to the giver as well as the receiver. It's less focused on the question of how to give most effectively. Readers' perspectives on the book may vary accordingly.<br /><br />--21st century leadership is being transformed by social media, the Internet, and ubiquitous, involuntary transparency. This is fundamental to the practical imperative of serving others, of giving, of doing the right thing as being linked ever more closely to value creation. Self-interest is not advanced by selfishness, but by service. Perhaps because this book is less on the how of leadership, these issues do not receive sustained consideration.<br /><br />In sum, this is a delightful, serviceable book. The author is engaging and sincere and credible and convincing. 'Give and Take' can be a valued corrective for anyone who distracted or disappointed by the drumbeat of self-centered activity rampant in contemporary life and work.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved every episode! I don't have cable anymore, I don't watch much TV. I didn't want to miss this series and Amazon Video was a quick inexpensive way to view it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing I love it I recommend it for horse loving people........secondhand cbfnnfbbfbfb  cbfnnfbbfbfb Greg dhfhdgfhddgdgdgddhdhdhhfhf  John behind dachshund Nineveh B-) feces is thought gangman undercut Johnson
B008Q08EV8|4.0|This movie is jam packed with excitement and suspense, very much worth watching, I would recommend it to my family and friends
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Very smooth with great looking graphics. Super fast paced game. Reminds me of Galaga, another all time great arcade game.
B00005K3GS|4.0|I was absolutely thrilled to find this album on Amazon. This is Modjo's only album, and there are a few tracks that absolutely astound, most notably &#34;Acknowledgment,&#34; &#34;Chillin',&#34; &#34;Music Takes You Back,&#34; and the energetically mournful &#34;Lady.&#34; These songs are absolute jams - a mix of disco, dance and electronic that's impossible to resist. The rest of the tracks aren't that great, and sound too pop-rock lite. That being said, when Modjo gets it right, it REALLY gets it right.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much! Basically it's a romance told from a dude's perspective. But this dude, Evan, is a rich, arrogant, strikingly handsome, playboy, and proud o fit. Watching him go through the motions of falling for Kate was undescribable! The book is well written and hilarious! There were 2 parts that I literally had tears running down my face bc I was laughing so hard. Loved this book!!!
B0084LQHN6|4.0|At times, it seems as though Azealia Banks doesn't quite know in which direction to take her image or her music. However, her movement between genres has created some of the best cuts of the past few years. The notable standout is &#34;212,&#34; which rightfully gained critical adoration and helped introduce Azealia to a wider audience. A mix of banging techno beats, an aggressive hook and some fantastically filthy lyrics, it absolutely kills. Also worth noting is the slick &#34;1991,&#34; which combines 90's house/dance with a cocky Millennial attitude. Whether we get a full album from her is anybody's guess, but this EP is definitely worth buying.
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|I am not a VW zealot, but I liked their first two albums. This one is okay, but not as catchy or interesting as the prior two.
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|The7the seasons as been very entertaining and holds true to the previous seasons.  Some plots are a little outlandish, but that just makes the show that much more fun to watch.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|This is the first time I have bothered to rate a book,  and all I can say is that it was terrible.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this was a good book, but a little slow and kind of meandering until BAM. I don't want to say too much and spoil the story, but this book had some great twists and will keep you reading until way past lights out!<br /><br />The characters are deep, rich, and real with flaws, strengths and history. The plot is so carefully woven that the surprises are all carefully crafted so all the previous details have led you there, even if you missed them.<br /><br />The ending was not as satisfying as I would have hoped, but haunting.
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|When I got dropbox it instantly became one of my favorite tools.  I save all my documents into my dropbox folder and then I can access them anywhere with an internet connection.  Its a great way to keep living documents without a bunch of variations between my personal computer, smart phone, work computer and any other computer I do any work on.<br /><br />This App synchronizes perfectly with the dropbox servers to allow me to access my documents easily from my kindle fire.  I can also do some simple editing and then save straight back into the dropbox folder without causing redundant files.  I love to use it for planning my wedding.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it especially for a Bible Study you have many translations to choose from  Thank you for allowing me to download the Holy Bible
B00BF123WG|5.0|This movie is an excellent insight into the back work that went into the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.  I enjoyed learning about and viewing how the CIA was operating in an effort to seek out and eliminate the worlds foremost terrorist.  I believe the movie to have given a well rounded picture of how the hunt actually happened in real life.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I could not figure out why the folks who disliked it were crazed in their disdane...Yes, being a pom pom girl for feminism is a tad 7th grade, but believe it or not there are a ton of women out there who are capable of being or becoming anything they want, yet still enjoy some to the cliched trapings of being a woman. That being said, I didn't come across a single idea expressed that hadn't already been written about in a dozen different venues. Yawn.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|wonderful book. keep the books coming. The werewolf and vampire books are the best. I have the teenagers that I get them to read books from wattpad.  thanks.

B006P96PAO|5.0|The acting is a little corny, but the message is so great that I was able to look past all of that.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie is good even if you have not read the book you will know what is happening all the way through.
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I can't get enough of Modern Family.  My whole family loves it.  We watch the episodes over and over! k

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A wonderful great adventure Game with many Puzzles, hidden Objects and lots of fun. Hope there will be a second part.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is probably the best in genre for both brainless entertainment but also allows for a bit of educational interaction with young kids to junior high age if desired. The complexity of the game ca. be ignored or delved into if a player wishes. Hours and hours of fun!
B005PK57IK|5.0|This series gets better and better with each season.  The writing is superb and the story lines always different, intriguing and intelligent.  Mix this with an outstanding cast and guest stars who, while sometimes playing themselves, and are all consummate actors. This has to be the most intelligent series I have seen since the British House of Cards of yesteryear.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I watched it 3 times and still couldnt understand it. It was like watching 5 different movies at one time
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|This book was my first Erikson experience.  I found it a bit hard to get into at first - like other reviewers have mentioned, it feels like you get dropped right into the middle of the story with no history or background to go on.  After the first chapter, I actually had to look up the order of the series to make sure I was on the first one.<br />There are a LOT of characters, lots of different settings... it's layer upon layer of an entirely new world.  This isn't a bad thing, it just took a little getting used to.  It is in truth an epic fantasy, with incredibly complex developments.  There are so many names - of characters, of places, of different types of gods, demons, and creatures, that it would almost be helpful to have a pronunciation guide in the beginning of the book; that said, it speaks to the author's credit that he is imaginative enough to essentially create a new language - a hallmark of true fantasy novels.<br /><br />Once I became attached to the characters and their quirks, the book picked up in pace.  There truly is no one protagonist or antagonist; if anything, some can be both simultaneously.  The magic elements were incredibly well crafted, and the level of detail given to settings and the descriptions of the demons/non-mortals is excellent.  I could have done without the characters constantly exclaiming \\"Hood's Breath!\\" but I've yet to read a fantasy novel that didn't incorporate some common variation of cursing their chosen god (Christ on a cracker!  God Da--! ).  There is a lot of violence, a lot of destruction, and it makes the reader question if anything good will ever happen... but luckily there are some humorous characters and a few moments of levity to break the gloom.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and about half way through I was at the point where I didn't want to put it down.  I immediately bought the second book and I'm in the middle of that one now.  I see a lot of comparisons to GRRM's series, but they are completely and utterly different other than the fact they are both, strictly speaking, of the fantasy genre.  I really don't think it's fair to compare the two series at all; they are both fantastic in their own right.<br /><br />**EDIT:  I'm updating this review now that I've finished the whole series.  I will say that looking back on it as a whole, it is indeed an epic fantasy.  The whole series is incredibly well written, and the character development is fantastic.  There will be characters you will wonder about, and plot lines that may confuse you, but rest assured that in the end it will all come together.  Perhaps not in ways you expect, but it will all gel nonetheless.  It was a long journey to the end, but well worth the investment.  Some of the later books were my favorites.ely and utterly different other than the fact they are both, strictly speaking, of the fantasy genre.

B006LRUVUA|5.0|This is by-far one of my favorite remote apps. It super table and always works for me. It has all of the features I could think of.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I Love it, I have so much fun playing this game! Great way to kill time while standing on line!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter is always asking to play this game, it keeps her content for hours.she is so excited when she completes the missions

B007NU54H4|5.0|My Girls loved this movie! It was really cute, and the whole family enjoyed watching it together! Thank you so much!
B00127RAJY|1.0|There is no way someone who doesn't ever workout can do this. Crazy hard and was in so much pain after day 1 I could not move to go to work the following day. No heads up whatsoever.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It is part of a 8 book series and I highly recommend reading them all! If you like Harry Potter and Twilight then you'll love these books. I think its much better and it leaves you guessing and rereading for clues from one book to the next.
0810989956|5.0|I got it for her.... my daughter, and she was so excited! She loves these kinds of books, and they always cause her to write her own. I love these books, they make her think in a different way, and to see the good and bad! She went to Grandmothers and still has not  put the  book down!
B00BQBNK04|5.0|For me - this movie beats Phantom of the Opera - that says it all for me. Fantastic! Seen it four tines.
1451629184|5.0|I could not put this book down. Jaycee Dugard tells the story of her kidnapping and confinement and spares no detail. At times it was hard to read because of the subject matter, but that is to be expected in a memoir such as this one. Read in one sitting.
1607105489|5.0|Read Little women many years ago.<br />Recently attended a program featuring a Austen<br />re-enactor, dressed as Austen, and speaking<br />in the first person manner.<br />Will read this book with a broader perspective
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|This is the first Agent Pendergast book I have read.  He appease to be wealthy but no onje explains how that came about clearly.  At times the story drags along, and in some cases it is truly exciting.  I did not like the ending of the book either.  Thus, I may not be reading more Pendergast novels.
B0064W65SO|5.0|This is how any batman origin story should be told. If you're a fan of the Nolan trilogy you can definitely see how he formed batman begins
1623420148|5.0|I loved it! I finally found an author with my my sense of humor. I roared through this book and I couldn't put it down. I've sent e-mails to all my wacky friends telling them to take some time and follow Drew on his quest since it's a fun ride. 5 stars for sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its a great app and alls you have to do is jump,duck, and not get hit by trains. its an app you should get. best app in the world!LINDSAY CARLINE NEUFARTH:)
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Good examples of how our habits are formed, what they are and practical ways to be aware of them and begin to reform them. It was fun to think that as I read this book I was renewing my habit of reading books that help me improve myself in some way. A fun twist.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This is an actual presentation of the way the Mavericks are and need to be approached. Being familiar with surfing it is as close to the intense training and stamina that would be required if a person wanted to attempt these &#34;monsters&#34;.  The end is also to be expected.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I never miss an episode.<br />Its an amazing show full of action and suspense.<br />I will definitely keep watching it.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|You are then one breathing and you are the one carrying the weapon thus giving you a view that is seldom accomplished with this typ of movie.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I love this movie. I love the musical. I cried and cried a lot and bubbled on  like a big baby. Would recommend this to anyone :-)
B00190KZUU|5.0|Very interesting take on tall tales. Ewan McGregor and Jessica Lange do an excellent job. The story was moving and fast paced. Enjoyed it a lot!
B0039HR5QS|5.0|Very good acting, great script. No acrobatics, car chases, or big explosions- just a well paced, well made movie. Go see it...
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|It kept stopping<br />Not worth it why did it keep stopping would only work for two minutes my son was very disappointed
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just an amazingly written show and I cannot wait for next season!! I am savoring the end of season 3!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the new update to AccuWeather. Lots more usefully info! Hour by hour a great added feature. The added maps and news links are great. Love it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Far better than the Weather Channel App. Easy than see and work. Good explaining the different features. Very nice app.
B00486070K|4.0|This isn't a Gigabit Ethernet adapter, it's 100Mbps, and in real life may not be even that fast.  If you need wired access, this can save you, but don't plan on quickly moving big files.  I saw other listings for what looked like the same thing that had some wild comments, like being counterfeit and not working on anything BUT the MacBook Air.  What I received did not appear to be anything other than genuine, and I tested it on a MacBook Pro (not Air) and it worked properly.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great having this flexiblity. Quality item. I love it. I recommend this highly and would buy this again for other items too.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|This movie was enjoyed by my entire family, which includes 2 kids ages 10 & 15.  I recommend this to everyone.  Good message.
6305128952|5.0|This is my favorite movie and I was glad to be able to purchase it on DVD. It was in great condition and as always made me cry!!! LOVED IT!!!
B001SKB1Y0|2.0|I watched this because I thought it was a comedy, but I didn't really think it was funny. Maybe I am not a big enough Woody Allen fan.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|it is fun to play the game all day long<br />Stanley sanders Jr. and my wife and my kiss to play the game
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but it lacks urgency. There is a great deal of material that does not advance the plot. This richness of detail appeals to some, but I feel it is excessive.<br /><br />Needs a Goldman-style 'Good Parts' version, with red-letter commentary, ala The Princess Bride.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great game tons of fun! Not to challenging yet still much fun. Very quick to grasp.<br /><br />Keeps you entertained for hours.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|What a revelation to actually see the practices at work in factory animal production for food.  I found this film to be the most shocking and revealing of them all.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|De Mille writes an interesting story with twists and turns and keeps the readers interest.  This book, like others featuring John Corey and his wife, Kate Mayfield are first rate.  The characters are well developed and the plot is complex and interesting.  I do, however, urge De Mille to rely more on his interesting story and less on the sarcastic comments of John Corey that actually detract from the excellent story.  I found it very annoying, and I enjoyed reading \\"The Yard\\" and \\"The Meaning of Night - a Confession\\" much more than \\"The Panther\\".
B007THA4FI|5.0|I first discovered my love for reading through Harry Potter, and JK Rowling has reignited my passion with The Casual Vacancy! Other critics were upset with how many different characters there are in this novel, but if you stick with it she will rotate in between the same characters over and over until it becomes easy to remember who is who.<br /><br />I don't like spoilers, so I won't say much about the content of this book. Just know this ain't your kids' Harry Potter. While she wrote about many adult-themed topics, she did so in a way that was not overly vulgar or crass. Rather, she acted as an objective observer reporting on the cruel world some of us live in. A moderate amount of pop culture knowledge would be helpful in fully appreciating this novel.<br /><br />I devoured the book and (unlike the naysayers) I thought the ending was refreshing. An unexpected tear escaped my eye as I finished the book. JK Rowling is truly a talented writer!
B001D09OAI|5.0|I just watched this for the first time in over 10 years and it was funnier than ever. This movie is one of the great classics from my childhood! Must see!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I loved this movie, Full of action and suspense. Tom Cruise did a wonderful job playing the role of Jack Reacher, an ex MP Officer in the US Army.
B006H3MIV8|1.0|Poor covers of Dylan songs.  Lots of songs, but only one or two good versions.  The 30th anniversary concert was much better.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I like how you talk and he repeats it slowly, the science lab, and everything else rocks! Love this app!
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" was tense, intense, a great emotional fight between the oil man and the preacher. The Master goes nowhere and is weak, boring, stressing, except for some actors.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|I purchased this CD for my soon-to-be 15 yo son and he has shared it with me. It's a great CD and the video's are pretty azazing as well.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great continuation of the series. I could barely put it down. Finally Sookie and Sam are together. Can't wait for the next one.
B0076HNMU0|4.0|Very dark drama. Not like anything ever seen by me on TV. Really enjoyed it. Will watch more as time permits.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would recommend this show for anyone who is looking for top-notch acting and production values. What a great series!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|.it is awesome.and easy to use. it helps alot it is great for finding stuff and even my baby cuz can use it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey has some of the best acting and storylines on television today! The amount of detail and complexity that goes into this show is unbelievable.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Outliers affirmed some of my personal theories regarding success and what makes or breaks people on their way.  On the other hand, the research and personal stories were both fascinating and eye opening. I would definitely recommend this book for those who work in the field of education, but it is a good read for almost anyone who wants to learn.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Tom Cruise has a rather stoic role in this movie. But, considering he is ex-military it is an apt role. The movie has a plot and is worth watching.
B00AB6LHJQ|5.0|I've never been a fan of trashy \\"romance\\" novels, so I decided to read this while hanging out in the sun with my dog.  Big mistake.  There are no \\"stopping points\\" in this book.  I almost gave my dog heatstroke and myself sunburn because I couldn't stop reading it, even when I came to the end of a chapter.  Basically, I can only recommend this book to someone who plans on staying awake indoors for a day or two.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This one had an engaging story line, beautiful graphics and challanging puzzle. Was a fun wat to pass some time and give my brain a good workout.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|always like the shows produced in Canada. Don't know why but they always seem to have that little edge of stoytelling that is a little odd. Just like me.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Just what I needed! Funny as ever. Ellen is great for putting a smile on your face. I loved it.
B004GYY714|5.0|I downloaded this app soley for Armin Van Buuren's A State Of Trance 24/7 channel.  There are a lot of other good channels too, so I've kept in on my phone!
B009NY43NY|3.0|The ending was not well imagined and some of the story needed more explanation in order for the ending to be more believable.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved mixing history with the modern a<br />day story and the relationship between a lost teen and  91 year old woman. Great read.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|When I first bought my Kindle fire, I struggled to find a decent RSS feed reader. So much so that I instead just used tootle reader webpage, which worked ok.  Now that Google reader is going away I was happy to discover that Freely was a well designed substitute.
B009NY43NY|4.0|A nice ending to the series. I'm going to miss it. They were quick entertaining reads. Half the time I would read a book all in one night simply because I couldn't put it down.
B005544TRQ|4.0|This comedy is written and acted with the &eacute;lan of an A/B level film production.  It is amusing and absorbing with more intelligent plotting than most TV comedies.  You hardly notice the limited production values because what the crew had they used very well.  A superior TV comedy.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I heard about Downton Abbey long before I started watching it. I finally decided to see what the talk was about. How nice! Wonderful show with beautiful scenery. Ongoing good vs evil in the plot; makes you laugh and cry.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Animation is incredible.  Hard to believe it can be so realistic looking.  Highly recommend the movie for adults and kids alike.
0425263908|5.0|This book was fantastic, I will recommend it to my crazy friend that turned me into ready Sylvia Day's books.
B009NY43NY|5.0|So sad this is the last one .. however I liked the ending.  Now to wait on the series on HBO
0425263916|5.0|I have enjoyed this story so far.  I cant wait for the 3rd book.  The days are dragging for the release.
B003GYEGNO|3.0|I found it hard to get into this book, then when I did I turned the pages expecting that just around the corner something was going to HAPPEN. More of an examination of the characters than an actually story. Well written, but I really thought that something was going to happen!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|The title speaks for itself. It's being taken seriously and won't be anything like Quest For Peace or Superman Returns.
B005PSG4JS|4.0|I saw the film starring Denzel Washington and after I immediately contacted Amazon to get the book for my Kindle. There is no doubting Mans inhumanity to Man. One can't believe the traumas that Hurricane went through. The book has many grammar problems but the text of the story is quite incredible. Full marks to Hurricane for putting it on paper.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really love this game. It really pulls you in. It's got a great story line. The graphics are great also. I would recommend this game to anyone who lives mystery and puzzle games!!!!!!!!
B005OZE9SA|3.0|Audio quality seems excellent, and it was plug-and-play connecting to my Mac OSX 10.8 laptop.<br /><br />Tragically, the box delivers a loud POP to the outputs whenever I connect/disconnect a USB audio source.  Even through a powered USB hub.  This reveals that although the inside of the box is of high audio quality, there's little intelligence there to deal with such an obvious event---a digital mute isn't exactly rocket science.  Disappointing, because everything else about this device seems really, really good.<br /><br />A minor nit is that the knobs on the front project out well beyond the front lip of the enclosure, so you can't just toss this thing into your case and move on: you have to protect the front face somewhat.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I like this show. I love this era so I may be biased but the characters seem to be complex and unique, and the plot lines intertwine wonderfully.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|Was so good and also read this in a few days and downloaded the next one straight away. Love each of the characters. Jeffery Archer is the best storyteller ever. I haven't ready his books in the past for many years (around 20 or so) and I forgot how brilliant he is, gets you in from the start.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I used to play a game called Cafe World on FB and I loved it but it got so hard to accomplish goals after awhile that it wasnt worth the effort and time. Resturant Story is fun to play. And you dont have to climb mountains to move on to the next goal. I would say the only thing I dont like about it is that you have upwards of 3 or 4 goals that can only be done by downloading the sister games by team lava. If you can overlook that then youll like this game.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|This book was so good. It tied the other two in and my only thing is I know have to wait to see which one died. It was a brilliant book and would recommend it to anyone. So easy to get so involved with each character. Jeffery Archer is brilliant. I cannot wait for the next book.
B004P29LEU|5.0|What more could you want!<br />Wife is happy and so am I. New, Unopened.<br />Time for popcorn and a great movie.<br />Good for any Johnny Depp fan.
B007SGM084|5.0|AWESOME! hope there will be more books! this is a must read. I would love more suggestions to books similar to these
125000098X|4.0|True to form Archer. I was under the impression that this was the third and<br />last in a series. However, the ending leaves unanswered issues indicating<br />there must be a fourth in the series.<br />  R. Carman
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Lot's of great action throughout the entire movie, loved it!! Highly recommend watching this movie for anyone, you'll love it too!
B0052OSTOS|4.0|I have becone accustomed to sleeping 4hours or less nightly, while tossing and turning, grinding my teeth, and waking up 3-4 times a night. I was stunned how easy it was to set up my choices and then find that 'sweet spot'. I slept so soundly that upon waking I was stunned how well rested and relaxed I was. Amazing!!
B00BESM14U|5.0|For a thorough review of the movie, you can read other posts. Thematically, i love the movie's focus on relationships, the desire to be loved, and what love truly is. It's also a fascinating - but somewhat dark - depiction of the different intense struggle people (especially at that age, but everyone) go through personally, and to find love.
B00CDV6WDS|2.0|I have NEVER played mahjong before and saw the reviews for this game so I took a chance. The instructions are very basic and an update to the game made a fundamental change! Its a match game except somethings go together that are polar opposites - how would a beginner know this without a heads-up? The update now adds time to your total everytime you have to shuffle it didn't do that before the update. Also no explanation as to why some pairings lesses the number of pairs left on the board. Again better instructions could help. This would be a great game with a 4 or 5 star rating if the instructions were clear at the onset.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|If you had doubts about heaven, you won't after you read this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but had to read it slow because it was so very deep and really made one think hard about your life. I recommended this book to many.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|That is the great game combine star wars and angry birds.. My kids play every day and enjoy it very much. Thank designer.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Non nonsense buy an album get MP3 for free.  Beats all other services because of content and delivery of the content.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the walking dead especially now I can own it and watch it all over again.  Bring it on for the next one. I love Daryl
0486237664|5.0|I bought this book used and it was still in excellent condition. It is was bigger than I expected, and the images are fantastic! As an artist, I can see myself referencing this book many times over the coming years. Great find and awesome buy!!
B0042JIL2E|5.0|I can jam to this in my car any day.  The music is upbeat and fun to listen to, can't go wrong with Mayhem ;-)
B00407PNY2|5.0|Steve McQueen`s acting is brilliant, the directing was top shelf and the car chase was and still is the best I haves seen. The John Wayne movie (McQueen ) is on par.  Quilla.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|This movie is definitely quirky. However, I found it entertaining. Not a super-hero role for Arnie and  he was allowed to show his age, Worth seeing.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|A big fan of Michael Caine and Noel Coward. Atop class comedy and excellent directing. Would recommend it to everyone. Quilla.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Percy series is very gripping read. It very entertaining and quick read. It had a great ending  to set up the next book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I recently got on the Twilight bandwagon, a little late, I know.  But I absolutely loved these books.  They were so easy and quick to read.  I was a bit sad when the story ended.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It is a wonderful series and done as I believe only the Brits can do it-- superb casting  and production--camera work wonderful except for some photo forshortening seqiences--where the camera should hae been lover becuase the angle taken tended to make the actors appear foreshortened.<br /><br />Shirley MacLane was miscast-- and was atotal falure- very bad choice there.<br /><br />This Fellowes was usually on point and moved things along nicely in his story until the aby smal stupidity surrounding th Mathew death--it was in extreme bad taste and lef a bitterness in my mouth. This highly developed and essential character is of course killd in a country road accident--perhaps there were only two vehicles in a rural area and they managed to crash-- improbable Fellowes.<br /><br />It was not just the killing of of  Crowley, it was the timing and it was vey pour indeed trivializing this essential character who had gone through so much--shades of ye another idiotic scorsece ending---always leae them with a frown.<br /><br />The juxtaposition of majestic happiness with this off the cuff horror was Fellowes biggest screw up in the entire series along wit the horrid MacLane character. With respect to  Crowley he should have been given the respec of being eased out in life or death--but fellowes seemed in so great a hurry to remove this wonderful and loving character in so crass a manner--I guess this is supposed to pass for a Greek Tragic event running parallel to the course of mild empire.<br /><br />There was a stupid scene in the Scorcese film he Departed--after amassive laor the main character is ignominiously killed offcoming out of an elevator-- ruined the entirefilms. Well similarly the preciputouskilling off of Crowley cast a dark pale on Season three.Now I am wondering what there is to worry about in the upcoming season 4.<br /><br />Aside from ruining things with manner in which Crowley was cut down--the  actng is excellent - great character selections. Mary is superb in any place or tim--can't say enough about her wonderfully nuianced acting abillities---Smith is in a word: SUPERB.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My coworker downloaded this game on his phone and became hooked. He told me I had to check it out, so I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire.  I LOVE it! You start off a little Reef shark and grow as you eat and complete missions. I never get tired of it since you evolve to larger species of sharks, and can eat more things. The graphics are awesome, the backgrounds as well as the characters. Great detail and large maps. Just got Part 2, since I  FINALLY got the last shark, which is AMAZING!!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|My husband loves the Stargate series. It really marries, SciFi, history, and science. It is a great show!! Try it now
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|As mentioned by others the book is fairly short.  But it is a good look into what goes on not just in North Korea but also it's even more secretive labor camps.  Unbelievable what Shin had to go through there, to get out, and what he is still going through even now.  I'd say this is a good book to read if you are just getting into what North Korea is like.  It will certainly give you a good first step into learning about it.
B0095GSKDE|5.0|I ordered multiple copies of paperbacks for staff that work with me to save a bit of money. They arrived in a timely manner and with no surprises.  Can't wait for  them to read the book and enjoy as much as I did.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that this game is really cool but it is kinda hard because you flip over easily but this game is still lots of fun.
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|Had it on VHS but seeing I upgraded to blueray figured go for DVD. It is funny and I figured It's time to forgive. Especially after GW Bush did worse.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Well I'm a big fan on Bradley cooper and becoming a fan of Jennifer lawerence. This movie was cute and funny. Had a great ending!
0802473156|5.0|If your spouse doesn't know about the love languages and you are feeling unloved, this book is very good.  I kept telling my husband about our love languages, but he wanted to know more about it so that he could tell others.  It helped our marriage a lot just knowing in-depth about the different love languages.
B00336G7HI|5.0|This battery functions as it should and lasts almost as long as the specs state.  I purchased this battery as a 2nd backup battery.
B00AFOS6P2|5.0|I don't see how I could exhaust this album. No matter how many times I listen to it, it continues to present something fresh every time.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I LOVED IT!!! Such a funny, awesome book. Thank you Ellen!! Your book got me through some really hard times.
B00418NVLW|5.0|Two separate albums in one, and each attacks you in a different way. I was expecting good, but I was completely blown away.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded this to my android phone because I wanted to download a couple of bibles from Amazon and didn't have a kindle, well I love how I can go to my phone and pull up any scripture to read when I don't have my bible with me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|There's nothing worse than having nothing to do in between flights so Solitaire is perfect for that.  It gets my mind off the time.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I really loved this movie.  This movie reached me on so many different levels that it is hard to explain the effect it had on me.  All I can say is that it is one of the sweetest movies I've seen in awhile and I really would like to own it.  If you want a romantic comedy that is a little crazy then I would recommend this movie.  It really was such a sweet movie which had two people who fit perfectly together that it's worth watching, enjoy!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Yes the game is fun to play, but you seldom win and when you do you get so few credit it cost more to play than what you earn.  I have been playing in one room for such a long time time (over a month)and I only need one more shadow card to complete room. I continue to get dozens of the same shadow card over and over and they intentionally make sure you don't get one of them - so you never get to complete that room.  Doesn't make any sense.  I am not on facebook so I can ask friends to give me the missing one.  I have been trying to get the tumbleweed in Plano and I truly believe it just doesn't exist.  I bet I played that room over 100 times.<br /><br />Very frustrating - also I purchased two slot spins yesterday (.99 each) and never got them RIP OFF - be careful they just take your money.  What would it hurt to let people win more often?  Come on guys lighten up and let people win now and then.  Purchased $7.99 in credits and they lasted me less than 1 hour of play.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Seems to work pretty well. Doesn't get my knife all that sharp, but as sharp as I've ever needed it to be I suppose. Extremely light, so it's good for backpacking as well.<br /><br />TIP: Use the ceramic for sharpening. Carbide for repairing &#34;burred&#34; metal.
0060989157|5.0|Surprisingly engaging ,page turner memoir . A must read for Mötley Crüe fans .what an amazing story.\--/ it was impossible to put down.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Using an Android HTC DNA phone with an Apple iPhone 4S. No problems, no fuss. The charger doesn't get hot. Has been used on several long-distance road trips and have had no issues.<br /><br />[edit] After a week or two with it, I noticed that the end metal pin gets stuck in position, and very frequently doesn't stay in contact with the car end. Amazon allowed me to return it, so hopefully the second will work better this time.<br /><br />[edit] Anker responded immediately to my review on Amazon. They apologized for the inconvenience and sent me a free replacement adapter. It has been working flawlessly since, and I have to give two thumbs up to Anker for being incredibly responsive and tending to their customer needs. Definitely recommend to anyone. With this kind of customer service you can be comfortable knowing that the company stands by its product completely and will go the extra mile to make sure you feel that way too.
0446569909|5.0|Entertaining and hilarious read.i hope to be just like Ozzy when I grow up god willing \- -/ what an amazing memoir
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|Exceptionally good movie. Great plot and and ample action. I also look forward to buying this DVD when it comes on sale.
B0095P3ULC|2.0|Phony, unrealistic junk movie. I do not think even my kids would enjoy this movie. Leave it for others to spend their hard earned cash on.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We're watching it foe the second time.  We're probably enjoying it more the second time.  I highly recommend it. yes
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|This movie is good from start to finish. All the characters are developed well & the plot is creative. All action & suspense! My type of flick.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I've been using this alarm clock app for quite a few months now and couldn't be happier with it. (Well, as happy as I can get in the morning.) Rising music is fantastic, and I'm allowed to use custom tones as my alarm, vibration, and snooze options, etc. It's simple where it needs to be and complex where it has to be.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love the way it changes puzzles. It doesn't get boring that way. Enjoyed all of the games that it has.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Of course the books are always better but I just don't like how they don't follow the storyline. Might of enjoyed more having not read the book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read it. Trying to describe this book in a short amount of words will just undermine how extraordinary it is.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Good romantic movie with an exciting twist at the end, of course having Josh Duhamel in it makes it worth watching!
0071766588|5.0|The book has lots of topics for you to practice writing, also, the cd rom can give you an idea of how the test is. Also those practices are really useful.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was interesting to follow  his thoughts as he compared what he experienced on his journey to heaven and his professional knowledge as to how the brain functions.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie, highly recommend.<br /><br />Even better it was free to watch with Amazon.com prime.<br /><br />I see there is a Hunger Games 2 coming out this fall.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I got lost in this book! The author took me away and made me literally have feelings for the characters. This is a great read a and I encourage everyone  to open their minds and dive right in.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Best series I've seen in a long time. I would highly recommend it.  I am looking forward to the installment.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Plays great, in a soft cover, which I personally like better than hard because they are more durable, esp when dropped.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Edited: 3/23/2014: I FOUND A FIX!!! The Kindle HDX can easily handle the full Facebook and Twitter programs. I called my Mayday pals (aren't they WONDERFUL??) And we learned together that if, when you plug in either address and an M is embedded there somewhere, simply go up and take out the M!! Now I can do anything from my Kindle that I want to do on the FULL websites!! Best Wishes to all of you. I will be happy when those mobile versions of ANY website go to that long dark road in the night :-)<br /><br />Edited: 10/10/2013: Things have gone from bad to worse. I have given up completely on this app. I suggest you don't download the app and try to work from the full Twitter application if you can. Not only does it crash over and over again, but you can do very limited things compared to the full Twitter app. I am no longer using this Kindle when I am on Twitter. I now use my laptop. Too difficult. Shame on Kindle AND Twitter for not fixing these incessant glitches!<br /><br />Original review: It causes me no end of trouble. When I first downloaded this app, it was slow and kept getting hung up. I figured it was a fairly large, fast program (unlike a lot of naysayers in here, I LOVE Twitter) and gave it a chance.<br /><br />Well, after two months, I am still having no end of trouble with it on my Kindle PAD, which is supposed to be able to handle these programs, but now I cannot get to my own Tweets, nor can I find a way out of private mail. I literally have to re set up the program. After a half hour of this nonsense, I end up opening my laptop, which I got this Kindle to sort of replace, and all problems solved.<br /><br />I used to have the smaller version reading Kindle and turned it in for this piece of garbage. I wish I'd kept the little Kindle - the only problem I had was a bad keyboard. But I could shop, use Facebook, Twitter, and pretty much anything on the web. Not so, this lemon. Yes, I know I need to call and complain (again!), but I am tired of the Kindle dance (the last smaller Kindle was a replacement for another lemon).<br /><br />Next time? I'm getting an IPad!!le dance (the last smaller Kindle was a replacement for another lemon).<br /><br />Next time? I'm getting an IPad!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This Book Was Boring As'f And Lame T'h Don't See This In No body Stores Frfr Won't Nobody Read It !
B001LOPYHI|4.0|Logan’s Run is a movie about one possible future for humankind.  It deals with the human condition of believing one thing for everyone else, but when it comes time for ourselves we want a different future.  The future for the inhabitants of the city is to be terminated by the age of 30 to make room for the next generation.  This follows the rule of “trust no one over thirty”.  All wants and desires are fulfilled within the city for our future children.<br /><br />As stated above, the author wanted to show the city dwellers having all pleasures satisfied.  The satisfying pleasures shown are for men only.  Gratuitous nudity, see through clothing, common baths, nymphomaniacs, and hunting.  One place they showed women and men together is in the love shop; the other was going to carousel together.  The only pleasure shown for just women was a place to alter their faces using plastic surgery.  This is a male view of the world that women only want to change their faces with surgery for pleasure or be nymphomaniacs.<br /><br />As is common in Science Fiction stories, as a race we want to have a choice.  The choice defined for this movie is to conform or to want something different.  So the founders of the city created sanctuary for the disenfranchised and carousel for the believers. For the believers, carousel gives one the ability to renew and continue living a second 30 years.  Everyone believes that someone has renewed, but of course no one has ever seen a friend over 30 years old in the city.<br /><br />The main crux of the movie is the conflict between friends, one a believer and the other a non- conformer.  If the non-conformer had informed his friend of his assignment, they would have went together in friendship, but instead the runner non-conformist decided to keep it to himself and his friend felt betrayed.<br /><br />The second point the movie makes is the assumption that everyone wants to live to an old age even if it means giving up all pleasures in life.If they ever made Logan’s run II, they could show the old faction of believers wanting to stay in the city and the other fighting with them for control.  Who is going to teach them how to farm and provide for themselves?  Currently the city takes care of them.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Love the series - it's awesome!  I was a little disappointed in the Amazon player though.  I went out and bought all the necessary cables to hook my iPad into my TV, only to find that, for some reason,  the play wouldn't support an HDMI connection.  Next time I'll just order the DVD's.  Tks.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Fun movie for an hour and a half of distraction. Typical Arnold fare but enjoyable predictable action movie that suspends disbelief.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|\\"Get Lucky\\" is the first single from Daft Punk's Random Access Memories.  While Pharrell Williams provides a cool vocal, it is the other guest Nile Rodgers who really puts his stamp on the song.  His slinky guitar harkens back to his glory days with Chic.  The song sounds like it could have easily been spinning at Studio 54 circa 1979.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Truly a great book about life, love, happiness, and death.  Although it is written from a teenager's point of view this book is appropriate for all ages!
B000002N2N|5.0|Highly recommend will instantly put you in a great mood. A must for Ramoniacs. A fast paced wall of sound. Joey's voice is in top form.
B009GX6SSK|4.0|Most reality shows have a sizeable element of fake. Not this one. Very real and quite addictive. You quickly see how drawn in the whole gold mining thing is.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This book makes you think. I also will continue to read his other books. I don't think I would go down into the underground. I hate close places.
1594746168|5.0|***Review copy provided by Quirk Books<br /><br />A Nineteenth Century setting with dark macabre scientific experiments -- how could I not love it? While the book is dark and creepy with a strong Frankenstein-esque vibe,  I don't think that it is too over the top. Much of the story of Dr. Spencer Black, plays out in our imagination.<br /><br />Easily the high point of the book has to be the eye-popping illustrations. It's a book that I plan to keep on my coffee table rather than hide in a bookcase. Sphinxes, sirens, satyrs, and mermaids are all beautifully dissected and artfully displayed for our grisly perusal.<br /><br />It begs the question, if this is the art of a madman, what does it say about a person like myself who enjoyed it so? Hmmm.<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"The Resurrectionist: The Lost Work of Dr. Spencer Black\\" and give it 5 skeletal dragons out of 5.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Loved how Gaiman used a lesser known pantheon of gods in his story. As always, he delivers a great story.
B00947N6D8|4.0|Loved this! It was both creative and imaginative. Though animated, it seemed amazingly real. What can I say? Loved it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris did not disappoint with this newest Sookie Stackhouse book!  I love this series and Dead Ever After is another winner!  Very entertaining read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great fun for Bordem super addicting and fast to play and dosn't take much time to get in to it. overall awesome
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I selected this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR.  It sounded quite fascinating, and indeed it was.  Those were very angry days in the run-up to this country's entry into World War II, but no more so than today's angry days in Congress over issues like the war with Iraq, health care (i.e. &#34;Obamacare&#34;), debt reduction vs. job creation, tax reductions for the well-connected, etc.  The author tends to focus on the personalities involved, especially Charles Lindberg and Ann Morrow Lindberg, which makes it interesting for those who may not be caught up in the purely political aspects of the Isolationist vs. Interventionist fight.  The change of heart by most Isolationists after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor is a lesson that was not lost on later politicians wanting to wage war.  FDR's ability to inspire the public was well-known, but his reluctance to lead based on his own convictions, at times, was news to me.  And Wendell Wilke was only known to me as the guy who ran against FDR in 1940.  His true role and character was revealed to me in this book.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A story within a story; my fondest of reads. A love between two dark souls proves to be the corruption of many a happy life, but not without a fair fight. A seed of light is planted and persevered, as always, to outweigh the evil.<br />A great read, indeed.
B007G92QGO|3.0|Interesting. The main persons very well described. The conflict arising between the judicial aspect and the emotions experienced by the parents.<br />But too much law, court sessions - for the normal person who is not a lawyer a bit tiring.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|What a great book-I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day-did not expect it to end the way it did.
B007MOU6ZQ|5.0|Although \\"The Antidote\\" is a timely commentary on the 20th century cult of positive thinking and all it's myriad drawbacks, its most enlightening feature is that much of what it holds up as a mirror to our new age obsession with happiness is drawn from ancient philosophies and age-old religions.<br /><br />From the logical detachment of the Stoics, to the meditative detachment of the Buddhists, we follow the authors journey as he goes from worrying about life, to accepting it.<br /><br />It's a highly interesting book, and a concise introduction to many fields and threads of thought concerning the path to a better life through negativity - seperating ourselves from the things that happen around us, taking a step back and realising that while bad things might not be under our control, bad feelings are, or stepping even further back, and realising that our bad feelings, or any of our feelings at all, are not us.<br /><br />The author doesn't pontificate or merely introduce us to the philosophical ideas he has rediscovered, but takes us on his own journey through his research into meditation, psychological exercises, interviews with leading thinkers on the subject, as well as relating both ancient and contemporary commentary.<br /><br />The topic on Failure deserves an entire book to itself, and is instructive in revisiting the attitudes of our ancestors, even just a hundred years ago:  that failure is okay, that we don't have to feel good about something to do it, that often, the best habit to cultivate is just to get on with the job, even if we don't feel like it.  \\"Feeling like it\\", or being motivated and upbeat, is a superfluously modern artefact.<br /><br />Because of this book I have bought my own guide to Stoicism (by a happy coincidence I had just read the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius not long before The Antidote) and have signed up to some Buddhist meditation classes nearby.  Just being guided to the realisation that I am not my thoughts has been a blessing.<br /><br />I'll let you know how I go.<br /><br />I'll let you know how I go.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game I play it almost everyday. there are a lot of cool bricks like gold emerald. and quorts I have a huge mansion and I got this yesterday love this game I'm 15 years old I love this great game
B009NLC1D6|5.0|The film is of epic proportions, yet hardly ignores the small things and nuances of Gandhi, and comes a close as is possible to capturing the essence of the greatness of the man. Ben Kingsley characterization of Gandhi is flawless, and the movie is beautifully framed and filmed. The supporting actors are nearly as good, making for an all around terrific effort.<br /><br />It is three hours long, and worth every minute. I recommend it to the entire family, if you can tear them away from action games and immerse them a little while in history and storytelling instead.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This was &#34;proscribed&#34; to me by a premarital counselor.  I am only eighteen but already just by applying the techniques in this book I've seen drastic changes in my relationship with my girlfriend, my mother, and my girlfriends mother.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I love this cd and I love Bon Jovi! The music is great! My favorite songs are: Because we can,Army of One, and The fighter. The art work on the packaging is amazing!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Just the right amount of romance, suspense, and twist in plot.  Characters were real, and message was good for maturing audiences.
B000I186FW|5.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time--but not just for the eleventy-seven obvious reasons, such as action, acting, casting, effects, plot, music, cinematography, and so on (though I DO  love it for these reasons, too).  This film pushes so many buttons on the socio-political level that it should be taught in every high school civics course (do they even teach Civics in high school anymore?).  Also introduce this film to every first year university student as part of the core curriculum.<br /><br />Barring all that, it's just sanguine, brilliant, shocking fun.<br /><br />Oh, this another film I like to watch with the subtitles turned on so I don't miss even a bit of the dialog.  Try it. Seriously.
B00CBKVGGY|5.0|We enjoyed it. Just good old angry gangster fun and a perfect role for Sean Penn. I don't believe he was 'acting' or had to work very hard to get into the role, if you know what I mean!  lol. Anyway, good acting by all the cast and action filled.
B0047SF41G|4.0|great action movie. the final chapter of the predators trilogy. came with a digital copy. even if you seen this before its a good movie to keep on the movie library.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I love this movie and also the movie totoro. We watch them both together a lot. My toddler is 2 1/2.
B0002ONAM4|5.0|sending all of the pixies recordings to be re released on 180gm vinyl was a perfect idea. our old copies were cheaply pressed, worn out or just not available on vinyl. thank you for releasing these!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I used to love these books. I couldn't wait to get my hands on them. How could something so good turn so bad so fast? The beginning was slow however eventually she did have me interested, and looking forward to what was next. The end half just ruined the whole book. First: the plot was lame second: characters were off  third: (the last straw that you saw coming) the end just sucked-no pun intended! Sookie didn't feel like Sookie. It was as if the author wanted nothing to do with this book but had to write it. Such a shame! I'm regretting giving my money to this farce. The things C.H. says about this book make me roll my eyes! If she had written a book about characters, and a little less about her own personal views, this could have ended on a better note.
B001CVCAYA|5.0|sending all of the pixies recordings to be re released on 180gm vinyl was a perfect idea. our old copies were cheaply pressed, worn out or just not available on vinyl. thank you for releasing these!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I Love it! This game is addicting, and sometimes I spend too much time playing it.<br />Very easy and fun to play.
B00004YYDI|5.0|the international version leaves in a little more of the relationship between leon and his charge. this movie is fantastic and really lets the young portman shine

B0073COMUW|5.0|I love these, They're awesome. I bought these to Replace C.Crane Geo Bulb 2 or 3 I cant recall. But these Are Nice and Bright and have lowered my Bill by a few dollars so far. I will be buying a about 10-or-20 for my new house. There quiet, Bright, fit standard bulb socket, and have a decent warranty i think 3 yrs, and Are a Very White daylight White.  I suggest these to anyone wanting a Bright nice clean daylight bulb, I noticed only a few dollars saving but over a few years it will be allot better results.<br /><br />I don't work for the Company But I like there website they have allot of other types of Bulbs that I want to Put on my New House.
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|thankfully this was released. the red vinyl is beautiful. packaging is great and the sound is fantastic. super excited to finally own this on wax
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|Grandson who is 13 years old came from out of town for the weekend and wanted to know if I had it so we could have our &#34;movie night&#34;.  I told him I hadn't bought it yet.  He said it was a really good movie....so I bought it.  He'll be down in a few weeks again, so I am going to surprise him with it for our movie night.  If my thirteen year old Grandson likes it...it's gotta be good!!!!!
B000PMLFRA|4.0|I was very satisfied with the picture clarity! Clear enough to see most all detail. The surround sound was set up utilizing all speakers on my 5.1 system, you can hear Luke's speeder coming fromleft, to middle, to right. The only beef I have is why did they choose to include certain scenes with the CGI updates, instead of the original versions. I get that the speeder effects were lacking a bit, and the scene with solo and jabba was absent and truly missed in the storyline, but HEY! Why not leave it as it was presented ? Other than that, this is by FAR the best ever home presentation of this film available. Forget it's shortcomings, and enjoy the big beautiful fantastic sounding presentation.
B00CDCLL1A|5.0|It takes a bit of time to develop but once I was into it I was caught up in the vast canvas of time.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|It may have been the editing, but the story didn't flow smoothly.  We'll watch anything with Tommy Lee Jones in it, and the rest of the cast was good to.  We enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't a great one.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is one of my favorites also... great love story, great actors, Ryan Gosling is SO HOT in this movie....!
0385486804|3.0|I bought this after reading the author's other famous book, Into Thin Air; the book about the Mt. Everest tragedy in 1996.  The Everest book made you feel like you were there...well, because the author was there.  This book, Into the Wild, was based off his backtracking the events and route that the idiot main character took.  Yes, idiot.  What person goes into the Alaska back country without the proper gear, supplies, or knowledge to survive?  I can understand giving up everything to discover the country, and one's self...but in the book, he repeatedly avoids even material help from others, and creates a predicament that every reader knows would be coming, even if you don't read the jacket cover telling you that he dies all alone.<br /><br />Anyways, I just never felt like \\"I was there\\" at any time.  Seems that the author rushed through this book or something, because the emotional connection just didn't get established like a good book does to you.  Guess it's hard to immerse the reader in the events when the author can only relay generalities of what he believes happened based off some interviews with those that knew the character.  Towards the end, the author actually talks about one of his own \\"near death\\" experiences climbing a glacier...and spends many pages walking everybody through his successful mounting.  Just wish he would have tried to put in more details and immersion ability into the person he was actually writing about in this book instead of turning the book completely off subject and discussing himself in this way.<br /><br />I can't recommend it at full retail...but I'd say grab it if you find it on sale or at a discount store someplace.
B000NJMJGG|4.0|Quirky but very cute movie!  I don't understand why this rating requires so many words, sometimes less is more, enjoy!
B009G41CG2|1.0|downloaded program did not include instructions on how to play the game, so therefore the game is useless to me
B00005JCAA|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite but don't watch it unless you have a box of kleenex and want to get sucked into the greatest love story of our time....
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|the downloaded program did not include any instructions on how to play the game, so it is useless to me
B0071XO8RA|2.0|Let me start with the good stuff. Hugh is clearly a gifted writer who will no doubt be successful.  The text and dialogue flow nicely making the book very readable.  The problem is that the plot is so lame that  you keep hoping that it will go somewhere, but it doesn't.  Somebody about 12 might not notice that the whole thing makes no sense, but an adult will surely feel that this book needs a lot of work in the concept development area.  If you read it, you won't believe you wasted so much time on such crap.<br /><br />At the end of your life when you have been banished from civilization, do you really think you will be willing to clean off some sensors for the people who banished you with a piece of wool before you die from lack of oxygen?
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Fun and easy to play. My kids will love it.  Another hit by zepto. However, I could do without the IAP.

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|tom and sandra delivered as I thought they would.  I have watched it 2x.  I will probably watch it a 3x  soon.  I like victorious  family movies, and this definately  was.  I regret  not being  as dedicated  as  this child was.  I  was  rescued  by  sandra  when she explained about  knowing what the boy  had  done  and how she was able to let him go about his research  following  but  not  interfering. and then the  twist  of  it not  being  what  the boy thought it was,  and yet  acceptable. I got the warm and fuzzy  when the  people  recognized  how much it meant and they  attempted  to  help,  even though  they  didn't  have the answer.
0547848412|5.0|You will learn about a part of yourself that you may not have known existed until you read this story.  The symbolism is &#34;spot on&#34; and creates a vivid visual of who we really are as people.  This book is inspiring.  Powerful ending...must read completely through.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|I would like to see more personal  story line in the beginning.  overall I liked the movie.  I'm  glad I bought it, but it will be awhile before I watch it a second time.

B002EMESSM|5.0|Much greater storyline than the current films. This film will be a favorite for classic Star Trek fans. If you are looking for a movie that isn't just a theme park ride, then give this movie a try.
B00B4804KS|4.0|already a great movie, I found the 3d to be an enhancement. my wife and I both<br />enjoyed it in 3d and I thought they did a pretty good job of conversion.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Can't say anything new that was not already said under the 1 star ratings.<br />Confused by all the 5 stars. Boring....lots of stairs....yawn.

B00992CF6W|4.0|awesome... no glitches, no problems, exactly how it should be. block story or worldcraft are nothing in comparison. not bad, but minecraft is dolt awesome and has no equal.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I don't want to give the ending away so all I can say is it did not end the way I would have liked it to but it wasn't horrible.
B000W0B0UC|5.0|If you had the pleasure of being in the SF Bay Area in the early 90's there was an awesome light-jazz station, KKSF, that played a LOT of Acoustic Alchemy!  NOW, with this wonderful MP3 I can do my own programming!  Acoustic Alchemy has a striking and upbeat sound that I've not heard by any others.  This may be an old album, BUT it is timeless and transcendent.  Give the free previews a listen and hear for yourself.  I am DELIGHTED that I found this and I have enjoyed it immensely!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ENTIRE ALBUM! It's WONDERFUL!
159463176X|5.0|There are many kinds of poverty, financial poverty and mental/emotional poverty the most obvious herein.  What people do and become to surmount these formidable obstacles is the essence of Hosseini's latest novel.  It is in the early 1950s in an Afghan town called Shadbagh.  Abdullah and Pari are the children of Saboor who begins this story by telling them the story of a young boy who is stolen by a djin.  Little does the boy Abdullah, who loves his father's tales, realize that his sister Pari will be sold within the week to his step-Uncle Nabi's employers, Mr. Wahdati and his wife Nila.  Nila is a central focus for most of this story as she is a famous poet but intensely unhappy woman.  After her husband has a stroke, she will leave him to live in Paris with Pari.  At this point, one wonders how Abdullah and Pari will ever find each other, given their phenomenal closeness before their separation.<br />After they leave, Nabi takes care of Mr. Wahdati, even after he discovers a secret that almost made him leave.  We then hear of another sibling story between Parwana (stepmother to Abdullah and Pari; their father's second wife) and her sister Masooma who had a horrific accident and makes a decision that Parwana must carry out, one that frees both sisters from a life of being burdened by each other.  This aspect cuts to the soul of the reader, requiring a courage and sense of self that is true albeit more poignant than words can express.<br />Then we hear the story of a young boy whose father is narco wealthy, who makes his money from selling the poppy flower and who has bought the land in Shadbagh on which Abdullah and Pari grew up.  A family member inherited the property but was cheated out of it by the wealthy but generous man.<br />The bond between Nila and Pari is explored next. Pari truly understands her mother but it doesn't make it any easier, especially as Pari always has this feeling like something is \\"missing.\\"<br />The story of Markos' friendship with a young girl is heartrending but beautiful as well.  The young girl has been permanently disfigured by a dog bite; and though totally revolted initially, Markos and Thalia grow as close as siblings and remain so their entire lives, especially in their connection to other characters in this fictional tapestry.<br />A reunion will end this novel, one that will initiate a freedom for the daughter of Abdullah, who wound up in America running an Afghan barbecue restaurant but is now old and ailing and his sister Pari.<br />So much can be said about this story of real and evolving sibling relationships.  Though not quite as violent as Hosseini's previous two novels, there are fierce moments but more of a sense of honesty, integrity and endurance that truly evolves into bonds of connection equal to and greater than siblings.  No, I haven't by any means given away the whole story; there is so much more in these pages that is compelling, intriguing, brutal, funny, tender and just sheer beautiful.  Khaled Hosseini is a literate fine, fine writer and this book is his best yet!!!! This reviewer hated it to end and is hoping Hosseini will keep writing which he does so magnificently!!!! This novel deserves multiple awards for its greatness! Enjoy every line, every page!ng girl is heartrending but beautiful as well.

B00CHHWCQY|3.0|This is not Michael Bubl&eacute; at his best over produced and seems rushed. He doesn't show much interest in this set. I put the cd on listened, and filed it away. Something I've not done with his previous albums. Even the 3 bonus tracks (Exclusive To Target) don't make it a winner. He takes the Ronettes Be My Baby and ruins it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Character are so flawed, but lovable. The story intrique me and I couldn't put it down.  The language and sex are so very raw.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|If you like spy and espionage, you will like it. It was just not my cup of tea.It was confusing at times, but it was well written
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It is a disturbing book to read as it is as raw of language that I have read.  The charaters are something else, very interesting and the feeling that they have for each other.  Both had a great deal of pain and they are made for each other.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|This has a fast start and slows a bit in the middle, but overall is a fun, funny film. A really good set of cameo stars. Would love to have seen more of Bill Bailey.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would reccomend this book to anyone, it was way more descriptive than the movie was. I'm glad I saw the movie first because if I had read the book first I think I would have been disappointed in the movie because it left a lot of things out. This book was a great read and I'm already starting the second one!!! =)
B004LWZW42|5.0|It stuck with the X-Men movies story line and still managed to introduce new mutants both evil and good.  Looking forward to them making the sequel to this one.  =)
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Like it much better than previous versions. I would tell you the version number but I can't find any way to access a 'Settings' menu to view the version number. I think it must be version 3.'something' because the app icon has changed and now says 'ES Explorer 3'.<br /><br />Also don't like the fact that I have hidden a folder and now have no way known to unhide it.<br /><br />I like the new progress display when transferring files.<br /><br />Also don't like being able to set order of files (name/type/size/date/etc...). Maybe in 'Settings' menu that I can't find.<br /><br />Would have given it all 5 if not for the 'don't likes' above. They are moving in the right direction with this app but they need to keep one thing in mind, if I isn't broken ... don't fix it.<br /><br />Updated review:<br />My age is catching up to me and I guess I'm slowing down. Since the earlier review, I have found the missing menu (must have turned it off by accident in settings)!<br /><br />Both complaints are resolved as is a testament to any well crafted piece of software. The 'Hidden List' selection at the bottom of the menu allowed me to 'unhide' both of my hidden folders.<br /><br />Now if I could just figure out how to hide a folder from the KFHD7 'Photos' app.<br /><br />Truly, this is the best file management app for noobies and more advanced users.
B001AK3S4Y|4.0|I'm a big fan of sci-fi movies so I am biased.  But I thought this movie was good.  I wouldn't put it in the class of X-Men, Avengers, Iron Man or Thor.  But it held it's own.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I am a bit scared to write my review since so many people are outraged with this book. So here goes nothing!<br /><br />I gave this book 5 stars because:<br />  I just couldn't put it down (well, technically I couldn't put down my laptop since I use the kindle software to read my books; so much cheaper than the actual book). I ended up making dinner at 10PM instead of 6pm because time just flew right by me! I purchased the book on Tuesday night. Few hours later, my husband had to wrestle my laptop out of my hands so I would go to sleep. On Wednesday, I camped out on my couch all day needing to finish this book. A book that makes me shake my head, scream \\"you moron!\\" at my laptop, sight in awe, huff in frustration, raise my eyebrow, and go WTF?! Is worth 5 stars in my opinion.<br /><br />If you are thinking to buy this book:<br /><br />1. The story is about college students.<br /><br />  I think this book got so many negative reviews because many readers are thinking of these characters as adults in their 30s. They are not 30! They act childish and stupid because they are childish and stupid.  They are in COLLEGE people (well University to be correct). Abby (the main character) is 18! She turns 19 in the book. She is a TEENAGER. How smart and sophisticated were YOU when you were 18 and freshman in college? I know I was stupid and made some childish mistakes. Travis is not even 21 or may be not even 22. They are young adults who are stupid and naïve and horny! I know I was when I was their age! Why would you expect them to act like they are in their 30s???? When you are 30, you have a brain. When you are 20, you are still working on that part.<br /><br />YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! ------ Please don't buy this book and expect a mature behavior from people in their 30s. Think about what YOU were doing as a freshman in college living on campus AND THEN JUDGE. Compare your stupidity to their stupidity. You will be surprised how similar you acted.<br /><br />2. The first threechapters are addicting!! I agree with other reviewers that this book has a part where it really feels like a high school teenage drama. Which Bores me. But there are some REALLYYYY good parts in this book. (if you like drama) Which outweighs some pages that made me want to skip over but I wouldn't let myself.<br />  This book is dramatic and has lots of shaking your head, raising eyebrow, screaming you moron!, sighting in awe moments. If you do not like DRAMA, do NOT read this book!<br /><br />3. Reviewers have called Travis (the \\"hero\\" haha I'm laughing as I am typing Travis = the hero) offensive and abusive.<br /><br />I am not disagreeing and definitely not calling him a \\"gentleman\\". However, please consider that he is young, definitely has issues, and still figuring out how to properly express himself.<br /><br /> I read reviews that zero in on the part where Travis trashes his apartment when Abby leaves. Ok, this is aggressive but doable. My boyfriend punched a wall when he got upset. Never has he EVER tried to get physical with me. EVER! I think this is their way of getting frustration out. If it was me, I would just go shopping. But that's the difference between testosterone and estrogen. Again, keep in mind, they are not 30! Stupid behavior is expected. I think if Travis was trashing the apartment and punching people in his 30s, I would be running for the hills. Or Canada ;)<br /><br />Now, there are parts in the book that I don't agree with. For example, when he is punching people left and right for looking at his girlfriend. (And she encourages it?! What happened to looking the other way? Being a better person? huh?!) It made me wonder why he didn't end up in jail? I mean if you got beat up, wouldn't you call cops? I would!<br /><br />4. This book is not your typical \\"happy romance with perfect heroine and hero\\". The book is about a VERY DYSFUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP. The main couple's relationship is very intense, much like a roller coaster. They have pastsand bring their baggage to their new relationship. Don't expect to read about a happy, perfect couple in this book.<br /><br />AND that's about it! Thank you for reading my review on Beautiful Disaster :)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A must have for sci-fi fans.  Unique perspective of space based movie.  I loved the series.  I also have the movie Serenity to complete the collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Haven't read book in a while. Loved it! Can't wait to read the third in the trilogy. Starting it now
B004EPZ07K|4.0|I'm a superhero fan.  The movie could have had a better story line but the fx did not disappoint.  I'm just sad that the movie did not make enough money to cover the cost of making it because there probably won't be a sequel.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is good.  Very good.  38-million-copies-sold-internationally good.  So-successful-he-quit-his-decade-long-career-as-a-physician good.  But does this mean he's talented?  Of course he is.  But not all bestselling authors are.  Ever heard of E.L. James or Stephenie Meyer? Or how about Dan Brown?  Brown's books have sold over 200 million copies, been translated into 52 languages, and he has lots of critics (not to mention haters).<br /><br />So why trust my opinion?  Let me explain.<br /><br />There are lots of talented authors out there but often where they excel in one area, they seem to falter in another.  There are skilled grammarians, wondrous wordsmiths and magicians of metaphor, but even equipped with all that they fail to produce a story that flows and that holds a reader's interest.  Then there are the gifted raconteurs, writers who rule with style rather than language, and take readers so deep into their own world that those people forget they're just sitting in a chair with a book in their hand.<br /><br />There are great writers and then there are great storytellers.  Khaled Hosseini is both.<br /><br />\\"And The Mountains Echoed\\" is his finest work.  Complex, interweaving, always poignant, and often heartbreaking. The novel is prefaced by a story that establishes a perpetually bittersweet undercurrent and it shares the same central theme of family and friendship that his previous novels are known for, yet the myriad of stories he includes here makes these themes seem much weightier by comparison.  Set in Afghanistan, America, and France and spanning more than 50 years, the novel takes the reader into many a character's private hopes, dreams, joys, regrets, and pain, and the six degrees of separation between them all. Hosseini described it as \\"revolving around brothers and sisters, and the ways in which they love, wound, betray, honor, and sacrifice for each other.\\"<br /><br />I was moved many times as I read this, in particular by the book's opening involving the folktale of the div who stole away children from a village.  That story alone was enough to make my heart ache but there was much more wrenching stuff to come.  I loved how he began it with the brother and sister, how it mirrored the story of the div, and that he closed the book with those siblings - it made it feel like everything came full circle.  I also loved the common thread of each character having some sort of void within themselves, and how each struggled with it and/or desperately tried to fill it.<br /><br />Much as I would like to say this novel is perfect, it isn't.  There are sections here that didn't seem in keeping with and/or had tenuous connective threads to the rest of the story.  The chapter featuring Idris seemed as though it was written more for the purpose of elucidating a Westerner's limited knowledge of the inherent problems in Afghanistan.  The chapter featuring Markos seems solely an examination on friendship and the relationship between mother and son.  If these sections hadn't been a part of the novel, they could certainly stand on their own as short stories.<br /><br />\\"And The Mountains Echoed\\" is the type of book that I very much see being added to - and pushed to the forefront of - required reading lists for high schools nationwide in that the enormity of its themes and its observations on the sociopolitical climate in Afghanistan are of significant value in the realm of contemporary literature.  It is destined to become a new classic.opening involving the folktale of the div who stole away children from a village.

B001E95ZHY|4.0|This movie was very funny! I can see y it didn't get more popular but totally worth it! Good actors in it. Very funny! Will watch over n over too.  They could've come up with a better title
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Good pace, lots of data to support her claims. Great ideas and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Highly recommended for any women who are interested in business or career development.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Good sale.  But it's friggin' STUPID that I have to write a minimum number of words.  Crap.  Three more to go.
B005ES0YA4|5.0|I resisted buying crocs for a long time.  I interested when a friend overseas ask us to bring multiple pairs to them for our visit.  To my surprise, it feels very comfortable.  I like the Duet sport clog because of it's duel layer design.  It's a softer feel when you walk.  The only problem watch out is walking on wet tiled surface. It can be slippery.  BTW, this is my second pair!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the Downton Abbey series.  Unfortunately I discovered it in 2013 so missed the first 3 seasons on TV.  But I'm making up for lost time with Amazon.
0896760839|5.0|Excellent help, lots of period pictured and plenty of graphs and aids to help you construct your very own piece of history
B002QYNIHU|5.0|This is so much better than the Irwin toys and Hybrid DBZ figures. Great articulation, paint job, and sculpt. I bought it used for about $31, and it still had that new toy smell. I assume it only said used because the box wasn't in mint condition. But the box isn't horrible, it just had clear tape sealing it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|im nine and I love this app and your kids will love it too. I love it because you even get to ride<br />around in a car so you should really get this app
B00A83075M|5.0|I am going to say first, I didn't purchase this film from amazon (I know I should of) but couldn't wait for the delay in shipping! So, hopefully this review helps you decide whether to watch it/purchase it or not. I am not really big into Disney kiddie movies myself, but I WAS WAY OFF THIS ONE!!<br /><br />First of all the characters. You may be familiar with their shows or other movies, (i.e. Ralph *John C. Riley* or best known from Step Brothers, Sgt Calhound *Glee* Jane Lynch, Fix it Felix *30th Rock Jack McBrayer* and of course Venelope *School of Rock* Sarah Silverman. How could I forget? Married with Children's \\"Al Bundy\\" = Mr. Litwalk (Arcade Operator). Voice acting was superb and the writers really brought out the actor's personality/resemblance into the virtual world with the characters.<br /><br />Ralph simply no longer wants to be a bad guy and Venelope wants to become a racer and both are forced to collaborate in order to achieve their goals and during that process, develop a brother-sister relationship. Of course, the story is not that linear and does take off focus from the main characters for a bit, but nothing to be concerned with because the script/writing is just well tight, focused and controlled! (There's no fluff here). It's great to see sides from character nostalgia. NO MARIO or LUIGI characters on this one, but felt they weren't needed at all for this animation!! Bowser is there though!<br /><br />Anyone else sees the Alice and Wonderland resemblance \\"The Hatter\\" and King Candy? Was this intentional?<br />Of course, it's Disney!! Why wouldn't they! Although King Candy's voice slightly reminds me of the voice of Roger Rabbit.<br /><br />Anyway, my final verdict.<br /><br />If you are gamer at heart, old school, new school, retro, or whatever, you will enjoy this film and the game references (see if you can spot them all!).<br /><br />Kids will definitely enjoy this! Specially if they know the iconic characters!<br /><br />Adults and Grown ups,even if you aren't a gamer, do not pass this up! Watch it with your children, nieces, nephews, grandchildren or whatever. Just watch it and be ready to laugh, cry and possibly tear together on those emotional moments because this movie will grab you and bond you with the characters!<br /><br />Have watched this at least 10 times and still as good as the first time I saw it!<br /><br />Best Disney film to date and has not disappointed! Can't wait for Monsters Inc 2 this summer!!!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|It is super witty and sarcastic: Definitely one of those books that has you giggling to yourself as others look on jealousy, obviously out of the loop.<br /><br />Bossypants is a quick, fun read.
B002OPZ37E|5.0|One of my favs i lole this album. Great sound quality. Over all ROCKS my socks off. Would recommend to all adtr fans.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really enjoyed the beginning of the book, but thought it dragged on towards the end.  Like his other book, it is well planned out and but also suspenseful.<br /><br />Since the book is an &#34;oral history&#34; with each chapter following another person's story, I think it might be an even better movie as Brad Pitt seems to be the main character.
B000FC130E|5.0|I was introduced to Neil's work in Good Omens and was thrilled to find this just as good.  This ia imagined story about finding yourself, real happiness, love, friendship and what really matters in life... just in a really round about way.  London Below is a world where Richard Mayhew finds himself.  In more ways than one.  His adventures are on par with Milo from the book The Phantom Tollbooth, and his companions are just as interesting as are the people he meets.<br />If you are looking for a book that takes you on an adventure, makes you think, question your reality and brings a smile to your face as you envision everyone you meet this is the book for you.  Sadly<br /> there is no sequel or series to follow it up.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was an example of the American spirit.  The willingness for a man to sacrifice for the benefit of all.  Chris was just a good ole Texas boy that used his skills and determination to do a job that many could not do.  He put a human face on a conflict that we only know from biased news reports.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I like this app is very good and im glad i downloaded it to my kindle fire its a success
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I had high hopes but was disappointed.  To me this movie went on forever.  I keep falling asleep.  Everytime I woke up there was still a lot of the move to go.  Lol
B00AQCMK32|5.0|So I get this yesterday and i Can not put it down! If you can buy this Get it Know!!!!
B00BJS7104|5.0|This move has humor, has things that will make you angry, happy, and sad.<br /><br />Great acting, great story.  This has to go in the movie collection.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was amazing. It made me laugh and cry all at the same time. I couldn't believe all the sorrow the young girl went through, but that's what made the story great!!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This move was so inspirational!  The colors, the unique creatures, the stories eithin a story.<br /><br />This is a must see.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Saw the documentary and bought the book. They compliment each other quite well. Have started the diet and am losing weight! i have found this is the only sustainable diet that works for me.
0061367036|5.0|I purchased this for the amusement and &#34;education&#34; of my 15-year-old granddaughter - she loves it!  To be fair, she is a big fan of the show and would probably love anything related to it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Hosseini is a masterful writer as always but some readers may be disappointed that this book essentially has no plot.  It is a beautiful weaving of interrelated biographies spanning lifetimes and continents.  It does enlighten the reader to a degree about Afghanistan's modern history, but the sense of place is not nearly as strong as in his previous novels because it is so diffuse. Worth reading, but not as rewarding as I had expected.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 20 times since I downloaded it.  I love being able to watch the movie anywhere.
B004TI1WME|5.0|A pet peeve is not being able to see entries.  This gives you the ability to run a visual tape.
B00BAYLRNO|4.0|This impossibly true story is visually stunning and maintains your interest throughout. Naomi Watt delivers an outstanding performance in the heroic depiction of a mother who suffers greviously but maintains her dignity. The movie's title is apt and you are doubtful this story is true, but it is...a great bit of storytelling.
074357818X|5.0|A terrific tale of survival by Steven King beautifully read by the talented Anne Heche.  Abandoned in the wilderness 9 year old Trisha McFarland must become the sort of woman who can find her way to safety.  Anne Heche gives a performance beyond what is usually heard in audio books as she portrays Trisha's transition from a panic stricken child to an empathetic yet ferocious survivor ready to take on a bear (or a hallucination, or her fears) with nothing more than a broken transistor radio.
B003ODL3KG|4.0|I did not know album was reissued I did not see that in the description.But the album looks great and will play nice I am sure.Is the album rendered also?
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Soooo good!! Couldn't  put it down. Needs to have a sequel!! Highly recommend! I need more words so here they are.
1401937519|5.0|Saw Anita live, and HAD to read her book!  Was very inspiring, and a great guide to living a more authentic and fulfilling life.  She is very understandable, straight-forward on a difficult topic, and truly inspirational.  Thanks for writing this book and sharing this story with the world  My husband and son are now going to read it as well.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I am so happy with this book! Finally, a romance/erotic novel from the man's perspective. I am waiting for Fifty shades to come out from Christians P.O.V. I was pleased with the chase between Drew and Kate and I enjoyed how the majority of the book was in retrospect after the beginning. I loved Drew 's narration and  his funny, sexy, quick witted charm.  SEXY, SEXY, SEXY!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a very fun exciting game for when you are bored!!! And just a game to have fun in general.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Incredible story, and wild characters.<br />Boy what a reality of how badly people were treated<br />just because they looked different.<br />Hopefully, we will learn from this Movie,<br />not to ever go there, and respect each other.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This is a kids movie that both kids and adults can enjoy,it is the best gift for a kid and family
1400067820|2.0|I was very interested in the ideas in this book, but after reading the Prologue and first chapter, he had ruined his reputation with me. I might have found his sniping at his enemies funny if he had first convinced me they deserved the scorn. Instead, he comes across as an arrogant bully still bitter that he didn't get tenure. This author doesn't want to give me an understanding of the issues, instead he's going to refer to the rest of the thinkers in his field as 'constipated' and 'fragilistas.' I can't trust this fellow to give his story to me strait. Reject.<br /><br />If you're considering reading this book I highly suggest that you download the Kindle 'sample' and give that prologue a try. In the prologue, he claims that he's so insulting because he's highly ethical, and he claims that he's open to scientific response, not by publishing research papers, but by writing footnotes in his books. If you buy all this, then you'll probably like the rest of the book. I find that type of arrogance annoying and not likely to produce reliable results.
B004G600A4|5.0|Awesome kids movie that kids along with parents and grandparents can enjoy and it doesn't get old and I can w ACTH it weekly

B009NY43NY|4.0|Nothing mind blowing, no major plot twists...we get to meet with a lot of old friends (though I'd have liked to see the ones that were left out, and would've liked better closure with some important people in Sookie's life). Very little of the supernatural for a Sookie Stackhouse book. But hey, I've enjoyed the series for what it is and was happy enough to read this final installment. Found it more engaging than the previous book. It's been fun, Mrs. Harris! Thank you!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Simply put, I am beyond disappointed. Didn't even finish the book. I haven't met a single person who wasn't disappointed. blah.
B000HZD168|5.0|Its one of the best star trek movies they made. To see recardo montalban again older was great to finish old story.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It was a good read, but I was hoping for more.  I didn't want it to end the way it did, but it was what I thought might happen.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|A most enjoyable book. Easy to read. the story line catches the imagination of the reader, making it impossible to leave down, until completed.<br />I would highly recommend this book.
0062238868|5.0|It seemed extremely realistic, not only in the battle experiences but also in his personal life.<br />He did an excellent job telling his story.
B00AKOB7CG|1.0|I downloaded this app to give it a try and got as far as the first ad that shows up with most free programs for smartphones.  Unfortunately I'm not one to put up with political propaganda or rhetoric, especially when it's on something that's trying to prove that it deserves my money for the full version.  I do my best to stay out of the political mess so having it blasted at me on an app that should be helping me isn't appreciated.
B0048PU7TC|5.0|Some great duets on here.  Even if you are not a Norah Jones fan, buy this album.  You will not be disappointed.
B00C7KYXHW|3.0|I'm very steeped in the lector fiction and the show is deviating from the story.  It is an interesting cop show.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Got this for free on Amazon's free app day and it has become very addicting. Nice action as things move along and comes in handy waiting in a doctor's office to kill a little time.<br />Highly recommend to everyone.
B001XUPH9K|3.0|This is easily the best of the original Star Trek movies and I thourghly enjoyed it as a kid in the 80's.  On a recent watch however, I found it to be just a bit lacking.  If you have a fond memory of this movie as a young one, keep the memory alive and skip this movie.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is an awesome game. I just wish you didn't have energy. All in all its a good game. I liked the first one on the ipad to.
1608871045|5.0|By reading this you get into the Batman's character, it starts with the most important thing that happened in Bruce's life: the murder of his parents. It makes you feel like you're looking through Batman's eyes. It's very interesting!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence (well deserved Oscar) are brilliant in this film. Their chemistry on screen is amazing.<br /><br />Robert De Niro puts in an Academy Award worthy performance as the father.<br /><br />You will laugh, you will cry, you will just be completely in love with this film as I am. I promise you that!!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Love this game. It has so many different levels. The games are fun to play and gets your problem solving mind excited.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I love this series. From the cast to the writing it is just brilliant. It reminds me of the series \\"Friends\\" in that it is a story about, in this case, five friends just hanging out and living their lives. So, if you are a fan of the \\"Friends\\" series then check this out. You will not be dissappointed.
1439152802|5.0|I am soooo angry that anyone could give this book only one star. I must admit I expect people to like what I like. But really!!!!!  This book is just wonderful from the very first to the very last page.<br /><br />Kate Morton deserves the highest praise for this novel. I found myself liking certain people in the story, and feeling a little guilty about it. All I had to do was wait a while to see if I was right all along.  Kate brings us to a exciting scene, then breaks it off before we know quite how it evolves. I had to keep reading just to find out what was actually transpiring. But I enjoyed every single minute of trying to figure out what was happening.<br /><br />How would you like to search through someone's attic to discover what secrets are hidden there? And imagine the thrill when you come upon something that is mindblowing?<br /><br />I know you'll love this book as I did. I can't imagine finding fault with it.  It's perfect.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Well I don't know how the game is because it won't load on my kindle and I have enough space ugh
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I am a huge fan of swiftkey I have been using it for years nothing is as good of a keyboard as this. It learns your mannerisms your typing style and special words you use.  It helps make you a much more efficient and effective texter all round
B0071XO8RA|1.0|After reading some reviews and after seeing the 4.5 star rating, I was really disappointed with how unexciting the book was.. they travel up and down stairs and bump into each other for about 80 pages YAWN. I couldn't get into it at all. And the plot holes are exceedingly irritating. Really, a 10,000 foot deep underground bunker with a functioning life support system, intranet, oil rig (one would think it dangerous if they ever hit a methane deposit huh?), virtual reality headsets, a complete self-sustaining microcosm with rules, intrigue, a whole culture, BUT NO ELEVATORS?!?!?! SURELY, someone thought to themselves- HEY, LETS BUILD AND ELEVATOR SO TENS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TO RUN UP AND DOWN STAIRS ALL THEIR LIVES. Nope. They got an IT department instead. Its just face-palm ridiculous.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|It had a more comical view then I had expected, many one liners. I very much enjoyed it! I would recommend it.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Although I often had to skim through much extraneous material to get back to the thread of the main story, I enjoyed learning the author's original version of the familiar modern movie version. It also provided a great history lesson.
B007N8RULO|4.0|My husband introduced this game to me, and boy am I glad that he did! It doesn't take much brain power to do and in fact is quite relaxing! Great for when you're sitting in doctors offices with nothing to do!
B008NMT684|5.0|My two year old loves all the different puzzles he can do them on his own its great! I got the boat and airplane one as well
0345472322|5.0|This book provides a simplistic view of two different approaches to learning, participating, and life in general.  Obviously we are not all one or the other, there is a lot of gray area there, but it does present both approaches equally.  It is a quick, easy read.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We all loved this movie. I have four boys ages 22 months to almost 8 and we can watch this movie over and over!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is awesome! To bad the free version takes you to the middle of the game....Will definitely buy the full version!!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Sweet story of two people trying to find themselves after childhoods that were less than perfect. Characters were interesting and story was good although it moved a little slow.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|Broken city is a movie about ex-cop Billy Taggart (Walhberg)seeking redemption and revenge after being double-crossed and then framed by its most powerful figure Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Crowe).<br /><br />Both Walhberg and Crowe play solid roles with Walhberg especially comfortable playing the cop type role, which is something we have seen from him before.<br /><br />The movie itself is entertaining, although a bit slow at times, but brings nothing to the table that surprises or brings  some dramatic twist.  There are times that the plot drags a bit and opens plot lines that are never really answered (i.e, Taggart's girlfriend issues) but its biggest issue is that it doesn't bring anything new and retreads some basic plots that have been done before and better.<br /><br />Broken City is an average movie and worth renting to watch but could have been much more with a little more plot development and better pacing.
B005MLOKXA|2.0|I don't like TV or any other form reading or listening that have sex as one of the main idea.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The boy's Southern accent hurt my ears. I live in the South and I have never heard that accent. The scenery did look familiar. Jeremy Iron's character was a bright spot in the film. He was divine. He had a line about \\"Google it\\" that was funny. The romance was cute. The girl and her magic powers were interesting. Her cousin, the bad girl, was an interesting character. If paranormal romance is your kind of film, this is for you. If you like Twilight, you will probably like this too. I thought the ending was unique. I won't spoil it for you.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great movie. It had various elements of crazy funny and deep...Great movie for those looking for the out of the norm comedy drama, but not good for those who can't take alot of cursing. If you have kids watch while their napping or asleep because of some of the crazy acting out parts and cursing, but it's funny.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this is the best dungeon crawling game I have played since the original &#34;Gauntlet&#34;...  hours of fun for anyone looking for a simple way to kill a lot of time...
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This was a cute movie...My kids especially were addicted to watching this movie over and over...Thank you it came in great condition and fast shipping.
B002APU580|5.0|I have tried to see the other variations of this &#34; Pride & Prejudice&#34; movie to no avail.. I keep coming back to this version. It is just wonderful. It is something to say that I could actually see this movie every week and not get tired of it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Great condition and fast shipping. The movie was great my family was very addicted to watching once a day and on weekends, but I am happy to say that we watch it less now, maybe once a weekend they still love it.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|My daughter and I saw this together and loved it.... It is just such a tear jerker... but, Great Movie..
B004SIP8JI|5.0|Great fictional movie, and the love and romance story was great. I like watching it every once in a while...I love Meg Ryan and I especially love Hugh Jackman.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Have not read this book in over 40 yrs. Written in the old style, no sex, no profanity and lots of morals. Both sexes had their place and each had respect for the other. Beautifully written, (even if I did have to look up quite a few words) the characters you can envision (perhaps due to an old movie with Katherine Hepburn). Thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to reading other classics that have been sitting long forgotten. Best of all free!
0446547646|4.0|I buy these books for my wife because she and our grand daughters enjoy them.  When they are reading I can enjoy my time to do something else.  LOL
B000GWE44U|4.0|The movie is really good. Jack Nicholson does a great job, of course. However, the book is so very much better. Stanley Kubric cut way to much out and changed too much of what he left in the movie.
0385738765|5.0|This was not the book I was expecting when I read the summaries on the web. I had pictured a zombie infested world that the boys had to manage their way through which seemed like it would be a bit disappointing after the other out-right zombie series and the way the Maze Runner had not included anything like that previously. What I got was a veritable scavenger hunt through seriously harsh environments with the addition of girls and others who added such color and dimension to the story. I found myself reading as fast as I could, biting my fingernails, and cheering at certain points.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the further development of Thomas's character as he grows beyond the somewhat shy newbie he started out to be in the first book to a strong, hero-like figure toward the end. I struggled with reading the development of Teresa, however, and hope that where we are left with her at the end of this book is not what it seems. When writer's short-change their readers to keep the pair readers are rooting for apart, it can be frustrating. But I trust Mr. Dashner to have a grander plot in mind and I, for one, cannot wait another year for the final installment!<br /><br />I was up all night with this one, devouring it as fast as Crank can chase you through the underground tunnels. which, by the way, was one of my favorite scenes in the book but I won't spoil you for it if you haven't read it yet. If you haven't read it yet, get thee to the bookstore or library now! Read it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These three books have been the best series I have read in a LONG time! Hopefully another one coming out soon?
0439023513|3.0|I have been such a huge fan of the Hunger Games since I first discovered it sitting in large stacks, seemingly unloved and unwanted, at Barnes and Noble just after its first release. I loved the premise so much I couldn't resist the splurge on a hardcover - something I had not theretofore (is that a word?) ever purchased because they tend to be so cumbersome and expensive. Nevertheless I was hooked immediately and plowed straight through Catching Fire with similar voracity. I could hardly stand the wait until Mockingjay hit the shelves and I have to admit that I read through it in shorter time than I normally manage a book.<br /><br />But I was hit hard by the content. Harder than I think I needed to be hit for the message of the book to get across. I've read a lot of mixed reviews on this book and I think I have to hang my head and sit myself there on the line between loving and hating it.<br /><br />I love it because it is absolutely true to the series and how it has progressed naturally through the three books. The character arcs were true to the way Collins designed and nurtured her characters and their stories were heartbreakingly realistic. I can't forgive an author who sugarcoats for the sake of keeping readers happy. I also love this book because I love the world Collins has created. I want to see them succeed in breaking free of oppression and finding a new, better way of life. I love the satisfaction of the ending, nothing was left hanging and I had no questions at the end - well no plot questions, anyway.<br /><br />I hate this book because it was brutal. There's no way to put it other than that. Bloody, gorey, angry, unhappily brutal. Perhaps it's the mom in me that balks at knowing younger readers are taking in the descriptions of horrific and unspeakable acts. Though I must praise Collins for keeping almost all of the language very generic. But for people like me, I only need a suggestion of an idea to see the full blown image. I'm sure I'm not the only one. There were certain things that took place in the story that seemed completely unnecessarily cruel. Almost as though Collins had decided she was now sick of Katniss and needed to punish her somehow. I remember at one point feeling like I needed to put the book down because there was a lot of depressive anger resonating from the pages. It was hard to read.<br /><br />So, I am entirely on the fence with this. I'm definitely looking forward to anything else Collins publishes next because I believe she is an amazing author with a brilliant mind for world building. I think I may have to put up my hand and ask her not to write anymore revolutionary tales though. *sheepish*y one.

0385737955|4.0|This book sat on my shelf for over 6 months and I could kick myself for that. I absolutely loved it. I think in the rush of all things Christmas and New Years I just put it down and got carried off onto other things before finding it on my shelf again while going through all my books for Retro Reads.<br /><br />The book has a very Lord of the Flies feel to it without veering as far to the dog eat dog (Griever eat whatever doesn't count) as LotF. It grabbed me the way The Hunger Games grabbed me when I first sat down to read it and whisked me away completely into the world of the Glade and the Maze. I, like Thomas, couldn't wait to get out there and solve that thing!<br /><br />I enjoyed the whole flow of the book and the way each chapter ended with just enough of a cliffhanger to make me want the next one bad enough to keep the lights on an hour longer. I found myself needing to put the book down in the middle of chapters just to be able to get things done. It was absorbing to say the least.<br /><br />I did feel cheated, however, when the mysteries were revealed. I felt like there wasn't a possibility to have figured them out for myself first and I always like to be able to at least try to keep up with the protagonist. I think more clues could have been inserted before Thomas came to the conclusion to keep me turning different possibilities over in my mind. It was like watching a murder mystery where you and the sleuth guess along the way, only to discover the murderer was someone neither you nor the sleuth had ever met and therefore could never have suspected. But that's pretty much my only complaint about the book.<br /><br />If you haven't read it yet, like silly me who waited so long, go. Read. Enjoy. But Mr. Dashner, please don't do to Thomas what Ms. Collins did to Katniss. Thanks!

B009IA9OLE|3.0|well it was fun but to short. it was fun but kinda dumb on what it was based. I don't think its worth $3.00. maybe 1.00 and that's a little much. it was fun but not my favorite game in the world.

B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I love Tom Hanks movies, but this is a very confusing movie. Hard to understand alot of what they said. Three hours of confusing is too much.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Her storytelling doesn't get much better than here in the midst of murder and or mayhem. A classic that deserves reading (and re-reading) just for the sheer pleasure of the setting, the words and a superb plot that really does deserve the reader's attention. What a delightful read.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Very disappointing....the way story lines were wrapped up was neither tidy nor satisfying.  When I reached the end, I was just sad and angry.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|After getting their new album, \\"Random Access Memories,\\" I found myself yearning for the Daft Punk of yore.  This is by far the best Daft Punk album produced.
B00425S1H8|2.0|I had high hopes based upon the great reviews here, but it didn't work for my application.  I was connecting this device to a Meridian Sound Processor, and the timing just wasn't right -- failed to upload / download files -- tried repeatedly, but failed every time.  Called Meridian, and they recommended Keyspan by Tripp Lite.  Cost twice this one, but it worked perfectly.  At least my problem was solve, but likely this product will work for your application -- as the reviews are so good -- my application must have been a one off.

Heck, that's just in the first thirty pages.<br />This Grisham novel rekindles (no pun intended) fond memories of his early works (for this reader, anyway).<br />Distinctive yet all-too-realistic characters have always distinguished the author and he hasn't lost his stroke.<br />Fun for all ages!

It takes a few listens to really get the feeling and to feel the sound.<br />The return of the horns was always a nice Stooge thing and Iggy sounds great and the writing.is right on.<br />Iggy's comment on world and the people in it is always a treat.<br />Get it and love it.

Mike gives you all the know how to get into great shape, all you need to add is the desire and some discipline. I cant wait to see how my body changes over the next year. Whether you're just starting out in the fitness world, or stuck in a rut like i was, this is a must read. You wont regret it. Thanks Mike

And I wanted to watch it on my iPad using Flixster and UltraViolet.<br />I had downloaded the Ultraviolet copy for this movie on Flixster.<br />But I could not watch the Ultraviolet copy of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey; on my wi-fi iPad.<br /><br />This is a problem I have had several times with Flixster/Ultraviolet. And I have contacted Flixster customer support twice about this problem that I can't play a movie offliine.<br />I have had to delete my movies, delete Flixster, download the program again and then download my movies again.<br /><br />* This UltraViolet/Fixster is just poorly designed software.<br />There should have been an iTunes Digital Copy option with this movie.<br /><br />Edit; The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey still does not play on my iPad even after I deleted Flixster. The error message is \\"asset is not licensed\\". I have sent another e-mail to Flixster support. Anyway, just an FYI about how poor the Ultraviolet/Flixster digital copy is.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I got this to convert my 35mm slides to digital format.  It is easy to use and produces images of reasonable quality if you are looking for snapshot type images.  If you are looking to make professional-style, high resolution, large format images, you will probably be disappointed by this unit.  When coupled with an SD card, it is amazingly fast to convert a great number of slides.  While you can make some adjustments (exposure, brightness) using the small LCD screen, I found it more useful to make most adjustments using image editing software after transferring the files to my PC.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Happy with this purchase.  Works well.  Just don't forget to turn it off when you are done.  I bought a bunch of batteries because I'm used to phantom power and always forget it uses a battery.
0525948023|5.0|I began a very stressful job and thankfully was reading &#34;A New Earth&#34; at this point in my life. I went from shaking on the way to work to enjoying my drive in, and then doing my job joyfully without the stress attached. But more important, my entire outlook on my life changed. I wish I'd read this book when it first came out. Not only insightful, but also with practical ways to accomplish, at least for a few moments, becoming conscious and aware. Incredible, incredible book.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I've used the Kindle app on Android for 2-3 years now -- every day.  Great way to read and buy books.  A couple small suggestions:  It would be good to have the option to view my highlights separately from view my bookmarks.  I have 100s of highlights and only 1 or two book marks.  Also, the 'send feedback' option crashes the app every time I try to use it.  Other than that, it's a great app.
B000FA675C|5.0|What can I say, I'm a late starter.  Sure, this book's been around for ages, and they've even made an okay movie out of it, but it wasn't until recently that I got a chance to actually read it.  I remember there being a lot of controversy over this book, but really it's a work of fiction meant to entertain.  And entertain it does... A good read that I couldn't put down.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Reading Tangled was an absolute BLAST! I have never read something so uniquely written before. How the heck Author Emma Chase got into the head of every man on the planet to be able to write as \\"Drew Evans\\" will remain a mystery. I enjoyed every single tidbit of feeling like I was getting the `inside scoop' on what these sexy-a$$ men think like!<br /><br />This book is written from Drew's POV. A book written from the male character is always a nice little treat BUT this is even better. Why, you ask? He is actually speaking TO the reader. It's like you get the chance to sit down with this sexy fine man and have him tell you his story of how he did the unthinkable - fall in love & suffer a broken heart. Oh, I mean \\"get the flu\\". =)<br /><br />I found myself smiling the ENTIRE time I read this book. I laughed out loud more times than I can remember. Think along the lines of \\"Wallbanger\\" and \\"Seduction & Snacks\\" type vibe. It's funny - yet so very true!<br /><br />Best part? A HEA and NO cliffhanger! Things are left open for a second book (PLEASE give me a second book!) but we aren't left with a panicked \\"WTF face\\" after a huge cliffhanger. Lets be real, there's been way too many of those lately. We actually got a full story - beginning middle and end - without having to wait 8 months for the next `chapter'. Awesome book, great characters, suburb writing...Author Emma Chase has a new fan!

B00CJ32S74|5.0|I bought the Deluxe edition of this CD and ll of the music is fantastic, good for partying, relaxing and just plain listening, i highly suggest this CD it is great and never gets old, loaded with bass too!
B0090XO57C|5.0|This is truly a beautiful program that is packaged nicely. Great to watch with the family. Most scenes are spectacular, breathtaking, and often make you wonder how the cinematographers got the shot.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game and am sad to see I have to wait for more! Hope it is back soon!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My husband and I enjoy playing this game and challenging each other to better the other's score.  It is back -n-forth until the new week begins.
B0041D843M|5.0|I'd give it more stars, but there aren't any. Tired of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer.....???? Then reverse it! This book empowers you & has the answer! Outlines the research that Dr. Campbell did with cancer. What are you waiting for?
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Loved this one- if you like different perspectives from interesting characters  mixed with a look at history this is for you.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|It's not as great as people say I doesn't respond well to the touch and not addictive so not worth your money:-)
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I wouldn't sit down and watch this movie without having something else to do otherwise. It was a fun comedy when roaming around the house.
B003SHDP4K|5.0|I couldn't put it down but I had to because I had to sleep! Thanks to Dan Brown's story telling mastery in this book, I became an avid reader now. I've read all the Robert Langdon series, and I must say &#34;Angel and Demons&#34; and &#34;The Da Vinci Code&#34; are well done, while &#34;The Lost Symbol&#34; is rather half done and &#34;Inferno&#34; is overcooked that it doesn't taste delicious anymore. Still, each of them has their own surprises.
B000SCHC0Q|3.0|I enjoyed the Kite Runner but A Thousand Splendid Suns seems to be much heavier.....but probably based on fact.  Worth reading
B005LAIIJY|4.0|Django Unchained was a good movie to me.  A lot of people said they did not recommend it because of the use of the &#34;N&#34; word.  However, back in the time that was depicted - it was a natural use of the world and it wasn't used as offensively in the movie as it is used in our language today.  I liked the humor in the movie and the love story behind it.  It was enjoyable.
1476734941|4.0|Saw this on tv and wanted to read the book and try the diet.  I like the book okay, but was a little disappointed in<br />the diet.  There are no options for vegans or vegetarians so I was surprised!  So many people, doctors and nutritionists<br />are advocating a plant based diet these days, but this diet does not.  Maybe they will add it in the future, but I would<br />not recommend it to vegans or vegetarians or anyone who wants a truly healthy diet.<br /><br />That said, it is still a very interesting new way of looking at eating and I hope that in the future they have a book about<br />this for vegans and vegetarians.
B006AN78XS|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but it was so boring! The scenes were WAY too long, and the dialogue was so forced. The ending was, of course, expected. It's a story that has been done far too many times. Cliched.<br /><br />Disappointed in this movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Excellent application to install.Outstanding interface and accurate weather.Not only that it also lists wind speed etc. Install and know for yourself the rest.One word to say 'Stupendous!'
B0018O4YT0|4.0|Anyone steeped in the dark Mysteries of the 40's, American experimentalism and German Expressionism will feel right at home in this well-done derivative of these fantasy's in Black created in the Shadows of The Great War and World War II. I don't mean by using the word \\"derivative\\" to denigrate the quality or originality of the film, all art rests on the shoulders of important predecessors. With so many reviews already at hand, there seems no need to repeat an outline of the plot nor add to appreciation of the scenic design: both contribute amply to the sense of fluidity and uncertainty which are so necessary to this kind of production. One can be over-sensitive to particular breaks in the internal logic of action but that would be nit-picking: the overall impression for one ready to accept the premises for the unreal reality is quite involving. On the other hand, it is understandable that realists or others who need to have a handle on what is happening throughout a film will fail to respond and dislike phantasmagoric qualities. Those who know that they are impatient with \\"arty\\" films would be well advised to give this one a  pass. Oh, yes, it is always quite difficult to create a suitable ending for such a film. While not entirely satisfactory in this case, it will do, I think, for the average  viewer.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I read &#34;A Walk in the Woods&#34; this year where Bill Bryson hiked part of the Appalachian Trail . I liked his adventure more than Cheryl Strayed who seemed ill prepared and self serving. I felt like saying &#34;get over it!&#34;<br />On the other hand, she showed perseverence and was sometimes quite humorous.<br />It was worth the read!<br /><br />RT
B00BHWG5C2|5.0|This expanded edition should have been made available a long time ago !  There is a &#34;wealth of bonus material&#34; that is phenomenal: B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner. Each of these artists have their own CD in this collection. This product is a MUST-HAVE for any Rolling Stone fan. This is the ULTIMATE version of this concert. I STRONGLY urge anyone that is thinking of buying this set to do so !!!!  (I do not work for Amazon.com or any other music or video company).
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|A little slow. a lot of time spent developing characters.<br />I was definitely spoiled with the first two.<br />excellent trilogy, though.<br />Too bad its over.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Had a few twists and turns that I did not expect.  However, I am always a fan.  Loved the book.  Looking forward to what happens to Sookie in the next one.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great book.<br />could not put it down.<br />as soon as i finished it, i bought the second.<br />READ THIS BOOK!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Not what I expected but impossible to stop reading. Very much looking forward to the next in the series. Not just for young adults!
B007FH9GA6|3.0|i was pretty disappointed.<br />an excessive amount of editing, but who am i to judge.<br />i always create a superior image in my mind than someone else does on screen...<br />this adaptation is a perfect example.<br />i need to see the foreign versions.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher character.  I can't get enough of his most exciting life.  It's always an adventure from start to finish when you're reading a Lee Child novel
B001NLKT60|4.0|i wasn't disappointed.<br />this book was another quick read.<br />nearly impossible to top the first...<br />but came close.<br />if you enjoyed the first, you'll enjoy this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator use it all the time, great app for monthly budgeting. Would purchase again love the style and button design.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The CD arrived timely and in good condition. This is my favorite CD.  It is so full of passion and emotion, and I can listen to it for hours on end! Bocelli's music relaxes me, and calms me when I feel stress.
0465068367|5.0|Less than one month after Japan signs a military pact with Germany, December 13, 1937, the Imperial Forces of Japan defeat the forces of Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese capital of Nanking and overrun the city. Approximately twelve weeks later anywhere from 100,000 - 300,000 Chinese, including non-military women, children, and older adults are dead, most of them rotting in the streets and fields, or mass \\"grave sites\\" inside and outside of the city. Surprisingly the deaths are not what stands out, but the fact that the Japanese soldiers also brutally raped tens of thousands of women as well. \\"Brutal\\" seems a tame word actually for the almost indescribable ruthless, cruel, and unrelenting abuse and murder of women--some as young as 10 years old, or as old as 80--who were either raped and killed, even if pregnant, or forced into prostitution. (The latter were called \\"comfort women\\" and deemed necessary for the health and moral of the Japanese troops.)<br /><br />Iris Chang's classic work The Rape of Nanking meticulously documents the horrors of those weeks through diaries, (including the diary of German businessman and Nazi Party member, John Rabe, who took many risks to save Chinese people) news reports, official correspondences, and the testimonies of witnesses, victims, and even some of the perpetrators. Reading the descriptions of the many different ways the Japanese soldiers found to rape and kill is not within the capacity of most sane people to even imagine. Since I am certain that those descriptions have been repeated by many others, I will not repeat them here. My interest in this book is the fact that, unlike Germany, Japan has a long history, including recently, of denying any wrong doing during WWII, especially as it pertains to the actions of the Japanese military in Nanking, and the knowledge of any atrocities by the Imperial family.<br /><br />My interest was sparked by a recent article that I read about the revisionist history being taught even today to Japanese children, and a recent realization that my fascination with WWII has been very limited to the war in Europe only. I first came across Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption (Olympian Louis Zamperini's story of being a POW of Japan), which then led me to William Manchester's Goodbye, Darkness: A Memoir of the Pacific War. As a baby boomer, whose memories of WWII were experienced through films of the liberation of concentration camps in Europe, and pictures of the total destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nothing in my wildest imagination prepared me for the equally nauseating descriptions of brutality towards POWs, and pictures of the bodies of tens of thousands of Chinese--mostly civilians--dumped in ditches, on streets, in fields, or mass graves in Nanking. William Manchester opines that this is a lack of interest, and is due to our total lack of knowledge of the area and cultures involved. He could very well be correct about that, at least as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Just as I do not blame Germans with knowledge of the concentration camps in Europe, I do not blame Japanese having the knowledge of Nanking. (As I would hope that African Americans do not blame me for the sins of my ancestors.) In the \\"Epilogue,\\" Ms. Chang describes the term \\"democide,\\" coined by researcher and expert, R. J. Rummel, as both \\"...genocide and government mass murder...\\" that comes about from \\"absolute unchecked power\\" in government. Hopefully, to those who read this book, this will be a warning and lesson to stay vigilant and involved, rather than complacent and lazy when it comes to our elected (or otherwise) officials.<br /><br />If you missed reading this book in 1997 and want more information about what Ms. Chang calls \\"the forgotten holocaust of World War II,\\" include this book in your quest. However, read with the caution that the raw descriptions and the pictures could very well be disturbing. (Don't know if it makes a difference, but I read the hardcopy, 1997 version.)t makes a difference, but I read the hardcopy, 1997 version.)
B004J4WL50|5.0|I loved the book, very motivational.  Blake talks about wanting to share what he's learned through starting TOMS.  I think he should make the book lendable.  If I had a physical copy, I could lend it.  Why not the Kindle version?  This makes me sad.  :(
0824835921|5.0|I've bought a lot of books on trying to remember Kanji. This one seems to be the best one that I've used. Though I haven't been far into the book, I'm already able to recall most of the Kanji presented (according to the associated web site, I'm at about 90% retention at the moment). If you're looking to remember Kanji, then I would recommend trying this book.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|I was originally referred to this author by someone I met while vacationing in Hawaii.  I started with &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; and liked it so much that I have read two more from this author.  Each story had some tie in with the previous one that I really felt that I knew the characters as friends.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I was reminded of the quality of the stories once i got to see them all in a row at one time.  Even the effects were better than I remembered, given that it was a TV show with obvious budgets.  Very well done, great show!
B004VB3V0K|5.0|Never had so much fun reading a book on Haskell.<br />This book is probably the best introductory book on Haskell. 5 stars!
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I like Foxx when he is acting and I love Westerns overall.  The style is classic QT, and the blood and violence are overboard.  But the story and the acting are very good, Seeing Don Johnson with a wig on a horse was classic, and the KKK scene was funny and and just so great, they got what they deserved.  Well done but over done on blood.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game kind of like temple run but better I highly recommend it! The best part is that it doesn't matter if you are 4 or 40  you will still love it!
B004WY2M8I|3.0|Just briefly:<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the \\"Legend of the Twins\\" chapters, as well as those featuring Lestat without Akasha.  These chapters were full of good vampire fun.  However, the ones featuring Akasha in the modern world dragged horribly.  I got very tired of reading about her master plan and her philosophy.<br /><br />And not to be one of THOSE people but... I was hoping for more sexiness to the whole thing, since there's a lot of Lester/Akasha interaction.  Boy was I disappointed.  Three stars for the fun vampy parts.
B0094M2ITG|5.0|This is one of my favorite stories. While it's all fantastical, there is such a beautiful lesson to be learned.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|The title says it all and it is accurate.  I bought this book a year ago and it changed my approach to lifting weights and going to the gym.  The muscle you gain by his methods are much more practical for whatever lifestyle you have. If you are a dedicated to fitness this book is a must read. There are concepts in this book that you can't find anywhere else at least not all put together in such a small package. The book is deep but not overloaded with information. Also if you thing body weight exercises are joke I dare you to try and do some of his advanced exercises.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|My daughter recommended this fascinating story and I will tell others, also.  I have roots in England and it made the story even better! Loved the way it went back and forth over the three time periods.<br />Jsmoss
1926778103|5.0|(this review should realistically be 4.5 stars, but i'm lacking that option here)<br /><br />let me say this: i love this book. i've had an interest in the darksiders series since i heard about it back in 08, and though i haven't had the time to buy and play the games, i've had an awesome time looking at the art.<br /><br />Mr. Madureira's art is spectacular and every piece has a satisfying feel to it, bolstering the \\"chunky\\" feel i love to have in art. literally every single picture you see in this could be used on a Heavy metal album cover, which is a damn good source of inspiration for fellow artists like myself. the only downside i see is that the binding is a bit sub-par (as many have mentioned in their reviews). while this is a problem, it's not that big of one. other Udon art books i own (such as the Okami official complete works, also a good purchase) also have this flaw. but considering the quality and sheer quantity of work put into the book, it's not really a big deal. just be careful with it and enjoy.<br /><br />all in all, i'm quite satisfied with my purchase and i look forward to getting the Art of Darksiders II in the near future.
055358894X|5.0|I actually gave up the first time I started reading this book. I was immediately put off by the foul-mouthed priest buying up orphan children in the opening section of the book. I guess I just wasn't in the right mood. But recently, I gave this book another chance and ended up loving it, finishing it in less than two weeks time. Overall, I have to say that the sheer fun and entertainment value of the story is what garnered it 5 Stars. Or maybe I was just in the right mood!<br /><br />First of all, you should know that there is some foul language throughout the book (probably unnecessary), but it really isn't all that bad over the length of the novel. Now I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under the age of 15-16 due to the language and that's too bad, because without this element, the book would be a classic for all general audiences.<br /><br />Now on to what's so good about this book! First of all, the story is a refreshing reinvention of the city/thief adventure. It's lightharded and fun, but there exists a seriousness to the storytelling, based primarily upon the fact that everything is truly thought out and executed so well. There are elements that are introduced early (and in flashback sections), only to turn up later in unpredictable ways. The structure of the story does contain several interludes (flashbacks mostly) that do not detract at all from the pace of the novel, in fact as mentioned above, they deftly serve to assist with the advancement of the backstory and characterization. Speaking of characters, the author has created a band of likeable thieves, whose motives and actions are fairly genuine. Only at the end did the main villain slightly change character in my opinion. And then there is the setting of the city of Camorr! The city has a unique feel to it and throughout the novel, there is a sense of greater mysteries to be uncovered, ones that are not completely answered in this story.<br /><br />Overall, I was much impressed by the \\"Lies of Locke Lamora\\", a fresh, exciting and well structured story and one of the most entertaining I've read in a while.ies of Locke Lamora\\", a fresh, exciting and well structured story and one of the most entertaining I've read in a while.
0345803485|5.0|Story revolves around the chemistry and relationship that develops between two unsuspecting characters, Christian and Anastasia. He's rich, affluent, gorgeous, stubborn and controlling with a dark past, while she is young, beautiful, and stubborn as well as quite inexperienced. What makes this story a bit unique is the BDSM influence fused into the majority of the story. --- The sexual escapades are not for the virtuous at heart... explicit yet curiously tantalizing. Honestly the first 9-10 chapters of the book are an exceptionally fun read... delicious, funny, erotic, tantalizing, curious, surprising,... so many more adjectives suitable!<br /><br />Though I always love an exceptional plot that incorporates a good romance, this was the first that was really all about the path of the dysfunctional main characters who crave love. This is no literary piece that's for sure... but there is plenty of that out there. A few maligned characters are introduced in the story that Christian and Ana endeavor to manage without losing relationship ground and add overall interest and flavor. However, the story comes down to... how individuals can/do positively cope with their emotional scars against society's moral compass.<br /><br />Battoe's audio narration is wonderful. Having finished the series, I find myself going back to certain parts of the story that read just as exciting as the first time. Great story. Who knows, it may end up stimulating your personal sex life!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Absolutely great calculator app! I was concerned with it being free that it would be awful. I am happy to report it's exactly what I needed.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The rescue of 6 Americans hiding at the Canadian ambassador's house in Iran was faithfully depicted in this movie.<br /><br />A lot of the scenes put you in the shoes of the protagonist and make you feel the drama deep inside your soul.<br /><br />It is also a great story about American ingenuity and the lengths to which we are capable of going for the good of others.
B000268D1K|5.0|This is the best of their work, IMHO, and it is a must have for any serious rock music collector of any age.<br />There are 21 truly HIT tunes, which is not always the case with all<br />best of  Cd's.  From &#34;Satisfaction,&#34; to  'Sympathy for the Devil,&#34; to  &#34;Jumpin Jack Flash,&#34; and &#34;Let's Spend the Night Together&#34; this CD makes you want to get up and MOVE<br />For this Baby Boomer,  it is my fave CD to clean the house by!!  And lasts long enough to actually do it!
B003L77FYS|4.0|It should be a 5*, but some episodes were too visually gory. I like the interplay between the characters, and the romantic tension in the midst of the platonic relationship between the two protagonists. That has changed in Season 3 - for the worse.<br />It could be improved if Castle were not a stereotypical adolescent when it comes to relationships to attractive females - out only for the fleeting act he can entice, rather than the meaningfulness of shared values and interests that the mature man holds out for. It could also be improved with less weirdness in the cases that was exacerbated in this third season. There is enough in the normal realm of violence of humans, without concocting the unreal with which no normal person can identify.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is what a hidden object game should look and feel like.  The developers hit all the necessary requirements.  You will not regret buying this game!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I would love to read more on Cheryl's adventures that summer!  I could not put the book down.  Loved it!
193700788X|1.0|I have always loved Charlaine Harris writing, however this last Sookie book was disappointing and sadly a waste of money.  I had read the reviews and bought anyway because of course I had to see what everyone was talking about.  I felt the story was rushed, sloppy and inconsistent with the other books.  Several other reviewers went in depth in describing reasons and I agree.  I feel as if this story almost got confused with the tv series which I would say is disappointingly LOOSELY based on these books.
B005F2BBLK|1.0|I was surprised at how poorly written this movie was. These animated films have been on a roll for the last decade or so but this one dramatically fell short.<br /><br />It tried hard to be funny, but my wife and I agreed that it was't. The characters weren't likable, and the story was unoriginal. Honestly, it just kinda hurt to watch.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|Recommended.  Redford and Dunaway are fab! If you lived during the 70's (or didn't), you have to see it.  Life was simple
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game. So much content and the animals are super cute and look really ice age. Can't stop playing this game too much fun.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The movie is ntertaining but not true to storyline and would be confusing to movie goers who haven't read the book(s).
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This obviously isn't going to be the best sharpener you can buy, but it's value far exceeds its price. Great buy, I am very satisfied
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|The killer is after revenge, deciding to punish people who had wasted his time.  The bizarre first murder is just a prelude, and Detective Max Larson and his new partner Jesse Fairlane have very few clues to go on. The two cops initially have some friction, but as the tale goes on they adapt to each other and the strange circumstances. The two have to use any shred of evidence to get inside the killer's head and find out why he's killing, and who else might be on his list.<br /><br />I found the writing to lack a certain \\"oomf\\" that would makes things have more impact. Dialog and descriptions are straightforward and dry, with characters speaking just a tad more formally than is normal. The premise was really interesting, and the action kicks off from chapter one. Unfortunately, I feel like the conclusion came too quickly, not leaving enough time to savor the unveiling of the killer. Overall this was a decent thriller, some changes to the style would have made it even better, but I liked the plot well enough to see it through to the end.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I LOVED IT! I have always loved dragons, and this game is all about them! I like checking my dragons every day and decorating my park. Buy this game! It's so awesome! Backflip Studios deserves a huge thanks for releasing this game!
B00BUT5I84|5.0|Jared Leto continues his turn as Renaissance Man.  He's moving even beyond actor, songwriter, singer, showman, and musician to push the bar ever higher--now also producing, directing, mixing, design.  An amazing artistic talent.  Shannon Leto's innovative and clever rhythm foundation is the glue that anchors the record.  The music is catchy, lush, and very listenable.  I would be very hesitant to suggest that the younger Leto is giving away any personal insights, but he sure knows how to put together a soaring set of songs.  I don't have the discernment to critique this album and analyze it tune by tune, but it IS one of the best records I've heard in the last couple of years.  It's getting heavy rotation in my shuffle-play, and I'm glad I bought it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game marks the beginning of my love for minecraft! When I first played this  game, I had no idea what to do, now I'm a huge minecraft fan and have the pocket edition, Xbox edition, and pc/Mac edition.This game is very addicting and fun, and I'm sure you will love minecraft after you play this!
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This will be on repeat for at least the entire summer in my house, if not longer. Great album from beginning to end.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I had played this game on my friend's tablet and I couldn't resist but to get it myself. This is very fun and entertaining.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This season seemed to be very centered on family  I enjoyed this season as much or more than the previous. I love the way the characters all get along so well. Very good show
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing! From cover to cover I simply was submerged in what seemed a surreal world. Though the ending didn't really content me I seem to have gotten the meaning of what Suzanne was trying to portray- the cruel reality of humanity in wars and things of the same nature. Of how fragile life is and some just take it for granted. Life is truly a gift that shouldn't be wasted. Overall, a splendid book to read.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I saw Boz Scaggs in Austin Texas and was so impressed by the concert, I had to order the CD- love it

B000JIHP88|1.0|Like other reviewers mentioned, I had to return this item. The leaves on the mobile was getting stuck and the motor was making clicking noises right out of the box. Also, I found the music box quite bulky & bottom heavy; made the attachment to the crib not so ideal. Thank goodness for Amazon free returns :)
1401322786|5.0|Such an inspiring book with a simple theme - exploration of time. Makes you view the world differently. Very touching. I read it in one day. Worth my time!!!
B00BG4UWPC|5.0|More esoteric than their last couple efforts, but quite magical if a bit bitter at times. Go see them live.
B006L3RZ26|5.0|I came upon Xuefei quite by accident and grateful I did.<br /><br />This CD is a good selection of Bach pieces, and wonderfully performed by all the artists.  The quality of the recording is so present, you feel you are five feet away from them.  Xuefei's delicate but precise technique is impeccable; yet the gentleness of how her notes touch you, evokes a deeper, more emotional response.  Bach must be pleased.<br /><br />I now have &#34;40 Degrees North&#34; and it too is as masterful, elegant and moving.  Xuefei now sits among my other favorites, Vieux, de Lucia, jazz greats, Ford...  As a woman among all these men, she brings out the feminine, the soul, she has attained her own unique voice on this instrument.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Loaded free version, loved it, went back for full version. Could not stop playing until I finished it.  Can't wait for more  games like this.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|i found it very long winded and predictable.not up to the authors usual standard would not buy another john corey novel
B00865P3AS|4.0|I first heard one of their songs on the radio and it was a mello one, so I bought the album. I took it to school to play for the children during quiet time and am glad I listened before the kids arrived. It's not classical cello but has a great rock sound. I enjoy when classical instruments are played in non-traditional manners so I still enjoy it but others might not as much.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|I'm not picky when it comes to music. If I like it, I'm going to listen to that song until I run it into the ground.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|If you like Band of Brothers you will enjoy this as well. I recommend buying this, it is worth your money.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a good book. I had a acquaintance tell me to call her when I finished it. I did and she was dying to know if I thought there would be a sequel. I would have to say that I would definitely read a sequel.

B009NG1Q96|4.0|The Elite by: Kiera Cass is the hotly anticipated sequel to The Selection. This series is a mixture of The Hunger Games sans the bloodsport and The Bachelor with the bloodsport! (Well, more like cat fights)<br /><br />Thirty five girls came to the palace for The Selection. A competition where randomly selected girls from the country compete for the affections of one man - Prince Maxon. The field has been narrowed to only six - the Elite. The rest have been sent home, but their status and lives have been elevated for having been dumped by the prince.<br /><br />The competition to win Prince Maxon's heart is fiercer than ever. Only one will win, marry Prince Maxon, and become Princess of Illea.<br /><br />America still isn't sure where her heart lies. With Aspen, her first and forbidden love or the Prince where she's finding herself in a fresh new love. When she's with Prince Maxon, it's like a fairy tale filled with romance and new adventure. Now that Aspen's a guard in the palace, she can imagine the life they had planned to share all those years ago.<br /><br />America needs more time to sort out...everything. But while she's torn, the other girls know exactly what they want - the tiara. And if she waits too long, the decision may be taken out of her hands.<br /><br />This book is filled with action and just the right amount of romance. All the characters are well rounded and well written. The book is so good that I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />America thinks she knows what she wants, then something devastating happens to her and one her fellow Elites that make her question everything she feels in right and moral. And in turn she seriously question Prince Maxon's principles and her place at his side. Without a second thought, she knows it's time for her to leave the competition.<br /><br />One glitch happened on her path to leaving the palace...Prince Maxon refuses to let her leave. He endures much to keep her, to the disappointment of his mother and even a confrontation with his father - the king.  It doesn't stop America's quest to leave, setting out on a path of self destruction. She's determined to get herself kicked out and sent home.<br /><br />While the inner turmoils of the palace continue, the Northern and Southern rebels attacks amp up even more. And it seems they want to end the Selection as well as end the Monarchy in Illea.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this book. Can't wait for Book 3 - The One.frontation with his father - the king.  It doesn't stop America's quest to leave, setting out on a path of self destruction.

B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed reading the Sookie Stackhouse series and this book was very enjoyable. It turns out like I thought it would, but I was disappointed with the ending bc this book doesn't tie up the series there's actually another book out this fall that does, which I have already pre-ordered.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|eveyone was psyched about this book so i decided to see what the fuss was all about. Such a let down! It sounds as if i wrote this novel, the way how things are done between this Ana and Grey sounds so childish. I have read better erotic books... books that doesnt describe how the man looks when he breathes or walks and acts so stupid and dotes after this wierdo. I am sure the writer intention wasnt for us to critisize Ana but to pay attention to the sexual events.... dont you think? Obviously she or he or whoever sucked there
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this was one of the best books i have ever read, it was action packed. i was sad that my favorites died and Katniss' family is gone but i thoughtvit was a really great book!!!!! :):):)
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the ending. The acting was very good and the storyline was different and refreshing. It was well worth watching.
B0094OLFUW|3.0|I adored their first album but there is something missing from this one. It's heavy on the things I didn't like from the first album (breathy singing, crooning) but no depth to the songs. I purchased the album in anticipation of one of their upcoming concerts and due to the disappointment decided to skip the show. Maybe it will grow on me after a few more listens but I actually don't even want to give it another try. Meh.
B009178OQA|5.0|This is an amazing movie. It's not so much about sushi as about dedication to one's craft and a father's love, and sometimes complicated relationships, with his sons.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Not for all but if you like dark films with a bit of romance and some gore mixed in, this is for you. Love it. Great music, too.
B00AIA89HS|4.0|Coming off of their eponymous effort (and, subsequently, the same year's covers album, \\"For The Lions\\") in 2009, Hatebreed rebounded with another new studio album, their seventh with 2013's \\"The Divinity Of Purpose.\\" Unlike its predecessor, this record has no experimental leanings - it does away with all Killswitch Engage-lite acoustic interludes, and also never ventures into the realm of Kingdom Of Sorrow-inspired sludge/doom metal. In fact, the only thing that is at all new about this record is the fact that Hatebreed did not undergo any lineup changes between it and the time of their last release, a rare occurrence for Jamey Jasta and Co.. \\"Divinity\\" returns the group to their thrash/groove-metal-inflected hardcore roots. So, yeah, reading in between the lines, here, It is, basically, all bludgeoning riffs (which play like full-on thrash most of the time), crushing rhythms, viscerally bellowed vocals, and brutal breakdowns. And the end result of all of this mayhem is easily the band's most vicious and inexorable effort since 2002's \\"Perseverance.\\"<br /><br />And while some of the riffs and song structures might come across as a bit stale-sounding, \\"D.O.P.\\" is also a record that is armed with some of the band's all-time finest and most memorable choruses. \\"Put It To The Torch\\" is an opening bruiser, and a thunderous introductory mosh pit anthem. \\"Honor Never Dies,\\" then, which marries catchy, staccato beats with industrial-strength guitar chugging and noteworthy lyrics (Jasta is heard repeatedly bellowing lines like \\"sometimes standing for what you believe/means standing alone\\"), is another standout. Later highlights like \\"The Language\\" are backed by blazing, Slayer-esque buzzsaw riffing, and catchy, call-and-response vocal patterns. And it is further highlighted by grumbling bass lines and even a guitar solo (yes, it is one that is on the mini-side, but still.) And \\"Before The Fight Ends You\\" is another insanely catchy and addictive number with a hooky main guitar riff that sounds not unlike the one from Pantera's \\"Walk.\\" It also has more really memorable vocals, and Biohazard-influenced choruses, too.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Indivisible\\" begins with a propulsive, grumbling bass intro before locking into a thrashing groove tattooed by memorable, chanting vocals, and a catchy, punching guitar lick. Needless to say, it all makes for one mightily catchy and infectious mosher of a song. The title cut also features more noteworthy bass work, as its groovy bass lines are what fuel the track. And so does \\"Nothing Scars Me,\\" because it is highlighted by a decent little bass solo. But said song is mostly a standout on account of it featuring guitar and bass riffs that evoke some Machine Head stuff, deeply grooving, mosh-pit-ready rhythms, and catchy, call-and-response-style vocals that would not sound out of place on Fear Factory's \\"Archetype.\\" And \\"Bitter Truth\\" is another thunderously pounding, breakdown-centric ode to the mosh pit.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell: There is practically no innovation or musical growth present in \\"The Divinity Of Purpose.\\" But even so, it is a thoroughly enjoyable album, and one that is filled with riffs and songs that will gladly conjure up the primal urge in you that wants to smash the crap out of all of the crap that currently surrounds you.r riff that sounds not unlike the one from Pantera's \\"Walk.\\" It also has more really memorable vocals, and Biohazard-influenced choruses, too.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Indivisible\\" begins with a propulsive, grumbling bass intro before locking into a thrashing groove tattooed by memorable, chanting vocals, and a catchy, punching guitar lick.

B008CPZNL6|4.0|I love Flipboard - it is a great way to see news, recipes, articles on what interests me.  Very easy to use and to add new sites.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It has intrigue and charm, excellent character interaction with chemistry; Also extremely good writing; we found out about it towards the end of season 1 and caught up by buying several episodes per evening to finally see all episodes; hope many more seasons are ahead!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|the room was worth the price. I am always looking for puzzle games, and this one is a refreshing change from the usual point and click. I am looking forward to more fireproof games.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Amazing book!  I couldn't put it down.  It speaks so well to current times and what adolescents are going through in public schools.  As a mother, it was really good in helping me understand how teenagers think and feel at this crucial development point in their lives.
0470876417|4.0|There are many of books on strategy or business planning, but little are so to the point and simple as the canvas in Business Model Generation. It's a methodology instead of a philosophy and does not make the mistake of trying to tell you how to turn the canvas into a plan. You are still the one that writes the plan, this methodology just helps you define the building blocks of that plan.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app is crape it wont download anything and it locks up my kindle fire when the screen goes black I wouldn't get this again if I needed it to save the world this sucks so much
B009NY43NY|1.0|Can not believe that the series ended this way. Horrible writing. Horrible editing. What a waste of time! Completely disjointed from the rest of the series.
1575666286|5.0|I am interested in alternative medicine and Dr. Gerson's name was cited in several books that I read. I decided to go to the source and was not disappointed. This book answers many questions about the nature of cancer and how your food can be your best medicine.
0811875040|4.0|I have read the Miette book from one cover to the other.  I always tweak a recipe; it's just in my nature and knowledge to do so.  One recipe (though not worthy of purchasing the whole book) is their Chocolate ganache recipe. I watch videos on making ganache and get angry when they say heat cream and pour over chopped chocolate.  This may be easy, but it is not a ganache worthy of a baker who wants the real deal.  as far as I am concerned, their recipe for true ganache is perfect.  So I am happy and delighted for this one recipe ... (not a reason to splurge on an entire cookbook, though.)  The beautiful cake on the front gets to us and we fall in love with the scalloped pages ... it is a coffee table book ... so, for that reason, I'll give it 4 stars.  There has to be another gem inside that I can use ,,, :)
B009NY43NY|5.0|Yay for the book/story. I'm happy with how it and with whom. Boo that this was the end of the series
B005544TRQ|4.0|I recommend it and will watch season 2 if it is for free. $ 1.99 is more than what I pay for a movie at Redbox. Not worth all that money
B009NY43NY|4.0|Enjoyed the book!  Enjoyed the whole series, I guess I'm pleased the book and the HBO series were so different!
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Works good. Has a few issues with network failures but not too bad. Download is also pretty fast makes it nice to save the funny ones for later
B009TSA7MA|5.0|I have been collecting Michael Schenker concerts for many years now and each of them is excellent in its own way, taking into account that different musicians and singers are featured. The constant among all of the concerts is Michael Schenker's tremendous guitar prowess and dedication to his craft. Temple of Rock is fantastic and I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version for that clear, crisp, audio and video that the DVD just can't quite provide. The band is excellent and this show is a perfect addition to any Michael Schenker fan's collection.
B004SF30HI|5.0|We love this movie and the music.  Our three year old dances to it non-stop - and so do my husband and I!  Fun for all ages...!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I prefer the original black and white version of this film but the colored version makes for a nice change on occasion. This particular package has both versions, as well as a number of extra features that the Blu-Ray doesn't offer, which is why I purchased this package. This film is on the same level as It's A Wonderful Life in that no matter how many times you've seen it, you look forward to seeing it again because it is a classic. I highly recommend Miracle on 34th Street regardless of what version you prefer.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I had not heard of this movie and decided to take a chance.  I was better than I anticipated.  This movie kept me watching throughout the entire movie and kept me guessing.  Somewhat of a typical plot and outcome but entertaining just the same.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I'm amazed they can still continue to create new plot lines and story innovation, but they do:) And as always we still get to have the warm company of Dean and Sam.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Predictable ending. Well written.  It seems like Harris was ready to get this series over with quickly.  I still enjoyed the series overall.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Definitely worth buying the digital episodes! Love the walking dead and how it keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more... Keep Calm and Don't Git Bit! 💀
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|I love Vin Diesel! If you loved Riddick you must see how it all began! Must see for anyone 17 years and above.
B005544TRQ|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT SERIES THAT I JUST CANNOT STOP WATCHING! I ALMOST FEEL SMARTER WATCHING IT. IT IS FAST PACED AND HAS SOME TWIST AND TURNS TO MAKE IT INTERESTING.  A LITTLE LIKE THE WHITE COLLAR SERIES WHICH I HD A LOT OF FUN WATCHING UNTIL I RAN OUT OF EPISODES.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I've only read one other Sophie Kinsella novel (well I actually listened), which was &#34;I've Got You're Number&#34; and I loved it. Only Sophie Kinsella can work slapstick comedy meets 90s sitcom into a modern day story and make me smile instead of roll my eyes at the absurdity of it all. So when I heard she had a novel set in Greece being released 6 weeks before my summer vacation there, I was more than thrilled! In fact, other than what I gathered from looking at the cover, I didn't know a thing about the novel going into it. Well about 30% through the book I became a bit disappointed with &#34;Wedding Night&#34;. It was turning into the bad version of a sitcom when you start yelling at the TV, &#34;just spit it out!&#34; as the characters dance around each other in confusion without realizing they aren't talking about the same thing. But I must say I am glad I stuck with &#34;Wedding Night&#34; because it was a great ride, fun and funny, smart, maybe a bit predictable, but it left me smiling and a bit misty eyed. I'm glad I read it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|As a fan of sci fi and science, this is a really interesting program. If you liked the X-Files, I think this is the best series since then. I like the term 'fringe science', as some of the cases are almost believable and so you never know it might be possible in the future. It is well cast and certainly makes you want to watch the next episode. The rating of TV-14 is accurate and definitely not material for younger kids to watch. Maybe some adults too might have nightmares from some of the human experimentation depicted in the series.
B0061PEAUY|2.0|No surprizes, nothing new. If you like characters will enjoy  Bones and the crewbut otherwise it was a waste of my time.
B003VPWX6K|5.0|After the first several chapters, I thought, &#34;Is anything going to happen in this book?&#34; The reader has to be patient, but the rewards are worth it. Great character study of a person and a society caught up in a changing world. Subtle!
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Great movie that is suspense filled and leaves you guessing.  In the end,.mark wahlberg gets his man and also gets the.girl
B000IKQK7E|5.0|Got the DVD for my son-in-aw and he love it, he had told me he wished he had a copy of ani mal house and so one day I was on here looking for something and thought hay I'll look and see if Amazon has it and U did soo ! Made Him Happy!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I really don't want to rate this, but I couldn't write the review without it &#60;G&#62;<br /><br />I have been putting off writing this because everyone, for one reason or another, pretty much feels the same way I do: disappointed. I’m not disappointed with the outcome. I didn’t care who she ended up with; as long as Sookie got what she wanted I was fine, even though it did seem kind of abrupt. My opinion might be colored by the fact that Harris said she was just tired of these characters, but I felt it showed in the book. It was anticlimactic, lacking passion, hurried, and the book story arc was uninspiring. Two of the major players' endings weren’t brought to a satisfying conclusion and many of the secondary ones weren't either. I’m not that hard to please; killing them off would have been better because it would give me some emotional closure for these people! At least I would know how things turned out for them. But to be fair, Harris is releasing a book at the end of the year to let us know what happened to all the other characters. And let’s not forget she has a new series coming out and she has said some characters from her other novels will be popping up in that one. So that might be a reason for leaving some endings open.<br /><br />Now it sounds like I am bashing this book, but I’m not! I adore Sookie. Sometimes an author can write a character that you connect to on many levels. This is what I love about first person POV, the character’s emotions are more real to me. Harris’s writing style made me feel so comfortable in Sookie’s head. The way she thinks and her outlook on life is a lot like mine. So this wasn’t my favorite book of the series, so what? The series as a whole has brought me a lot of reading pleasure and I can’t thank Harris enough for that.<br /><br />Open letter to Ms. Charlaine Harris:<br /><br />Dear Ms. Harris,<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Sincerely, Sharon Stogner
B001QOGYFO|5.0|loved the movie and got it for my son for his birthday good condition and exactly as described when purchased.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Fantastic set. I saw the show on tv and couldn't peel myself away so I had to buy it as soon as it was released.Watched it 3 times and will watch again.
B000067FP8|5.0|loved the movie and got it for my son for his birthday good condition and exactly as described when purchased.
B000IZA9NK|5.0|The visuals are stunning and the story is great but we actually couldn't watch this because Amazon video streaming is aweful!!!!!
B009178OQA|5.0|This is a great documentary on the dedication that Jiro and his sons put towards their craft.<br /><br />It was interesting to see how all the ingredients were selected, from the fish at the market to the selection of the rice.<br />I also enjoyed see the how much time the apprentices were required to put in before making something which sounds simple to outsiders, but involved lots of skill: egg sushi.
B005CRQ44W|4.0|I am learning German, so I thought, what better way than to read both German and English versions at the same time? Overall the German version is ok, but I did notice that there were several places where sentences or a whole paragraph missing. Plus, a native German speaker friend took a comparison of the English vs. German versions, and thought the German version didn't translate as good as it could have, in terms of keep the nuances of the English version. But perhaps there are some things that are just too difficult to translate, or that since J.K. Rowling doesn't read German, the translation house got away with it.
B0013TPV0Q|4.0|I appreciate his short story style. His telling of everyday events with his kaleidoscopic view of life.  Love the chapters about quitting smoking.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This was a gift for my brother who has seen the movie several times and who told me about it.  I loved the caring detail that the Japanese give to preparing those who have passed.  The movie is such a surprise and stimulates thought and discussion about how we view the inevitable end of life.  Not morbid, but sweet and unexpected.  Well worth watching!
B005LAJ1H2|1.0|Got my Season 2 and was ready to enjoy. Put in disc 1 and it does not work. Stalls on picture and breaks up. This is identical problem that happened when I purchased Season 1 from Amazon. Had to return it twice before I got a good one. Not happy with quality of product no matter how great a price.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|It was one Happy Christmas for a four year old that loves his garbage truck!  I his words Santa Rocks!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Fantastic ...unlike anything I've ever seen on regular TV. Dexter meets CSI. Great performances, with intense and intelligent scripting. Anticipating the next episode!
B0094K1MH2|2.0|I never saw the end of the movie. It might be interesting for children. I was surprised that it was produced by Steven Spielberg.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm half way through and I can't put it down... It's so suspenseful and the research he out into it is incredible from physiology to abuse to cooking.

B003G4W49C|5.0|You leave a book on a table. For a year. Ten years. A hundred years. The book will become damaged. And one day a person may find it. It may still be able to be read, if barely. But the person will weep just as the others who had read the book before them had once they've read it for themselves.<br /><br />Moral of this is: It matters not when the book was made, the story it contains and the emotions it contains will not change no matter it's age, or size, or how many people liked it on Facebook...A book's worth comes from the words inside and the people who love it.....Just as I have come to love this book myself, sceptical as I was when I first bought it.<br /><br />THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANY WHO THINK LIFE IS EASY FOR EVERYONE.....WAKE UP CALL SWEETHEARTS, ITS NOT!!!!!
B009GED3HS|5.0|Great show, I saw all seasons in less than 5 weeks duration, cann't get up once it starts. I watched first 7 seasons on Netflix and couldn't resist enough so watched rest of the season 8 on Amazon

B0049P1N3K|5.0|The &#34;POWER&#34; gives you what you need to control your life and get what you want. The book explains how to achieve exactly what you deceiver. It shows you how to feed your brain positive reenforcement.
B006LSZECO|1.0|A waste of money. As a librarian, I have read many books of differing types but could not get into this one at all. I really tried to enjoy it but found it to be BORING at best. I did not find it suspenseful. I could not finish it. In addition, I was really annoyed at all the words in parenthesis such as(He said)and (I, for one, ...). Go to the library and borrow it because it is not worth buying.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Well written but difficult subject matter at times.  Loved the floral descriptions and references.  wonder about a sequel.  ??  Worth reading
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The picture is as good as I've seen it. Sound was excellent as well. Price was VERY cheap for what you get. Casting and direction are great as are the actors. Delivery was very quick and the Blu-Ray (and the case) arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />The story, as most readers will know, is based upon a true story. In fact the grand kids of this famous family still sing and are coming to Indianapolis in mid December. I'm looking forward to seeing them for the first time.<br /><br />Keep in mind this movie is only BASED on the true story. I highly recommend that everyone do some research and find out about the true story. In many ways it's every better than the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Blu-Ray edition to all ages. It's truly a national treasure and should be vewed at least once by all.<br /><br />For the first time - I give this a 10 out of 10!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband and I loved every episode.  We have watched all 3 seasons and can't wait for the next season.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was told about this book by my sister. I got it and couldnt put it down. the only problem with this book is that it is finished before I was ready to stop reading.  I am a happy ending person and this one did it for me. it was well crafted and kept me on task to the end.<br />Now my sister and I are sending each other flowers via email... It served to remind me the past ages had something going for them.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A great read.  She takes you on the trail with her, a definite page turner.  I want to hike this trail now.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love the hunger games trilogy. I know the movie deviates from the book, but what book turned movie doesn't? I loved it!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This seems less fluid than Gone Girl, which I couldn't put down. I wish it made me want to turn the page with vigor and thrill but it didn't. characters weren't as well created and I never found the voices of the characters. Usually when a book is over, I miss the characters, but not go 'round. Save your time and money and go straight for the best one: Gone Girl.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have loved Charlene's books since the day I picked up the first Sookie book! I have always figured she would end up with Sam since Charlene has always known the ending ( which is disappointing)  but this WHOLE book disappointed me! The writing was terrible everything was shoved in this book with a page of explanation NOTHING was a surprise or a on your seat moment like any of the other 14 books and I find the way she ended a relationship with a man she has had something to do with since book 2 or 3 to be the stupidest thing I have ever read! For being one of my favorite authors Charlene Harris this book is a shame. :(

B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I did not like this App at all, it slow, it frustrated me very much.<br />I do not recommend this App at all.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I've always been a fan of LeCarre's books. Excellent, low-key, intelligent writing style. Like all his books, this one is<br />great on character development and building a suspenseful atmosphere. The surprises and plot twists just keep on<br />coming. Great for readers who want to savor his unique writing style. Smiley may be dead, but not LeCarre.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|A good story, but heavy with techno-babble.  I didn't care for the death of the security chief, other books spent time developing her character.  It will be interesting to see how this affects Word.
B009NY43NY|3.0|The Sookie books are always entertaining, but the last three or four books in the series definitely lost steam (and character).  I get the feeling Charlaine Harris was tired but still churning them out.
B003UYUP58|5.0|It's amazing how far we have come in oncology and the understanding of cancer in the last half century and yet we still have far to go.  Science and medicine do leave us with hope for new cures and treatments.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I just did day 1 level 1 and I must say harder than I thought!!! I looked at the video yesterday and it seemed easy. By the first 2 min. Of cardio I was sweating!!! Finished 10 minutes ago and I am still sweating and already sore! I am confident this will work.
B005K17RU0|1.0|big mistake updating this app. the old version was great but this new one takes forever to open and update. had to delete most of my locations to get it to work. will look for a new app now.
B008Y6RYDS|3.0|this movie really gets much more credit than it deserves but does offer some entertainment value.<br />hippies and motorcycles never really mixed well and this movie is an example. the saving grace of the music is the music soundtrack. the plot is weak, predictable and as non sensible as the very stoned jack nicholson.
B009NY43NY|1.0|If you have trouble falling asleep, this book is for you.  How disappointing was this final book?  Extremely!  My friends and I have been faithful Sookie fans.  We all agreed the last 2 books were also a bore, but hoping Charlene Harris would make a killer ending.  Unfortunetly, that didn't happen.  Although, I am giving this a very bad review, it truly doesn't matter to all the Sookie fans out there.  Who would not read the last book even if it's terrible????  I gave this last installment 1 star because of the title.  Charlene Harris titled this book appropriately, Dead Ever After, and to that I say, thank you!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|That was really fun! Challenging but not impossible. The Graphics were amazing on the Kindle Fire HD. Can't wait for the next one!!
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I am unable to Install this game on my Kindle Fire.  I definitely will be asking for my money back!!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|The beginning is very interesting. The idea is good. Short stories through interviews. But it took so much time to finish and it became boring.
098478280X|1.0|Come on, this is a technical book without a Kindle edition?  Do you expect me to take you seriously?  I no longer buy books not on my Kindle(living overseas makes that difficult)
B00AR0DN3Y|5.0|This was a brillian book that I simply couldn't put down. Just shows you what the human body can endure for survival.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Excellent, well crafted story. Interesting twists that force you to keep reading. Would definitely recommend this book to those who love suspense.
1400032717|5.0|The author does an outstanding job of getting inside the thought processes of his protagonist; the book is a wonderful glimpse of a young man coping with autism - and succeeding in making us root for him.
B000009DUY|5.0|Not much can be said by me that has not better been said by others. Saving Private Ryan is an iconic film that should be considered mandatory viewing for all Americans. This soundtrack is a wonderful and subtle counterpoint to the riveting visual storytelling.
B000O59A2K|5.0|This was a really great pairing of two of his best movies. Love both movies and was very happy to get such a good deal on them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG! this is such a great app vry addicting fun filled and fast I &lt;3 it get it I reccomend it thx world of technology
B0091REZMW|3.0|Its nothing special, and you need plenty of patience to play it. If you don't, you will be spending some money
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Great season, I am looking forward to getting the next season. Packaged well and received in good shape. I recommend watching all of this season.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Works GREAT!!! Many different positions to place your Kindle.  Quality product. Easy to place the Kindle in it and remove it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Sookie has been a good friend of mine for a long time, and honestly I'll miss her ability to almost die at least once every hundred pages and still worry about yard work. But it was well closed and saying goodbye is easier when that happens.  Farewell Miss Stackhouse and may you never bleed in your yard again.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is awesome I played it every day sadly one day when I went to play it all my sharks were gone and the game reset. oh well its such a great game that I'm willing to start over
B00004WX4X|5.0|Classic. 5 banggas n the rest are still filled with lyrical genius.  Young cats need to understand this album was a innovation at it's time. LYRICS LYRICS LYRICS,  a message or at least knowing someone S*it someone goin through it like me.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|I couldn't put the books down!  The last two books are the best!  While I love this series, I  only wish the author would've left out expletives and sexual details because I'd love to share this with my son.  It's  a tragedy that Stieg Larsson isn't around to write more books!
B008EQIK90|4.0|I'll admit that the trailer didn't sell me, and the fact that it was a remake didn't help either. However this was actually a pretty funny movie. The chemistry between the cast was fantastic, and the humor wasn't insulting. I know humor is subjective, but as a 25 year old male, I found this to be a very enjoyable time.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Downloading the Amazon Appstore and Experiments from it screwed up my other two Cut The Rope games from Google Play.  I had to uninstall Experiments and the Appstore and re-download Experiments from Google Play.<br /><br />All Cut The Rope titles are great.  But getting it for free from Amazon isn't worth it.  Just pay the 99 cents.<br /><br />Oh and the Amazon Appstore doesn't have the option of signing out.
B0083GOPSG|4.0|Chronicle chronicles the events of three highschoolers  who become friends after finding a strange alien artifact in the woods which gives them telekinesis. This movie does a better job than Cloverfield at the whole home camera concept because the telekinesis allows creative camera angles that you normally couldn't do with a camcorder. Despite it's science fiction premise, the story also felt very real. The writing coupled with the special effects makes this one of those silent hits.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|While there must be thousands of reviews of this book, this old Baby Boomer, has never read Steinbeck before now.  Steinbeck brings a depression era realism to the book. The real story is about mental illness and the view society had of mental illness. He must have wanted to create a debate on the topic.  Should leave you thinking about today's view of mental illness as it relates to violence.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watch this during lunch at work instead of reading a book.  I have become spellbound with the characters, the setting and the time period.  Excellent!!
0345529057|5.0|Read the books before you watch the show! Mr Martin has created a complete world that is seamless and exquisite. He tells the story from the points of view of multiple different characters (each &#34;chapter&#34; is more of the story from someone elses vantage point. This blend of characters and personalities gives his stories a depth that is hard to match. Once you flip the last page you will be scrambling for the rest of the series (Be forewarned, the series is not yet complete, so once you finish the last book that has been published so far, you will have to wait to read the rest!)
0345528581|3.0|The list of exercises and recommended routine set up is great, but I can't help but feel like a lot of the content is just filler to make the book seem thicker. I don't care about half of the crap he writes about and just want to work out, damn it!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book is the second in the series of 3 books. It's fine. Unfortunately, I tend to compare the writing to that of Shades of Gray, which I prefer. I think if you are into the erotic romance, this series is fine. The characters are predictable, but sultry and have (of course) their own demons.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|Gorgeous music, as always. It's really a shame that more metal bands don't try and emulate Kamelot's melodic sounds. I'll always miss Khan, but the new singer is a great replacement and I look forward to hearing more from him in the future. I'll have to check his discography and see if he's done work with anyone else before. Hopefully Kamelot's tour will come near me so I can go see them live - last time their closest show was about 300 miles away and that's just too much for me.
B00400NHRO|4.0|This is a good book for anyone practicing medicine or thinking about it. Interesting perspective. It was WAY funnier the first time I read it, prior to practicing, but it rings home a lot of interesting concepts.
1609611543|1.0|Eat less. Burn more calories. You don't need to buy this book or any book. It is real simple.<br /><br />Obviously, if you cut out an entire food group you will lose weight.
B006UISWB0|3.0|This was not the limited edition colored vinyl version. Nonetheless it arrived timely and undamaged. Went to the record store and bought the red vinyl.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Awesome scary and very descriptive! It kept me wanting more and I hated it to end! Makes you think twice, or six times about locking your doors!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it. Had slight similarities to 50 shades series but a much less racy read and had me staying up past my bedtime just to see what was going to happen.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I got this app on my daughter's Nabi 2.  I was able to easily download the kids CD I was looking for and use my Amazon account to purchase the CD quickly and easily.
B009AMAGXK|5.0|I loved the books.  and love the movie.  hope they do the next book in the series. will order when number two comes out.
0312427565|4.0|Very good &#34;tell it like it was&#34; story telling exaggerated a bit perhaps by Wolfes flamboyant writing style. Highly recommended.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very addicting!! Haha, do not get during finals week. =]<br />The mini games are a nice touch too. I've played a lot of games like this and non have had mini games.
B00322PK2G|3.0|I loved how great I could see the black hands!! This is the only white watch that has black hands however, I did not like the plastic case and plastic band.  Plastic will produce sweat just under the band and I don't want a wet arm. I thought I would just replace the band but it is not replaceable.  Watch was returned...BUT, I did love the black hands!!
B008BM9L72|5.0|Easy reading, like the story and love the deatails. Book one and tree are the best, but you need book two to get the hole story in book tree. Love the ending
B008C20TDG|4.0|I was really interested to read this book. I found it very intriguing and read it quickly. My husband and I are doing a Whole 30 now. I just wish I didn't buy the Kindle version- the actual book would be nice to have for the recipes.
B005RDF2NA|3.0|No closed captioning - the quality was pretty low (and no, we don't usually watch things in HD)<br /><br />I really wish I hadn't purchased this (for ten dollars) - but maybe I'll eventually be happy that we can watch it offline...
0316228532|2.0|Honestly I just really didn't like this book. It was slow, soo long, and had way too many characters to keep track of . I quit halfway through, which I almost never do.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I like it very much but tom is no repeating the words.even I am aged I am enjoying with talking tom
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Nice combo of both action and enough story to be drama also.  Had a nice moral to the story for teens also.
B0053FANPY|5.0|This is really good this conpleted my whole collection comes with a bonus new excellent and really fast shipping I love it and so does my family go fast and furious!!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|What can I say . Excellent film great acting and wonderful songs. Nip out and get it, settle down on the sofa and enjoy
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this story, talks about things everyone one thinks about but no one every says. Sad love story, but worth reading
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|I was somewhat entertained after an initial period of greater enjoyment. I may play it again one of these days.
B004ELSDZK|1.0|Not a fan. Too boring could not stand the music or the little alien or whatever it is. Too slow and not overall fun
B004G0DN7W|5.0|still a very entertaining movie after all these years.  suspenseful, funny, very futuristic thinking for period of time and well done.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|This is the worst game I have seen!  It doesn't fit on my screen for my Kindle 7.  I can't even get started, what's wrong with this game!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love the game so much I played all night last night well till one you should totely get and play with twilight sparkle
0425256162|4.0|WHAT IS IT?<br /><br />\\"Blue Remembered Earth\\" begins a new Alastair Reynolds series about the early days of interstellar travel. It begins with news of the death of Eunice Akinya, the brilliant, ruthless, and eccentric matriarch of Africa's -- and Earth's -- most powerful family. Founder of a corporation that helped lead the reconstruction of Earth after planet-wide climate-driven collapse, she contributed substantially to the expansion of humanity to the moon, Mars, and the outer solar system in the late 21st and early 22nd centuries. Eunice has left a secret behind, one that some of her heirs wish to bury ... and that some of her rivals hope to exploit. Caught in the middle are two of Eunice's grandchildren who have refused to join the family enterprise: scientist Geoffrey, who studies elephant cognition near the family homestead in the Serengeti, and artist Sunday, a sculptor living in an outlaw zone on the moon. Ultimately, it's up to this brother/sister pair to uncover what grandma was hiding and decide what to do about it.<br /><br />WHAT'S TO LIKE?<br /><br />All of Reynolds novels are magical mystery tours where plots and characters matter less than lushly-imagined scenery, deftly-mixed science fact and scientific speculation, and broad social/philosophical themes. In this book, Reynolds sides with the techno-optimists who believe that humanity, with our collective backs up against the wall, will find ways to blunt the worst aspects of climate change, find new sources of clean energy, and boldly go where science fiction has repeatedly gone before. He gives us self-renewing artificial corals to protect coastlines, undersea cities populated with surgically-altered mer-people, space elevators, new kinds of brain augmentation and telepresence, a benign Big Brother that prevents war and violence, Darwinian robot battlegrounds on Mars, asteroid mines, and a super-telescope on Mercury that can discern large-scale alien artifacts on extrasolar planets. As always, Reynolds assumes that the primary agents of social change are prickly nonconformists -- in this instance, Eunice -- who flout the rules in pursuit of their larger-than-life goals. Also, as always, Reynolds writes with conviction and authority.<br /><br />The big philosophical questions raised in this book are whether humankind is destined to (a) destroy itself, (b) spread to the stars, or (c) hang on indefinitely in quiet desperation. Only (b) gets serious consideration. What Reynolds really wants to debate is whether we need to go to the stars because it's our destiny, or we need to go to the stars because if we don't aim high we'll inevitably stagnate and collapse. You can probably guess which one he chooses.<br /><br />WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?<br /><br />The book's biggest problem has to do with the narrative thread that ties it together, the search for granny's secret. Unfortunately, the thread is actually a trail of breadcrumbs that granny painstakingly planted all around the solar system. It's one thing to acquaint readers with an unfamiliar world through the investigation of a crime (as in \\"[[ASIN:B001KOTU88 The Prefect]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:0441018866 House of Suns]]\\"), and it's something else entirely to drag the reader through a chain of deliberately designed puzzles a la \\"[[ASIN:B003QSPQ3O National Treasure]]\\". The former can feel organic, but the latter is always silly and artificial. That's OK in the \\"Indiana Jones\\" films, but not in a serious novel.<br /><br />The second problem has to do with the novel's apparent bad guys, two Akinya cousins who are supposed to be prime movers in the family business. If they're such big mucky-mucks, how do they justify spending so much time pestering, insulting, badgering, and sneering at Geoffrey and Sunday? Why would they bother? Like far too many fictional characters in stories that authors wish to drag out, they make make many threats and issue lots of \\"You'll be sorry!\\" warnings without explaining anything. Do they know something that Geoffrey and Sunday don't? Do they have a nefarious secret agenda? The answers, which you'll have to discover for yourself, will make you want to tear your hair out.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />Alastair Reynolds has mellowed considerably since the first three \\"Revelation Space\\" novels. His more recent protagonists are not completely reckless, they're not mass murderers, and they don't go around dismembering people for giggles. Granny might be difficult, and she may skirt the law, and she may take ridiculous risks, but she's still a family woman. Geoffrey and Sunday may have been born rich kids, but they're not driven by greed and they don't live decadent lives of privilege. I frankly like the older, nastier, rawer Reynolds better than this kinder and gentler version, but I am still awed by the force of his imagination and the strength of his writing. I read the book compulsively, most of it in a single sitting, and I was never bored, and I never felt more than mildly annoyed by its weaknesses. Definitely recommended.ing that Geoffrey and Sunday don't? Do they have a nefarious secret agenda?

B00471Z3CI|5.0|I had forgotten how much I loved this movie. Still fun, still scary. The special effects hold up well even all these years.
B0067EKYS6|5.0|I did not see the Robert Redford version and did not read the book but have recently added<br />it to my Kindle.  I have been a Leonardo DiCaprio fan for a long time.  Why hasn't he won an<br />Oscar?  He was stunning in this movie.  It was fun to watch from start to finish.  The party<br />scene alone was worth the price of admission.  Loved the characters, the locations, the scenery,<br />the music, the costumes, everything.  I have pre-ordered it from Amazon as it the kind of<br />movie I will want to watch again.  Leonardo is amazingly handsome in this movie and plays<br />his part to perfection. This was pure entertainment.  I watched it with 2 of my best girlfriends<br />and we all absolutely loved it.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|loved this. its a fun rollicking good time. We get to see that we (humans) are/were the real monsters in this world.  Adam Sandler did an excellelant job as Dracula (and he never once pulled out his ukelele and sang in his stupid voice.) Great fun.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|wow love this music and all the others I got, plan on buying more so send me so ideals yea baby
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is adictive. The history developed in the game is amazing. I recomend it so much. Cool graphics, I want to unlock more armors!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics are beautiful while the game truly challenges your observation skills and reasoning.  I can't wait to see what comes next.
B003WKOU0G|4.0|I love babies! It's amazing to watch how baby behavior is the same all over the global.  This was a delightful movie! My family enjoyed it together!
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This movie I have watched with my children--hoping that they see how important it is to talk to and mentor our children--even preparing them to be strong during conflict.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Single and over 40? Still living with your mother. Here's a book for you. Great read. Sweet characters. Thorough and complete story. Who needs singles.com to find a mate. Let fate.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Dark or light, it doesn't matter because love conquers all. It will be interesting to see how Link deals with \\"things\\" in the next book. I love, love, love these books.
B008Y73940|5.0|The acting and the story line were both very good, first rate cast. There was drama with a little bit of comedy.  It was enjoyable, the whole family watched the movie and liked it.  I like mysteries, a lot, and watching this movie, and wondering how he was going to deal with his particular situation keep me on the edge of my seat.  I had always wanted to see this movie, and I am glad that I finally did.  I was NOT disappointed.  I am by no means a movie critic, I just like what I like. If the story seems like something you'd be interested in watching, and you have enjoyed these cast members in other movies, hopefully you will enjoy this movie as much as my family and I did.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|While I did not enjoy this as much as the first three movies, I did like it.  Too bad they decided to make a trilogy (I think) out of this one book.  I think this is a mistake.  Anyway, back to this movie.  Slow in the beginning, then, gets somewhat interesting in the middle, with a decent ending - of course, leading to the next film.  I rented this film via Amazon (via Roku) and I will not buy it.  I own the trilogy and have watched them numerable times.  This one, I will probably not watch again.  My opinion.
B008602KQI|4.0|I was skeptical about this movie because of all the hype (I did not read the books) however, I was pleasantly surprised.  I am looking forward to the next installment and highly recommend this movie.
B009NY43NY|4.0|First of all, I liked it. It was a good end to the series. I just felt like it was being told by a different person than all the previous books. It had a different style than the previous books and it just distracted me from the story initially.<br />Good book. If you like Sookie, this is a fitting finale.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|The special effects were great.  It is true to the story and Chris Evans did a good job.  If you are a marvel fan you will like this movie.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|Grew up watching the ninja turtles and saw these movies way back when and still love them today!! Have to watch all 3 movies now and again :)
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great game. Would reccommened it.  It keeps you interrested especially since it has a different puzzle for each level.  Great game
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game so much that I can rarely play it because whenever I do I forget to eat and sleep.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The ending is not what I expected.  I think though that it will work out in the end.  A good cliff hanger for next season.
B005CGI4EG|3.0|The bargain packaging is the only real qualm to have--you're getting a very long-running and beloved (if that's the right word) TV series for a basement price point--but it's a big one. Two spindles stacked up as high as your head with DVDs is a little quarrelsome to deal with when you're looking for the Labor Day episode in season four, for example. So  before buying, just know and accept what you're getting  into.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I tend to favor females authors and male musicians. However, I always make an exception for Florence. Her vocals and lyrics are powerful and evocative.
B00000JPH6|2.0|Here's the elephant in the room about  this movie: It's boring. It's technically masterful and wonderfully-crafted, but part of the reason why nobody really remembers it is that for all of that work, it just isn't all that interesting. And as an adult, I find much of it to be a bit silly: lots of effort coming up with a ton of goofy species, both in name and in design. Ridiculous fake languages. It's hard for me to fathom that scores of children would take an interest in it because it is so dry (and dark). A somber child might. But this movie tries awfully hard to be philosophical and misses a chance to be thrilling, endearing, or captivating. The only character who you really care anything about is Fizzgig, the furry dog-like creature. And he can't even talk.<br /><br />I LOVE the Muppets and I LOVE Jim Henson, but to me this  just misses the mark.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was recommended by a friend who's book club read. Kept me riveted through the entire book and the twists toward the end nailed it!<br /><br />I am now reading Landay's &#34;Mission Flats&#34;
0316227706|4.0|Interesting conversation piece. Impressive photography and interesting subject matter. The dogs look silly (although at times menacing even though they aren't really acting in that way) and clearly are having a good time.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app is light years ahead of any other I've tried. It's text prediction and flow features are on per with Apple and Android attempts but beyond that.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|My daughter loved just for kids just clean fun, I hope you ever orders enjoys it.<br />I would highly recommend this game for child 6 plus
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|one of the best movies ive ever seen. so surprised that its based on the true story of family.to see the villagers so willing to help...
B005OT2YVA|2.0|I expected the spiderman-like pro-America theme, but this might as well have been a car commercial, a bad one at that.  Wall-E does a better job at humanizing robots.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Great show, enjoyed the stories, the music fits each story. The acting is great, good actors and actresses suit each other. Nathan Fillon and Stana Katic do a good job acting together. Great Show.
B005UG542S|5.0|Used the rental streaming version which was a very inexpensive choice and if you run at least 1Meg internet works well.  Good roll up of the series.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I just loved the show. The stories are great, music suits each story filming is great. the actors and actresses suits their part. Nathan Fillon and Stana Katic just suit their part and make the show jnteresting and there's funny parts. Fantastic show.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is amazing! I am like addicted to it, I play it at least once a day, soooo fun!
B004GYY714|5.0|I like listening to stations from all  over the country. I can listen to texas and alaska. I also listen to &#34;The Grand Opry&#34;.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|I had read the three previous novels in the series and really enjoyed them, I was looking forward to this one coming out... I wasn't disappointed in the book at all, but felt it was very short as I finished it in a day (hard to tell how many 'real' pages are in a book when you get it on kindle) but thoroughly enjoyed it and it lived up to my expectations completely.  Now I'll have to wait for the next one, sure isn't that what a 'series' is all about! Enjoy.
B00AFOS8A0|5.0|In this Verdi Bicentennial celebration, there can be no better option than this set to commemorate Le Roncole's composer. Great recordings with the greatest artists of the 70's and 80's are included in a bargain price. With some very rare operas such as Alzira and Un Giorno di Regno, and different version of favorites such as Don Carlo and La forza, this set is an absolute reference for the complete Verdian Work. Even though the libretti are not included,this box offers us a unique chance of hearing Verdi's non-operatic work such as his string quartet, the sacred pieces as well as other rare pieces. It is the first option to celebrate the Maestro bicentennial for every opera aficionado and performer. Excellent!
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was so much fun to read!  I couldn't put it down, it's funny, witty, smart, and sexy.  While reading it kept me smiling and laughing out loud. I'd definitely recommend this book!
B0038NN3B4|4.0|I used to think people who did Atkins were crazy. But recent foot surgery laid me up for 2 months. I was determined to not get fat. Well, fatter. At 246 the day of the surgery I was &#34;robust&#34;. I bought this and &#34;Why we get fat, and what to do about it&#34;, as they are complimentary.  Cutting the carbs and eating the Atkins way, I lost 18 lbs in 5 weeks, and it's stayed off. I still can't exercise, but lost weight literally having bacon and eggs five days a week for breakfast. As soon as the walking boot is off, it's back to th gym. Can't wait to lose another 15! I'm a 55 year old, 6' man. Feels great! Recommended reading for victims of the processed carb pride mic.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I love a story that pulls me in and refuses to let go.  Although I occasionally had trouble finding some of these characters to be plausible, the language and story were so gripping that I kept going only to be completely blown away by the ending--it was well worth reading through my mental question marks.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I tuned into Emeli Sande because of her appearance on American Idol this season.  I loved Amber Holcomb, who placed fourth.  When Emile Sande joined Amber onstage for a rousing version of \\"Next to Me,\\" it led me to explore this CD.  Wow!  Amber was right!  This lady is dynamic and this CD's great.  So Emeli's version on this set is complete delight with that rousing \\"wooh hooo\\" chorus and an expressive performance, \\"When all I need is a hand to stop the tears from falling, I will find him.\\"  It's such a confident love song, so sweet!  Perhaps the polar opposite is the tearjerker breakup song \\"Suitcase\\" that with a pedal steel guitar added I could envision on the country charts since it tells such a story, \\"He says don't touch me, get out the way; Will someone tell me what's going on tonight?\\"  \\"Wonder\\" is a delightful anthem with Sande's voice fully hopeful, \\"This light is contagious, go, go tell you neighbors, Just reach out & pass it on.\\"  \\"Maybe\\" is another amazing track, a relationship in danger, so emotionally powerful, \\"All the signs seem to say love is lost, but I don't want to give up what we've got.\\"  While these are my personal favorites, the rest of the tracks like \\"Mountains\\" & \\"Hope\\" are also strong.  Emile Sande's set is so strong that it creates anticipation to see where she'll go next.  Enjoy!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I enjoyed it so much that I let my grandsons and my sisters watch it with me, so I have watched it over 3 times, at different times.
B007EC27QM|5.0|A super easy to use calculator and I love the big keyboard. I use this calculator all the time and think it'$ one of the best out there.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I got this to go with my Lord of the Rings series.  I do like the 3D in this.  My grandson told me it was supposed to be good in 3D and I was not disappointed.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Each story is linked like an endless chain.  And each reaches deeply into our emotions.  This is an amazing book. This book while centered by Afghanistan life is universal.  I was deeply touched and moved.  Now I will reread it again to savor it again.  Hosseini has written a masterpiece.
B00B4804KS|4.0|Steven Spielberg did a great job converting this to 3D.  It wasn't just a 2D to 3D effect like my TV can do.  The rain actually feels like it's in the room.  Beautiful color and just made an old story gain more life. The special features also are good, you can understand how they were able to convert this so well.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This book came on a recommendation and I'm certainly not sorry I read it.<br /><br />A fascinating tale about one woman's quest to remember who she is (and was) courtesy of an accident, Before I Go to Sleep digs deep into the psyche of what would happen if we woke up every day not remembering anything that came before. The hitch, however, is a mystery involving this woman's life and the reason she's an amnesiac now. The story definitely has its intrigue, and the concept and the way it was written were unique. The reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 4 (or greater) was the length. Too many repetitions, too many scenes that played upon previous ones already told, and an ending I sort of figured out halfway through the book. That said, the story has a way of gripping you and holding on -- though I have to admit that I did so only by skimming pages along the way.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good read.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I watched the DVD disk that I sent to my grandson when I went to visit my daughter and grandchildren.  I could really see the beauty of the 3D vs the 2D DVD movie.  It just is so alive and the color and effects are wonderful. Makes me appreciate a good 3D movie.  Glad I bought the movie in 3D, well worth the money.  I got a big discount by pre-ordering the movie through Amazon.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played in my life. This game is so awesome that I could not stop playing it.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|This film was so magical for me as a child, I had to share with my grandies. They loved it, and had many questions about - magic (imagination)! Very healthy presentation of dreamworld!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game to play.  I didn't want it to end.  I love mystery treasure games.  I hope the makers will keep making new ones.  Very enjoyable!
B0072GPQNG|4.0|The role of the horse as a servant to mankind and in war over the ages provides an insight into the devotional relationship between man and beast of burden. The fact that no matter what side of political struggles in this particular war people were advocating, thd presentation of their relationship to the horse was foremost. The scenes ranged from horrid to very touching. Even the ole drunk was devoted to the horse, as were the enemies who help free him from the barbed wire snare. The realities portrayed should be in front of anyone who thinks of the horse of mainly something outdated or only to bet upon in a current race. Beautiful cinematography. The movement of the horse gets inside you and propels how important this social animal has been to help its human caregiver.
B009R659L8|5.0|From beginning to end I loved it.  Typical Mary Higgins Clark.  Kept my attention on ever page from beginning to end.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|For someone who rarely reads fantasy I really did enjoy this book. To be fair I am also a esoteric nut as well, so seeing the use of some these terms and people added to the intrigue.<br /><br />I will say that a little more character development would be nice. And it is kind of disappointing to not have a complete story in book one. This is obviously book 1 of 6, so if you don't want to spend the money on all 6... this may leave you highly irritated at the end.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Every word and every page held my attention.  We don't understand and appreciate the dedication and sacrifice it takes to do what he did under enemy pressure.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I really like how this cover looks. It may not be the most functional but for someone who uses their tablet as a book its a perfect indication of what is inside.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|A great show for any adventure and/or sci-fi TV viewers. I watched all of the episodes on BBCA when they came out and now I get to enjoy them again. Bonus features are not bad either; Matt Smith is such a character.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book! Can't wait for more! Author paints wonderful pictures in your mind with such eloquent wording. Pleasure to read.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I was sent this charger for product review.. And i say im very impressed. The packaging was nicely done, and very prompt on shipping. The charger itself is well made has input for Apple and Android and it charges extremely fast very nice product. This is a must buy!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|'Fun game for adults and kids. Teaches them goals and his to manage coins. It would be nice to rotate the view in. Order to see other angles
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|Looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I watched the movie before I this and its crazy how good they did on the movie and how closely it follows the novel.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|These movies are awesome, and the HD quality makes them even more enjoyable.  You notice things you might never have without the added quality.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the fact that I can read books on my phone with out having to purchase a Kindle. There is a great selection of free books or even low cost books.
B0073U2FB2|1.0|Soooooo boring feel asleep twice while i was wide awake to start.. movie made no sense and such a waste of money
B00847VY92|5.0|I remember seeing the Pollyanna movie years ago and when I saw this title I just thought it would be interesting to see the follow-up to that.  It was a fun read, she still had that Pollyanna motto and it sort of rubbed off on me too.  Put a smile on my face and those around me.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Only time will tell  if Sookie  can finally settle into a &#34;NORMAL&#34; exixtance with Sam.  I hope so but Im a romantic at heart.
B007SGM084|5.0|My girlfriend at work read trilogy and told me to read it. I was going on a train ride so I downloaded it to my kindle fire HD, I'm so glad  did. It was great. Thank you for writing this.
B00A0T0NWQ|5.0|This movie by Steven Spielberg with an all-star cast is a riot! It takes place in California after the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. If you lived that era than you are older than dirt! Seriously this picture handles the early days of the World War II similar to that other great movie: &#34;It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World.&#34; The soundtrack is most enjoyable! The film has lots of slapstick comedy with physical comedy that is exaggerated, boisterous and funny. The caricatures of some of the characters in the film are so far out of it that is exceeds the common sense of most normal people. But in this film there maybe only 2 or possibly 3 people who are normal. The rest are either out to lunch or on the dark side of the moon. I gave it five stars because the film really entertains and you see some of the actors just starting out in Hollywood and others God bless them are no longer with us... may they rest in peace. The film is also true to the styles of dress that was worn back then by both guys and dolls. The Zoot Suit was really big then! It is a man's suit with a long jacket and pegged pants, always worn with a long key chain that looped down around the ankles. The shoes were usually two-toned black and white leather shoes. It was the rebellious fashion that some of the young wore back then. The key word in this film is exaggeration and funny. For those who lived it, it was nothing like that but then this film will bring a bit of hilarious merriment to a period in US History that was far from it.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Very well written and towards the end I couldn't put it down.  In fact I finished it at nearly 2am one morning.  Definitely recommend.
B002L9N4F6|5.0|It truly looks like a box of chocolates on the outside, but don't expect a sweet treat on the inside. This is a great gift for the true fan of Forrest.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|the game is pretty fun. it gets a little tiring over time, but if you leave it for a bit and revisit it, the game gets a second wind.
B009JBZH54|5.0|What a great deal for a great trilogy of movies. This set has all three Christopher Nolan Batman films and is a must have for any Batman fan.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|A British saga written in the true Archer tradition.  A Great read for the lazy days of summer. Give it a try.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is an instant classic, and after your first watch you will be hooked. Catchy songs and hilarious jokes, I didn't want it to stop! Can't wait until the sequel until 2015. Until then this will be my go to movie when I am bored or need a cheering up.
B005544V6A|5.0|Perfect show to watch on my iPad with my wife.... This show has it all its funny, entertaining with great performance, and finally lovable characters - harvey you are the best!!!
159562015X|5.0|Wonderful embellishments. Made beautiful hair bows! Thank you for a speedy and well descriptive product. Would do business with again.
B000W05IL4|2.0|If you like this find a copy of it on CD or hell even cassette and transfer to MP3, whatever bit rate they decided to rip this down with is terrible. Watery/splashy crashes there even seems to be some tape warble going on.. What the hell? If only this did the album justice.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|If you are easily offended, this movie is not for you.  Only at one point in the movie did I think to myself, I can't believe he did that.... (I won't give it away).  But it was nothing that would have made me walk out of a theater.  Not even close. It is full of crude humor and is not politically correct AT ALL.  So if you are sensitive to that, don't bother, you won't find it humorous.  I have not seen Borat but I could tell from the previews that it wasn't going to be a \\"safe\\", 2 hour long Saturday Night Live skit.  Which is what I am guessing some people are expecting.<br /><br />Overall, it moved along fairly quickly with some laugh out loud parts but I deducted a star because it just wasn't one of my all time favorites.  Makes a good rental.
B000FA675C|5.0|Even though I already read this book, I could not resist purchasing this book for the Kindle at the wonderful price of  1.99. Thanks Amazon.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Stunning, hypnotic, mesmerizing!!  One of the best films to hit the screen in a long time.  Extremely creative in the storyline and superb cinematography.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Great purchase at 1.99. I am hoping to read it soon. Happy to have it at such a low price for the Kindle.
B009AMAGXK|5.0|Maybe it's because my expectations weren't real high, but I enjoyed \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" immensely. I'm actually disappointed I didn't bother seeing it theatrically. I thought it basically looked like \\"Twilight\\" with witches. And while on paper that sounds like an apt comparison (both are supernatural romance movies based on young adult novels) it does do the film a disservice. I believe it's a better made and better acted film.<br /><br />From the trailers I thought the leads (Alden Ehrenreich and Alice Englert) seemed poor, with him seeming particularly terrible. To my surprise they were both great and the two had a really nice, believable chemistry. The supporting cast is also great. Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson seem to be having a great time, and Emmy Rossum is fun and sexy.<br /><br />From what I understand fans of the books weren't crazy about it, but I've never read the books and I loved it. I'm sad it was a box office flop as I'd love for the other books in the series to become films. I'm glad, unlike most movies based on a series of books, that \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" is able to stand on its own and doesn't really end with a big cliffhanger or anything (not in my opinion at least). But it would still be great to see more. It's unfortunate this had to become a victim of a terrible release date. I do believe with a different date where it didn't have to go up against another film attracting the same audience (Safe Haven) it would have performed much better. And if by some miracle they did decide to make another I do think the audience would grow as more discover the first on DVD/Blu-ray, as long as it was released amongst less competition. They'd certainly need to try and cut the budget in half though. But alas I'm not holding my breath for the series to continue, as sad as it may be. The only hope would be if sales/rentals are strong enough. \\"Beautiful Creatures\\" is well-worth watching though even if there probably won't be a sequel. Such an entertaining film.<br /><br />Technically I would rate this 4/5 stars, but I'm going with 5 to try and offset the bad ratings because it was different than the book. I get that it's hard to separate them when you've read the book but as a movie I thought this was incredibly enjoyable. I recommend trying to take it on its own merits. That's why I hate reading a book first if it's a movie or I know it's going to be a movie because usually you end up disappointed even though it's bound to be different. But if you watch the movie and read the book after it just enhances the story.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|Just a fun movie makes me laugh great effects not to much blood and no sex! Give it a shot
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is so fun to play! The only down side is that you cant finish some of the goals because it includes posting things on facebook. Besides that, its great and I highly recommend it!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Hard to believe this actually happened but it did.  Great movie, filled with suspense. Worth watching if you have not.
B00D1HC8VS|3.0|What can I say great all the way the deluxe not worth the price its about the music I'm waiting for back to the egg deluxe my favorite wings lp album cd what I really wanted to know about McCartney wings deluxed Paul you should put together an anthology with outtakes live and demos and please give Denny laine more credit than he deserves really not fair
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app does exactly what it says it will do.  If you are looking for a way to see how your power usage is this will do it.  Just read through everything and view the screen shots.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Although the acting was terrific, I thought it moved slowly. I would have preferred watching a one hour History channel documentary on the subject than this movie. Then again, maybe I shouldn't review this as I had a difficult time staying awake.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I got the first game for my birthday and couldn't stop playing, I got the second game for birthday and I still can't stop playing, Now I got this awesome game that can be played anytime, anywhere, its really cheap, really fun, and really portable, now instead of bringing a DS everywhere, you can use your phone or any other Android device, this is great for people who use their phone for everything, or the kids who want to get a game with a shortage of money.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I saw this concert live last summer at Jones Beach ...my husband Mike suprised me with the tickets.  It was a fabulous night, the Beach Boys were on top of their game, and listening to this CD brings back 50 years of memories!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large and easy to read screen! Works very well I love how it shows what transaction you previously entered I would recommend to anyone! :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is totally engrossing.  I enjoyed every minute of it and loved the way it brought something new to leisure gaming on my kindle.  Very well made.  Please make a next chapter.
B007PS0DTI|5.0|It is a great story and we can not wait until the next one.  We liked the way they opened up Kate's character.  Awesome.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We LOVE this series.  One of the best we've watched.  Such a captivating plot line and great characters!  Looking forwad to season 4.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|Many different scene modes I can choose from.<br />The quality is great.<br />I really like this camera because it has similar functions as the Coolpix Nikon camera.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Amazingly well done from a blast from the past.  Maybe I'm getting old, but god damn this is a good great CD.  I 100% purchased this CD for the fact that Deftones make some amazing intense music.
B007TKT2SK|2.0|This wasn't what I was expecting. I'm trying to find a calculator where I can multiply the denominator. Then multiply the 2 set of fractions. Just going to buy me one at Walmart instead.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like to play it when I am waiting or just for fun. I like the effects, sound and the rewards. The game could be more challenging.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love the sounds.<br />The vibrant colors.<br />And the game itself.<br />This is probably the one game I wouldn't get tired of playing, because it has many different levels.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|We kept on waiting for the plot to get humerous. Never happened, not remotely funny spinoff of knocked up. Only reason it wasn't 1 star is Megan Fox made the movie slightly engaging
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I was glad to see they made an app for this game, because I used to love playing it online.<br />One thing about it is that I can't get passed level 21. :(
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Just like the Hurt Locker, this movie does a great job at showing the grittier side of intelligence gathering and modern warfare.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|This is a really good game to play when I am always on the road, because there is nothing to do other than look at cars and trees.<br />I really like this game because it's kind of easy playing it.
0545128285|5.0|Loved the tales they are a great addition to my harry potter collection. Everyone should look into buying and reading them.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was hard to read this long goodbye, because I didn't want the Sookie series to end.  I have so enjoyed the action, humor and excitement from this series...I wish there would be more...but guess the rest is left up to us the readers to imagine.
0525478817|5.0|You can not put how fantastic this book is in to words. This is a once in a lifetime book that everyone should read.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I transitioned over from google reader and man what an upgrade! Very smooth and very pleasing to the eye. Made transitioning a happy thing!
0316232955|4.0|This book is a wonderful story, but the ending seemed rushed. I believe the ending is symbolic but form your own opinions
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|For overseas buyers I can confirm that the version of this Blu-Ray title obtained from Amazon.com (USA) will not play in a region B (Australia) locked Blu-Ray player & that therefore the discs are all region A as per the mark on the back panel of the cover but luckily for me, I have access to both multi-standard (NTSC, PAL, SECAM) & multi-region equipment for both Blu-Ray & DVD. If you are not in USA or other region A country & don't have such a set-up then you won't be able to play this title if you purchase it from Amazon.com in USA.<br /><br />This is not the situation for some other Blu-Ray titles such as \\"Farewell Live From Melbourne [Blu-Ray] (2004)\\" by the Eagles or \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (Blu-Ray 3D/Blu-Ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack) (2012)\\" which I can confirm are multi-regional. Given that the total price for these 3 titles + shipping comes to about $US86 or $AU90 depending on the exchange rate & that if purchased in Australia the cost would be significantly more (at least $AU120), if the exact same items could be purchased (which they can't), then it's a no brainer when it comes to purchasing titles overseas because of the price difference between items purchased overseas & those bought domestically - we call it \\"The Australia Tax\\".<br /><br />The other frustration with buying Australian versions is that for some titles, the actual contents are different. For example, I can only find \\"History of the Eagles\\" as a 2 disc Blu-Ray version without the third Capital Centre concert disc and you thought it was bad enough that the third disc only contained excerpts from the show. This third disc is apparently only available in Australia in the deluxe DVD version NOT the Blu-Ray. The Australian 3D Blu-Ray version of or \\"The Hobbit\\" doesn't contain a DVD copy of the movie as it does for the US version.<br /><br />Anyway, as a musician & long time Eagles admirer, I found the \\"History of the Eagles - Parts 1 & 2\\" to be enormously informative & am greatly entertained by the 1977 concert footage tho' I agree with others that the whole concert should have been included so they lose a star for region locking & not including the whole concert.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Was everything I wanted and more!! Fantastic product! I bought them for my boyfriend as a gift and he loves them. He won't ever take them off!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|This card worked great, I have used it over and over without any problem.  In fact, it outlasted my Olympus camera!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it thanks for being free. Good way to pass some time when you only have a few minutes to spare. Enjoyable game
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Enjoying it greatly. Graphics are solid. Battles easily understood and don't take too long. Many in game upgrades. Months of fun expected.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|I have been a LeCarre fan since his first novel. He probably should have shelved his typewriter after the Smiley series.  He retains a remarkable and enjoyable ability to create English dialogue and imagery, but his lapses into his ultra-liberal political rants are off-putting. He hasn't yet realized that the England he celebrates, exists no more.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|It is a great camera bag, can suite many different uses, the best of all it doesn't look like a camera bag,<br />Im getting a second one for my video camera too.<br />It is well done good materials you can make it the way you want.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|I had reservations about watching this but after a few recommendations from friends I decided to give it a go. While not the same experience as the BBC Sherlock, it is a entertaining show regardless.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|From book one I fell in love with the selection series. I wish I would have read it earlier.<br />Amazing.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Wow!! This was an amazing read, and while a short novella, I feel like I just read a novel! Brandon Sanderson is a master of his craft!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It's nice to come home after a long day and challenge myself with all of the challenges that subway suffers gives me! I highly recommend this came to anyone who likes action games!
B0074VA2T2|4.0|I put this on my phone because it was free.  I use it with my kindergarten students that are waiting for late parents.  They like the game.  It is too easy for a kindergartener, but it holds their interest for the five minutes we are waiting.  If I was a parent purchasing this product, I would purchase it for my 3 or 4 year old.  It is a great way to practice counting skills and following direction skills.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game.  Simple to understand, and challenging enough to keep you coming back for more.  Can be a bit addicting.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|For pocket change you can build your own (UBEC voltage regulator) with disposable cigaret adapter you scavenge, but if your time is move valuable, this seems like a good purchase.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy this application.  I've gotten lots of ideas for recipes and home organization of some of the pins!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I really enjoy the ease of play on this game. the skill levels aid me in honing my skills for the next family gathering.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Have had this for over 6 months. Works very well with my 5 year old Verizon Escapede.<br />After initial pairing..The phone's bluetooth should be turned on before turning on the Supertooth.<br />Above average clarity (even in my interior-road-noised Honda Fit) and battery life is long.<br />Very happy.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Great story! I thoroughly enjoyed the characters. I could not wait to get to the next chapter to determine the outcome of Victoria's plight. It was a bonus to learn the meanings to various flowers that become such an important part of the story.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|I have been a fan since his first published book. His ability to develop plot and characters still captures my interest<br />.
B00AFEY354|4.0|It's about time a young gay male is NOT a victim in a gay flick. Patrick (Ezra Miller) fights back when pushed. And lets be honest. Ezra is nice eye candy. On to the main character, Charlie (Logan Lerman). Yup, he too is easy on the eyes and his story is not the typical coming of age story. Good movie I've watch several times and will pop it in from time to time to enjoy again.
B001EBWIRW|5.0|This is one of my favorites. I love the songs! I also love the actors and the plot. It is full of dark humor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soo  FUN it beats temple run 2. The game goes on a world tour  so now the game is in Tokyo.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A Very good read. Hard to put down. Maybe now I can get some sleep. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I became a fan of the Piano guys early on, and while this album may not be quite as good as their first one, it is still a great album...
B000WCN8SC|5.0|If you're a Doors fan, this is it.  Very complete works from the Doors, plus many extras.  We've really enjoyed listening!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I'm just going to put it out here right now: The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here is my favorite Alice In Chains album. The 12 song set here is almost perfect, from the lyrics to the music, it's all amazing. This is one of the heaviest albums the band has ever put out, probably second only to their previous release, the dark and sludgy Black Gives Way To Blue. A quick note about the album cover: the devil is actually on the album artwork itself. If you turn the triceratops skull 180 degrees, then layer it over, the face is shown, and this is completely intentional and completely awesome.<br /><br />1) Hollow (10/10) - The album wastes no time hitting you in the face with pounding guitar riffs, heavy drumming, and the always enjoyable singing of Jerry Cantrell and William DuVall. This was the first single released form the album and it shows what a monster the rest of this is going to be. The verses have an almost unsettling feeling due to the harmonized singing of Cantrell and DuVall mixed with the palm-muted riffing and heavy bass. The chorus explodes straight out of the verses, hitting you with the opening lines of \\"hollow as a mountain, all tunneled and drilled below,\\" then going back to the opening riff. The bridge here is the highlight, with the vocals suddenly jumping up with a heavy rhythm guitar but surprisingly almost uplifting lead guitar. The solo is also awesome, although it's not really a standout from the band. This is the best possible opener on the album. It's easy to see why this was chosen for the first single.<br /><br />2) Pretty Done (9.5/10) - Although a bit weaker than the opening track, Pretty Done is still a good song on it's own merits. It's not nearly as dark sounding, and it has an almost Check My Brain feel due to the main riff using a lot of string bending and the way it turns darker during the chorus. The solo here is a bit more memorable than Hollow's. Overall, this is a good song, though it is one of the weaker on the album.<br /><br />3) Stone (10/10) - You know from the first second of this song you're in for something heavy. The bass intro mixed with the cymbal-laden drums set the tone perfectly for the guitar to come in. The lyrics here are amazing, painting a perfect picture of a frustrated musician asking his fans why they act like he's the perfect symbol of everything they are. The main riff is a very sludgy, slow paced monster while the bridge/chorus has a surprisingly less dark sounding riff behind it. The interlude before the solo has the best riffing in the whole song, with a very fast paced modification of the main riff with Cantrell and DuVall singing over it. The solo here is amazing, one of the best on the album. This was the second single released and while there are better songs that could've been chosen, this is by no means a bad choice.<br /><br />4) Voices (9/10) - The first song to feature an acoustic guitar. You could hear a short snippet of this in the documentary \\"23\\" on AiC's VEVO page. This is a surprisingly happy sounding song. Well, as happy as Alice In Chains can get. Jerry's singing on here is very good, as it usually is on these later albums, and the chorus here is utterly beautiful. The whole song almost sounds like a reject from Jar Of Flies. You could call this TDPDH's \\"Your Decision.\\" However, this song does fall down in a few places. The last 40 seconds could've been removed and it wouldn't have hurt the track at all. The verses also feel a tad short, making this feel a bit too repetitive for it's own good. Voices is by no means a bad song, but it is sadly one of the weakest tracks on here.<br /><br />5) The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here (10/10) - Wow. That's all I could say when I first heard the title track. This is one of my favorite, if not my favorite song(s) on the album. The opening guitar line with the heavy sweeping sound in the background creates a very unsettling atmosphere, setting the perfect tone for this song's subject matter. The lyrics here deal with religion, mainly Christianity. The title itself comes from a belief some Christians have about the origins of fossils. Cantrell & DuVall pull out all the stops on here, with the unsettling low sound of the verses to the high pitch of the bridge to the absolutely magnificent chorus. The solo here is the second best on the album, and the track ends with the acoustic (or at least what sounds like an acoustic) playing a simple but unsettling riff while the drumming goes into an almost military march sound with a feedback laden distorted guitar playing over it all. This is an utterly perfect song, from the music to the lyrics to the way it's presented, I can't think of a way to make this better. It's also the second longest on the album at just under six minutes and 40 seconds.<br /><br />6) Lab Monkey (10/10) - After that mammoth showstopper of a song, it's going to be hard to follow it up. While Lab Monkey isn't as good as the track before, it's still a fantastic song. DuVall's singing here is awesome, creating a very unsettling atmosphere (something Alice In Chains has proven they are very, very good at doing) when mixed with the eerie sounding opening bass riff and strange sounding main guitar. The chorus here though sounds very normal compared to the rest of the song, though the lyrics themselves are still incredibly strange. The standout here is the solo though, which brings out a talk box and has another solo playing in the background (this is my favorite solo on the entire album). This song is fantastic, and the only one that could live up in any way to the song coming before it.<br /><br />7) Low Ceiling (10/10) - The song begins with Cantrell and DuVall giving their signature \\"ahs\\" that were established in songs like A Looking In View on the previous album. It's a strangely happy sounding song, with the verses not exactly showing a sign of desperation and the chorus is definitely happier than the norm for Alice In Chains. The lyrics here are still great, with lineslike \\"Why is my ceiling another's floor?\\" This brings out the acoustic guitar again, but this time it's shared with a heavier distorted guitar. The solo brings out the wah-wah pedal's welcome return, although it's a tad sad that it's only used on one song like it was on Black Gives Way To Blue. Jerry's singing here is great as well. The only real problem with this song is that it drags on a bit, but it doesn't bring the song down enough to lower the rating.<br /><br />8) Breath On A Window (8.5/10) - Sigh. After a string of amazing songs, this one comes along and ruins the momentum. This is by no means a bad song, but it is the weakest on the album and the one that is least needed on here. The verse riff is reminiscent of Lesson Learned, while the chorus is more along the lines of Take Her Out. I personally found those to be the two weakest songs on BGWTB, but that's not the point here. Breath On A Window does have many good points, but unfortunately, they're not enough to bring up the score more. The lyrics here are average at best, the solo is nothing special, and it overall just sounds a bit too happy. The highlight of the song is the outro, when it takes a turn into introspection with the lines, \\"I'd let you go, but you're always in the way. I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday.\\" Overall, good song, but not exactly something to write home about.<br /><br />9) Scalpel (10/10) - After that disappointment of a song, we have another acoustic song, and a downright beautiful one at that. This wouldn't have been out of place on Jar Of Flies or Tripod. Cantrell's singing is beautiful here, and the whole song is very different from what you'd expect a song by Alice In Chains named Scalpel to sound like. This entire song is beautiful, one of the most beautiful the band has ever released, among the ranks of Nutshell. While this song is basically the same length as Breath On A Window, here it feels justified, and not just padding to make the album longer. One of myfavorite songs on the album and overall one of the best songs from Alice In Chains' late period work.<br /><br />10) Phantom Limb (10/10) - This behemoth is the longest song on the album at just over seven minutes long, and it is very well deserved. You could say this is TDPDH's \\"A Looking In View.\\" This song actually leaked on a radio station and has been available on Spotify for a long time and it quickly became a fan favorite. This is the only song on the album with lyrics written by William DuVall, and he shows his lyrical dexterity in lines such as \\"I'll wear you as a second skin, I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb.\\" The opening riff shows you what you're going to be in for, with a dark sounding four note riff that perfectly sets the tone. The bridge here is similar to the verse, though much darker sounding with fittingly more bleak lyrics. The pre-chorus is incredibly heavy with DuVall's screaming lyrics creating a very angry sound which transitions perfectly into the downright creepy chorus, where DuVall is using some kind of effect to make his voice even more unsettling than it naturally is with some chanting in the background. DuVall's scream of \\"yeah, yeah YEAH\\" launches into one of the most frantic and incredible solos on the album. DuVall is playing lead on here and he proves himself here as a worthy lead guitarist of the band when Jerry isn't. This is my second favorite song on the album and definitely one you should check out.<br /><br />11) Hung On A Hook (10/10) - DuVall is singing here again, although not in his usual way. He usually brings out the loud, screaming pain, but on here, it's downright disturbing and quiet as he whispers the opening lines with some. Some ahs in the background and the strange instrumentation after the first lines help cement this as one of the downright creepiest songs on the album. The chorus is more of the usual fair for DuVall but it is by no means a bad thing, and the lyrics here are amazing. The solo here is amazing as well, helping to prove the very eerie sound the rest of the song succeeds at already.<br /><br />12) Choke (10/10) - Here we are. The final track on the album. This is a fitting way to end this monster of a song collection. It's a dark song, more so than any of the others with an acoustic playing. There's an electric playing here as well, but it doesn't overpower the acoustic and serves as a backing to make it even more emotional. The chorus is impressive here, but the bridge blows it out of the water. Jerry's singing here again, and it fits as he has a good voice for these emotional and evocative ballads. This is a welcome addition to the album, and one that is not to be forgotten.<br /><br />Overall, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here is utterly fantastic. Breath On A Window is the only song that drags down the rating, even though some songs may have received lower ratings than others. It was worth the four year wait, and if it is the last Alice In Chains album, it's a very good sendoff to a great band.<br /><br />Full album score: 9.8/10.
0738737909|5.0|I pre-ordered this kit and was a little put off when the ship date was moved back - but Boy! Was it worth the wait!<br /><br />The book has a color print of each card, which I always appreciate, and was written by Kim Huggens who wrote Tarot 101 (highly recommended).  There is mention on p. 152 of an ebook called The Tarot Illuminati Revealed, which (I think) is now titled \\"Complete Guide to Tarot Illuminati\\" and available on Kindle.<br /><br />The deck is amazing. To me, this is a deck of dream images.  While most dream decks are filled with wispy/foggy images in watercolor and pastel, these images are instead what I see when I dream: they are lush, eerily beautiful, highly detailed, and hyperrealistic.  The complexity of the images makes these cards utterly fascinating; here are images that confound the eye, and pull the viewer into their world.<br /><br />Thank you, Erik Dunne, for your genius!<br /><br />Update: It wasn't until I went to shuffle the cards for the first time that I noticed bits of paper had come off the backs of several of the cards. This must have occurred when I pulled the cards apart. It's not unusual for brand new cards to stick together a bit, but I've never seen them damaged. (All swords, too. Hmmm.) It makes the deck useless for divination. I am having Amazon send me a new deck and returning this one.<br /><br />Update II: I received the replacement deck 2 days later, and it is perfect! The cards didn't stick together at all.
