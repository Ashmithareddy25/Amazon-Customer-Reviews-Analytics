B003WTE886|4.0|I swear I tried not to like her...but listening to Swift's brand of sweet, normal, harmless, charming, and yes, infectious melodiousness induced a pleasant change in mood heretofore unknown in my temporal lobes. Before long, my damned brain was infested by Taylor worming into conscious recall over and over in one ear and in the other one too! How many times did I warn myself, \\"Stop listening to this stuff or that earworm's gonna multiply into little sugar bunnies and then you'll see what gets reproduced.\\"  Well, heck, if sharing your brain with a bunch of sugar bunnies means never having another bad ear day, it's smart to jump onto the happy, campy no-damper bandwagon all agog this catchy collection by the depth-throated Swift, who not only knows how to get those earworms hopping, but has 'em all sucking up to her!
B009AMAM9S|4.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" (2012 release; 172 min.) is a massively ambitious movie made by no less than 3 directors (Lana (nee Larry) Wachowski and Andy Wachowski from of course the Matrix trilogy, and Tom Tykwer from Run Lola Run). There are six separate stories in the movie, set in the 1840's Pacific, the 1930's Cambridge, the 1970's San Francisco, today's London, the 2100's Neo Seoul, and a post-apocalytic story set \\"106 winters after Fall\\". Because of the sheer size and volume of these separate stories, it took me about an hour into the movie to just get a handle less or more on what is happening. That is not a complaint. It is simply stating the epic parameters of the movie.<br /><br />It is truly impossible to bring a nice synopsis of these 6 different stories, and suffice to say that common themes eventually arise from these stories: \\"Our lives are not our own, we are all connected with others, past and present\\". This is of course emphasized in the fact that the lead actors perform multiple roles, none more so than Tom Hanks and Hale Berry, who star in all six stories. It is utter fun to see the transformation in the various roles, and for that my hat off to Hale Berry and the make-up team as she truly looks amazingly different in her different roles, including being a German (read: caucasion) Jewish woman, and even better as an Asian old man (yes, man!). Just wow. Also noteworthy is Hugh Grant, who appears in 4 or 5 (I lost track after a while) widely varying roles. Of all the stories, I liked the one set in 2144 in \\"Neo Seoul\\" the best, as it brings a Blade Runner-reminding atmosphere and of course the Wachowskis are right at home in such a futuristic setting (not just the Matrix but check also Speed Racer).<br /><br />If you think that you are in for a neat little wrap-up of everything at the end of the almosr 3 hr. movie, you might be wrong. Just for that fact, I'd love to see an alternative \\"cut\\" of this movie, in which the six stories are not \\"blended\\", as they are in the movie. I read somewhere that the production cost alone of this movie was about $100 million, making it the most expensive \\"indie\\" movie ever (it was financed primarily out of Germany, believe it or not). No way this movie will come anywhere close to that number at the box office in the US. All that aside, this is by no means a \\"bad\\" movie. It is an interesting experiment in which the ambition is greater than the execution. Viewers beware.in the movie.

B0059XTUB8|2.0|Beyond the shadow of a doubt Michelle Williams is brilliant in her portrayal of Marilyn Monroe. The movie itself is so slow and plodding that that brilliance is wasted. I'm sorry but I've never understood the onscreen appeal of Kenneth Branagh (nor Laurence Olivier bar his roles in Marathon Man and Boys From Brazil--both with Nazi themes so Freudians have a field day with that). Sure, Branagh is a great Shakespearean actor but, sorry, I don't get him at all.<br /><br />The young lad who falls for Marilyn is also less than convincing in that crucial role.<br /><br />The DVD extra, for myself, was far more fascinating intersplicing actual clips from 1957 when the movie (The Prince And The Pauper) around which this movie is based was being filmed.

B000VIP5L0|5.0|I am way past the age of getting stoned at 51.  I smoked my last bowl when I was 24, if memory serves correctly before wisely giving it up.  But a youngster out just to drink a few brews and smoke a joint or two is a rite of passage for fans of rock, especially the heavier stuff.  Not that everybody does, but it is called stoner rock for a reason.<br />  I say all that to say this:  sometimes a band does music that recalls the murky days of vintage Sabbath and yet has its own sound that is done so well it makes you want to go out and buy a black light, some fine smoke, and kick back.  \\"Sleep's Holy Mountain\\" is one of those albums.  Matt Pike is one of the heaviest and amazing guitarists out there, his style all his own, and packs enough punch to knock out damn near anybody who dare cross his path.  \\"Dragonaut\\" opens with a fine swinging beat, \\"Some Grass\\" takes you to a still out in the back yard of your redneck cousin's house to light up and drink a little home brew, and of course the title track moves with all the grace and subtlety of a glacier.<br />  The sound is huge, and the cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Snowblind\\" is one of the most faithful covers ever.  Sleep has reformed but there is no word on whether they're just playing the occasional show or festival or whether Pike might try to juggle Sleep and High on Fire at the same time.  He has cleaned up and that would give him more energy.  Still, even if Sleep doesn't record, High on Fire is the logical extension of what they started, only heavier and faster.  It's great stuff from both bands.  Also, you must get \\"Dopesmoker\\" just to hear Sleep tackle a 63 minute tune and make it work.  It is a very interesting song/album and I like it as much as \\"Sleep's Holy Mountain\\".

B004LWZW7E|4.0|I can understand why some people did not like this movie but I loved it. It has a bit of a dopey premise that time is the new currency that can be used, traded or stolen. Even so I enjoyed Justin Timberland O'Lakes and Amanda \\"Big Love\\" Seyfried's chemistry onscreen. There's also gratuitous Leonard (from \\"The Big Bang Theory\\") as Justin's best friend, gratuitously evil Pete Campbell (from \\"Mad Men\\") as Amanda's dad and the coup de grace--Cillian Murphy playing yet another baddie. Well, actually he's a sort of time cop called a timekeeper, but they are cops basically there to protect the rich.<br /><br />The clock countdowns and then sudden deaths were shot well. The vacuousness of life for those rich enough to have thousands of years banked was very Gatsby-like. Loved the sound of the cars in the movie (trust me they have some futuristic zoom zoom feature) as well as the whole pseudo Dodge Charger meets Knight Rider look to the timekeeper's cars. The 2169 future was not all shiny and new but mostly concrete and more concrete. It worked for me.<br /><br />There were zero extras (other than trailers) on the DVD so that was a bit of a disappointment so my advice is just watch this on demand.

B007UPNA6Y|1.0|I am a great fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher and cannot wait for his new book every year. Unfortunately his youngest book did not make the grade for me. I found it boring and towards the middle of the book I just could not take it any more. Went to the back to see how it ended, and that was that.
0425263916|5.0|I have never written a review on any online purchases of mine. It has always seemed pointless. Bottom line is this book is beyond awesome. It is hands down one of the best books I have ever read. The love Eva and Gideon have is certainly undying. Although they have their troubles, their feelings for each other never waiver, they may stumble but the surely do not fall. Yes I have read 50 Shades of grey and chose to read Bared to you because of it. Bared to you was a little like 50 Shades only because of the relationship. Reflected in you was totally different. I loved it and I can not wait for the next one.  If you get this book, you will not regret it. You have my word.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|There's no way I could have given this album anything less than four stars.  Given Steely Dan's and Fagen's music in my life for going on forty years; there's no way this could ever score lower.  But five stars?  Sorry, I just can't do it.<br /><br />Overall, the album strikes me as too quiet, and slow.  And maybe droopy.  Before I even opened it, the album title and artwork had me thinking about global warming, the rise of the oceans, global catastrophe, and ultimately loss, lots of it.  At first it hit me as dark and cynical, even bitter (\\"dirge\\" kept coming to mind), but with more than 50 listens since I've gotten it (I pre-ordered, of course), this first impression has changed.<br /><br />It's the mentions of old guys, old hippies, old age, insecurity, loss of relevance and edge and stature--and a partner--due to physical and technical inadequacy.  There is some measure of happiness, with wisdom and hope in there, but it's tinged with what is likely going to be loss, not just a possibility, but more of an expectation.  Don, at a healthy 64 now cannot be blamed for exploring these issues, as they are already resonating with me at a mere 50.  It's kind of a downer.<br /><br />My favorite is \\"The Weather in My Head.\\" Some have ripped on this as a lightweight throwaway blues snoozer, but I really enjoy it.  I am very much hearing Deborah Coleman's [[ASIN:B000QMQOXY \\"My Heart Bleeds Blue\\"]] in this song, and distinct echoes of [[ASIN:B001EE4OZI \\"The Thrill Is Gone.\\"]]  I just wish the instrumental jam at the end of the song would go on for another ten minutes.<br /><br />I also enjoy \\"Miss Marlene.\\"  Honestly, this song is almost all [[ASIN:B001OB7RA0 \\"I.G.Y.\\"]]  The hook, the chorus, the horn punctuation, it's that same loping I.G.Y. shuffle.  But that's not a bad thing, not at all; I love that song (even that smarmy cover Howard Jones did).  At first I thought this song was a fun exercise in circumlocuting sexual arousal and congress, a la Michael Frank's [[ASIN:B006FXGXMA \\"Baseball,\\"]] but a dedicated listen to the lyrics shows it to be a smooth ode to failed love and its tragic consequences, with the strikes and spares filling as backstory.<br /><br />\\"I'm Not the Same Without You\\" has got me, not so much for the music but for its rhetorical composition.  What I thought initially was a defiantly whiny response to being dumped is really a testimony to all the good things flowing from the dumpage.  It gets even more positive as the song progresses, as the lucky schmuck is now becoming a superhuman.  It finally dawned on me: this breakup either has unleashed a powerful transformative force, the freedom and happiness allowing an unprecedented Olympian evolution, or it has shattered this poor dude's mind, and his litany of incredible improvement is pure delusion.  Or, he's just piling lie upon lie to cover up his agony.  The music is meh, but the story and its possible interpretations hooked me good.<br /><br />I'm not really a fan of \\"Memorabilia,\\" as the repeated word over and over just grates on me.  It's an interesting story of a guy who collects atomic test novelties and harkens back (again) to The Nightfly's [[ASIN:B001OB2IVS \\"New Frontier\\"]] and Cold War fascination with The Bomb.  I mean, when was the last time you heard a rock song referring to Pacific island nuclear testing, right down to specific shot code names?<br /><br />But alas, there is no [[ASIN:B00122KLZE \\"Godwhacker\\"]] in this album.  There is no [[ASIN:B00122B6EY \\"H Gang.\\"]] There isn't that one track that opens with that instantly hooky, perfectly produced thrum, and then just launches into a song you'll never get out of your head.  I kept listening for it, that one track, but it's not here.  The \\"Out of the Ghetto\\" cover is the one seriously up-tempo tune, but despite being a clear homage to Isaac Hayes, its archaic 70s throwback terminology relegates it to also-ran.<br /><br />Bottom line: it's a Fagen album, so I will listen to it a lot, and I'll treasure it as I have all the others, and it will grow on me in the years to come, as all of the others have.  But it's kinda slow, kinda dark and overall not really that happy, which is a bit of a disappointment, but I realize is also highly reflective of the artist, where he's been and where he's at.e it as I have all the others, and it will grow on me in the years to come, as all of the others have.

B005LAIIA8|5.0|Our children, ages 6 (daughter) and 9 (son), are typically scared or upset fairly easily.  My son generally shields himself from upsetting or frightening things by covering his eyes and ears or walking out of the room.  Our daughter usually tries to be brave, but regrets it and has nightmares.  For example, the Disney version of &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; is way too much for them to endure.  However, even certain &#34;tense&#34; portions of otherwise harmless fare such as the Tinkerbell films can cause them concern.  (Not sure why... they are just really sensitive that way.)<br /><br />At any rate, we thought for sure that this film would be a &#34;no go&#34; for our kids because of the themes surrounding the death of the young boy's dog, as well as the &#34;monster-like&#34; animals brought back to life and the overall creepy vibe of the film.  However, while at a recent trip to Disneyland, we took them into a special Tim Burton/Frankenweenie exhibit which gave an overview of the film and showed some of the sets used in the actual picture.  To our surprise, our kids expressed interest in seeing the movie.  Because our son especially loves stop-motion films and even makes his own, we thought we may try to go ahead and take the kids.<br /><br />Anyway, to skip to the punch line... OUR KIDS ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  In fact, it's all they talked about for the next week.  They were not frightened or upset by it at all.  It is not overly creepy or macabre, neither is it a horror film on any level.  Still, I was unprepared for how much of a liking our children took to it.  Maybe seeing the sets in person, and being aware of some of the behind the scenes stories helped.  However, I can say that this movie has TONS of heart.  And, it is absolutely a modern day classic.  In fact, my wife and I enjoyed the film as much as (or more than) the kids because of how well it is made along with the fun references to other classic films.  (How many can you pick out?)  :-)<br /><br />Seriously, this is one of the best films we have seen in a long time.  It's a shame it didn't do as well as it should have at the box office.  However, we're certain that it will find a following on video.  It is an absolutely charming film, impeccably crafted, and infused with tons of heart and soul.  It is certainly a piece of work the filmmakers should be proud of.  And, it is definitely a gift to audiences around the world.<br /><br />We give it our HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.

032147404X|4.0|This book is written in a friendly conversational style, with jokes in the beginning of each chapter followed by great photography tips. It is targeted for beginners in the photography field, but intermediate users could also glean information from this book.<br /><br />This book should not be considered a comprehensive photography manual - it is more of a light instruction book. The book is filled with many tips, which could lead to information overload for beginners - photography is a comprehensive field that requires practice and patience for that great shot.

B008FSCNTK|5.0|It's not that revolutionary self-betrayal like Dylan's \\" Highway 61 Revisited\\" or Davis's \\" Bitches Brew\\". She gave a pattern of change in fresh direction, not stereotypical at all. So my judgement on this new album is simply \\" Alright, Ms Krall~ You always give me some inspiration.\\" It's like \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\"  meets T Bone Burnett's guitar-work with voice of Krall, then made some new exciting 45 rpm donuts for jukebox of tavern. If you stubborn pocus only on cocktails of her old jazz-lounge, well you better find some new pompous luxurious 5 star Hotel.

B007MDB548|5.0|Wow!  This must be the best direct-to-video movie we've ever seen.  I sat down with the kids to watch what was only supposed to be a few minutes of this film the other night.  However, I couldn't pull myself away and ended viewing the entire movie with them, complete with a lump in the throat and a smile on my face at the end.  To sum up my experience in a trite phrase, \\"I laughed, I cried, it moved me\\".  :-)<br /><br />Seriously, I was not expecting much from this film.  I got it because my daughter (age 7) and son (age 9) really enjoyed the other Tinkerbell movies, which we own.  However, I never expected to enjoy it myself, as an adult.  I was greatly mistaken.  In fact, our kids are watching it again (for about the 8th time) with their aunt and uncle (who are also enjoying it very much).<br /><br />Another quick note...  We purchased the 3D/Blu-ray/DVD package.  I can definitively say that the picture quality on the blu-ray is breathtaking!  Additionally, the 3D is amazing!  Definitely a great 3D disc to have if you're looking for more family films to add to your library.<br /><br />Needless to say, this was a great purchase.  I know this movie will be in heavy rotation in our home for years to come.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />P.S.  I read that some people might be concerned about possible \\"environmental\\" overtones in this film.  Look, I'm politically conservative and am sensitive to outright propaganda, but that is just nowhere in this film.  If someone finds it in this movie, they are probably either ultra sensitive or really, really reaching.  This is just a terrifically fun film for the entire family, with a refreshingly original story-line, and is very moving to boot!  Enjoy!  :-)
1442444053|5.0|This book is beautiful!! The type is large and clear. A wonderful introduction from Richard Adams tells us how the story was born. Wonderful art shows itself through out. The front cover almost feels like smooth leather, even though it is not. Full color picture on the front, on the spine, wonderful words of wisdom from the story on the back cover. No words can describe how beautiful this book is. If you're a fan of the story get it...don't even think about it. If you're just a lover of beautiful books for your library get it. This is wonderful and I can't wait to go on the journey once again with this wonderful band of rabbits. I can remember when Peter Benchley re released Jaws about a year before his death, in an introduction he told how Jaws never made it to number one on the NYT, because as he put it: \\"a man name Adams wrote this book about these pesky rabbits that just wouldn't budge to let me get to number one.\\" Tells you everything you need to know about this book. BTW it is not a story for young children. I would say age 11 and up, there is some violence and blood due to battles the Rabbits have. Would be a wonderful Holiday gift. And the price for this is FANTASTIC! So beautiful. It will go on the shelf with my other leather bound favorites. It's a good investment. One leather bound book I purchased on here for $20.00 two years ago is no longer available and is selling second hand for $1,000.00. Never know what could happen with this.  Oh go on, you know you want to, go for it...you only live this life once.

B003QI95Y0|5.0|From Beale Street to Oblivion is the eighth full-length studio album by rock band Clutch released in 2007.<br /><br />The album title comes from a line in the song \\"The Devil & Me\\", and is named after the real Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee.<br /><br />Clutch<br />Neil Fallon...Vocal and Guitar<br />Tim Sult...Guitars<br />Mick Schauer..Hammond B3, Piano and Hohner Clavinet<br />Dan Maines...Bass<br />JP Gaster...Drums and Percussion<br /><br />Additional musicians<br />Bryan Hinkley...Guitars on tracks 4 and 12<br />Eric Oblander...Harmonica on tracks 6, 11 and 12<br /><br />As usual the lyrics are excellent and Neil Fallon's delivery is so commanding and aggressive yet always on the hypnotizing side. I read...<br /><br />\\"Neil Fallon's pissed-off trucker vocals are as, well, ballsy as ever (if you want emo-boy whining you've come to the wrong place, buster).\\"<br /><br />This is one serious boogie rock album at its best. JP Gastor is one fantastic drummer and Tim Sult's unique style is so refreshing, he is constantly mixing it up going off in a million directions in every song. Heavy on wah-wah and distortion, I love it. Dan Maines' bass lines throughout the album are constantly over dominant the way they should be. I believe Clutch have created a music genre and style all of their own that no other band out there can match.<br /><br />\\"Every track is listenable, and they're all worthy of their inclusion on this album. I highly recommend this album to everyone. If you want some good-time rock that isn't afraid to show you a few surprises, then this is for you. And even if that's not what you want, try it anyway - given the chance, From Beale Street to Oblivion will show you that rock doesn't have to be straight-laced, serious and concerned with the mainstream to be good.\\"<br /><br />For previews of music and videos not available on Amazon, check out Clutch's \\"From Beale Street to Oblivion\\" on You Tube.

B0006A9FKA|3.0|Edgar Wright's cult classic Shaun of the Dead follows the titular Shaun (Simon Pegg), a nice salesman who feels as though his life is going nowhere. His girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) is disappointed in his lack of ambition. Shaun's best friend Ed (Nick Frost) epitomizes this arrested development. Ed's simian humor (he literally imitates gorillas) amuses Shaun to no end, but leaves their other roommate, Shaun's girlfriend, and her judgmental roommates Diane and Dylan (Lucy Davis and Dylan Moran) cold.<br /><br />In the midst of his personal problems, Shaun finds himself in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Is this his chance to find his inner strength and get his life together? That is, if he survives?<br /><br />This comedy has amusing and surreal moments of silliness and satire, but its humor isn't for everyone. For those whose funny bone it doesn't strike, the film's strength comes from its metaphors. Shaun feels stuck in his routines, held back and a little dead inside--not unlike a zombie. In fact, the drones populating the city of London already resemble the living dead. Shaun is so oblivious to his fellow humans and the world around him, he hardly realizes an epidemic is upon them.<br /><br />Our hero's journey from overlooked \\"loser\\" to courageous leader is also satisfying. He finds himself torn between the well-intended but prepubescent friend of his youth and his girlfriend's affections. This is as much a relationship film as it is a horror movie.<br /><br />There are some bloody moments, though. Horror and horror-spoof fans will enjoy watching the nonplussed Shaun and his best mate battle zombies. Others might find the film diverting but not particularly memorable. Many might connect to a man in his thirties who is trying to find himself--zombie infestation or no.

B008QLXSG8|4.0|Camus was the guiding hero of the protagonist in \\"You Deserve Nothing\\"a recently read and reviewed novel , I was invigorated to pick up Camus' masterpiece \\"The Stranger\\".Years past Ive read plenty of Sarte and the leading biography of his life, which included enticing descriptions and anecdotes of his fellow existentialists Albert Camus's \\"The Stranger'.<br />Unlike French Surrealistic painting French Existentialism in literature has not survived our ever maturing collective scrutiny so very well.The layering in of post modern culture in the following 60 years recontextualizes much of French existentialist novelists and authors and their weighty tomes (Foucault)as self indulgent if not a bit comic. On the other hand French Existential poets of the period are as potent as ever ie:Baudelere 'Flowers of Evil\\".<br />I am one who believes that writers & artists drive the ebb and flow of our deepest awareness.French existentialism ,so revered on campus in the fifties and sixties, has just not held up to the evolving scope of conciousness to the present. where as German existentialist have transcended the decades nicely(Freidrich Nietzche).<br />\\"The Stranger\\" appears on 'greatest' book list of the twentieth century often and as the favorite book of many notable thinkers.I was prepared for an unforgettable read.It is spare and precise piece of writing which is at once a descriptive atmospheric tale,and philosophical text .The Author is careful and dettached as he leads his protagonist through a gauntlet of apparently unasuming harmless if not accidental events which accelerate into doom.Along the way however he reveals an abiding indifference to his own fate ,effectively characterizes the classic French existential anti-hero.Mssr Camus's portrayal of hapless events in the life of his unfeeling misanthrope is nothing less than a warning; an inevtable outcome which awaits all who indulge the promise of romanticism.<br />The setting ,North Africa 1944 ,is a slice life woven well into the story and gives the reader insight to the symbiosis of Arabs and French.Ironically same place and time approximately,just a few miles up the road and a flipped page or two of the calander ,the Americn film director Michael Curtiz was making \\"Casablanca\\" featuring the true grit Americn romantic Hero Humprey Bogart.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case protect my fire in every aspect, the only bad thing is it's easy to get fingerprint on it, and it cannot support the fire stable. My suggestion actually is to save the money and take another kindle5 for reading.

B003VDY7XE|5.0|Great show with interesting characters. Each episode a different storyline, yet all are connected. Watched Season 2 already. Definitely recommend.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband to replace his Swiss Army Knife that he's had for years.  In his words, what he likes most are the spring loaded pliers, easy pull-out of the tools, and comfortable grip.  He was originally considering a Leatherman model, but these features are what sold it for him.  The tools lock in place, so they're not going pop-out or close unknowingly on you.  One thing that could be better is the Phillip's head screwdriver.  It's more flattened than a standard Phillip's head, but still gets the job done.  It's not a complete replacement for the Swiss Army Knife, but it's a decent multi-tool that for what it does do, does a good job.

B00138EVDK|5.0|Coming up with a title for a review can be tricky.  I thought about it for a while and came up with the \\"Top 10 of all time?\\" title because that best explains my thoughts on the album.<br /><br />This album came out in 1976, when I was 11 years old.  Back then I was infatuated with \\"Carry on Wayward Son\\", but really didn't appreciate the rest of the album.  Your average 11 year old doesn't appreciate the orchestration, the writing, the originality or the shear talent involved in an album such as this.  By my late teens I appreciated the album much more.  Now, 36 years after its release, it somewhat boggles my mind at how much I still LOVE this album!  The staying power it has is simply amazing.  I can't add much more to what's already been said in previous reviews other than to say that to me, this is and always will be among the top 10 rock albums of all time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is really fun.  I love it and my kids love it! I recommend it to everyone! It gets addicting! Lol
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This has been a favorite Christmas movie ever since it came out several years ago.  It's one of the few Christmas movies where the true spirit of Christmas really comes to life through the eyes of a child.  The Blu-ray version just makes it that much better.  The crisp, clear picture makes the train ride adventure to the North Pole really come to life.  A must see if you're wanting to recapture the true essence of Christmas!
B004KSQN7C|4.0|With a catalogue of seven albums to her name, Britney Spears has established herself as a solid pop artist. By now, fans know what to expect from a Britney album: catchy, fun songs and sometimes the occasional hint of something deeper. Britney is not known for her songwriting depth, yet considering the type of music she sets out to make, that is never a problem. By now, Britney has long since proven herself as capable of delivering solid pop albums. Femme Fatale proves to be no exception, showing Britney at her most confident since her well-publicized breakdown. Although she's never been known for being a powerful vocalist, Britney has mastered the ability to work within her limits to deliver strong, catchy tracks. On this release, Britney branched out more than on her previous albums to work with a wider variety of producers. For the most part, her risks paid off, with some of these new collaborators bringing out her best work. At the time of its release, Britney commented that she had put her heart and soul into the album, and stated that it was an album for the fans. Aside from a couple of missteps, the quality she delivers here certainly shows this.<br /><br />\\"Til The World Ends\\" sets the tone for the album immediately, and proves to be one of Britney's strongest recent tracks. Although the chorus is quite lacking in proper lyrics, the verses are strong. Britney sounds confident, which suits the upbeat track very well. The bridge is a particular strength. This is a brilliant start to what is commonly referred to as Britney's comeback album, and shows her at her finest. \\"Hold It Against Me\\" keeps the momentum going, and marks another of Britney's stronger singles. Co-penned by the very talented Bonnie McKee, this is an excellent dance track that once again showcases an assertive Britney. This song is masterfully crafted to allow Britney a chance to shine. Despite the powerful production, it works with Britney's delivery rather than competing with her for dominance. \\"Inside Out\\" is more of a hit-or-miss track, mostly due to the chorus. In this song, Britney half sings and half speaks the verses about having one last intimate encounter with a lover before they split up. The chorus is a little bland, however that has more to do with the production than the lyrics. The lyrical references to Britney's earliest hits are a nice touch. It's far from a bad track, however it does not live up to the standard set by the first two. \\"I Wanna Go\\", on the other hand, brings the quality back up with Britney singing about losing all her inhibitions, as well as some subtle references to her issues in the media. Some fans may dislike the stutter-y delivery of some of the lyrics, which at times sounds awkward (especially her delivery of the word \\"uncontrollably\\" just before the three-minute mark). However, overall it is another fun, catchy track although not Britney's best work.<br /><br />\\"How I Roll\\" is one of the weaker tracks, and a rare misstep for songwriter Bonnie McKee, although the sheer number of songwriters may have more to do with that. The track is generally underwhelming, with mediocre lyrics (\\"I got nine lives like a kitty cat\\"), and an even more mediocre delivery. Here, Britney attempts a softer, more breathy style of singing however it does not suit the track very well. There is also too much going on at once with the production for such an otherwise simple song, making it more distracting than anything. \\"(Drop Dead) Beautiful\\" picks things up once again, with Britney once again taking on a more confident approach. The chorus does get repetitive at times, which can be irritating. Guest rapper Sabi delivers a good verse, although the auto-tune on her part is a bit too much. This is far from Britney's best song, but it is a strong addition to the album.  \\"Seal It With a Kiss\\" is a true highlight, helmed by long-time collaborator Max Martin as well as Dr. Luke, both of whom know how to bring out Britney's best. Although the chorus is extremely simple and repetitive, it suits the song quite well, and is balanced out by the rather strong verses. The song is really made a strength by Britney's delivery. \\"Big Fat Bass\\" is another hit-or-miss track. Although it has some very strong moments throughout, the overall track is generally underwhelming. Britney holds her own quite well against will.i.am's production, however one of its biggest problems is that it drags on for far too long. Some listeners have also been put off by the lyrics, which appear to be a thinly veiled metaphor. It is not really a weak track, however it ends up being unmemorable in the long run.<br /><br />\\"Trouble for Me\\" is another of the album's less memorable tracks, although it is an enjoyable enough listen as the album plays through. Unlike other songs offered on this album, this one actually has a stronger chorus than verses. This is also one of the few songs where the auto-tuning of Britney's voice seems most apparent, largely because it is not used to create a necessary effect like it is in other tracks. This track is, at best, solid filler.  \\"Trip to Your Heart\\", on the other hand, is a risk that pays off. Britney once again takes on a softer vocal approach over a strong beat, which works incredibly well. This is an unexpected gem of the album, and showcases another side to Britney's abilities. The only weak patch of the song is when Britney starts listing \\"trip to your...\\" and naming various parts, since this gets repetitive and seems unnecessary. Luckily, that segment is quite short and listeners are quickly brought back to the strengths of the rest of the track. This is one of Britney's most creative tracks, and it works in her favour. \\"Gasoline\\" is another strong track that showcases all of Britney's strengths. Here, Britney uses gasoline as a metaphor to describe her partner setting her heart on fire. Despite being a strong track, it is not one of the more memorable songs that the album has to offer. It is certainly a welcome addition to the album, and definitely a grower. \\"Criminal\\" is another of the album's highlights, despite how songs about loving thugs or bad boys tend to sound contrived, regardless of who is singing them. Surprisingly enough, Britney manages to pull it off rather convincingly. This track once again proves how long-time collaborator Max Martin can truly get Britney to shine. This song also has a very different style compared to the rest of the album, making it a very refreshing change. Britney once again sounds confident in her delivery, which really helps to make it believable.<br /><br />The deluxe version of the album includes four bonus tracks. The first, \\"Up N Down\\", is one of the few tracks where the production almost overshadows Britney. Nevertheless, she holds her own well enough to make it a strong track that makes the deluxe worthwhile. The lyrics border on a double entendre, as they describe Britney asking a man to watch her as she dances. This is an excellent club song, and another album highlight. \\"He About to Lose Me\\" is by far the best track that this album has to offer, and it alone makes the deluxe version well worth the additional cost. This is one of the rare tracks where there do not appear to be any modifications to Britney's voice, and she actually sounds quite good. This song has Britney contemplating cheating on her boyfriend, commenting that he doesn't realize that he's about to lose her. The lyrics are quite strong, and this song shows that Britney truly can sing (albeit with limited range). \\"Selfish\\", in contrast, is one of the album's weakest offerings. Although it gets off to a strong start, it gets dragged down by the incredibly weak chorus and especially Britney's odd pronunciation of \\"selfish\\". The verses are decent enough that the song remains mostly tolerable; however with a weak bridge and even weaker chorus, it does not save the track. There is much better elsewhere on the album. Album closer \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\" is an out-of-place rock-tinged track that is rather mediocre all around. Britney does not quite have the voice to pull it off, and it is again the chorus that drags it down. The track does not really fit the style of the rest of the album, and was certainly not the best choice to end things with.<br /><br />Overall Mark: 4/5<br /><br />As a comeback album, Femme Fatale certainly achieves what it sets out to do. Britney sounds confident throughout, and it's evident that she enjoyed making the album. She took more risks than usual, mostly through trying different producers. Although this did not always work in her favour, it at least demonstrates an interest in expanding her sound. Britney has never been one to deviate too far from her signature sound, but she has repeatedly proven that she can make consistent, enjoyable pop albums. At this point of her career, no one expects any incredible vocal feats nor much lyrical depth, so complaints to that effect are rather pointless. Britney's albums are not artful masterpieces to be taken too seriously, nor are they the soulful, personal efforts of her contemporaries. Nonetheless, she fills the niche for music that is sheer fun, and has certainly learned how to work within her limits to deliver strong music.
0545265355|5.0|I love these books, and really wanted a hardcover, boxed set to add to my bookshelves. They are in perfect condition and are exactly what I was looking for!
B004HYXW1O|5.0|I always listen to any new artist ( new to me ) at least 4 or 5 times before forming an opinion. I will tell you I enjoy their work very much and have probably listened to this album 20+ times. And have now purchased 2 more of their albums. Excellent songs and storytelling. So if you buy this I don't think you will be disappointed.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I just loved this movie.  Special effects were great and story line was good.<br />I highly recommend this movie to everyone who loves superheros.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is an excellent book.  Very well written and it really draws the reader in to a Spanish way of thinking.  Without realizing it, the reader gets a much better view of Spanish Culture.  I read it on my Kindle and liked it so much I had to order a paper copy.  I got a used copy that was in excellent condition.  I plan to use it as a walking guide to Barcelona next year.  It even has a suggested route in the back which was not obvious on the Kindle.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Wall-E is a kid-friendly, environmentally spirited tale of a lone robot who goes about his days stacking trash until he meets up with a futuristic robot named Eve.  He can't help but fall for her.  The comedic-romantic plot centers around these two as they lead a group of space-bound humans home after nearly 700 years to repopulate the newly revived Earth.  The Blu-ray version just makes it that much better with its crisp, clear illustrations.  A must-see for any 3-year-old robot lover!
0525952926|5.0|The latest installment of  Ken Follett's \\"The Century\\" trilogy, \\"Winter of the World,\\" by was a great read.  IThe book, about 950 pages was hard to put down, like Fall of Giants.  I can't wait for the third installment.  These books have wonderful characters who are very well realized.  You want to be there with them.  Highly recommended.[[ASIN:0525952926 Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy]]
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Totally awesome. Can't wait for more games like this.  Never got bored &amp; just couldn't wait to get to the next seen.
0439023491|5.0|Sequels can be hard - especially when they follow a hugely successful story. Catching Fire does everything a good sequel should. It picks up after the somewhat happy ending of the previous story and raises the stakes. There are consequences and now we're going to have to deal with them. This builds toward the inevitable and epic conclusion that will take place in Book 3.<br /><br />At the end of The Hunger Games, we had hopes for Katniss. She had defied the odds and managed to survive. Now she can have hope of a future - maybe even a little happiness. In Catching Fire we go along the journey with her, realising that none of this is as simple as we thought it was. Sometimes victory can be the greater defeat.<br /><br />There was good use of subtle foreshadowing on this book, so when the big surprise ending comes, it's not at all jarring. It makes sense.<br /><br />This story is an emotional roller coasting of raising and falling hopes. There are new twists which keep everything fresh. It all comes together in a very satisfying end, which opens the way very well into the next book.
B008XG1X18|3.0|this app doesn't always load! please fix! if errors were fixed could be a great app! love pinterest on ipad but not kindle!
B0086700CM|4.0|cool game. I really like the characters and the fact that they are faster than the next. I also like the different power ups.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Am a big fan of SAMCRO, so added this to my collection at a huge discount.  Item was received quickly without any problems and in excellent condition!<br />Thanks!
B000G6R7B8|1.0|I liked the way the watched look on the screen and that is why I bought it.<br /><br />Unfortunatley, the watch did not work upon receipt. It stopped frequently, and randomly the first 12 hours. The watch had been well wound. The limited instruction set, properly and dutifully followed. I am waiting on verification of refund. I do not want to and cannot generalize on my experience regarding this item. I only register my experience, and therefore the title of my review.<br /><br />A. L
B00006L6YG|4.0|Got a Oppo universal player.  Started reading about super audio CDs, and it was intriguing.  If you happen to be looking for a full catalog of SACDs check out sa-cd.net<br /><br />This disc was highly recommended.  At such a cheap price compared to many titles out on the market, it was easy to pull the trigger, and give it a listen.  Verdict, that was $13 dollars well spent!  This sounds fantastic.  The music is smooth, and very relaxing.  Definitely will be looking for some more Getz Gilberto and jazz releases.  I remember as a kid hearing the song The Girl from Ipanema.  Never knew the title or the artist, as a kid you don't really pay attention to such things.  But when it started playing, that just brought a grin to my face.<br /><br />Only reason for not giving 5 stars, this is SACD only; it will not play in a normal CD player.  Their is a hybrid version of this disc, but it is silly expensive ($100+).
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is addictive. Quality graphics, happy music. Would like to have had more detailed instruction in the tutorial, however. Can't wait to get home from work to play - you never know what will challenge you next.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is exciting and tons of fun once you get the hang of it. You'll be addicted before you know it!
B0094OLFUW|1.0|Yep. Bummer.<br /><br />Wow, I'm amazed how there can be so little to remember from a full album.  There is nothing new or interesting in Coexist. Each track sounds like an intro without an actual song following it.
B009JNQ86Y|5.0|This album doesn't disappoint. After loving Ellie's \\"Lights\\" album I bought this on the first day it was released. Very different sound than \\"Lights\\", but just as amazing. It grows on me every time I listen to it. I can't wait to see her live on her upcoming U.S. tour.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its a good app but has dome glitches. I have had to restart the app a few times but, is the best of the apps I have.

B0087HT36U|5.0|Wow,this app is awesome!  I really enjoy spending hours trying to figure out ways to defeat the characters.  I really find it challenging but frustrating at the same time.  The only thing that would make it more enjoyable is if there were more levels that were available without having to jump through hoops.  Other than that it is great.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|fun game. lots of levels to play. star system encourages you to play more. works fine on asus transformer. thanks.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|So I was looking at the app details.  The version on Amazon app store is 1.6.3 and was an update to the version that was available when this was the FAOTD.  This is when they broke compatibility with pretty much every android device out there as far as I can tell from all the new reviews and comments.  The other place you get apps from (G) has version 1.6.2 which shows compatible with all 4 of the android devices on my account.  Looks like they decided they didn't want so many people to be able to play for free anymore and have stopped supporting this game on the Amazon app store.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Very awesome installment to the movies! I loved it very much! I think I might like this one the most so far.
B005LAIHZE|1.0|I loved this book. I'm not really crazy about vampires, but I loved this book. I went into the movie aware that the books are always better than the movies and fully expecting it. I still expected SOMETHING from the book to make it into the movie though. Everything that I loved about it somehow did not make it into the movie. Instead, it was all replaced by flashy action sequences. I debated giving this 2 stars just because some of the action scenes were pretty cool. But my husband who had not read the book said they made no sense whatsoever, so I couldn't do it. Don't buy this movie.
B000VFY7H6|5.0|Eleventh in the Jack Reacher suspense series. This one takes place in L.A.<br /><br />My Take<br />Oh. This is such a sad one. So many losses.<br /><br />I found it interesting that Child is allowing Jack to age and start to question what he's doing. This makes it so real. I've been wondering if/when Jack might start to wonder what's happening in and with his life and I love that Child is taking it so slow.<br /><br />It's funny, too, how out of touch he is with modern technology, especially his use of a cell phone. Not knowing about flash drives. He's got the math down. He's a bit of a savant with numbers. He knows people. How they think, how they act. It's fascinating to read how he and Neagley try to figure out what Franz's password is for his computer. No real surprise when they do determine it. He has the respect of his peers.<br /><br />My first reaction is always to cooperate with the police. Good thing that's not how Reacher and his team think.<br /><br />Too funny. Karla and Reacher's big secret that everyone knows.<br /><br />Lord, they are a brutal bunch who aren't afraid to take matters into their own hands. Cops everywhere would envy them this freedom! Although it's a bit frightening to think of less upright people doing the same things.<br /><br />There are a number of reason I love this series. Reacher's sense of fair play and his willingness to ensure it. His intelligence with numbers and figuring events and people's directions. The loyalty he feels and that others feel for him. I do enjoy his lifestyle. It wouldn't be for me, but it certainly makes it easy for Child to \\"play\\" anywhere. I love how he figures out the impossible.<br /><br />The Story<br />That ATM card ends up being useful when it conveys a secret code that only a fellow MP could understand. It's a 10-30 and Jack is quick to sort through the possibilities.<br /><br />He meets up with Neagley in L.A.--both of them having figured out exactly where to find each other. Where they worry about why they haven't heard from the other six. Why Franz didn't contact at least Neagley. If he contacted all the others.<br /><br />They haven't much to start with, but Reacher's way of getting inside someone's head stands them in good stead. It's how he taught Neagley, how he taught the others, and they were the best.<br /><br />If they were the best, how did the bad guys get the jump on them?<br /><br />The Characters<br />Jack Reacher is almost broke, just a few hundred dollars left in his bank account. With the aftereffects of 9/11, he's had to start carrying identification AND an ATM card. I do love his method for creating his PIN.<br /><br />Frances L. Neagley is his former sergeant. She's now a partner in a big firm in Chicago and desperate to get in touch with Jack. They last partnered up in Without Fail four years ago.<br /><br />The nine of them had been part of a special investigations unit in the military. One that Reacher had created. Their motto was You do not mess with the special investigators. Calvin Franz is the reason they're gathering. To find his murderers. Angela Franz is his widow and they have a young son, Charlie. The others from the old unit are Tony Swan who is assistant director of corporate security for a defense firm, Jorge Sanchez (Milena is his girlfriend) and Manuel Orozco (married with three kids) work security in Las Vegas, David O'Donnell is a private detective in D.C., and Karla Dixon does forensic accounting investigation in New York. Stan Lowrey died years ago in Montana.<br /><br />Thomas Brant is one of the men watching Neagley. Curtis Mauney is his boss with the LA County Sheriff's Department. Azhari Mahmoud is the pivot. Diana Bond works for a jerk of a senator who is on the House Defense Committee.<br /><br />New Age Defense Systems<br />Margaret Berenson is in charge of Human Resources while Edward Dean is the current quality control manager. Allen Lamaison is the head of security; Swan, Lennox, Parker, and Saropian workfor him.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is a quarter of a red-on-red target transposed on top of a textured cement wall. with the title in an embossed silver and the author's name in an embossed white.<br /><br />The title doesn't come close to events.

1400069289|4.0|I've been on a bit of a fetish with these books about how your mind works recently. This one has been my latest read in the genre, and it was also insightful and good like the rest, though they are starting to get a bit repetitive. This discusses humans as a \\"collection of habits\\" and gives many examples through life and business about how understanding these habits and how they work can enable you to more effectively take control, or at least understand them, and more importantly, why you do what you do. It poses most habits as a loop: a cue (which is an event that leads to a mental craving), a routine (which is the action), and a reward (which is the end result). I feel sometimes that Duhigg forces the habit into this structure, even where it doesn't really fit, but it is nice to have some sort of consistency, which helps in understanding his points.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|It's the classic story of a hero who arrives in a strange world and is bound to become the king even if he doesn't necessarily wishes so. You see it in the character of Aragorn in \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" and even with the character that Matt Damon plays in \\"Good Will Hunting\\". A man that others want to look up to. A man that others want to follow. But that man doesn't want it. That man is not ready for it. But in the end, he will become what he was born to be. Or destined. That concept always is a winner. And it is here too. It sure is a bit \\"cheezy\\" but it is done with good intentions. The creators really wanted to do a genuine good film. It's easy to see. For that, you feel compelled to appreciate the efforts.<br /><br />You also feel like you want to forgive the quality of the special effects. This movie looks like an expensive B-Movie. You don't believe for a minute what you are seeing but what the heck, it's done with good intentions and with passion. So you choose to believe it and have fun. But just like all B-Movies, i couldn't help wondering what Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott would have done with it, with all of their talents, power and money. That's the curse of all B-Movies, i suppose.<br /><br />Jim Caviezel is perfect in the role and so is the other actors and actresses. The only two complaints i have, even if it's a B-Movie and even if i really want to appreciate the efforts and passion, well my two complaints are with the make-up (the characters look a tad too \\"modern\\" for what you expect people from that period to look like) and the cliches (there are too many to make a list but let's just say that you always guess what's going to happen). But even within those cliches, i thought some of the story arcs were pretty interesting, like for instance, the enemy from the other tribe battling along with our heroes in order to defeat the monsters. I would have prefered that the Ron Pearlman character survives and becomes some kind of an important member of the tribe, though. But hey, this is a genuine good B-Movie. If you don't expect much and if you go in with the proper expectations, you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />And a special note has to be given for the music. Geoff Zanelli, a clone of Hans Zimmer, one of his students rather, composed a hell of a score that is not original for one bit but that delivers nonetheless. You come out of it humming the main theme, wishing you'd be some sort of a hero yourself.<br /><br />A good note. Great B-Movie. Goes to show you what passion and good intentions can do.

B004SIPAJG|5.0|I owned this when it came out in VHS; time to upgrade and hopefully the new format will be viable for my kids, two and four years old, to watch and enjoy at some point in the future.<br /><br />I kid you not, I have no clue how many times I've watched this movie, I love it that much. Everytime I've seen it I come away with something different, find myself enchanted by the characters all over again, with their quirks, their humanity, their \\"bigger-than-lifeness\\", and who can't love a movie where the main character unravels and embraces the super-macho bullfighter's dance, the Paso Doble, with a freight train suddenly taking over the screen - how Freudian can you get?<br /><br />I cannot provide enough superlatives to attribute to this film, it's that good. Simple, sweet, lovely, and a sheer joy to watch. The dancing is wonderful - if you have a scintilla of appreciation for being able to move to music then watch this movie and wish you were Paul Mercurio.
0987300911|5.0|I bought it for my first IELTS. It is very useful to understand what I should do in the exam. I am really lucky I could meet this book just after starting IELTS preparation, or I whould have wasted time...
0767903862|4.0|What struck me most about this tale was the fact that it told of a totally different world than I knew about.  We all know of Melbourne and Syndey.  But Bryson traveled deep into Australia at Alice Springs and to the western corner at PErth and north into Darwin.<br /><br />These were areas that I was totally unaware of.  It gave me such a greater appreciate for the entire country and continent
B006LSZECO|1.0|I could not read the whole book for the first time ever.  I did not enjoy the topic at all, although it was nicely written. The two main characters were so sick that i could not stand reading it. Not my kind of book.
B0099G88BE|4.0|Of all the tribute albums of the last twenty years,this is by far the best! I would have given it 5 stars,except for two cuts. I'm sure Jon Lord is spinning in his grave after hearing the Flaming Lips version of \\"Smoke On The Water\\"! It sounds like someone just learning how to play keyboard on a $20 unit!<br /> And how does an iconinc band like Iron Maiden manage to not sound like themselves!While their version of \\"Space Trucking\\" is awesome,I had to look to see who was doing it!<br />All in all,a great album,just watch out for the Flaming Lips cut!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love this match three game - the way you move through the levels is much more fun than the last one.  Well worth 99 cents!
1423140605|5.0|I have been anxiously waiting for the release of the Mark of Athena. Rick Riordan yet again has written a wonderful, exciting book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty entertaining until you run out of coins. great app to pass the time. wish the games were worth less coins.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is the best game ever. I love it so much. I think every body should get Angry birds free
0312323867|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book as I did \\"Love the one you're with\\". I will definitely buy more og Giffin's books!
0761171703|5.0|This book is full of miraculous photographs of extraordinary dancers levitating magically in the midst of ordinary places. It also has inspiring accompanying text & quotes which further \\"illustrate\\" the love & wonder of the pictures. It would be a wonderful gift, especially, but not exclusively, for dance fans
B008D28HYS|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I am waiting for another update because I've done all the puzzles. Hopefully it will update soon.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|All the good reviews are true! definitely a must for a Taylor Fans!<br /><br />Stay Stay Stay is my absolute fav! :)
B00984668E|3.0|When I was first introduced to The Sword, Warp Riders had already been released.  I listened to songs from Age of Winters first, then Gods of the Earth.  I really liked what I heard, so I downloaded all three albums from Amazon, discovering the Warp Riders was a little different from the first two albums, but it was still enjoyable.  Iron Swan is one of my favorite songs, by any band.  So, naturally, I was supremely stoked about Apocryphon, and even though there were a few sampled bits on Youtube, I didn't want to listen because I really wanted to hear the album as a whole.<br /><br />Well, I was disappointed.  I feel like Apocryphon just doesn't rock, darn it.  I don't think I set the bar too high with my expectations.  I just don't feel there are any outstanding riffs, and there aren't any straight on fast rockers like on the other three albums.  Maybe it had something to do with signing on with Razor and Tie?  Maybe it was due to the loss of their drummer, Trivett Wingo, who pounded the skins so well on the first three albums.  I'm beginning to think Wingo leaving the band was like Mustaine leaving Metallica and Burton dying.  All the metal power was sucked straight out of them and they weren't the same since.  I hope that's not the case here.  I mean, everyone is entitled to make a ho-hum record.  Listening to this album twice, then going back and picking over some favorites from the older albums, it's no contest at all.  I know by the other reviews that so far, people really dig Apocryphon, and maybe I'll come around.<br /><br />But the original \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" these boys made may turn out to be impossible to top.
B009IU6N5Y|1.0|I had been looking forward to this movie for a long time and was really excited when I finally got to see it. It was the most disappointed I've been in a long time.<br /><br />The plot was just ridiculous(and I'm not talking about Abe hunting vampires). Every scene that wasn't just people standing around talking, and there were plenty of those, was insanely over the top cartoon style action and cgi. I spent half of the movie bored and the other half thinking \\"I know this is a vampire flick but they're not even trying to make the plot half way believable\\". I can't count the number of times that I was amazed at how bad the story and action scenes were.<br /><br />Seriously, arming the union army with silver bullets, silver canon balls, and silver bayonets? It would only take a couple hundred tons of silver. Not to mention that they were fighting super strong and super fast creatures that could turn to smoke and move around invisibly. That's one of the dozens of retarded plot point.<br /><br />I'd say this was the second worst vampire movie I've ever seen. Second only to Twilight which I was tricked into watching the first one because I didn't know what it was.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am getting used to the game and sometimes it is hard to put down, I am not much of a game player so this is a lot of fun
B0043CSBKM|5.0|Akira was one of the first anime's I remember seeing as a kid. I'm so happy to have this on Blu Ray.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|this is a fast moving, constantly changing story that never drags and keeps the reader interested and wanting to read on.
B006RXQ800|4.0|It was a pretty good movie except for one of the bar scenes where the prostitutes were<br />hanging around topless and another scene where there were several naked women in a bed<br />with Daniel Day-Lewis. The movie would have been just as good without this crap. This<br />isn't an appropriate movie you'd want your young children to watch.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The coin regeneration keeps me coming back more than any other game I've tried. Not tricky but fun! More words.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I was interested in reading a book by Oscar Wilde. This title intrigued me, or rather the description of the young man who wanted to always stay young and have the picture grow old. I haven't gotten very far into the book as yet, but appreciate the writing. Author is good with words.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the most awesomest app ever. It tells you all the info you need to know and more. It is wonderful to have on any day.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I loved this book!!! I couldnt put it down!!! Totally makes you think.I could see something like this actually happening. The twist and turns are amazing.
B0024FAG4Y|2.0|I liked this film when I first saw it at a movie house long long time ago and then I purchased this blu ray<br />but the picture quality of this blu ray is quite disappointing because I can't find any better picture quality<br />on this blu ray compared to any other DVDs.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|Dont expect for the graphics to be ps3, thats not what was done. It was simply cleaned up as the ps2 hardware was only able to handle so much. The game is great for hours of fun. if youre looking for non stop action look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a great fantasy induced game with a bit of myth creating, this is the one for you!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My son LOVES this game! Of all the games I've got for him, this is his his favorite by far! It is fast, and very similar to Mario Bros.  It keeps his  attention, but the best part is that it was free!!! It is better than all the games I have paid for!
1594135851|2.0|Was a gift and wasn't pleased to see that it was the large print edition. To much of a pain to return.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Having used the Google Reader on an Android smartphone for a couple of years, I've found gReader to be an excellent alternative on my Kindle Fire HD.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|The effects are dramatic and interesting to a degree, not frightening and lack some of the symbolism they could have added without much expense.  The editing is choppy and leaves many characters limited in description and depth.  Too bad, for the actors are good and deserve better.  Best thing I can say of the film is that the strongest and most layered characters are the leading women.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|So many great characters and a wonderful description of the  early 20th century. Cant wait to read more about Ethel and Billy in the next one.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Determined to Right an ancient wrong Harold starts out to mail a letter only to discover he can't just slip it in the box,he must go himself and as he walks he meets good people,he remembers meeting his now remote wife,the birth of their child,the long journey that set the stage for his walk and along the way he finds not only himself but the road ahead
B007NG93CK|3.0|Good story but some unlikely senarios distracted from story such as the visit to out of state by forensic anthro.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Scott creates a memorable sci fi classic. The blu ray was outstanding(4 disc set), and the special features can be enjoyed over time. I was disappointed with sacrificing character development for speeding the story along. Most of the characters were completely forgettable. Of the sci fi movies of the last few years this is far superior. Enjoy!
B003XDZMPY|5.0|it confortable and soft, i like the product and your sell through his page on web.<br />very thanks and my wife love it , it seem like the photo
006109594X|1.0|I was sold a bill of goods on this one. I was assured that this would be a fast-paced thriller in the mold of Clancy. This book plodded along with all the speed and grace of a drunken elephant. The characters were completely unbelievable and after reading a third of the book I could no longer take the lack of any character development and minimal plot development. Saying that the book contained characters is a stretch; they were caricatures, like something out of a Republican's wet dream. Everyone was perfect and wealthy, except the Democrat news media which just wanted to destroy America. I confess I couldn't finish this dreck.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you are a fan of this series why wouldn't you purchase this item?  Wonderful entertainment and laughs.  A great buy.
B0086700CM|5.0|This was a free download for my Kindle Fire.  I downloaded mainly for my 5 year old son.  It definitely occupies his time when I'm trying to do something else.  His dad likes it just as well.
B00932H7FW|5.0|Definitely one of the best offerings from any provider.  Thought provoking, clever and full of surprises.  All of the actors are great. Filming and editing are excellent. Highly recommended!
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I downloaded the free version from here (which turned out to be an older version); after the program updated itself through the developers' site, I found that even though it's nowhere close to Microsoft Office (it won't even change fonts like the online user's guide shows, nor will it let me print anything for some reason) the interface is decent and there's not a lot of clutter on the screen. The main problem I found is that to have the truest professional version of this program you have to  BUY the Windows-compatible suite (at £50 or roughly $120!) Let's face it, shall we? If we wanted to spend that kind of money, we wouldn't be looking at freeware, now would we?
B004UID2LC|5.0|I find this to be a great app, even when I don't have Wifi the vi<br />deos are great in quality
B00992CF6W|4.0|6.99 is a little much but the game is great. you get pretty much every thing you get on he computer.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Great Book!! A classic that will always be a fun read! If you have ever wondered where our ideas of pirates, adventure, treasure, and the high seas came from, they reside in this book.
B005PK58TI|5.0|Love this program! Jessica Lange is amazing. Her perfomances alone are worth the watch. Definitely not a family show, however. Season 2 promises to be even better!
0399236058|5.0|Great book for teaching your children the days of the week. My daughter loves this book! We used this great story for part of our lesson in week three with Starfall. The song at the back of the book is great too. We learned it very quickly and sing it together all the time. Great book!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|There was one twist after another. I was not at all disappointed. There was a couple times the story seemed to jump around, but it still kept me reading. Another great book by a great author.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I have heard about the book for years.  I didn't pick it up until after seeing the trailer on the big screen.  I loved the book.  I thought it was fresh and thorough.  I didn't set down the book and find that I had a lot of questions unanswered.  It filled me with many different and powerful emotions.  I am eager to see the movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was so excited to read the sequel to Bared To You!! The scenes in this book were hot and also very poignant to see what made up the characters. Obviously the sex scenes were hot and the vunerability of the characters heart breaking at times. Some of the character qualities are defintely fantasy, but isn't that the point to a book, to escape into someone else's reality. This series definitely lets you go to places that you might not go to in your \\"real life\\". This was a book that myself and my co-workers talked about alot!! Looking forward to the third installment.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Fans can debate and debate about the \\"best\\" Bowie album, and there's a lot of quality to choose from. I'm not going to join that debate, but I will say that \\"Scary Monsters\\" is my very favorite Bowie album. Maybe I was a bit too young when \\"Ziggy\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\" came out, and somehow \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\" didn't connect me with me right away (but they did many years later), but when \\"Scary Monsters\\" was released it just grabbed me. The songs, the amazing musicians that supported Bowie, the spectrum of sound that they all produced. This album was sheer magic. Bowie seemed engergized by these songs, and his supporting cast, and it shows. From Bowie originals to the uplifting verion of Tom Verlaine's \\"Kingdom Come\\" this album flowed brilliantly and gripped me intensely. It may not be treasured by every Bowie fan --- and in fact when I read a recent online forum discussing people's favorite Bowie albums, this one was rarely mentioned --- but for me, this one is very special.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|With some dystopian fiction, you get great plots. With others, you get interesting premises. Some offer up good characters. Howey does all three -- and does them masterfully!<br /><br />I picked these up because one of the folks I follow on Twitter said, &#34;If you liked the Hunger Games series, you'll love this one!&#34; He wasn't kidding. I've been loaning my Kindle version and recommending it to delighted friends.<br /><br />And the Wool series was good enough that I find myself reading a lot of Howey. Great stuff!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a fun and addicting app but if you want to build a house with a pig in its really hard to do so I think that you should be able to craft animals.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I didn't know what to expect.  The language of flowers? Maybe a lot of latin names?  It's turned out to be a great read.  Tatally recommend it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|loved the game seems so good and real that I loved it also that it is a search and find
B0091REZMW|5.0|an interesting new game that is always changing so there's more enjoyment than your typical game. I love hidden picture games and my kids love this 1 2!
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Austin Kleon doesn't romanticize, but he also doesn't paint a picture of struggle. He shows his readers a balanced, disciplined, but creative approach to being an artist. His muses have names, and he's not afraid to say them.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game i play it every day there is no problems with it you should get it it is worth the time
B005OT2YVA|2.0|I had so many issues with this movie I had to write a review- I NEVER write reviews but this was just so bad.<br /><br />1st the chick - The way Michael Bay portrays and films women in these movies totally sickens me, but he made it up in the first movie with the action and in the second with Megan's contribution during the fight scenes. It's so painfully obvious they only casted this girl because she was prettier than Megan- which isn't a good thing when it comes to quality. She was an okay actress but the relationship felt fake and she was completely useless throughout the whole thing. She was pretty much pushed and pulled throughout the whole movie!<br /><br />2nd thing- what is up with all these random try-to-be-funny scenes? They felt SO out of place- Mr. Wang is a good comedy actor but the script they gave him was so far from the story it wasn't funny at all. It was like trying to mix the Hangover with Black Hawk Down or something.  Nothing flowed like in the 1st and 2nd movie- it all felt forced and random.<br /><br />3rd- This was the biggest disappointment - barely any autobot scenes, a lot of stuck up human scenes. I don't know about you but the autobots is the whole reason I watched this series! Ugh,enough said.<br /><br />I feel so bad giving this movie only two stars but I couldn't bring myself to give it more. I LOVE Optimus Prime! I  LOVE Bumblebee! I LOVE the cars! I LOVE the action! But it just dragged soooo bad for 2 1/2 hours I only gave it 2...sad.
B00371V6SE|5.0|a must read, heartfelt and sad saying that it was a compelling, intriguing book, although I thought it ended too abruptly considering the first part of the book was more draw out.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My kids wanted to buy this since they like the movie so much. The movie quality is great. Price at Amazon was amazing, can't complain.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I loved this game on my computer and love it on my Kindle. Works great on Kindle Fire.  Whoo hoo!
B008XG1X18|3.0|i love this app and i really enjoyed looking at different things and i accidentally uninstalled it and now it wont let me redownload it and im really dissapointed because i want it back!!
B005LAII1C|5.0|SPOILERS are present!!!<br />---<br />---<br />---<br />---<br />---<br />As an English major, I'm prone to see the deeper meanings behind any piece of literature, any piece of text. The nostalgia within this film becomes painfully evident in the final moments of the film, first as John battles with his childhood insecurities (Ted) and ultimately gains the confidence to face his adulthood with Julie, and secondly, as Julie (the girl of his dreams) manages to repair John's childhood by making a wish that she had her life back, complete with John and John's intact/pain-free childhood (his stuffed friend). All is well in the end, as is to be expected for a man who is blessed with the true and honest love of a sincere woman. Take it from a man who's also wished for an absolute friend throughout the years of his life; any disability, physical, mental or perceived can make you feel awkward; we all need a Ted, we all need a Julie.<br /><br />Not an incredibly, uproariously funny film, but the humor of McFarlane and the surrealism is there, and it's an enjoyable flick which I will be buying in support of the man who gave us Family Guy. After all, Ted does sound A LITTLE like Peter Griffin....hehehehe...and Mila Kunis is an absolute knockout of a sweetheart. I think she's probably as pretty on the inside as she is on the outside. Too bad Meg Griffin isn't nearly so beautiful :P<br /><br />Kegan Mahon<br />University of Pittsburgh at Bradford (Bradford, PA)<br />---<br />For more magic-realism (where magic is taken as an occurrence within everyday life) or surrealism (where the narrator's mind is the one true reality, for the sake of the story), check out Lewis Carroll's ALICE IN WONDERLAND or Julio Cortazar's LETTERS TO A YOUNG LADY IN PARIS; both stories really gave me the insight to appreciate this film's deeper intentions.
B007I2BZIE|1.0|Long-time Rush fan here (30+ years), beginning with the first album and continuing on.  Regrettably, I have to say this release is GOD AWFUL.  It just goes from bad to worse.  For the life of me I cannot understand all of these high reviews.  For me, I find the songwriting to be extremely poor, not a memorable tune here.  The guitar work is unimaginative and very average.  I didn't dig Geddy's singing either -- he seems unable to write and deliver a good hook or melody.  The quality of the recording stinks too.  By today's standards (and those of yesteryear) this release is a complete an utter loser.<br /><br />Sorry guys, but this is THE WORST CD I have heard in years.  I want my money back!!!!!
B007L6VR12|5.0|The Indy style movie has become so popular, major studios have copied it. This film has a well written script, effective sound track, excellent acting, background distractions, and of course quirky memorable characters. The film might may be best classified as a light drama, leaning toward comedy.<br /><br />In this 1965 tale two misfit 12 year kids conspire to run off together. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a teased orphan scout. Suzy (Kara Hayward) is the daughter of two lawyers. They live on a New England island. A search party for the two missing youths is lead by &#34;sad dumb policeman&#34; Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). Captain Sharp is having an affair with the mother of Suzy (Frances McDormand). Bill Murray plays the rather straight husband.<br /><br />There is a scene where the two youths get close to each that made me uncomfortable for a moment. Fortunately the scene didn't last long and the film returned to its quirky self, with bits of dark comedy. While it is PG-13, I wouldn't want my 13 year old to watch it. It might give them ideas.<br /><br />This is Kara Haywood's first full length film. I see a great career for her.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Kara Haywood in bra/undies. Some groping.

B005HSL626|5.0|Addicted to this game. Can't take my hands away. Love it. I highly so recommend this game to everybody else out there.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Loved this whole series, am disappointed we will have to wait so long for the next book to come out, will need a lot of chapters bringing up to date, or will need to re read the whole series again.  It was such a surprise when main characters are killed off, sending your thoughts on to a new direction. I read the whole series on kindle, I think I would have found the books with the small print and large size a bit daunting.  The story line challenged my imagination and for a time I could enter another world.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|From what I understand, this game has evolved over the last 15 years.  I for one am grateful it did. It's not easy and I like that.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|One of those rare books that I had to force myself to put down so I wouldn't consume it all at once; I wanted to savor every single word/chapter.<br /><br />Book 2 cannot arrive soon enough!

B002OT731E|5.0|This CD is awesome IMHO  - from the first thru the last, just an excellent Stones CD.<br />I highly recommend it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is NOT fiction. This is an extremely well written book about the journey we all must eventually face. Dr. Alexander presents a thought provoking book from both the scientific and spiritual point of view. It is not muddled up with an excessive amount of medical DATA. I expected there to be more but what was there was fairly easy to follow.<br /><br />Read this one and slowly digest all thoughts. I feel this book should be on the reading list for college philosophy programs. It answers the question, where do we go from here?
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I could watch this every week & I'm an adult :) It's a good story and quite funny. Great visuals.
0307245306|5.0|We rented this audiobook from Cracker Barrel for a 9 hour car ride (each way).  I would have preferred Steve Jobs' autobiography, but, with  sigh, I decided to sacrifice and get this children's book for my daughter.  I couldn't have been more surprised at how much I enjoyed this book!  Rick Riordan's writing draws you in.  His characters and situations are interesting and well-drawn.  After finishing this one we got \\"The Lost Hero\\", which my daughter says is the best.  She had already read the entire series, but enjoyed hearing it on audio. It was also nice to share this with her.<br /><br />I love how the characters in Riordan's books make caring choices.  There are  lot of situations where they make choices based on wanting to help others or remain honorable.  I like the author's point of view very much.  The only negative for me was that, after a while it was kind of like Lord of the Rings in the sense that it was one battle after another.  But that's an adult's view.  My daughter loves these books unreservedly.  I like Lost Hero even better.  More humor in the writing and the characters are even more interesting.  I don't often write reviews, but I took the time to write this one because these books brought us so much pleasure.
B008Y6TE5O|5.0|It's been 20 plus years since I've wateched this movie.  This movie has so many Hollywood insider references that I must confess I will never be able to appreciate them all.  I'll watch the reviews for those who can pin them all and I thank you.  The most tragic and poinent cameo is Ms. Maria Shriver's role.  Thank you for your governess, and much enjoyed movies, but I am sorry about your mistake...
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I liked the movie only because it had to do with the original ALIEN<br />but it left a lot to be desired. I did'nt quite like the premise of<br />trying to find human's \\"Creator\\". The special effects were awesome<br />and worth the price of admission and the Blu-Ray but that's just me.<br /><br />  That said, I wish there were another story line which connected the<br />original ALIEN movie to this one, especially connecting if this was the<br />beginning or the end of Alien.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I would recommend to buy this game.u can build houses to hide from zombie, skeletons, crepers. It is my favorite game.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The action and special effects were excellent.  The ending was lacking but overall, the movie was definitely worth the money and time.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action flicks and a little SCI-FI.

0062127241|5.0|I have been listening to audiobooks for over fifteen years as a means to augment my regular reading. When the author reads their own memoir it is the art form reaching it's maximum potential. Augusten Burroughs reading \\"Running With Scissors\\" for example. Townsend ads what is a combination of a giggle and a chortle at opportune times serving to punctuate many of the zany, sad, depressive, exuberant, melancholy stories. I found myself laughing along with him as he relay's the comedic performances of Keith Moon yet as Townsend makes clear tragedy was the dust in the air of tension for those in the Moon orbit. Ultimately Townsend impresses because he maintains a spirit of artistic ambition that seems missing from many of the now thriving \\"Rock God\\" autobiography Keith Richard's good book comes to mind. I was also impressed by what seems to have been a long running practice of Townsend to respond to the letters of his many fans in my mind this speaks to the innate kindness of a sharp elbowed legend.<br /><br />Listen and hear him tell you his story doesn't get much simpler than that.
B009D0LBRO|4.0|Reminds me of Rayman Origins on a wire, you control raymans actions like jump, punch, fly etc. but you can't control where he goes. It's always straight ahead. You have to get all the Lums to clear the board and get to the land of the dead. the art is beautiful, the game is responsive. it'e pretty cool but a tad on the easy side. I recommend the game if you liked past rayman games.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely love this trilogy!!  I was a little skeptical at first with book one but by book two I couldn't put it down
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A pleasure to watch, this movie has everything: a fantastic cast, a marvellous story line, drama, comedy, incredible setting, you name it.  I purchased it because I am a fan of Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Judi Dench.  I have now watched it three times because I keep wanting to see certain passages again, like Maggie in the hospital gurney requesting her tea and wanting to see an English doctor or Judi trying to make sense of a computer.  The performance by the Indian actors is nothing short of brilliant, from the over enthusiastic young hotel owner to his sexy, beautiful girlfriend, her business minded brother, the over bearing and unforgiving future Mother in law, each and every one delivers an impeccable performance.  This is a movie in the successful Hollywood format of the 1940's where people left movie theatres uplifted.  A joy to watch with something for everyone.

055358894X|5.0|Scott Lynch makes an excellent debut in this fantasy adventure novel.  I won't bother with a synopsis of the story, there are plenty of reviews that do that already.  I found the Lies of Locke Lamora to be a quick read, with plenty of action to keep you in the book.  It had a good plot with plenty of twists, and the characters were well written.  His world is incredibly rich and detailed, reminding me a bit of R.L. Asprin's Sancturary.  When I was done, I was excited to pick up his next installment to see where he would take his characters!
B002NPY7FE|4.0|I remember this from &#34;83&#34; when it came out. All we would talk about at work was how nutso that woman was to leave her car, not knowing where Cujo was. Good movie if you like terror & suspense. It does keeps you interested. When I watched it the first time on Blu-Ray I was a little disappointed in the quality. Having watched it again I see that it's not as bad as I first thought. I thought most of the movie looked like a regular dvd. Not so. It isn't the best Blu-ray I've seen but not the worst either. I can't comment on the digital sound as I listen through my tuner & external speakers in regular stereo. It sounds good in stereo though. I got this at a really good price too. This is one of those movies that really doesn't matter that it's in 1:85:1 aspect ratio. It's still enjoyable to watch even after all these years.

Sharks await, in quiet shoals.  Imprisoned, we all escape sometime, and what better time, the stars are out tonight!!!  Oceania, eternal, immense, the sea swirls into the shore, I await you my love, in a watchtower choked my autumn branches and blue aquamarine skies.

0385344228|3.0|In many regards, Defending Jacob was a good read.  However, it suffered from an inconsistency in the believability of its characters and plot.  Some incidents and relationships seemed very realistic while others stretched the reader's imagination.<br />  When his son is charged with the murder of one of his classmates, DA Andy Barber finds himself in an awkward position.  He loves his son and wants to trust him; on the other hand, in many instances, his training in legal reasoning and the rules of criminal justice seem to fly out the window.  The wishful thinking, destruction of evidence, little white lies, and condoning the manipulation of the legal system are disturbing, especially when practiced by a successful DA.  Moreover, parts of the ending seemed contrived and hurried.<br />  In many other regards, however, Landay's characterizations of teenagers, family relations, and public opinion seem very realistic.  The courtroom drama and tension of the case make for exciting reading.  I enjoyed the explanations of some of the legal terms and strategies used during the trials.  The actions of friends and neighbors of the Barbers  and the Barber family's response showed a good understanding of human behavior.<br />  In essence, my estimation of the book swung back and forth. I suppose that Landay was trying to show how a DA's reasoning can change when he is personally involved in the case.  In this book, however, the author stretched my acceptance.  I hope that in his next book, Landay uses less poetic license and more throughout the story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is addicting though I tend to get distracted by this game I don't get much accomplished if I'm playing it

B00000JBFW|4.0|In 1984 this was the most anticipated realease of the year,for all hard rock and heavy metal fans all over the world.Deep Purple Mk11 line up along with Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin in the late 60s invented a new music genre,which is called Heavy Metal.The Deep Purple Mk11 line up of the early 70s was the ultimate and best lineup ever.When Ian gillan departed the band at the end of 1972 they recruited David Coverdale.They continued till 1976 untill Deep Purple disbanded.To this day i often wonder why this super group reunited??.All the MK11 & MK111 members had all forged brilliant post purple work with Ian Gillan, Ian Gillan Band.Richie Blackmore,Roger Glover joining forces to form Rainbow,David Coverdale & Jon Lord (RIP) forming Whitesnake.They Could have taken the easy road and just gone on a world tour,perform all of the 70s classics to re-harsh past glories.However they did the unthinkable and released new material with PERFECT STRANGERS.......This album is one almighty classic!!!from the opening track Knocking at your back door thru the rest of the album it has a very fresh vibe to it.It feels like this is a young band with a debut record.It is very well produced and everybody has contributed to this piece of work.You can feel the energy on this record and it simply grabs you by the throat.My favourite songs are<br />1. Knocking at your back door<br />2. Perfect Strangers<br />3. A gypsy Kiss<br />4. Wasted Sunsets<br />5. Hungary Daze<br />6. Son Of Alerik (Instrumental)<br />I highly recommend this for all Deep Purple fans. I worthy cd to add to your collection
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So all of the reviews I've read so far have completely bashed this book to smitherines. Which is really unfair to the book. I mean, its not the greatest book in the world, but its certainly not the worst. Give it a chance.
B0054U53M6|5.0|Perfect Doctor Who fix.  Loved every episode.  Looking forward to more.  Matt Smith has become my favorite Doctor.  I will miss \\"come along pond\\" and Rory the Roman Centurion--hard to say goodbye..but I know next season will be just as rewarding.  Fantastic writers as always.

B009NQKXYK|4.0|Ridley Scott is an amazingly talented director, and this is an admirable return to horror/sci-fi for him. I wish I'd seen it in 3-D, but I was too eager to get the HD download to wait for the Blu-Ray (and I  missed it in theaters). There are some questionable casting decisions that bothered me, specifically casting Noomi Rapace as an English scientist named Emma Shaw, I think, when she's only been speaking English for about a year. It would have taken little more than a five minute search and replace function in the script to make her a Swedish scientist working in an international operation and then she might have spent less effort trying to get an accent right. She's a brilliant actress,(The Swedish Stiege Larson trilogy) and in the latter 45 minutes of the movie, when so much of the acting is physical, you can absolutely see why she was cast, but why they made her English seems like giving her an extra stone to carry when it wasn't necessary. Likewise Idris Alba, who is almost always terrific, and successfully played a Baltimore gangster for five years on The Wire without a hitch in the accent, is cast as, I guess, a Texan. He was credible, but there was no reason not to give him a Cockney or Northern English Accent if you needed him to be working class.(He plays the captain of the ship.)<br /><br />You don't care about any of that. It's a fun, flashy, sci-fi horror movie with first-rate actors. It's not quite as scary and atmospheric as Alien, but it's cool to look at. You'll be tempted to try to think too hard, and a lot of people who saw it said they found it confusing, but it does resolve and explain itself by the very end, so just sort of hang on for the ride and think, \\"I'm watching a monster movie, not a philosophical treatise.\\" And thank your alien gods that Scott didn't put Russell Crowe in it. If you haven't seen Alien, then you might want to give it a look before you watch this film, although the intervening 30 years or so between the films will standout.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Still a awesome writer, his references to places, and things are great. His small references to 19, for those loyal to the dark tower series. All in all a great read
0345803485|2.0|This novel already has over 13,500 reviews, so I won't add much.  If you like to read page after page of foreplay and bonking followed by analysis of the adolescent kind, then you'll love this book, because there's nothing else.  Descriptions of foreplay and bonking capture the attention, so as one reviewer said, the novel does keep you turning pages.  Anastasia's never-ending analysis and interrogation of Christian Grey is really annoying, at least to this (male) reviewer, and it goes on almost to the last page.  And the bonking?  Well, there's only so much one can say about it, even with the aid of sophisticated S&M equipment and a dominant male of extraordinary stamina, so it loses its appeal by about one third of the way through.<br /><br />Really, the book seems to have been authored by an adolescent, or one who has lively adolescent erotic fantasies.  I was surprised that a woman in her late forties would feel impelled to put pen to paper for this purpose, unless the purpose is purely to make money.  I like to read popular literature to see what it is that people enjoy, and have found that I enjoy it, too.  Harry Potter, the Millennium series, the Hunger Games - all highly enjoyable.  But Fifty Shades?  Give me a break!  It's boring and mind-numbingly superficial.  The male protagonist is totally unbelievable, and the female is pathetic in her needs and her insecurity.  The end is unresolved, but that's the hook to get you to buy Volume 2.  I won't be buying, nor even borrowing it.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This was a useful book I'm 11 and need help with some words in this book. I would recommend this book to everyone
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I bought this book for my eleven year old granddaughter who gave it a great review. She can't wait for the next book.<br /><br />Please ignore this sentence - this review site requires at least 20 words with no repeats.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|I read this book in hardcover. There is definitely more to offer in this autobiography then to only appeal to Duran Duran fans. The book starts off pretty straight forward, not really offering to much insight in John's life aside from some glimpses into his relationship with his parents, you can feel he is holding back to respect them, which I can understand. But the book really takes off in my opinion about half way through with John's admissions to his drug, alcohol and ego driving period in his life. Some moments are very candid and I for one as the reader truly appreciate this. He peppers his experience with some great antidotes to a happier more fulfilled life.<br />I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interests in the highs and lows of true super stardom and not just fans of his band.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have just read all three for the third time love these books. I love the storyline and the love story between Christian and Anastasia
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Granddaughter had previously seen this movie and loved it.  So of course grandma had to order it for her.  She loved it and even slept with it the first night she receiverd it.  Movie arrived in record time.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|After we had both read the book, my husband and I decided to watch the movie. The plan was to purchase it on DVD, but before we did we looked at the overall impression from other people. When we saw that the movie only garnered 3 stars we decided it might be a better bet to rent first. I am very glad that we went with the rental. We were prepared for the slight deviations such as abbreviations, characters left out in the interest of time, etc. These things always seem to happen when a book is turned into a movie and can be a minor irritation if the finished product is good. However, this movie was a HUGE waste of time. There is almost no resemblance to the book. At times, we found ourselves wondering if the two were even connected. Aside from having a totally different story line, it was hard to follow and felt like some things were only thrown on the chance that they might make for good theater. The only reason we hung on to the end was because we paid for the rental.<br /><br />Some of the fight scenes were interesting but that's about it. I recommend reading the book. It is an fun twist on vampires and an alternate history of Lincoln's life. I liked the book much more than I expected to, but do yourself a favor and skip the movie.

B0064X79JC|5.0|James Sallis has crafted a taunt, bare bones thriller that grabs hold of the reader and doesn't let go until long after you've turned the final page at 2am!
1607066017|5.0|This trade collects Saga issues #1-6.<br /><br />Saga, the first work of Vaughan's I've read,  is the very definition of \\"not for everyone.\\"  It contains heavy use of profanity, nudity, graphic violence and sex, and a lot of things most readers will find very unsettling.  The base concept also sounds rather cliche - two people from waring worlds fall in love and wish to leave their people's conflict behind and raise their forbidden newborn child in peace.<br /><br />And that classic idea is the only thing in Saga reminiscent of anything else I've come across, except that Vaughan knows that the interest to every great story grows from its characters.  The elements I mentioned above aren't the point of this unique story, and so they add to it.<br /><br />The strange worlds and grotesque forces Alana and Marko are trying to avoid are interesting and well developed, but it is the strength of the key characters who are ignoring, aiding, fighting or fleeing these horrors that makes this compelling.  The pacing is good (although this is an opening volume so there's a lot of groundwork being filled in) and despite the permiating oddness of the setting characters' actions and emotions feel genuine. Staples' art is great, doesn't shy away from disturbing images and suits the story well.<br /><br />I'll avoid further details to prevent spoilers, but overall Saga is an excellent start to what looks to be a hard-hitting, gripping tale.  Well worth a read if you can handle its approach to the subject matter.
B004LROMX4|5.0|I started out seeing a preview for this show when I was instantly excited. As a fan of shows like Stargate, this show is really cool. Upon watching the first season it left me amazed and wondering what would happen next. I am really glad that they are continuing this show because as a science fiction fan I believe that most of the good shows are being cancelled after just 1 or 2 seasons. But if you are a fan of alien shows, or survival shows this is one you should check out.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its a fun game<br />worth the time to play with good art and a lot of different play. the story line is not advanced but still fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is addictive. At first I didn't think it was going to be any fun. Now I play it all the time.
0316228532|3.0|Do not expect a magical adventure. This book is a gritty look at life, death and politics in a pair of small English towns. That said, Rowling is still tops as a wordsmith and I look forward to more from her.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy on blu-ray is amazing! I kept hearing about the Bourne series for a while and wanted to see for my self if it was as good as I was told. It was better! If you want a action/thriller with an amazing plot this is it. I looked for a long time to decide which set I wanted to get and this one does not disappoint. Between watching the Mission Impossible trilogy or this one I definitely choose this one.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|I really love this movie. The HD Bluray version has incredible sound and a flawless picture. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I saw the oringinal in an iMax theater... and nothing you can watch on a TV screen compares with that experience!!

B000FDFVZ6|3.0|This story could have been great, unfortunately it fell flat. I love the idea of the story...a murdered 14 year old girl looking down from heaven watching as her loved ones struggle with her death and getting on with their lives.<br /><br />Here's the parts that prevented it from being a 5 star book:<br /><br />1. The part where Susie comes to earth years after her death and has sex with the guy she had a crush on before she died at the age of 14. Someone else said this part cheapened the story and I completely agree. Her coming down to earth flat out didn't make sense and I'm still not clear on how it happened and why Ruth passed out. It in no way added to the story, and in fact took a lot away.<br /><br />2. Ruth...Her character wasn't well developed at all. I didn't understand exactly what her purpose was. The book would have lost nothing without her.<br /><br />3. Susie's mom was a horrible character. She was very self-centered and I found her entire attitude repulsive.<br /><br />It's a book that's worth the read, but I like the idea of the story much more than I actually like the book. It had the potential for an amazing story, but sadly fell flat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome game. I highly reccomend it great for milling time I just played for an hour get the game and stop reading this review

B0072OFOM6|4.0|Another season of over the top sex, violence and backstabbing.  And let's be honest, if you're still watching this series, that is what you're watching it for.  I wish they would tone down the heavy handed CGI blood work but other than that, this season hits all the expected notes.  The story is wearing a bit thin though, it might be time to wrap it up while it still holds our attention.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I intended to get this book no matter what the cost, simply on the brilliance of the author's gift for writing. I also did not expect to find any vestige of Harry Potter.  However, I am still in awe of the author who could write a series of books, where each one was better than the excellent one you just finished reading, culminating in the last book being one of the most profoundly satisfying books I have ever read.<br /><br />I discovered the same writing excellence in \\"Casual Vacancy\\".  However, not the same love of the characters as in her previous books, finding not many redeeming qualities in any of them, and this came as a surprise.  I had at least expected to feel for this gathering of people whose lives intertwined in this village, but at the end, while saddened by the predictable deaths, and the sad and struggling life they lead, I was unaccustomed to not care as much for characters as much I had for characters in other books.  This was the most disappointing.<br /><br />I stayed with the book until the end, because I feel that I know JK Rowling more intimately from her other series than I did any of the people in \\"Casual Vacancy \\".  I also like the fact that she wrote what she wanted for herself without worrying about anyone else's opinion.  I hope she got what she needed from this new venture.<br /><br />I will definitely read anything else that she may write.  The woman is, to put it familiarly, \\"Brilliant!\\"  This book was not, but I got a chance to get acquainted with JK Rowling all over again. I would encourage others to read it, simply out of curiosity about the book, and I do not mean to deter anyone else from the experience.  However, I am glad that I not only have Harry Potter books, audio books and movies, but the abiltiy to transport myself into this magical realm when I want uplifted by love, friendship, hope and courage.  Missing a bit from \\"Casual Vacancy\\".
B001EJY8RW|1.0|Now let me just make it clear that I love tony Scott. His work ranges from mostly excellent to decent at the least but never really terrible. This movie seems like a bad Spanish soap. Not a fan of Kevin Costner either who isn't horrible but brings the same sort of blandest he brings to all his roles. If you like Lifetime movies then you might like this otherwise stay the hell away!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I live this game I love it more than temple run its great and way to addictive. temple run was fun but this game beats it
B007HM2ZTS|4.0|I listen to classic rock and new hard rock all the time. Bands like Guns 'n Roses and Metallica are on my playlists and my current favorite radio station is Octane on Sirius. This is the first time I ever got into a rock band fronted by a woman. I tried to like bands Evanecance and Within Temptation, but it was always too whiny for me. Well, enter Halestorm. They have a unique, distinctive sound that I like for several reasons.<br /><br />First there is Arejay's maniac drumming style that's a mix of very impressive virtuoso stuff and plenty of humor. His groove makes each track interesting and never generic-sounding. There aren't many like him around, it's just pure bad-assness. I haven't met a drummer yet who hasn't been impressed by his style and chops.<br /><br />Then there's Lizzy's amazing vocal talent. She has a very impressive tonal range and a pleasant voice to listen to. She can go from silky smooth to belting and screaming. The most impressive thing about her voice is the amazing amount of face-melting power behind it. There are plenty of dude rock singers who simply can't even come close to it. Her style, power and range kinda reminds me of Sebastian Bach (the former singer of Skid Row) and that's a huge compliment. I guess that's why I like her singing style, she sings rock songs like a guy. I can't stand that whiny high-pitch girly stuff.<br /><br />The bass player and guitar player do their thing and they do it well. Most riffs are catchy and there are a couple of good guitar solos to be found. All in all it's a very tight-sounding band. Especially the opening song of the album shows off the band's mastery of their instruments. It's a fast-paced hard rock song with quick and clever riffs and hooks. The first four songs are high energy, hard-rock songs. After that the album slows down a lot with three slow and soft ballads. Two of which are on side A, and the third, \\"Break in\\" starts off side B of the record. This change of pace is a bit of a surprise,but it works. Towards the end the album ramps up again and it ends with the great anthem \\"Here's to us\\". My favorite song of the album would be \\"Miss the misery\\". My least favorite song is \\"Rock show\\".<br /><br />If there's any critique on the music to be had, it's the lyrics. It's a mixed bag, really. Sometimes they are clever and deep, but sometimes they seem they were written by a teenager. \\"Miss the misery\\" and \\"In your room\\" are for example good ones, while \\"You call me a b*tch like it's a bad thing\\" and \\"Rock show\\" are so bad it's almost awkward to listen to. I wonder why it's all over the place like that.<br /><br />Another point of critique I have is the production of the album. Like many modern albums, it's WAY too compressed and loud for it's own good. I just can't wrap my head around why producers keep doing this. Every single track on this album is clipped, yes, CLIPPED!!!!!!!, except for \\"Break in\\", which is -0.02 db from the top. It angers me that this great album could have sounded so much better if the producer didn't go with the loudness war treatment. It's just such a shame because there are so many things on this album that would benefit from some proper dynamic range, especially the drums. Instead of having that \\"blast\\"-effect, they sound flat. Everything is just LOUD with hardly any distinction. Instead of punchy and alive, the sound has that dry, flat quality to it. Their first album sounded much better, audio-quality wise. If you don't understand any of this, check out Metallica's \\"Black album\\" from 1991 to hear just how good a properly mastered rock album can sound like. Also listen to Metallica's \\"Death magnetic\\" to hear the absolute worst sounding album of all time.<br /><br />So, is this a perfect album? That answer would be \\"no\\", but that's okay. Only albums like GnR's \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" and Led Zeppelin' \\"IV\\" make that list for me. Is it a very good album? Yes, for sure. It's been quite a while since I've listened to an entire album this many times in a row.<br /><br />In fact, I liked it so much that I went out to get the vinyl version. The vinyl album sounds much more alive and dynamic than the MP3/CD. If you want the best sounding version, get the good 'ol record. Also be sure to catch them live if they stop by your town, they're an amazing live band.
B005CRQ3LG|5.0|I got this for my 5 year old granddaughter.  We have read it a couple of times and I discovered that she is really beyond this book.  It is, however a perfect book for younger kids.  I will save it for her little brother when he is older.
B004BSFC46|3.0|I bought this toy for my two-months-old baby. I overall like the pattern and the color contrast. I know that developmentally these patterns and colors are very stimulating. The baby stares at them and definitely is interested in the toy but my mother raised the concern that because baby's movement are not very coordinated he can hurt his eyes with the bugs' antennas or legs. The tip of the antennas and legs are protected with a hard glue that can hurt their eyes when they are moving their hands close to their faces. I still like the toy but what I do now is that I put them at eyesight for stimulation but avoid wrapping them around his hands to prevent him from hurting his eyes.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I enjoy this game.  The objects are not in the same spot each time you come back to a room.  This adds challenge.
1451629192|5.0|Very heart touching account of Jaycee who was captive for 18 years, of  her daughters whom she gave birth to during that time, and the harsh treatment she indured.  She helps others now that she has her freedom.It was hard to put the book down once I start reading it. Very well written. Not a book for children.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Ok, I'm a silver age guy, growing up with Marvel from the 60s, the silver age of comics. Bringing the world's greatest heroes to life on the screen was awesome. From the minds of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee to the screen in magnificent fashion is an accomplishment. Not as ground breaking as Avatar, but this is a must have for your video library.

From late night endeavours to monitoring my programs from the hotel room it has been amazing.<br />The only thing that I could even complain about is the difficulty to connect from a new wifi hotspot though I think it is something that I am doing wrong...<br />Overall this is an amazing app and definately the first one that I will download after resetting my Kindle Fire to factory defualt if I ever do.<br />( As additional praise: I was actually able to stream AND play Battlefield 3 on my kindle using this! )<br /><br />* Written on my kindle fire streamed to my PC :) *

B005HIBWFW|5.0|This film has so much going for it that you should stop and think twice before dismissing my claim.<br />First of all it is a genuine Tragedy in the Aristotelian sense.<br />Secondly, it is the tragedy of a major musical genius who is also a popular 'romantic artist'.<br />Thirdly, he is treated by Russell as the representative Romantic Artist who tries but fails to live up to his ideals, or, to put it another way, it's about the distance between the life and the art. This has always been Russell's main theme as a filmaker but you need to have his films about Debussy, Rossetti, Isadora Duncan, Richard Strauss and Delius, all made for BBC television, to put alongside the more familiar feature films to see this pattern as a whole.<br />It also touches profoundly, especially at the climax, on the subject of shamanism and genius.<br />Fourthly, the expressionistic visual style of the film is an attempt to create a visual equivalent of Tchaikovsky's kind of Romantic music as an art form. In this it is nothing less than an experimental arthouse film - and a successful experiment at that.<br /><br />What other film in the 'all time great' category has this sort of grand universality of subject matter including Art, genius, Tragedy, the Romantic Artist, failed ideals of the highest kind? None at all with the possible exception, stretching my categories a bit, of 'Les Enfants Du Paradis' or perhaps the Russian film of 'War And Peace'. Neither of them is British so I nominate this film as the best British feature film on the grounds of subject matter combined with its powerful treatment in what is an undoubtedly non-naturalistic and original way - sometimes even Expressionistic - stamped in every frame with the director's vision: I give points for this because it is more of a purely cinematic aesthetic than naturalism is.<br />I must admit, however, that to be fair, I should also give a very honourable mention to that other great film about Isadora Duncan called simply 'Isadora' directed by Karel Reisz and which starred Vanessa Redgrave in her finest performance. In many respects this should be considered along with 'The Music Lovers' as their style and intention is similar. It is much underrated, mainly I imagine because it isn't very well known.<br /><br />We also need to have Russell's films about Wordsworth, Coleridge, Bruckner, Vaughan Williams and Martinu, and the early one about Prokoviev, all made for television, but for ITV this time, like the missing films still not released on DVD in the UK on PAL, which I mentioned above.
B007WFTFG6|2.0|This app is not kid friendly. I mostly have to guide my 3yr old grandson through the process (he is a fast learner). Boring in every way, this app does not hold my grandkids attention at all (ages 3-8). I strongly suggest you seek a better version.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|All the Nikki Heat books are good reads. They are exciting and well thought out. I hope there will be more of this series too come.
B009X5IL36|4.0|Actually delightful watching! The beginning of the episode was immediately catchy, with Holmes in dire straights. It seems a predictable case, but it really isn't. Holmes is back in form, energetic and intense. Manic JLM is mesmerizing. Watson is calmer, and more likable as she becomes comfortable in her role with Holmes. She also shows good instincts.<br /><br />The antagonist is very clever and the machinations between Holmes and the serial murderer are delightful. Holmes, as the case moves along, is brilliant, managing to insult and offend every person he interviews, which is so much fun to watch.<br /><br />Gregson proves to be observant. Watson insightful and anxious.<br /><br />I am hopeful that future episodes will continue along these lines. There were clues strung along throughout the case, well paced and the murderer not revealed too soon, nor too obvious. Recommended!

B00514HDNW|5.0|Started off odd because it just jumps in not telling what is happening but once you quickly figure out what you're dealing with it gets good. Be prepared for having a lot of conversations with yourself cause that's most of the book, Neville talking to Neville.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Very nice app for content can be a little more helpful on index.I use it in church and when scripture is called can be time consuming
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I didn't think I would like it at first. So I read the book first to see if I would like it. I became so interested in it I couldn't put it down. I ended up reading the other two books as well which is part of the trilogy. I bought the movie so I could watch it more than once. I will probably buy the other two movies when they come out. I would recommend this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The others were so good, but this book, especially the ending, just fell flat. Everything was boring or rushed, and nothing really made that much sense. Read it because you basically have to if you read the first two.

B0052AC8C6|3.0|As others have said, it's not a childrens' movie... not because of violence or language, but because there are themes, jokes and movie references that kids wouldn't get. Think a more sophisticated and less slapstick version of Shrek.<br /><br />The first 15 minutes or so, until Rango arrives in the town of Dirt, are mindlessly inane and boring, and somewhat disturbing at times. After that it becomes a combination of typical Western and High School genres.... the protagonist enters an unfamiliar culture, establishes himself with a fake persona, comedic action blah blah, faces humiliation and failure, then grows a pair and redeems himself/becomes the hero. And gets the girl.<br /><br />But it is still a bizarre journey; he's a goofy lizard after all...<br /><br />The animation is outstanding.<br /><br />There are lines and scenes borrowed from countless movies and film franchises, many of them from the 80s and some older. I'm sure there are many that I missed. Movie geeks (you know who you are) will enjoy it more than I did.<br /><br />In the end I'm glad I watched it (library rental), but I wouldn't watch it again.
0316228532|3.0|I wanted to like this book.  But it didn't work out that way.<br /><br />I almost put it down at 50 pages, and not picked it back up again -- something that's rare for me.  At 100 pages, I still could not have told you who or what the book was about.  But, largely due to the author's reputation, I kept going.<br /><br />It did get more interesting.  It also got darker and darker; it really sucks the joy out of you.<br /><br />The book begins with several pages on each of the 16 or so \\"main\\" characters.  It jumps back and forth, presumably establishing each one.  But it seemed very disjointed.  Repeatedly, I had to go back and check which character was which (through the first 75 to 100 pages) because the constant jumping around made it hard for me to remember who was who.  In addition, it was constantly jumping between the world of adults and the world of teenagers.  It's a bit jarring to move from small town council business to who's got a crush on who at the high school.<br /><br />There was a key event involving the hacking of a website that finally put a plot in motion. At that point, it was almost compelling to read.  But as it moved forward, the characters' thoughts and emotions became darker and darker, and the book became bleaker and bleaker.<br /><br />In many ways, the book is about social class, community, and responsibility.  Rowling is certainly well positioned to write about that, having moved from being a struggling single mom who needed some help from the government to one of the wealthiest women on earth.  She is able to illustrate the views each class has of another, and why.  That is perhaps the book's primary achievement.<br /><br />But, since it's a book about an abstract thing, rather than about a character, it's challenging to make this work.  Steinbeck wrote a more successful book of this sort in The Grapes of Wrath.  The image of Tom Joad has stayed with me since I read it in the 1990s.  I don't expect that to be the case with any of the characters in this book.racters in this book.
0385535139|5.0|it's a good book. it's hard-back. and, i got a nice price on it. i don't really know what else to say about a book. everyone has their own preferences. i, personally have not read it, but my husband says he liked it. but, i need to fill 20 words, so that's why i'm babbling. good deal!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It is unbelievable to think that there is a country today that treats its citizens like prisoners...enslaving and brutalizing them on a daily basis...North Korea.  Imagine having the misfortune of being born inside a prison inside North Korea.  That is a double dose of Hell on Earth.<br /><br />This book describes, in great detail, the life and struggle of a child born in Camp 14, one of the numerous sprawling prison camps that operate inside North Korea as I type this review.  Daily physical and psychological beatings are the norm.  The values of love, trust, caring, sharing, friendship, and just about everything else that we take for granted are non-existent.<br /><br />The book is very well written.  I highly recommend it.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|To be clear, this is a very good book. But the way it started out made me hope for more. The idea seemed so original and the writing so good, that mid-way through, I was ready to give it five stars.<br /><br />The lead character, Jacob, had felt out of place his entire childhood. This feeling was fed by his unusual grandfather who told stories about fighting monsters and living in a home across the sea with peculiar children who could do amazing things.<br /><br />Jacob grows up never quite sure whether his grandfather's stories were fairy tales or true, whether the old man was deluded or a hidden knight in the battle of good against evil. When he witnesses his grandfather's murder, he decides the stories might be real and is labeled disturbed by his family and sent into therapy.<br /><br />But the promise of the first half of the book, which revolves around the complex character of Jacob, doesn't fully deliver. Instead, the story turns into a fast-paced yarn, a page turner that's hard to put down. But at a cost. The stakes become too simplistically good and evil. Too many plots turns are not fully developed (the latter part of the book goes by almost too fast). And the richness of the beginning diminishes. The peculiar children, while distinct, are flatly drawn, their relationship with Jacob too bland. The result is an opportunity lost, the quest for the ring without the friendship of Frodo and Sam, the battle with Voldemort without the relationships between Harry and his friends.<br /><br />Finally, I have no idea whether this is intended to be a series or not, but it ends on a cliffhanger. If this is a stand-alone novel, the ending will leave you wanting. If this fine first novel is the start if a series, then sign me up.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|Perhaps its because I have read most of his books over the last two years and not over a long period of time, but this story was not the best of his novels.  A good read but I found myself able to put this one down and get back to it over time whereas others I would make time to finish in a few days.  If I was to put the \\"I fell asleep while reading this book\\" with the fewer the stars being better, I think I can remember falling asleep at least 3-4 times before I finished it.  There were certainly a few that I read nonstop.  A Wanted Man is a good book with predictable turns based on Lee's style of writing that we have come to love.  Worth the AMAZON price with a follow up on a cheap paperback version to add to the library collection but NOT worth spending 30 bucks on a hardcover version.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Whether you had the once in a lifetime pleasure of seeing Sade live last year or would like to experience for the first time in the comfort of your own home, you must buy this set! Intimacy has been the key mood set for every tour Sade, the woman and her bandmates, has blessed us with, but this time they decided to up the ante a bit. More theatrical than past tours, Bring Me Home manages to capture the breathtaking awesomeness that is Sade in one show, once again filmed in California.<br /><br />It's hard to believe it's been a full decade since Sade last hit the road, but the band bangs out the hits like they only left the stage the night before. The DVD features 22 songs (9 more than the CD), a well balanced mix of newer songs and the classics we love. This time around Sade goes through four costume changes, my favorites being the white dress with her beautiful black hair falling around her shoulders while crooning the ultimate melancholic love song No Ordinary Love and the red jacket and dress with bare feet for the dreamy closer Cherish the Day.<br /><br />The extras are pretty good too. Although there's no in-depth sit-down interview, How Do You Say Thank You? is over 20 minutes of footage featuring the diva goofing around with her bandmates (watch her get her groove on to Snoop!), staring pensively outside her tour bus window, taking photos and briefly chatting with fans, and practicing an a capella version of Amazing Grace with her backup singers. There's even a quick shot of her young daughter Ila. These moments humanize Sade in a way that go far beyond any interview. She seems like a fun person to hang with. Other extras include In the Trenches, a detailed behind the scenes production look by Stuart Matthewman, and 3 Seconds.<br /><br />Hopefully The Queen of Quiet Storm will hit the road just one more time one of these days, but until then, let them Bring You Home over and over again. Enjoy!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I wonder how many more movies are left in the Wes Anderson oeuvre. I fully expected to love this, but it just didn't resonate with me - even though I am a huge fan. All the things I like about Anderson's movies - the cinematography, the unique narratives, the dry, clipped dialog, the attention to minuscule detail - seemed forced and predictable in Moonrise Kingdom. I just didn't believe the love story between these two at all, though they were both wonderful in their roles. I did love the Hank Williams soundtrack. And I'm happy to see Anderson has found a wider audience.<br /><br />Life Aquatic, Rushmore, Royal Tannenbaums - these movies inspired me. Moonrise left me a little disappointed.

B008YWY0HK|2.0|While this was a stunningly beautiful movie visually it's apparent that Disney has officially taken over Pixar (was hoping Cars 2 was a fluke).  Instead of the past Pixar quality story-line, this movie ended up being just another Disney \\"princess\\" movie that Pixar happened to animate.  It seems Pixar has become nothing more than an outlet for Disney merchanidising potential.  Bring back the heart of Up, charm of Wall-e, fun of Toy Story, and warmth of so many of the others!  Here's hoping that Pixar gets back to what they used to do best...create a GREAT story we haven't seen over and over, then add their past wonderful animation!

B000OVLBFS|5.0|All of the Jesse Stone series movies with Tom Selleck are wonderful. Has a story, sex is left to the imagination, plots are always good if not great. I have bought all of the Jesse Stone movie series .  I like action movies  but I also enjoy a story line that is plausible , that is if you don't count the TRANSFORMER SERIES, then  one must suspend intelligence and jus enjoy the show, which I do. And  Tom Selleck is one of the great actors of our time, he can be menacing without useing filthy language, plus he's a great comedian. You got to like a guy who can go from great cowboy shoes to detectives to a dad to protraing Eisenhower.

B009ESIGHI|1.0|Disney have butchered this release by only including the cut version of the film. It is approximately 4 minutes shorter than the full version - the most crucial song to the plot has been cut out.

B0011Z3DK2|3.0|I havent read the writing credits but if this is Led Zeppelin's first album with no cover material. Then it is no fluke that it's the weakest of the first five albums. I titled my review hit and miss because that is exactly what this album is. My review would be pretty close to spot on, why is that you ask. Well because if a person hated Zeppelin their review would be one sided, negative and not excatly true. If it was the other way around and it was a Zeppelin worshipper who thinks they could do no wrong you would not get any objectivity that way either. I fall somewhere in the middle i like Led Zeppelin or the Rip Off Kings as i like to call them. The problem i have is that there was an abundance of great mainstream and great obscure hard rock out at the same time Zeppelin were around and honestly after listening to pretty close all that the late 60's and early 70's had to offer over the last five years i can honestly say Zeppelin werent any better than a lot of these bands. The first song on Houses Of The Holy begins on a bad note The Song Remains The Same is horendous. I just picked up the cd today and couldnt make it through that song all the way. Whoever was the genius that recorded and used that vocal track needs a slap to the face. Either Plant disguised his voice to sound almost like a chipmunk for what reason??? or someone else used some studio trick to have him come out sounding nothing short of annoying (A FACT). The Rain Song is the second track and one of my favorites on the album it has some nice acoustic guitar and a decent not over the top vocal from Plant. It was raining hard today what a perfect song to be playing while hearing the rain outside. What the He ll is song three??? oh yah actually another winnner, Over The Hills And Far Away once again some more great acoustic playing from page and a great vocal from plant also good original lyrics that they didnt have to steal. I dont mind Dancing Days, No Quarter is great however the rest of the songs sound so generic, poppy and weak especially The Crunge, D'yer Maker and The Ocean. The Ocean has a lame and bad guitar tone sounding opening riff as far as John Bonham's drumming. I was never impressed he never intrested me he used to bang the drums hard big deal. Give me Buddy Rich, Carl Palmer, Don Brewer, Ian Paice, Danny Seraphine. If i wanna listen to someone bang the drums hard that is what  Keith Moon and Carmine Appice are for.s sound so generic, poppy and weak especially The Crunge, D'yer Maker and The Ocean.

B001RJXA7S|4.0|I have always enjoyed the vampire genre of movies and the different twists that each movie brings.  Blade, even though it is on the older side of things, is a great movie that brings the good versus evil conflict together with mystery and suspense.  The main character is so dynamic and tested in all ways to overcome his own demons and try to make the world a better place, even though he suffers for that world.  And, the good guys win the day.

The White House did not want the true story to get out. I guess they prefer their version, with their spin on it. This is a very good book that gives you a view behind the scenes at the true story, without any spin being put on it.

B008WCP2PG|2.0|I watched this film expecting to scream my head off.  After all, a few of my female co-workers stated, \\"Everyone in the theater was screaming!\\"<br /><br />I was bored.  Channing Tatum was in fine form.  However, for some reason, I kept thinking about Chris Brown during his dance performances.  The lead actress was terrible, and had absolutely no chemistry with Channing's character.  I kept thinking, is this an actress fresh out of acting school.<br /><br />The dance scenes were too few.  Alex Pettyfer played his role ok.  Matthew McConaughey fulfilled his obligation looking spectacular I might add. The rest of the cast was under used.<br /><br />Would I recommend Magic Mike?  Only if it was offered on Amazon Instant Video for 99 cents or free on Netflix.  Hard to believe this film made over $100 million dollars.  Women/Gays!  We deserve better!<br /><br />P.S.  The floppy bums on one of the dancers was quite laughable.  Sorry Adam.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|There were so many aspects of this movie that were great, and so many that were bad.<br /><br />(Spoilers!)<br /><br />First, the good.  The visuals are breathtaking.  I actually think they are better than Avatar.  Truly awesome.  Also, I thought it was pretty cool the way this movie ties in with Alien.  It's not a direct prequel, but it lives in the same universe.  We are introduced to the beings that the crew of the Nostromo run across on LV-426 in Alien.  Not sure if LV-426 is the setting for Prometheus or not, but it's definitely similar.  The special effects for the move are top notch.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  First, there's almost no character development.  You never really get a chance to get to know any of them.  Unlike Alien, where by the end of the movie we not only know Ripley, we like her and we're rooting for her, Prometheus never gives us a character to root for.  A few of the characters have real potential, most notably the captain of Prometheus.  It feels like we're supposed to really like this guy, but we don't get to know him well enough to get there.  In the end, there is no hero in this film, and no real antagonist, for that matter. In addition, there were too many unbelievable characters.  For example, the Holloway character.  This guy is supposed to be a scientist, yet he comes across as a loud-mouthed, moronic douchebag.  For example, while inside the alien ship, Dr. Douche realizes that the air inside is perfectly breathable and decides he wants to remove his helment, even while everyone else is urging him not to.  Dr. Douche doesn't once consider that while the air may be breathable, it may also be full of airborne contagions.<br /><br />Second, the story itself isn't developed well enough.  We're landing on the alien moon within the first few minutes of the movie.  I would have liked more development of the back story, the ancient carvings that led the scientists Shaw and Holloway to draw their conclusions, the challenges of convincingsomeone to fund a mission, etc.  I would have also liked more development of the story behind the Guy Pearce character.  This all seemed very rushed to me, and never realized fully.<br /><br />Third, there were too many stupid story elements.  For example, at one point in the movie, two of the Prometheus crew members get lost inside the alien ship.  A storm is coming, so no one can attempt a rescue mission.  The two lost crew members will have to spend the night in the alien ship, which I'm thinking would be a major issue.  No one really cares that these guys are lost inside of the most important discovery in the history of mankind.  The captain actually tells them that he's going to bed and to sleep tight.  Good luck, don't get into any trouble.  Don't you think real scientists would have been monitoring their every move, talking them through it, using this time to maybe explore in a scientific manner?  Nope.  Find a place to hole up and we may or may not come get you tomorrow.  I'm tired, nighty night.<br /><br />Also, I really need to point out that CO2 is not toxic.  This supposedly was the \\"toxic\\" substance in the air, and one of the characters even made the comment that the air was like car exhaust.  I think Ridley Scott is confused about the difference between carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.  It's carbon monoxide that is found in exhaust and is toxic to humans.  Yes, a person will suffocate from lack of oxygen if he/she walks into a room full of CO2, but it isn't poisonous like carbon monoxide.<br /><br />In the end, I expected a lot more from a master like Ridley Scott.  This movie suffered from the common ailment of more thought put into the visuals than the story and characters.  Too bad, because it had a lot of potential.

B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has  very scientifically based subject matter and the author really makes it readable.  I am actually going to start reading it again.  He is funny even at times.  But it's a serious subject and it makes you mad what has been done to wheat genetically, because I do love bread!  It's a good read and good to know.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Even after the big blockbuster that was the Avengers, Capt. America still hold up well. Can't wait for Capt. America: The Winter Soldier.

B0046MOVD0|5.0|so i saw this movie back when it first came out and i saw it in 3D.. movie has alot of parts in the movie where you can tell were put in for the sole purpose of 3D so if your watching the 2D version u might be like MEH hurry up like theres a scene where they stop in the middle of a crash and the camera scrolls across in 2D its not all that fascinating lol.. the movie was fun just like any resident evil movie its filled with over the top action and beautiful women killing zombies etc all in all hella worth the 12 bones i paid also includes many of the special features like the making ofs extended scenes etc..
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Abe Lincoln was not the Great Liberator, but the<br />Great Traitor of slaves; not setting them free, but<br />imprisoning them forever...<br /><br />XIII Amendment of the Constitution...<br /><br />Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.\\"<br /><br />'EXCEPT AS PUNISHMENT FOR CRIME WHEROF THE PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN DULY CONVICTED\\"<br /><br />He set them free, with conditions, that if they misbehaved or was found guilty and 'convicted', they would once against become a slave.

But, that's the way is now, movie, tv, just about everything is being taken over by them.  The great white minority is approaching.  This was suppose to be about a great white President, but they turned it into a black movie.  It was still good, but they hijacked it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Its a great read couldn't put it down. Cried at the end of book one and beginning of book two some parts of book three, the way book two ended throw me for a loop cliff hanger. Everyone needs fifty shades someone to cherish love and not want for anything must be great

0345803507|5.0|Was a great end to the trilogy. Hope there is a book 4. Could not put any of the 3 books down for long. Always picking them up and reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang avenged you. That scam the guy made of MCPE has made millions of more money, than every scam he sold. Be proud of your revenge!
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|I did not keep this game. I enjoy hidden object games. but to have to wait for them to &quot;magically &quot; appear gets a little old real quick.
B008MM9630|4.0|This game is very enjoyable.  It has the right amount if challenge.  It's better not to spend money on crystals and earn it.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Good puzzles and enough hidden object screens to keep the game moving. The &quot;back&quot; button however was not always easy to find and use.  Also I found the long travel between scenes to be a nuisance. However the game itself is very entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful book i love it i cant wait to read the second book catching fire  i love the hunger games
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Held my interest but kept waiting for the \\"excitement\\" of all the hype but it never happened. Didn't think it lived up to all the hype. I would recommend this book but don't expect  something  really wild or over the top. Christian Grey may not be a typical male but his lifestyle certainly isn't unique.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Makes you really look at all your relationships and how well you know anyone, including your children, spouse, or best friend.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like temple run because it is very cool and awesome. I also like temple run because it keeps me very quiet and my parents like when I am quiet as can be because trust me I am very loud.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is far more detailed than the original,  however I hate that it takes energy so long to regenerate.  I will have to be patient when I play...
B000VI12ZS|5.0|The American Indian's not only gave us a code, they won us a war! My daughter chose this movie as a project for extra credit for a school assignment, she not only learned a tremendous amount about the American Indians and what they did for our military, during such a horrific time in history. She cried at the end when the Indian soldier honored the American (Nicholas Cage) soldier with his young son and Nicholas Cage's dog tags. It was extremely emotional.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Perfect adaptation of the Frank Miller Book. I cant wait to see what the Joker will do in Part 2 next year.
0385535147|5.0|From other reviews, you should already know the plot of this book. So I will skip over the entire book and draw your attention to the Author's Notes at the end.  He says:  \\"Research, hardly a priority, was rarely called upon.  Accuracy was not deemed crucial.  Long paragraphs of fiction were used to avoid looking up facts.\\"  Well, my own note to author:  Please keep using this method because it just means I have less time to wait for your next good book to come out.  Really, I don't mind.  If the next books are going to be this good, please just keep making stuff up.<br /><br />For those of you who find it implausible or technically inaccurate - what was your first clue?  The fact that it is listed as a work of \\"fiction\\", perhaps?  There are plenty of excellent non-fiction books out there for all you lawyer wannabes to get yourselves known in your cocktail party circuits and golf courses as the pseudo legal experts. There's also law school, if that doesn't do it for you.<br /><br />Personally, I read purely for the entertainment and escape from a stressful day. Just keep me guessing and turning the pages. I am not a high brow literary critic and don't profess to be one.  I don't ask much from authors, just keep my attention, make it worth my time, and tie it all up at the end.  In short, give me a great story I haven't read a hundred times before.<br /><br />I was hooked at the first chapter in Grisham's early legal fiction works.  Then in later works, the books were either just forgettable or frustrating. Now lately, he's back and this latest work is right up there as a page turner, with everything tied up at the end.  Nice having you back, John.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was wonderful. I'm reading the second one now and I'm sure I'll read the third.  It is such a wonderful story line.  I'm sure that most of us can find a little of Christian and Anastasia in us.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This video has more crudity than has been mentioned. I thought it would be reminiscent of the 70 - 80s, but it was too cheesy.
0143121006|2.0|I don't even know why I gave this author two stars. He does write well, but the subject matter he writes about is just filth. Murder, drug addicts and elicite sex. Is this what still interests readers? Sad to say, there are a few very excited reader reviews that still get a kick out this trash. One word, LAME, both the readers who find this crap interesting and the author who cheapened himself to write a load of crap for money. I suppose I gave him at least two stars because he is a good business man, to know that sex, drugs and murder are always a seller for the dumb sheeple. BAAAAAAH
1607066017|4.0|Saga, Volume 1 is a collection of the first six stories in the Saga series. Brian K. Vaughan's brilliant storytelling, backed up by the bold artistry of Fiona Staples, offers adult readers an entertaining and impressive graphic novel. As the drama unfolds, Vaughan's fans will come to appreciate the depth of the plot and the well-rounded characters that take us on a journey bursting with unexpected twists and outcomes.<br /><br />Alana and Marko's story feels like it could have been adapted from a hardcore, science-fiction version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Alana and Marko are each from the opposing sides in an outrageous war that's expanded across the universe. Saga opens with the birth of their mixed-breed daughter; with wings from her mother and horns from her father. Aside from the opening scenes, the story is already taking a direction that show how far from ordinary it'll be. The narration sounds like it might be a third person omniscient point of view from someone with no ties to the main characters, but in reality, the narration is that of someone who is right in the middle of all the action. Hazel tells us the story of her birth and guides readers through the history of Alana and Marko's world. It was quite a surprise to recognize who the speaker is, but she bridges the story's subplots together so that the end result is smooth and tinged with chilling forewarning.<br /><br />An enormous reason why Saga drags you in and keeps you reading is because Vaughan creates a versatile dialogue. The dialogue captures each character's personality well, whether they fall along the lines of sarcastic, hateful, or pleasant. The illustrations were drawn with no limits so you never know what you might see next, but even Staples captures the danger, the tense moments, and character reactions impeccably. The characters' body language is very well in sync with their thoughts that sometimes you may not even need thought bubbles to get the sense of their next move.<br /><br />Saga is a story strictly written with an adult audience in mind. The language, the nude scenes and how the violence is depicted do not make for a story suitable for teens and younger. I thought the violence was slightly icky because you actually see the effect of someone being struck and afterwards when they're fatally injured, but it didn't completely turn me off from the story itself. I wouldn't recommend Saga to the more reserved readers or those who are relatively squeamish.<br /><br />Saga continues soon in Saga #7, and I'm so eager to see what awaits Alana and Marko. Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples have created a dynamic series that will definitely come as a surprise and entertaining treat to readers!<br /><br />*eGalley provided via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review*<br />Saga is a story strictly written with an adult audience in mind.

B005UBNKZG|5.0|Wife's 'puter needed upgrade, so decided to give her the Phenom X4 Black and myself this FX8120 (her needs are much less).  The 8120 went into the AM3+ I already had; Didn't really expect to see much improvement, with chipset being the same, etc.<br /><br />I run the 880G set with 16GB ram, 1.25 TB hard drive,couple dvds.  Operating system is Kubuntu 12.04.1 64.<br /><br />First thing I noticed is ram is in more usage.  Second is when I boot Windows XP in virtualbox, this thing is about like comparing an old Charger 426 to a 318 (something many won't know about).  The boot is a matter of seconds: remember the 'puter must start up VirtualBox first, then load Windows.  Actual boot time is 23 seconds start to finish.  Some of this seems due to the processor's better utilization of hard and soft memory, including drives.  Since I don't usually use windows any longer, except for some programs, to get a better handle on speed I opened my sound lab and did a modification of some old songs that needed pops removed, volumes adjusted and so forth.  That process was near twice as fast as with the Phenom.  Also, since virtualbox supplies the platform for windows to run, there are no issues about windows recognizing either the cpu or the 64 bit system, meaning windows runs much more smoothly than by itself.  Also, this removes the security issues Microsoft has always had.<br /><br />Also, once the cpu was installed and running (BTW, linux recognized and used the potential instantly) I decided to reinstall the 64 bit version of linux.  That installation was finished much more quickly than with the Phenom, strangely enough.  Also found that downloading large files seems quicker, probably due to the faster/more efficient memory/disk operations.<br /><br />Considering the multitasking aspect, since linux is much better at that than ms, I can have a dozen iterations of windows running, but setting tasks on each at the same time I can't do because the thing finishes a task more quickly than I can start more.  So if your standard usage includes the multitasking, this is a good one.<br /><br />Other reviews complain about the noisy fan when the thing revs up; frankly, I noticed it more with the Phenom than with the 8120.  Some of this is due to the fact that next to my box is a rather large true sine UPS (2kVA, runs all the computers/printers and such) which makes substantial noise, so commenting on that would mean little: I just don't notice the fan noise much.<br /><br />As an upgrade, then, this is probably one of the best I've done re performance boost in a single easy step.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|very fun game and challenging<br />I play everyday and enjoy it very much.<br />I have never had to buy a thing. if you play enough you will gain access to almost everything you need.
0061998885|5.0|Prayers For Rain is an interesting mystery novel.  The characters are likable.  I have read other novels written by Dennis Lehane and have liked them all.
1936891026|5.0|If you're anyone who knows you have to follow your heart and walk alone to fulfill your life's mission; If you know there's a project you need to do: like being an artist, an entrepreneur, or even considering having a kid, the this book is a MUST READ. I really loved the part about RESISTANCE, it is so so true!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I brought this for $50 which is expensive but if you really want another controller for our PS3 i think it is worth it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Clumsy design and very kludgey look. Couldn't keep it on my machine because the thing was so badly designed. Sorry, no cigar.
B00005AXKF|1.0|this is in german not english which it never mentions in the ad for it so for those of us who do not speak german it is a bomb
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is one of the best apps I have ever played. It was so time consuming I accidentally played for an hour not even knowing that I had untill later.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|App is really easy to use. Lots of good sharing options and encourages the &quot;jotting&quot;of ideas which I really like. The organizational structure of the app is also very nice. It allows for fast recall of notes and ideas. The only thing that I would love would be an integral note pad feature that would allow the inputting of hand written notes and sketches. You can attach these types of files from third party programs or apps. But having yjis feature right on the evernote dashboard would be really cool. But overall great design and execution!
1451695195|5.0|Hollywood could not have scripted a more plausible or powerful scenario to demonstrate the existence of heaven and the afterlife than the experience of Dr. Eben Alexander. A top neurosurgeon whose whole career was focused on the brain as the seat of consciousness, he got bacterial meningitis with no history of exposure. It was such a virulent form that it put him into a coma and stopped all his higher brain functions. According to current medical understanding, he could not have been thinking or even dreaming and should have died, yet he returns to life bursting with joy at having met God.<br /><br />Having been in a deep coma for six days his doctors expected him to be a vegetable should he even survive, yet he regained his full memory and faculties. Not surprisingly, the experience forever changed his understanding of consciousness and of our place in the universe. He tried every possible medical, physiological and biochemical alternative to explain his experience, yet each one was discounted in turn, leaving only the mystery.<br />I am reminded of the TV ad with the cell phone testers asking, \\"Can you hear me now?\\"<br /><br />As a radio host and reviewer I have received a surprisingly large number of books describing near death experiences, each one offering similar or complementary insights about the nature of death and divinity. One of the reasons this book stands out is that Dr. Alexander's credentials are unassailable, the case was impeccably documented, and he was a skeptic with no ax to grind for a divine or metaphysical explanation. We are also given enough of the scientific details to understand what a miracle this truly was.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written, and deftly interweaves his personal story with the drama of his illness, recovery and attempts to understand what happened. The lyrical description and the ineffable beauty of what he experienced \\"on the other side\\" will touch you deeply. \\"Proof of Heaven\\" makes your heart sing as you recognize the truth of our eternal connection to Source. Don't miss it.nize the truth of our eternal connection to Source. Don't miss it.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I always have to watch this movie at Christmas time. Its not Christmas time until I watch this movie.  Its so funny.  You can watch it every year and never stop laughing.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|The title pretty much sums it up. Its my favorite movie. Buy it, watch it and thank me....your welcome. Just reply to this review with words of praise and comments about my taste in movies.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I do not normally write book reviews, since I am less than qualified to critique anyone's writing ability. I read for the simple pleasure it provides.<br />Highly entertaining book. Not a \\"quick\\" read, but one that keeps you up at night reading way later than you should be because you just have to find out what happens next.<br />I will be anxiously awaiting the next book in this series.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|A must have for any DJ or dance music lover. This is my most favorite deadmau5 album to date. He has re invented house music for the masses.
0891419063|5.0|This book is raw and riveting!  It places you along side of Eugene Sledge as he takes you through the day to day drudgery of the horrific battle of the pacific war during WWII.  I learned of Eugene Sledge from the PBS documentary series \\"The War\\" by Ken Burns.  He was one of the characters featured regarding the pacific war.  After the war, and many tortured years of nightmares and struggle to return to a normal life, he became a professor of science.  He had kept diary notes of his service during the battles, against regulations, and years later converted them into this book at the urging of his wife.  It is a true view of war from the point of view of the infantryman.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|please fix glitches.  game freezes as I progress ..frustrating. how do u expect people to buy if there are problems. I like game but not if I cannot progress. time after time this is happening.  1 star until glitches fixed.

B005XN31LY|5.0|Very few TV shows worth watching today. After I watched the Pilot I couldn't stop and had watched the entire season in about two days.  Great twist on all of our favorite storybook characters.
B005K17RU0|3.0|not always the most accurate when i check it in the morning before a run.  prefer weather channel for accuracy.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I found \\"Casual Vacancy\\" to be a novel that was more about the agenda than it was about the characters.  I could not find a person or a plot that encouraged me to read on.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This book is really good, and you never see what happens.Its a little freaky, so i would not recommend it to young children.
1416909532|3.0|its an okay book. brings up many good points but the only downer for me personally is that they make the same point over and over. being more a bitch makes your relationship better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is aa really awesome game. It lots of fun because it is challeing but easy at the same time
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like the concept, the graphics are good, the guides are helpful, but the need to add cash comes up quickly.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great for meme funnies. It also has some good clip art. It lags on saving but it is fun to play around with photos.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is a real page turner, read it in two days.  Several story lines makes this book one you do not want to put down.  It is a thriller without being gorey.  Really enjoyed it, looking for other Baldacci books now.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is so awesome because you can evolve dragons and I'm in to pokemon so I'm into lots of stuff like that
B009UX2YAC|5.0|after reading all the other reviews I had to get this app its awesome it is just soo fun!I love it soo much I played like 50 games so far and I have had it for 12 hours.GET IT!!!

0425263916|5.0|Love this series!  I read this book in less than 36 hours!  Very fast read!  Would suggest this book and am now waiting impatiently for the next one in the Crossfire Series!
B008S4FZHI|4.0|Back to form in this one, leaves recent stories labouring. Enjoyed it very much will read it again to see if I can spot the killer earlier!
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I choose to read this after watching the film, normally I would do it the other way round.<br />This book is beautifully written & really pulls you in. I loved it & can't wait to read the next two.
B008EZVNFE|3.0|This young lady has a good voice.  A few of the songs were good.  The rest were soso. I wish her well.
B0032BMSKY|5.0|My husband said this is the best bib short he has so far. Very comfortable after 200k ride in a day. Great value for money. Highly recommended.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|From the IDOLS to finally letting her voice go.  What a great album  (cd) Love it , listen to it regularly.  All of the songs are good- rarely happens on a whole album.  Thanx Kelly, I knew you could do it.<br />Note-- I'm OLD, like really old and I really do totally enjoy listening to that CD. GREAT STUFF.
B000068TP0|5.0|Excelente Dvd, tiene las clasicas canciones de esta gran estrella, vale la pena tener este DVD, igual que los otros de Shakira! Yo recomiendo este DVD
1439190275|5.0|I have tried the dieting yo-yo so often, with many failed results.  I have read about the Atkins Diet numerous times, but never tried it.  This updated book is great.  You still have to count the carbs but it is a little less restrictive than the previous Atkins versions.  I have this book in a hard copy to read at home and also bought the Kindle edition to take with me on the go!  Highly reccommended
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Very handy/useful app.  Worked like a charm very first time.  Good AI as it auto-cropped perfectly and made usable pdf
B00782O7IY|5.0|Very entertaining black and white film.  Never did my attention waver.<br />The acting and the dancing were superb.  No wonder it won awards.
B000JBWWBK|3.0|I agree with J. Tavernier about including more songs. While they only used a line or two from some songs in the movie, others, like Boum, were critical to the plot (and you leave the theater humming them). There are 28 songs listed in the credits. While this soundtrack also includes the key 3 songs written by Marc Streitenfeld for the movie (Max-a-Million, Le Coin Perdu, and Wisdom). However, only 12 of the other 28 songs appear. (See [...] for the full list.)<br /><br />A note about J. Tavernier's list, he includes \\"40ft\\" by Franz Ferdinand and \\"Chances\\" by Athlete which are not listed as appearing in the movie. Also. his list does not include two songs that do appear: \\"No. 11 Final Du Deuxieme Acte\\" by Jacques Offenback and \\"2 Arabesques: NO. 1 Andantino con Moto\\" by Claude Debussy.<br /><br />If you have iTunes or some other song manager, you might consider combining the missing songs with the songs from this album to make the double album this CD should have been.
B00005NQCB|5.0|I have been looking for this cd at an affordable price for a year or so. I once had this cd but it was stolen. You can't get all the tracks somewhere else, and you cannot get the album as mp3. Now I have all the songs, and of course have the mp3's.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautiful and touching story. I've never laughed or cried so hard during the course of one single book. Simply beautiful.
B000RD0RDU|3.0|do its work correctly, blow a reasonable amount of air on my NB.<br />less noise than the 20mm thick version, less air flow also.<br />good compromise.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected In You:<br /><br />The first Novel was so-so. But after getting the second Novel I really got interested in it.<br />The first book was similar to another book (Fifty Shades Of Grey) And I had just finished that Trilogy, so I was not so interested in reading another such novel. BUT, once I got into the second book,(Reflected In You) I can't wait to read the third novel!<br />Sylvia Day is a wonderful writer!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  I thought is was a great action movie.It is also a great family movie for all ages
B009UX2YAC|4.0|never really liked these kinds of games but saw all the reviews. safe to say it is what everyone says it is. pretty fun &amp; pretty addictive!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. its just like the real coin games but you don't really lose any money. download it and let the fun begin you'll. love it too.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I really really wanted to like this more than I did. I feel like he has told this story before just with a different cast. It wasn't terrible, but when I finished, I felt unsatisfied. The twists in the plot were kinda predictable. The middle portion of the book really dragged for me. Again, it was not terrible, but I would not say it is a &#34;must read.&#34; maybe next time :/
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|this cable worked great original one rarely used but took it out of  case and the coating just started falling off the interior wire.  It was a little too scary to try to charge like that.  Amazon replaced the cable for me, provided<br />Fast shipping and i was back to reading. Thanks for the great customer service
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Having read the book and read the poor reviews and synopsis of the movie I decided not to even see the movie. Praise the author, shame the filmmakers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book because I like scary but not like horror.<br />I would recommend this book to people who like adventure books.
145162607X|2.0|SPOILERS ARE CONTAINED HERE REGARDING HOW THE BOOK EXPLAINS THE HISTORY OF WHICH WE ARE ALL AWARE:<br /><br />This book's strength, namely, the accessibility it offers to a complicated and debated piece of history by telling it in a simple, first-person point of view, becomes its weakness as the book wears on.<br /><br />We start with Anne Neville as a child, and her freshness is charming.  We know the history so it's interesting to see it from an innocent point of view.  But as she grows up, her maturity fails to expand our view of the story.  The first person POV is severely limited in how much it can hint of the possible motivations of all the players.<br /><br />WARNING:  BIG SPOILER COMING SO YOU MAY WANT TO STOP HERE. THIS WILL BE THE LAST WARNING.<br /><br />Anne's defining moment is her refusal to katow to her sister Isabel and the sister's husband George of Clarence.  Anne demands a share of their mother's inheritance, but rather than heroic defiance, it seems scaled smaller--one sister saying to another, you cannot have everything. The sibling rivalry seems petty and commonplace given the way the two have stood by each other earlier.<br /><br />The book becomes claustrophobically frustrating with each page after the first two thirds. She has been depicted as in love with Richard, and now we doubt that he ever loved her.  Was it all as her mother maliciously insists, a ruse to be able to divorce her when it suits his purposes?  Can it be that he is plotting to marry a younger woman, now that they have arrived upon the throne?  This book's Anne never confronts him about this, just as she never brings up the matter of obtaining a dispensation to fully legalize their marriage. The reader may suspect he is poisoning her to death instead of taking the divorce route because it grows naturally from what we are seeing, but Anne never makes this explicit. There is only so much we can see from her eyes, and we feel as the book closes, that she is willing herself to blindness.<br /><br />It might have happened this way, but the story as told seems flat and narrow. At the end, I feel less a sense of illumination than merely glad that it's over.  The simple first person POV also presents her state of mind redundantly, and while this may be accurate in the way people tend to repeat things, it also makes the novel boring.
B009CREQJS|4.0|Just don't accidentally buy the [clean] version. Billie Joe drops the f-bomb quite a bit, which is fine with me, but on the clean version, the editing is distracting. As far as the music goes, it isn't like either of the last two albums as far as being a so-called \\"rock opera\\", but it's not supposed to be. It is a bit similar in sound, and my teenage son and I ended up in a long discussion about whether or not this and the next two albums might just be stuff that didn't work with the last two. Overall, we enjoyed it.
B009ARMS1I|5.0|Fantastic as always! I accidentally ordered it and I enjoyed every minute. My fiance was not too happy when he found out I bought it... but he is still marrying me!
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Ken Follett  should be ashamed of this reprehensible piece of  crude fiction.  Scattered throughout are oral sex scenes with the backdrop of World War Two bombing duds in every vignette.  The story is written with a fan fiction mentality seared in an author's brain, who for some reason could not get his mind off the tasteless bizarre picture of girl and boy meeting of the mouth on the penis kind.<br /><br />2011 was a very good year.  i'll return to my favorite book of that year for an  enjoyable second reading of the acclaimed uplifting book, Unbroken.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good characters, same Jack--inscrutible --and predicable ending.  Doesn't this guy get cold or hungry or sick of being beat up and dirty?
B008IJT0CE|1.0|Very annoying app!  Skips like crazy and will keep you awake.<br /><br />Avoid!!!!  Thought it was supposed to be relaxing but will drive you nuts with the constant skipping of the sound.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|John Mayer is a one of a kind, phenomenal talent. \\"Where the Light Is\\", is actually 3 concerts in one and it plays more like a full length movie than a concert performance. Mayer shares everthing with rare backstage glimpses and the camera close-ups of this guitarist at work on stage are the best ever!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers was even better than expected and Joss Whedon steered the ship masterfully, Hulk definitely stole the show. Can't wait for the sequel!
B004EPZ02A|1.0|I am extremely disappointed..... The Blue Ray I ordered doesn't work. It constantly freezes at certain parts of the movie which is very frustrating. Boo!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have bee waitting for ever 4 this app to come out on kendle to days my b day so it was like a b day present!!!!<br />:)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Really enjoyed the theme and the excellent cast. It's a touching story with a few interesting twists and lots of chance occurrences that remind us how small the world is.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|That was the sense I got from this newest CD. Testament brilliantly mixed elements from those three CDs into this new one and boy does it work!!! IN many ways it's a natural progression from \\"Formation\\", but to me,I hear elements of those past gems in this one as well..and I love it!!<br /><br />I always felt like Testament was the Rodney Dangerfield of thrash (no respect). Sure they may not be as popular as The big 4..but they seldom disappoint, while they might explore a little (demonic), they always come back home.<br /><br />The riffs manage to keep you engaged, and Chuck sounds like, well...Chuck!! Rhythm section is nice and tight, and Alex...well what can you say about Alex that hasn't been...imo...along with Broderick in Megadeth, Alex is by far the most proficient soloist of any of the big guns of thrash (Slayer,Anthrax,Metallica,Testament,Exodus..etc...). He plays with such melody, even adding bluesy and jazz components so well..<br /><br />one of my favorite tracks is \\"man kills mankind\\" for the solo (and the rhythm UNDER the solo that is brutal!!), but also the almost RUSH-like prequel to the solo.<br /><br />personally I was not a fan of their 'Demonic' era stuff, and I'm glad Chuck went back to his roots (his dark roots if you will...ha ha). He has such a unique voice in the thrash community and 'cookie monster' vocals don't suit him...Chuck is back to doing what he does best..and I love it.and I love this CD...you won't be disappointed!!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|In short, fans of the Alien films should find a lot to like in Prometheus, a sci-fi film that isn't afraid to ask questions and leave more than a few new ones unanswered in the process. Great performances by Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron make this film a must watch while Noomi Rapace of \\"Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" fame and Idris Elba (The Wire) get to shine also. There are plenty of tense moments, especially one in particular involving an automated surgery that make this film a must watch as well. This is good, smart sci-fi with great production value and a willingness by its creators to pose queries and challenge its audience a bit more than your usual schlock.<br /><br />The picture and sound on this Blu-Ray edition of Prometheus is pretty much perfect, especially the surround sound which gives your speakers a proper workout. The end of the film is especially bass heavy and pretty spectacular. I'm disappointed that the documentary that is available on the 3D edition of the film is nowhere to be found but you do get some deleted/alternate sequences complete with editor commentary, as well as a director commentary by Sir Ridley Scott and a separate one with the writers, Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindleof. I'm not a fan of the practice of packing these sets with a bonus DVD but I do appreciate the included digital copy that you can get via iTunes (preferred) or the terrible Ultraviolet service.
B008476HBM|5.0|a wonderful book,so hard to put down. A true English classic that is hopelessly romantic<br /><br />Would definitely recommend this book
B009UX2YAC|1.0|sucks I mean bad graphics . when I tapped one way Jake did not move. My advice do not buy game.Get the full versoin if possible.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The title of my review pretty much sums it up. I can go for weeks and never tap into this app but at a very hard time my husband and I were going through -it pops up and wanted to know if I'd like to take just a minute to read some words from it. Its as if it knows we needed help and wanted to show us how to get it. Thank You Jesus , Thank You !!!
B008WCP2KG|1.0|Digital download can not be used with iTunes!  Wish amazon would make this disclosure somewhere on the item listing.... now i'm stuck with the stupid thing since i refuse to use flixster!  I will never buy another Ultraviolet copy again.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all times!! I think everyone should go get this movie and have as action packed movie night
0761171703|5.0|For anyone who doesn't already know his work (and he's been a New York treasure for years), this book is a perfect introduction to photographer Jordan Matter--an artist who is equal parts technical master, thoughtful witness, and great lover of mischief. Both his books, Uncovered and now Dancers Among Us, have involved high-risk shoots that probably should have gotten him in some form of trouble, even when they didn't. But a general disinterest in permission is the brand of any self-respecting auteur, and Matter comes away with photographs so remarkably unique, it's just too easy to enjoy him.<br /><br />This book in particular is a portrait of the photographer as much as his subjects. Yes, there are pages upon pages of gorgeous, virtuosic dancers doing incredible things in unexpected spaces--from lovers kissing upside down under the Santa Monica Pier as the tide rolls in, to a pickaxe-wielding farmhand leaping to his chores like a gazelle, his body suspended some 10 feet off the ground. There are charming guest appearances by performance legends Bill Irwin and Bebe Neuwirth (both seemingly ageless). But they're framed by intimate stories from Matter himself--reflections on his youth, his wife, his children and his own journey from aspiring athlete to creative photographer, from rootless youth to proud husband and father. These stories establish the book's many quotations (from Mae West, Edith Wharton, Samuel Beckett and others) as expressions of the artist's own spiritual compass. Through words, they present a path toward welcoming the essence of a dancer in ecstatic motion into our own souls.<br /><br />Make no mistake, the beauty and athleticism in Dancers Among Us is jaw-dropping. The narratives these images create, in an instant, are delightful. Many locations are stunning (and clear evidence of one epic road trip). But as both his published works demonstrate, Matter is no coffee table book photographer. We don't just see, we're asked to think, and reflect, andappreciate--and think again. Matter's images always come contextualized with stories. It turns out his are as wonderful as anyone else's.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This game has a lot of great features. My kids love all the backgrounds and the stamps and stickers. It is a great way for them to express their creativity.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I liked this movie so much that I went to the theater to see it twice, (have not done this but one other time), then bought the blue ray.  We need more works that tell stories of our great men and women that give all to keep us safe.  We take to much for granted and often forget these people.
B0007LXPBI|1.0|Not funny, just mushy. . .<br /><br />This is supposed to be a romantic comedy. I like this genre, but the story was so predictable and mushy that i could not even force a smile or a chuckle.
0525953728|5.0|I did not find anything in this book that gave away info that other books have no already said.  What it does do is give the first hand experience of one that was there.  I give credit to the author for having the courage to write it.  Some time you just need to set the record straight.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|This classic Sci-fi hit never gets old.  Stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn all shine showing you the terror that would come from fighting an unrelenting single minded enemy.  And stand by for the plot twist that comes with T2!

0061733199|3.0|This book starts out as an interesting read but quickly turned into a tech manual it is good but just theory no practicality
1401322786|3.0|Well, I requested to review this book via Netgalley as I have heard so many people talking about it.  I have to be honest and say that I have very mixed feelings, hence the 3 star rating.  While I like the premise of the story, I found it a little hard to get into in the beginning.  The book is shorter, only 240 pages, so it is a quick read if you want something that you will get through quickly.  I cannot really comment as to format and editing, something I would normally comment on, as this was an uncorrected advanced reader's proof, so there is no guarantee that what I saw is what you will see.<br /><br />The concept of the history of time was intriguing, and I found that I could easily relate with Sarah Lemon, having see quite a bit of myself in the character.  I found the characters mostly believable, although Victor seemed a little...off.  I really do not know how to quantify that, but something about the character bothered me.<br /><br />The story is well written, of that I am sure.  If you like looking at the history of things (whether real or fictional), this book is entertaining and intriguing and it does make you think about how you have lived your life and how you should be living.<br /><br />The point of view/plotline were slightly disjointed, and this is probably why I had trouble with it.  Admittedly, I have ADHD, and sometimes story lines that jump back and forth are difficult for me to follow along with, and that could be a big part of why this book just did not seem to grab me like I hoped it would.<br /><br />If you are intrigued by the cover or the description, I would give it a shot.  It was an interesting read, just was not my thing.
B005S9ELM6|5.0|To eyes grown used to modern effects, this might seem bland - it's just actors acting. Modern eyes need to see what that means, and this shows it.<br /><br />Even the acting is subdued - the first two thirds combine documentary, bureaucratic procedural, and claustrophobia. The historical facts and the escap have drama of their own, especially for those of us who remember the events, at least as the media could show them. Lots of scene-setting and character-building. You know, the slow stuff. The drama builds, though, as tempers fray and the gears of the hierarchy slowly grind.<br /><br />Then, the exfiltration (i.e., escape) specialist arrives on scene. From that point, the movie really begins. Tensions rise with the political pressure. Then, the clock becomes a worse enemy than the revolutionaries. The refuge closes, the cover story demands too much exposure, events move faster than the rescuer. This sustains a \\"down to the last second\\" breathlessness better than anything I've seen. Think about those Bond movies with the bomb ticking 5..4..3..2..1..... - like that, but with international intrigue on each side of the timer. Tension sustains down to the very last moment, which you'll see for yourself.<br /><br />And, behind it all, there's a very real piece of recent history. This escape really happened, and in roughly the way the movie shows. (I imagine some artistic license, but it doesn't seem too licentious.) That reality, with everyone a bullet away from death, gives an edge of reality that normal scripting can never achieve. Then, in the trailers, they show the real diplomats side by side with the actors representing them - the matching is just amazing.<br /><br />This movie needs to be seen. It brings plain old acting and drama back to the screen, and brilliantly. I don't say this often, but I could see this one again, soon. And again, and again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I bought a $50 Kindle Fire case at Best Buy which I returned after finding this case on Amazon. Half the price and twice as nice. This case has a nice texture and feel on the outside of the case and is slip resistant so your kindle is less likely to go falling to the floor. I love the elastic band for holding the cover back when I am reading and holding the case more secure when I carry it in my bag. Also much easier to hold in bed. I really like the fact that the screen can be positioned at any angle. I prop my Kindle Fire up on the coffee table and with a flick I am at the next page and am hands free while reading, I even prop it up like that when I am reading in bed sometimes. Mine is red and the color and design of the cover is pretty. I am very pleased with this purchase and price.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Wow, Fun for kids of all ages. I downloaded it for my kids on kindle fire. Then loaded on my phone for me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead continues to be amongst my favorite shows.  Who needs Dish when you can purchase a season pass on Amazon for a whole lot less.  Season 3 continues to be just as enjoyable if not better then the first 2 seasons.  Highly recommend this show to anyone whether you enjoy the Zombie genre or not its just good drama.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app. It is very accurate and updates quite often. I am able to add multiple cities and go back and forth very easily between them. It shows not only just the current weather, but 10 days, tommorow, it shows the times. It shows humidity, dew point, highs, lows, sunrise, sunset.. ect.
B009FZZK8I|4.0|Fairly entertaining look behind the scenes of the Walking Dead.  Its cool to see some candid interviews with some of the cast memebers.  Who knew the actor who plays Rick has an english accent.  If your a fan of the show you will enjoy this look behind the scenes.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Defintely not the facebook app i have on my phone. Half the time it doesnt load, if I click \\"like\\" it doesnt show up, it only shows about half of my news feeds. I hate it.

B00028HBKC|5.0|Great film as an ever present reminder. Always like to have a look again every so oftern .Glad i made the purchase to have in my library of DVDs
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|it is a good puzzle game.  the best I have played on my kindle, so far.  you should try it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is tons of fun and you can play for hours and never get bored. I love this game!
1594203059|5.0|Niall Ferguson does a masterful job of capturing the rise of Western civilization and its impact on the rest of the world.  His identification of five \\"killer apps\\" that enabled small European powers to become world-wide empires provides a nice structure for what can sometimes be an overwhelming amount of detail.  I'm not sure that everything Ferguson postulates is true, but it provides a cohesive and convincing way of understanding the rise of Western civilization from 1500 onward.  I found that I kept thinking back to the thought-provoking book Guns, Germs and Steel that assays much of the same territory from a different - and I think complementary - perspective.  If you want a big picture view of modern history, I think you will find this book valuable.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Read in 5 hours couldn't put,it down!!! With that much time on ones hands being locked up, I could see where he had plenty of time to make it all happen!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Simple to use and very easy to play.  Hours of fun to idle away extra time.  I found no glitches to stop play.<br />Go for it.
B007G8SET8|3.0|Thy have some many albums titled heavy metal thunder ... I was looking for documentary DVD of the life of the band. But this is not bad at all it has a lot of good tracks , and great sound . I'll give it 4 stars.
B003K15IF8|4.0|This was a book about a man whose entire life seemed to be filled with both fulfillment and disappointment .  He seemed to struggle to achieve his goals yet got great satisfaction in them.<br />His personal life was not very satisfying except for one period when he was completely happy.  I think he was quite complex though he didn't realize it.  I will continue to think about<br />Stoner for a long time.<br /><br />ML
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire ---gets stuck at a location sometimes, but eventally syncs back to location you want
B009UX2YAC|5.0|better than any game ive ever played its so fun and addictive I couldn't wait for it to come on amazon
B002GYKTS6|5.0|More Wilson and band greatness here. If any one of these tracks comes on while the pod is on shuffle I enjoy it...like anything else I have heard where Mr Wilson is involved. It's just worthy of respect IMHO.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Fall of Giants was so compelling looked forward to this 2nd volume; however this book introduces so many additional characters it's a struggle to appreciate the story line.
B00070DK14|5.0|Saw this tour...have the t-shirt here abouts somewhere. I use to see Tull every couple of years first in 1971 and the last one was The Rock Island tour so it's been a while. I have total confidence that were I to see Tull these days it would be money well spent...if Anderson and Barre are there I'm there.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Those saying this is not a prequel to the movie Alien need to understand what a prequel is.  This movie sets up the story from being an earthbound species to the world we see in the movie Alien.  It shows the origins of the original xenomorph species, and while it doesnt show the exact alien from the first movie, nor the planet, wait until the very last scene, and you will see something very familiar.  This movie was amazing, it is quickly becoming one of my favorites.
B00006JKOM|5.0|Ah 1976, 20 years old and right into music and many other assorted pastimes. A very good year indeed! This record was another worthy notch in the Tull catalog...no doubt. I'm so lucky to have been born when I was because I will agree there isn't as  music that's listenable out there now.... nowhere near the high percentage of it all now that there was back in the mid 60's to the late 70's. Can't convince me otherwise..sorry!
B00785P2QC|3.0|I'm loving this game, theirs no other game like it. I would to see a farm game made by you guys that would make my day.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Decided to pick this book up on a whim, really glad I did. Really liked the characters, and adventures both past and present were fun and interesting. It was hard to stop reading once I got going.
B004UPAIDK|5.0|Evil Dead 2 is a direct sequel to The Evil Dead and continues the story of Ash as he battles the evil that was unleashed; he is joined by a new group, which includes the professor's daughter, her research partner, and Jake and Bobby. The story is fairly simple but engaging and fun to watch.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell does a great job reprising his role as the groovy Ash. The rest of the acting was also great, at least for a film from the 80s. The special effects were amazing, especially if you're a fan of the old-school gore and make-up effects; it has plenty of gore and possessions to show off these great effects. I've always enjoyed the laughing/giggling sequences in these films, they're both weird and eerie. Evil Dead 2 has some very funny and some horrific moments, this blend makes the film even more memorable; you'll never forget the moment Ash attaches his chainsaw to his arm and creates a sawed off shotgun. The ending was great and sets up the film perfectly for the follow-up.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Evil Dead 2 for purchase or rental; it's fun and an effective time-killer. As of 10/27/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video, if you'd like to watch before purchasing.<br /><br />Evil Dead 2 has very extreme violence and gore, no sex or nudity.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|We received this video in a very timely matter.  It was a video that addressed the problem that my friend has with her grandson and is now giving her hope for him.  Quality was great and once again Amazon delivered as it said it would.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|I just finished this book, Fall of the Giants.  As someone who enjoys reading historical fiction, this book did a good job of portraying the political events that led up to WWI. Although I could have done with a little less battle descriptions, the interesting angle was really the politics and thinking of that time period.<br /><br />Yes, I plan to read the sequel.  I'd recommend reading this book if you really enjoy war stories, facts, battle discussions, and political views.  I enjoyed the characters but often times felt the style of jumping to different characters took away from the story.
B004SBX112|2.0|Well here we go again! Another Angry Birds update has come out and not only does the Amazon app store lack the new seasons update we still haven't gotten the update for the original Angry Birds. So until Amazon gets it together I will be using the play store for my app purchases!
B007UPNA6Y|1.0|Very disappointed with this lateast book by Lee Child. I think he should hang up the pen with the Jack Reacher character. Very predictable and poor story line.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I commenced this book series, I inintially believed it to be a erotic based book, but as I continued from book 1 to book 2 & 3, it became obvious to me it was a story of romance and conversion for both Anastasia and Mr. Grey.  I enjoyed the series v-e-r-y much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|sooooooooo good it is awesome I love it great picture on my kindle fire and great graphics you van buy different poeple and save up for other things<br />my advise GET IT FOR SURE
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Well Lee Child does not disappoint with Wanted Man.  However, the ending is a little too pat.  It's like we don't know that Jack will kill about 20 guys and never get a scratch.  Everything is just a little too convenient.  Child needs to stretch himself a little and not fall back on superman Jack.  Even his busted nose helps him in this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun and easy to play and unlike real solitaire you can choose to be dealt a winable hand.  Knowing that a game is winable makes you think twiice before choosing a move.

B003WMX3SY|4.0|I LOVE this case.  It is excellent.  I run several servers out of my house, have for years.  This one has excellent handles built into the top, as it is a gaming tower made to be trans ported.<br /><br />It has room for improvement.  It did not come with a single screw!  The drives mount on bungee rails, but the rails (plastic that slides over on the bungee cords to keep from shocking the drive while it is being transported).  the problem is the case does not come with the proper screws.  The plastic slide has a recessed hole so you cannot use the typical drive screw, it needs to have a narrow head to allow the screw to go into the hole therefore allowing it to be long enough.  So make sure you order a screw kit!<br /><br />The design is pretty nice, it is kind of heavy when loaded with 2TB WD black label drives!  But I Love it!  I will have this case for many years to come.<br /><br />The cooling is impeccable!  The two fans on the side (you see in the picture, left side) have speed switches attached too them.  You can put them on low or high speed.  No heating problems in this tower!<br /><br />You will need a screw driver with it.  Mounting the HDD's to the rails, mounting the power supply in its removable cage and For the front DVD/Blue ray slots - other than that you wont need a screw driver to access any part of the case.  The doors near where the drives go (front sides) are 100 % removable.  They swing open and in just the right part of the swing can be removed completely while working on it).<br /><br />The drives can be mounted in front to back orientation or side to side orientation.  I chose side to side in mine as it left more air flow over the mother board.  This case is also larger than it looks, its pretty big!<br /><br />If you had more than one, they would not stack very well.  I was looking how I could stack them and I would have to use something to do it ... to put something between the towers.  I guess if you layed them down on their sides you could stack them.<br /><br />Antec did a great job - but there is room for improvement!  Drive mounting screws should be the first improvement!  (that was frustrating) but either way, I Love the case and will order more of them.<br /><br />One other thing - the sides look like they are metal - but they are plastic.  the only metal are the screws that hold the sides on (thumb screws), the plate for the motherboard, the cage that holds the power supply and the frame. Everything else is plastic - so its pretty pricey considering that it does not come with a power supply.<br /><br />One other improvement I would like to see is to perforate the mother board mounting plate - it is solid metal and does not have any venting holes in it.  It is not something I am concerned about but it would be a nice improvement.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Timber
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Another brilliant Hitchcock concoction. Terrific in every way. Especially the methodical way Norman cleaned the room, more frightening than the murder. Obvious he had cleaned up before, bone chilling.Loved it. If I could give it more stars I would.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|All star Cast with everyone exceeding my expectations. Of course an action movie doesn't need much reason behind the story but this particular one was played out quite well. And the action was top notch.

B0046ECJBY|4.0|It's good for you, but it's not enjoyable.<br /><br />The information presented is really interesting. And Kissinger does a good job of trying to get the Chinese point of view across.<br /><br />But the writing is pedantic, repetitive, and boring. I feel sorry for anyone who's had to listen to Dr. Kissinger at length. Of course, that may be the secret to his success as a diplomat - the other party saying they'll agree to anything just to end the conversation.<br /><br />So really good book, well worth reading. But it's not an enjoyable read.

B0099G6Q5E|5.0|SO GOOD. I have even seen the movie a second time, it's all so worth it. Buy the soundtrack and you won't stop listening to it for a week.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Scalzi's premise of only being allowed to join the army after age 75 is a good one. It opens up many possibilities for plot and character development. Coupled with the offer of becoming young again in body, the story offers its characters compelling reasons to join the CDF and defend the colonies. I would recommend this book to all sci-fi buffs as a good read - I was sad when it ended, but enticed by the promise of a sequel.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|If you came looking for xenomorphs and Colonial Marines, you left disappointd (and likely savaged the film because you didnt understand it).  Prometheus is an origin story, not only of the xenos, but of US.  As such it was more philosophical and open-ended than a simple shoot-em-up.  Dont get me wrong, Aliens is still my favourite of the series, but this one is the only one that requires you to THINK.  The Engineers sent an ambassador \\"two thousand years ago.\\"  They were horrified how he was treated.  So horrified that their ultimate biological weapon (that was to have been used on Earth if we, their creation, had not turned out right), which reacted to strong emotional energy, went off without their control, killing them all.<br /><br />Lets see, human mythology, a couple millenia before the events of Prometheus... Space Jesus.  Yes, Jesus was an alien sent here by our Engineer creators to check up on us.  Humanity not only rejected him, it slew him in horrific fashion and perverted his message into one of hate and bigotry.  They would have used the canisters on us, except that they were so distraught over the treatment of their ambassador that the canisters overcame the safeties and set themselves off.<br /><br />There.  Now you understand Prometheus.  Watch it again in a new light.  Give it the 4-5 stars it deserves, not the 2-3 for not having pulse rifles and flamethrowers.
0575095830|4.0|ANALYSIS: To say this book was highly anticipated would be an understatement, once it was announced that this book would be featuring the return of Logen Ninefingers. A character that has been synonymous with the term \\"bad-ass\\" along with other famous ones such as Druss, Anomander Rake, Waylander, Oberyn Martell etc.<br /><br />After reading the ending to the First Law trilogy, many readers were left stymied a bit with it. Most characters had an ending that belied their start however for one particular character the journey was a full circle. People were left wondering what exactly happened to Ninefingers and this book answers the pivotal question of his survival without divulging any particular details as to how. The following review will have some minor spoilers for the previous five books and for this one so be warned for those who haven't read all the previous titles.<br /><br />The story begins in a bloody fashion of sorts wherein we are introduced to the main protagonists Shy South and Temple. Shy is a person who has had a rough adolescence and is now learning to live straight. She has her stepfather Lamb to help her out however with his timid behavior it often turns out that she has to step in to take care of situations as they arise. Temple is a jack-of-many-trades, who considers himself a coward of the highest order and is currently working as the legal counsel to Nicomo Cosca and his band of mercenaries.<br /><br />Both characters have a journey ahead of them thanks to the actions of others and this is where this fantasy western story really explores the arc of each and every character. The story is focused on Shy & Lamb's search for Ro & Pit, the two missing children who have been abducted along with a host of others by an outlaw called Grega Cantliss. Their search however will cross roads with Nicomo Cosca and his band of mercenaries that include Temple and sergeant Friendly (seen previously in Best Served Cold).  Cosca is going along with the inquisition to root out the rebels and is actively searching for a specific rebel leader.<br /><br />For me this book was the best of Joe's standalone books and possibly one, that is great for all those wanting to see and read more about Ninefingers as he returns in a bloody manner as befitting his nature. The story follows a couple of plot threads that start divergently but soon merge in a surprising way that makes the book slightly more streamlined.  Shy South and Temple can be said to be the main POV characters among the various ones featured in the book; however the sad part is that we don't get a POV from the character that we want to know about the most.<br /><br />This part seriously was the biggest downer of the story for me as with everyone else I wanted to know about Logen and what he had been doing after his betrayal by Black Dow. We never get a clear cut idea about whether his so-called berserker state is super-natural or just a part of his mental persona. The author certainly loses points for this move as to not feature Ninefingers as a POV robs the story mightily of its sheen.<br /><br />The pacing of the story however is spot on and we get a story that is a western as well as a redemption tale. The character arcs explored are very similar to a Stephen King story wherein flawed characters either make it or they don't but their journey will be one that enthralls the readers and powers the story completely. Plus Logen Ninefingers finally transcends his journey into an iconic one by accepting who he is and what he is not, hopefully the author might provide further illumination by featuring him in more stories.<br /><br />I was waiting to know all and be enchanted by Logen's presence in the book but to paraphrase Logen himself \\"you have to be realistic about these things.\\" The ending of Red Country is perhaps much more optimistic than of the First Law trilogy and for that I'm glad however it is still as open ended as its predecessor and that might be a sticky pointfor some. I loved this book and the way the story ends readers will be hoping that we get to know more about what happens next for several characters.<br /><br />Joe Abercrombie definitely knows how to write a story, he also knows to create memorable characters but his strongest suit is his dialogue and writing copious amounts of black humor. This book is no stranger to these facts and it manages to be the most uplifting of all his standalone books by virtue of twists and turns of this story. The book is a complete winner for all fans waiting for the return of one of the most iconic barbarians ever, however for fans wanting to know Logen's inner thoughts they might just have to wait a little longer. Dive in to read another fantastic effort by a veritable fantasy writer who is the first law when it comes to writing dark, bloody, action packed stories.for some.

It is violent, funny, vulgar and has lots of surprises and entertaining aspects to it.  Yes it has some dumb moments and some stereotypical characters but come with the territory.  Maybe I was going in with low expectations but happy I watched it.

0345536886|3.0|This is another entertaining read from John Grisham. A young lawyer, David Zinc, cracks one morning under the strain of his job at a top Chicago firm. On arriving at work, instead of marching dutifully to his desk, he leaps back into the elevator, runs out to the street and soon finds himself in a bar where he spends the rest of the day drinking himself into oblivion.<br /><br />Hours later, David stumbles out of the bar and into a cab and then finds himself on the doorstep of the law firm of Finley and Figg in one of the city's less than desirable neighborhoods. Wally Figg and Oscar Finley are a couple of ambulance chasers who literally bolt from their desks and race out into the street at the tantalizing sound of a car crash. After a fairly long partnership, they are barely scraping by.<br /><br />David happens by just as a major accident occurs in front of the offices of Finley and Figg. Oscar and Wally run out and attempt to recruit clients from among the victims and in the aftermath, David convinces them to hire him. He is willing to work for practically no base salary along with a share of the fees that he generates.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, Wally Figg stumbles across what he believes to be the chance of a legal lifetime. A study suggests that Krayoxx, a very popular cholesterol drug, may be having deadly side effects. One of Finley and Figg's clients who took the drug has just died, and Wally is determined to round up as many other apparent Krayoxx victims as he can find and sue Varrick Labs, the giant drug maker that produced Krayoxx.<br /><br />The fact that no member of the firm has any experience in such cases deters Wally not in the slightest. Nor does the fact that none of the three members of the firm has ever appeared in a real court trial of any consequence. Nor does the fact that the firm has no money to hire the experts required to actually make the case. Oscar and David have serious reservations about the whole idea, but Wally insists that it's a can't-miss proposition and before long, the visions of a giant financial windfall overpower the better judgment of the other two members of the firm. The consequences are interesting to say the least.<br /><br />This is a lighter and more humorous book than some of Mr. Grisham's more recent novels and it offers an interesting look into the world of the lawyers who make a career out of putting together large class action lawsuits in the hope of making fortunes out of the fees involved. It should appeal to a large number of readers.t's a can't-miss proposition and before long, the visions of a giant financial windfall overpower the better judgment of the other two members of the firm.

B00425S1H8|5.0|Works without a driver on Linux, works immediately after installing a tiny driver in OS X, and works after driver install and a reboot on Windows.<br /><br />One note about this device; it's mimicking an old school serial port from the days where stuff was called DCE and DTE.  While it may seem silly that you can't just plug the thing into your UPS or whatever, you couldn't do that back \\"in the day\\" when serial ports were on the motherboard or on an expansion card -- you HAD to use a cable.  And on that cable, were the screws.<br /><br />Yes, a bit strange that you have to use a cable on the end of a cable, but adhering to the traditional thinking assures all those legacy console cables will fit and if necessary, can be secured into the device so they don't slip out while the user is rescuing the interwebs.<br /><br />Five stars, I carry an extra in my bag and find it a very popular tool around the office as people try to configure switches, routers, PDUs, or whatever.<br /><br />-

It follows a star wars type plot Good first ending, weird not bad, not good second book and third book gets better... kind of.<br /><br />Makes you wonder if the US is really that far from this book with games like survivor on TV.  But I really did like it.
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|Cool app that I love letting my kids use, before it just wanted permission to read/write to SD Card ( I've yet to update). Now? Access to networks, connect to the Internet, etcetera. Why? Any new options besides camera use and setting wallpaper? Did it really need access to my network? It's not nearly as bad as other apps but I simply don't like apps requiring access to my connected network without explaining why.
B009AJDDQU|2.0|I will avoid a distillation of my philosophical and theological misgivings with \\"Prometheus.\\" All I will just say is that the film is a scientistic reiteration of Gnostic creatology laced with misotheism. Such an interpretation of our origins disagrees with my own outlook. Moreover, it is a stale hypothesis that creates more questions than it answers. That aside, I think that \\"Prometheus\\" also falls short in terms of storytelling.<br /><br />Yes, the film is replete with dazzling visuals and vibrant colors. My heart was gladdened by Ridley Scott's rediscovery of these elements. They were the very same elements that highlighted films like \\"Legend,\\" \\"Bladerunner,\\" and the magisterial \\"1492: Conquest of Paradise.\\" In recent years, Scott has eschewed such breathtaking visual elements in favor of an earthier, visceral style (e.g., \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" \\"Body of Lies,\\" \\"Gladiator\\"). To see Scott return to his former aesthetic sensibilities was, in my view, a welcome development.<br /><br />However, Scott's storytelling style has plunged into the very sort of incoherence that epitomizes the short attention span film-making approach of 21st century Hollywood. In contradistinction to most of Scott's early work, which was slower and thoughtful, \\"Prometheus\\" exhibits a ravenously kinetic narrative thrust that allows audiences little or no time to contemplate the ideas being presented to them. In fact, one could convincingly argue that some viewers might miss the ideas all together. This is unfortunate because the film's themes (human origins, exotheology, faith, etc.) should be pondered a little more thoughtfully. Yet, how can one do so when the story unfolds with such rapidity and the questions are only marginally broached by the characters themselves?<br /><br />In short, \\"Prometheus\\" represents a very gifted film-maker's conformance to the modern Hollywood formula... Placate audiences with bread and circuses. Serious thought be damned!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This is one of the best films of the year and to get it at such a great price made it even more appealing.  The surprise ending ties it to one of the most successful film franchises ever.<br /><br />Definitely a MUST SEE!...and OWN!!!!

B0070R40V6|4.0|The story is one of the best, and if my review was based on that alone, no question bit to give 5 stars.  I LOVE the story.  One star was lost because of the annoying &#34;enhancement&#34;, where whenever your finger accidentally lands on a hyperlink to a character glossary, you leap forward to near the end of the book.  If you are using an App on an iPhone or iPad, this is very annoying.  The instructions to take you back to your reading place do not work on these devices - you are left trying to scroll your way back.  Worse, you can no longer sync to latest reading page, as Kindle seems to use the character glossary as your furthest read page.  The only way to fix, I have found, is via &#34;manage my kindle&#34; and clearing &#34;furthest page read&#34;. This does fix it, but gets old quick. I recommend this book, but don't pay extra for the enhanced version.  The enhanced version may work just fine on an actual Kindle, but I don't have one, so cant say.

B00514HDNW|5.0|After seeing the movie with Will Smith, I was interested to read the book that supposedly birthed the idea for the movie, so I thought I'd give it a go (and costing only $3.99 wasn't bad either).  This book was different from the movie (aren't they all) and in my opinion was more interesting because it offered a much clearer look inside Neville's head.  His motivations for his actions, his wide-ranging and fast-changing emotions allowed me to connect with him much better than the movie in that I, like many people, have felt these same emotions.  The author did a great job of helping the reader to relate to how he was feeling.<br /><br />The flashbacks confused me a very tiny bit, but they were easy to get along with once you figured out what was going on.  All in all, a very good read.
0446581356|2.0|I am disappointed.  Too much is obvious, such as \\"Oil-free liquid foundation is for oily skin\\" (p. 56) or circular in definition, such as \\"Latin women with golden skin and olive undertones\\" should look for foundation with a  \\"yellow-based golden shade.\\" (p. 62.)<br /><br />Page 70 tells how to choose a bronzer.  The book says: If you have \\"light\\" skin you should choose \\"beigy brown with a hit of pink.\\"  If you have \\"alabaster\\" skin you should choose \\"pinky shimmer or peach.\\"  How is a person to know if their skin is light or alabaster, and aren't those words like pink and beige all part of a vast continuum?<br /><br />One complete page is dedicated to how to apply lip gloss.  Here's what it says:  1) Apply gloss to a lip brush or directly to lips. 2) Using the brush or finger, begin at the middle of the lips.  3) Apply gloss to both the top and bottom lips.  4) Wipe the edges of lips when finished.  5) The lips look fuller and hydrated.  ....  Is there anything in that you did not already know?<br /><br />Although the book contains many photos, too many are art photos of messy makeup kits, puddles of foundation smeared together with chunks of broken lipsticks, or ladies getting white paint dumped all over their faces.  These kinds of pictures waste space.  I would have preferred photos that compare makeup done wrong to that done well (kind of like Christopher Hopkins did in his book \\"Staging Your Comeback.\\")  And  it would have been nice to feature more average-looking women in the photos.  Some of the models in this book actually look better before they have the makeup on.<br /><br />Okay, I've said why I can't use this book for myself, but I do think it could be nice for teens who are are just discovering the world of makeup and don't know a thing about it.  The presence of the big section at the end as a vocational guidance for those who want to go into makeup as a profession further points that this is really a book for high schoolers.

B008NEMPTO|5.0|Many months ago my cousin told me they were releasing the movie of an excellent book he had read. All I can say about it is WOW!<br /><br />  I always carefully track the D-box website for upcoming movies with the motion codes for their motion simulator movie seats. I was unaware this movie was in D-box in the theater, but their website said the motion code would be released on or near the release date. On the day of release, [[ASIN:B008NEMPTO Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter 3D (Blu-ray 3D)]] was nowhere to be found on the D-box website. Nowhere.<br /><br />  What gives?? Anyone have any info? I was sooo looking forward to seeing this movie in 3D and D-box motion simulator seats simultaneously.  It's a mind blowing experience. So far, I'm a little bummed. :(

0385340990|3.0|In general, it is difficult to craft flesh and blood passionate characters through the technique of the epistolary novel. The viewpoints depicted are often one-dimensional as letters are usually written to make an announcement, get to a point, perhaps make a request or relate some above-average event.  Although I believe that one's voice can be revealed through letters, I do not think that the characters of Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows in their The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society present themselves as thoroughly and as intimately through descriptions of their demeanor and actions as they could have been showcased in a novel written in a third person narration.<br /><br />But then again, Potato Peel Society is meant to be an upbeat little story that intertwines a dark hour in the world's history with the universal hope of being human.  The letters as the only real form of distance communication must be viewed as heraldic newsletters where the writers have already survived the events and are now reporting the past in terms of their triumph as examples of what it means to healthily \\"move on\\" and not wallow.<br /><br />Viewing Potato Peel Society in this sense works.  We become members of a private club of islanders who in their isolation during the German occupation of WW2 must devise a way to get through the every day of hunger, anger, defeat and despair.  They do--some do it better than others--and we, as readers, hear of it all in the form of stories as related to the lead character and letter writer, Ms Juliet Ashton, a column journalist for a London newspaper who is at a crossroads with regard to the rest of her life.<br /><br />Shaffer and Barrows do write with a love of literature; they quite rightly focus on what the thoughts of writers might mean to people who have no other outlet.  How many times have you read a book and then read over the writer's words and wondered at how that person could convey the emotion that you yourself were feeling or had felt at some key point in your life?  The great surge of universality does wash over you and you do feel the power of the pen and connectivity on an Absolute level far stronger than some of the senseless pings and narcissistic announcements of Facebook.  Shaffer and Barrows most ashamedly pull out all the romanticized stops--their situations are most definitely contrived and meant as English student teaching points for the reader who has little need to ponder metaphor.  An unhappier reality does intervene in the form of concentration camps, needless deaths, children separated from their families, hunger, desolation, arrests and cruelty which, at times does seem bleak in the face of all the cheery letters bandied back and forth.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Juliet as the eternal and feisty optimist does become enchanted with her collection of islanders and quite predictably opts to take on the role of more than just an honorary member of the Society.  The authors take advantage of many of the situation comedies of the 40's cinema to contrive an extravagantly outcome for all involved in tone with their theme of love and hope arising from the ashes of the Blitz, the desolation of the work camp and the frustration of being captured on your home turf.<br /><br />Bottom line?  In \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,\\" authors Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows strive to craft an epistolary novel that depicts the seriousness of the plight of the island of Guernsey during the German Occupation of WW2 while lauding its residents' obvious patriotism and steadfastness in the face of hardship and great adversity.  At times, the seemingly contrived naivety of main character Juliet despite her orphaned past might frustrate some looking for more depth, but for those desiring an entertainment read with some hard facts that do not diminish the overall joy of the story, a serving of Potato Peel Pie might make the perfect dessert.

B006PTL1GC|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'A Dangerous Method' is advertised as a film mainly dramatizing the conflict between iconic therapists Carl Jung and his one-time mentor, Sigmund Freud. But the bulk of the film is really about an affair that Jung had with one of his patients, Sabina Spielrein, who later went on to become a prominent Russian physician and psychoanalyst.<br /><br />The film begins in 1904 with Spielrein, a young medical student, checking into a psychiatric clinic with severe symptoms of what was termed 'hysteria' in those days. She primarily displays a complex motor tic of continuously thrusting her jaw out and stuttering and often must be restrained by the staff at the clinic. Carl Jung, a student of Sigmund Freud, employs Freud's new 'talking therapy' with Spielrein, who makes remarkable progress and is soon offered a job by Jung, to assist him in his medical research (Spielrein's transformation from borderline psychotic to responsible student is too abrupt as we never see how Jung actually works his miracle--Jung returns from military leave and we must take it on faith that somehow, through the passage of time, his therapy simply worked!)<br /><br />Jung is married to a wealthy woman who he has a number of children with. During the course of his relationship with Spielrein, he treats a disaffected physician, Otto Gross, who urges him to abandon his monogamous ways and pursue his sexual desires with Sabina. It is the contention of the film's scenarists that Jung indeed began an affair with Spielrein; her illness was related to being physically punished by her father in childhood and she now sublimates these negative experiences by engaging in masochistic spanking and bondage sessions with Jung (coupled with normal sexual encounters).<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jung corresponds with Freud and meets with him a number of times, including a trip to America. Freud is depicted as a rigid theoretician and practitioner, inflexibly adhering to his core belief that mental illness is rooted only in childhood sexual experiences. Jung eventually seeks to incorporate other theories to explain psychological dysfunction which Freud derides, and ultimately rejects, as 'mysticism'.<br /><br />The dissolution of Jung and Freud's relationship is tied to Jung's dissolving relationship with Spielrein. He not only publishes studies about his treatment of her but her dissertation as well. They both agree that acts of creation can be rooted in destruction (holding up their own relationship as a perfect example: a clash of opposites and breaking of taboos), not necessarily related to Freud's one note obsession with childhood sexuality. Although Spielrein is essentially on Jung's side, she decides to undergo analysis with Freud who she hopes might play mediator between the warring couple, after Jung (due to guilt feelings) breaks things off between them. While Spielrein takes the high road by not exposing Jung, she insists he confess his indiscretions to Freud. After agreeing to Spielrein's request, Freud uses Jung's confession against him, bashing Jung in future correspondence, after his former pupil fails to pay homage to him. After they split, both Freud and Jung then fail to acknowledge Speilrein's contributions. She finally gets over Jung, becomes a notable analyst in her own right and has children with a kindly physician from her native Russia.<br /><br />The resolution of both of these plot strands (Jung and Freud and Jung and Spielrein), will prove of great interest to aficionados of the great psychotherapeutic icons, but to the general public, perhaps much more anti-climactic. If we are to believe the scenarists here, Jung went way beyond his mentor Freud, in terms of presenting much broader, holistic, psychological constructs. Much of this we learn in the closing titles at film's end but I'm not convinced that Jung is the better of the two.<br /><br />To their credit, Freud is depicted as a minority practitioner,beleaguered on many sides, due to his unpopular emphasis on sexuality. He argued that Jung's belief in 'superstition' undermined the 'scientific' basis of their profession. Ultimately, a one hour and forty five minute film, can only touch upon the basic conflicting points between the two men. For a deeper understanding between Freud and Jung, a real solution is to read through their writings. Creative luminaries such as Joyce Joyce, however, did not care to--he dubbed them both \\"Tweedledum and Tweedledee\\" (perhaps if both of them had written a novel as good as 'Ulysses', they may have earned Joyce's approbation).<br /><br />Michael Fassbender as Jung is perhaps the strongest of the three principals. He displays a subdued intensity throughout the film. Many internet posters found Keira Knightley as Spielrein to be way over the top, particularly in the early scenes where she is depicted as being completely unhinged. I didn't think she was that bad at all and is perhaps the strongest when she makes her case for Jung, while meeting up with Freud. Viggo Mortensen comes off as a bit boring as Freud but is perhaps saddled by the rather ponderous, dialogue heavy script.<br /><br />'A Dangerous Method' will keep your interest up to a point. Ultimately, however, Freud and Jung's work may not be worth immortalizing in any film at all. There is a deeper and darker tale here, far more ominous and important than the conflict between seemingly self-involved intellectuals. I'm referring to the fate of Sabina Spielrein, revealed in the closing credits. She was murdered along with her two children by Einsatzgruppe D, one of the Nazi death squads, near her home town in Russia, in August of 1942. The machinations of Freud and Jung seem like a distant memory in light of the evil which inexorably began its march over the European continent some 100 years ago, almost to this day.beleaguered on many sides, due to his unpopular emphasis on sexuality.

B002TLSSXO|4.0|This is a beautiful set of utensils for the kitchen. I have been using them for a few weeks now. There are three observations to be made for those like myself who buy online without trying the product in a store.<br /><br />First, the handles are weighted. If you attempt to leave the utensil on the side of the pan, it may do a somersault out of your pan onto the floor taking with it whatever you may be cooking. You can avoid this through a change of habit in use of these utensils as compared to traditional utensils.<br /><br />Second caveat, the spaghetti utensil. The combination of the oversized drain hole in the center and the widely spaced teeth make it hard to retrieve any standard size spaghetti from a pan. The spaghetti simply slips through the hole or off the tines. I had to revert to my standby spaghetti utensil.<br /><br />Third and finally, currently you cannot buy the carousel holder separately. So you may wish to consider the set which comes with the carousel. I did not realize this and was trying to save the extra $10. Instead, I went to the hardware store and purchased a set of clear suction cups with hooks which I attached to the back of my stove counter (mine it tile) and that works very well for me.<br /><br />Other than these three considerations, a fine set which is also aesthetically pleasing.

0316228532|1.0|I bought a Harry Potter book years ago, but just couldn't get used to the style, which was, I reminded myself, written for children. This book is written in the same stilted style, with words more usual to adult reading. Where I write 'couldn't' she writes 'could not'.<br />She goes to the trouble, and uses a lot of words to do so, to partly describe the character by telling, and then 'kills' him off. It wasn't until part way down page four that I found Mary was in the car with him. Harry Potter bored me, this writing style, with its unneeded info dump, left me numb, I started thinking about tonight's pizza and what I should do about the crust, make it wider, as my wife likes to dip the crust, after she has consumed the pizza centre, in honey. It's turning cold here, -1°C.
B004PGO25O|5.0|The problem for many creative people is that they suffer from too many interests and not enough time in the day to explore all of them.<br /><br />The result: many projects started, none finished.<br /><br />Be it from ADHD, or fear of success, or just plain old clinical procrastination -- the key to overcoming this is to simply focus and do the work.<br /><br />That is what this book is for, to help motivate you to DO THE FREAKING WORK.<br /><br />It's a small book.

On her birthday, her father tells Nell that she was not really their child.  Did Nell really need to know this?  This shatters Nell's world, and causes her to search lifelong for her birth parents.  Do we really need the bloodline to feel secure in who we are as a family member?  Or is family really just who raises us?  Can that ever be enough?  On her death, Nell's granddaughter takes up the search.  A bit complicated, at timrs, but overall, a very satisfying read.  I can't wait to start Kate's other books!

055357342X|5.0|Storm of Swords in the third entry in the Song of Ice and Fire series. Characters who played central roles in the first two volumes didn't just move to the back burner in a Storm of Swords, many of them died, which I guess is what would happen in a war. It doesn't matter if the person is good or bad, they have an equal shot at dying. That's quite a bit different than most books, but it's one of the things I like about this series. Also, more time is spent of at the Wall, which is the part of the series I enjoy the most. While I really, really enjoyed the book, I will say that the book did not so much end as stop. I know there are more books to come, but this ending was so abrupt, it seemed a bit unfinished. I read a lot of series, and I don't recall an ending this abrupt. That said, it did nothing to quash my enthusiasm for this book.

079073804X|5.0|The Exorcist has rightly earned the title of scariest film of all time....it's shot in an almost documentary-like style which makes the horror seem even more real.<br /><br />It's the tale of an innocent pre-teen girl, Regan McNeill (played by Linda Blair) who is victimized by the powers of evil and eventually taken over by it. At her wits' end, her mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn) appeals to Father Karras (Jason Miller) to perform an exorcism to drive the demon out of her. Karras is reluctant to do so, not only because he's not convinced Regan's problem isn't psychological, but he's also a man filled with self-doubt and on the verge of losing his faith all together (the recent death of his mother certainly didn't help).<br /><br />Eventually though, Karras does agree to be a part of it, it is Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who leads the rite of exorcism...and they both have their hands full as the demon proves to be more than a match.<br /><br />The scariest thing about this is that the villain in here can't be shot, can't be stabbed, can't be poisoned. There is only one power that can defeat the demon in Regan and that is faith....<br /><br />The 25th Anniversay dvd is the best....I tried watching the 'director's cut' which mostly features pointless extended scenes that actually take away some of the power of the film, especially towards the end. This one is the original in tact and more satisfying....sometimes less really is more.<br /><br />Great film.

B008BIN9EW|1.0|Now completely incompatible with my Android device.  It would appear that the developer has not only left an app that doesn't function properly, but that they have now made it so that anyone who bought or got this as the FAOTD cannot load it back onto their device.  I am able to play for maybe 10 turns or so, and then the game freezes and my phone is forced into a reboot which cancels out any progress that I had made.  It might as well not even be able to load up at this point.<br /><br />It would be a good game if it didn't always crash and the developer should be completely avoided due to their shady tactic of turning off all compatibility.

I thought this was going to download to my iPad with all my other music. I haven't looked to see if there is a way to transfer it over. I honestly don't think u can. This is why I gave it a 4. The song is great!!!

B005JABSB6|4.0|I recently bought the 80 inch 3D tv which came with 2 pairs of glasses, but I have 4 people in my family and needed 2 more pairs. Bought them on Amazon and they came immediacy. One of the pairs however, were broken and I let Amazon know- and before I even sent them back to be replaced, new ones were at my door!! Everything is fabulous and now my family can watch all together. Thanks Amzon
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very entertaining.  Loved it.  My dd and friends read it before the movie came out.  She then read other two books.  I didn't read till after movie came out.  Seems to match movie pretty much, but the part where the history of the pin is not in movie n dd wonders how or if they'll incorporate it into future movies.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down:)<br />Can't wait to read the next one in the series. 5 stars for awesome

B00275EGX8|3.0|I bought this movie on DVD recently because of the hype critics gave it and it winning best picture at the Oscars. I thought it would be a great movie because it dealt with the Iraq War and I was indeed very eager to watch it. I admit I was entertained because it has some very gripping and high tension moments. All the bomb diffusion scenes and the sniper scene at the mid point were very detailed and well executed. That being said however I can't help but agree with many of the user comments pointing out the inaccuracies.<br /><br />-The opening scene has a man detonating the bomb with a cell phone and the team simply yells at him to put it down, had it been in real life the man would have been shot instantly.<br /><br />-The character Sargent First Class William James is portrayed as a rugged, careless lone wolf who ignores his teammates and at one point leaves his base to track down who he suspects killed a small boy he befriended. Had someone done these things in real life he would have been highly disciplined and more than likely discharged.<br /><br />-And the last thing I have a problem with the movie clichés soldiers as war junkies who love combat and are unable to adjust to civilian life once they return home. While some military personnel may indeed go through this, most people would be glad to be out of the war and be back home with their loved ones.<br /><br />So to sum it all up the acting was indeed very good, all the actors gave great performances and it does have high tension scenes. But if you decide to view this movie just remember it isn't a very accurate depiction of the Iraq War and most soldiers are not like the characters portrayed in the movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it!!! Sylvia Day did a great job with the Crossfire series. I couldn't stop reading, I look forward to reading more.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this as much as the first! Ready to start the third as soon as I finished this one! Amazing series!
B0000CABBW|2.0|Unlike other viewers, I was not enchanted by the little girl or by Maori culture. The men are obnoxious, overbearing, hateful, selfish, aggressive bullies who do nothing but strut, bellow and play-fight with their big sticks; while the women are cattily passive-aggressive enablers of the abusive men. What's enchanting about that? If that's what Maori culture is really like, then it's good it's mostly been abandoned for the civilization of the English settlers. Good riddance.<br /><br />The little girl is okay, and she can cry on cue, which got her an Oscar nomination; but she's not interesting enough to overcome the overbearing melodrama that alternates with cloying cuteness and phony sentimentality to make watching this movie an annoying experience. It seems to last MUCH longer than its supposed 101 minutes; by the time I got to the sappy, absurd end of this movie, I felt like I'd been watching it for weeks.<br /><br />This movie may seem good to TV-bred children, or to fans of soap operas, or to people who for some reason are interested in the abusive culture of the Maori, or to people who miss the awful Disney live-action movies of the 50s like Old Yeller, but I didn't like it at all.<br /><br />The DVD has English subtitles for those of us unfamiliar with the Maori version of the New Zealand dialect of English, but for some stupid reason the subtitles do not translate the fairly extensive parts that are in the Maori language. The subtitles just say \\"[Speaks in Maori]\\", etc, as if all we need to know is what language they're speaking (and are too stupid to remember what language it is from one speech to the next), but that we DON'T need to know what they're saying. That's just plain dumb, and it's irritating. If what they're saying doesn't matter, why are they even speaking a language? Why don't they just grunt?
B007RTAR64|4.0|This doll was 80% similar to the actress of this Hunger Game Movie. Personally I am satisfied with the presentation. Thanks for selling this to me.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|There was nothing new in this storyline accept better special effects and better visuals aside from that the movie was unoriginal.<br />-Lonnie
B005WMQFOQ|5.0|It is a beautiful doll, I am glad I can have it now. It was gorgeous, and well presented. I may order it again sometime for my best friend as she is a barbie fan too. The box is not so strong, but hopefully it can be wrapped strongly. Strongly recommended.
B004HW7JI8|3.0|There are many things wrong with this product:<br />1. It got here 3 days later than expected<br />2. Didn't receive my amazon receipt<br />3. The box, on the inside was broken. I looked at the DvDs and they look fine. When i watch them I hope that they work.
B0053O89RY|5.0|This season of Modern Family was amazing. They took it to another level. Lilly is growing up and is so funny. Phil still is the most hilarious person on the show. This is the best comedy on tv right now and there is nothing else like it.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|My daughter took me to this movie for Mother's Day.  I watched the series on TV when I was young and didn't know what to expect. I found myself chuckling through the entire movie as very subtle references to the TV show were used as jokes all through the movie.  The background music had me humming along, and the actors did a remarkable job at imitating their character based on the TV series actor.  My daughter is a Johnny Depp fan, but not having seen the original TV series missed a lot of the subtle humor. It was a very enjoyable movie for me, but I guess you had to be a fan of the TV series to appreciate it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The fifth season of the big bang was great. I really like the 100th episode and the writers still have more exciting things for the seasons to come. Can not wait for season 6.

B009874S68|3.0|I was lucky enough to get a digital copy of \\"Livid\\", a french horror movie from the same team that brought us the outstanding horror film \\"[[ASIN:B00125WATQ Inside (Unrated)]]\\". I really didn't know much about this film except of the directors and for me that was enough to give it a go. What I got from \\"Livid\\" was confused and unanswered questions though.<br /><br />A young woman named Lucie who has heterochromia (two different color eyes) is starting her first day of in home care for the elderly with a veteran nurse named Catherine. She takes Lucie around to several different patients before they make their last stop at an old mansion where Catherine has Lucie stay in the car for this last visit. While waiting Lucie gets curious and decides to go in. She finds Catherine with an elderly woman in a coma, Catherine knew she would come and was actually waiting for Lucie. She starts to explain that the woman was a famous ballet dancer who lost her young daughter and that there was said to be a treasure of some sort hidden in the house.<br />Catherine tells Lucie she has looked all over but could never find anything. Later Lucie meets with her boyfriend who is a young fisherman and she tells him of the treasure at which time he starts concocting a plot to find it. Later that night along with a friend, a reluctant Lucie and her boyfriend break in and start their search for the treasure only to find that the riches they thought they'd find are something much more horrific.<br /><br />I took this movie as a kind of haunted vampire film which I really wanted to love but sadly ended up only liking to an extent. It took almost an hour before it starting getting good and by the time it ending I was a little dissatisfied. Some events in the film were unanswered and left me wondering an scratching my head, I would say what but I really don't want to give anything away. The overall mood was eerie and creepy along with a fitting soundtrack of violins and piano which gave it a nice touch. The acting was good, no complaints except for the use of Beatrice Dalle (the menacing woman out for revenge from \\"Inside\\") who had all but two small cameos in the film. I thought her to be the main villain at first but was totally let down by her role.<br /><br />It is a unique film with vampires, human automaton and revenge along with a few twists and a little gore that deserves at least a viewing or two. Overall its a beautiful film to watch and is interesting but starts off slow an leaves you a little confused with questions of why certain things happened by the end.touch.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters were great. The storyline was great. And it is well written. I recommend it to the readers that enjoy some extra detailed love and romance. Can't wait for a third one!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I had not read other Isaacson biographies. I am roughly Jobs' age and an acknowledged nerd/geek. Reading the book I felt as if I was reliving my technology oriented years, while learning a huge amount about the inner workings of a complex man who left his imprint on so many aspects of our lives. I will definitely read other Isaacson tomes.
B009AMAM9S|5.0|This dreamlike drama, starring:Halle Berry; Tom Hanks; Susan Sarandan; Ben Whishaw; and Hugo Weaving is a highly entertaining film that mesmerizes throughout. The entire cast deliver a fantastic multiple performance as they appear in different roles as the compelling stories move through time. Directors Tom Tykwer and Andy Wachowski produce a film unlike any I have ever seen. The intriguing stories weave dramatically throughout, combined with mystery, action, and romance. Special Effects are excellent, run time is 164 minutes, and the suspense is intense. an act of kindness travels across centuries to inspire a revolution in the future as the film explores how the actions of individual lives impact one another through the past, present, and the future. One soul is shaped from a killer into a hero as  the drama begins to explode. Interesting, thrilling, and Highly Recommended!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|So glad I came across this book...I've been looking for a new addiction.  A really fun read.  Great story, great characters.
B008220BW0|5.0|The compelling story is based on the real life surfing champion, Jay Moriarty, portrayed in \\"CHASING MAVERICKS\\" and the novel. The film shows breathtaking scenes of riding the waves off the California Coast, and how a surfing champion takes a risk with each and every experience. The intriguing story also portrays relationships, life's good moments as well as the bad,and the true meaning of having a mentor. The movie is as entertaining and as heartfelt as the book. The novel portrays heart-wrenching moments as we learn about a close-call in a near-death situation, and the movie has touching moments as well. Acting Performance of Gerald Butler is outstanding as well as the entire cast. Special Effects are superb, and the film captures your attention from start to finish. Interesting, Enjoyable, and Highly Recommended!
1616284382|4.0|This is a book for all ages to be shared and enjoyed with children,grandchildren and adults. It is a fine example of the documentation of a turning point in the development of animation as an art form. It is also a great tribute to the genius and talents of Walt Disney.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|A great science fiction thriller and visually orgasmic! Ridley Scott is a great film director, but a poor story teller. If you can look past the poor script and simply watch this movie with a sifi mind set, you will enjoy this movie. Lets face it, Alien had just as much mixed reviews when it first premiered in 1979, and I feel down the line Prometheus has the potential to make just as big of an impact.
0316228532|1.0|I was really excited when I saw that J.K. Rowling released a new book! I was excited to read her excellent writing, but I have to say that I was disappointing. The characters made me upset, the language was shocking, and the plot couldn't pull me in. I am sad to say that JK Rowling has disappointed me.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I normally only write reviews of books I really like and recommend. However I have read almost all of Nelson's books so I thought I would register my disappointment with this effort.  I enjoyed the first 100 pages, thought the book bogged down for the next 350 pages and the last 150 pages were good but not great.  Also I have to say, without being a spoiler, that the ending was cut off and totally unsatisfying.  For the most part, I thought the book was one dimensional and Nelson seemed to have used up all of Corey's good wisecracks in previous efforts. Also, since most of the characters in Yemen are wise crackers, it really lost its effectiveness. This is unfortunately painful because the pace of the book is really slow and there is not much action until the last 150 pages.

B006LSZECO|3.0|When I started reading this book, I could not put my Kindle down. I loved all of the twists and turns that kept me reading even when I should be doing other things. However, I felt a total let down when I got to the ending!! I felt the author took the easy way out and just left the reader hanging..not in a good way. I will not read any other books by this author because I don't trust her enough to invest my time with a book that will disappoint me.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this book. I don't think it was amazing, but it was enjoyable. It was a bit cheesy and unbelievable at times, but a good read none the less.
1451695195|3.0|Proof of Heaven? I really with all my heart tried to enjoy this book. I too pre-ordered it in anticipation of a great read. However, two thirds into the book, I began to realize there would be no profound description of the authors actual experiences on the other side. It's as if he launched into a paper of scientific arguments to convince his colleagues that what happened to him indeed was real. His writing style didn't bother me as some readers have said, it's just that I wanted more play by play description of the beings he encountered and the secret knowledge he so readily absorbed in the deepest core of that realm. He keeps emphasizing how mere words cannot depict what he saw or felt, but hey, we're paying for those words, and you should have at least tried to give more. It's an experience I suppose we will all face someday, *death, but darn, I wanted at least an intriguing, HD trailer of what's to come. Some may love the aspects of this story surrounding his dilemma, but I for one just got kind of bored, and wanted the book to have an NDE.

B003V4JU08|5.0|The season 1 BluRay DVD is excellent.  Would like to get season 2 & 3 also, but they are not available in BluRay DVD format like this one yet.  Hope fans of this show that are unable to get the Amazon HD streaming content and want the BluRay DVDs will ask for same treatment given to season1.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|I bought Stone Sour's debut album when it first came out but sort of fell out of the loop with both them and Slipknot.  But a few months ago I got back into things and got caught up.  It was not long after that when we get the new single/s Gone and Absolute.  The we got tempted even more with RU486 released just before the album dropped. So I have been looking forward to this release for a while. I must say overall it does not disappoint.  I would not call it the best release of yet....for me it is the debut album.  I would put HOG&B on par with Come What(ever) May, with maybe a slight nod more to that album, but that may just because it is more familiar to me at the moment.  I will say that the last couple songs just seem to be lacking that little \\"oomph\\", and mostly why I am gigging a star (no it has nothing to do with liking slow vs. fast song).  Most songs either have a good guitar hook (the intro to Gone Sov. for example) or play on Corey's vocals (Absolute or Rumor of Skin for example), and I guess for me the last couple songs didn't really put either out there.  But this should not be taken to mean the last couple songs sucked.  If they did I would be giving this 3 or 2 stars.  Nope, bottom line is this is a pretty good album that will probably pull in the guys a bunch of awards and go multi platinum.

0316228532|5.0|I checked this novel out from the library, and I will be buying it. I loved it. The characters were so well developed, and, although most characters were not likable, I really liked Andrew and Kay characters. Some readers' reviews claim there were no likable characters, but that is not true. And I did tear up at the end of the novel.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very addicting game.  Don't play it if you only have a couple of minutes to kill because you will be dissappointed you don't have enough time.

1608871517|5.0|Michael Bush's book was one that I could not put down. I also know my way around a needle and thread, and Mr. Bush's telling of his many years of designing and creating clothes for Michael Jackson kept me enthralled. He is truly an artist of the highest order. Making a garment for someone can be both challenging and rewarding, but to have to take into account the way that a person is going to move (read: dance!)  in that garment, and get into or out of it quickly between sections of a performance, requires an entirely different set of skills that Mr. Bush describes in glorious detail.  He takes us on a journey from precise measurement and pattern construction through fabric selection and traveling the world over to find just the right embellishments. He also shares some of the \\"tricks of the trade\\" that he used to create Michael's magic. The many full-color close-up photographs are simply breathtaking.<br />MJ fans will enjoy the many funny and touching stories that Mr. Bush shares, as well as the myths that he clears up.<br />The book is printed on high-quality paper, which makes for a heavy tome, but I was impressed to learn that both the author and the publisher are contributing to worthy causes through the profits from this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was a little nervous to read this one and had no idea what I was getting into.  Although putting me through an emotional rollercoaster, the main characters were amazing!  I could not put the book down.  I will never look at a gray tie the same way :)

Can't wait for the next!!
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|Disappointing is the strongest description I can offer about this Jodi Picoult novel. The subject is a grabber - teen suicide .. and a title which misleads, as there really is no \\"pact.\\" There are two major issues which Picoult ought to have addressed - secret-keeping, which is prevalent in the novel, but particularly the young man's willingness to keep the secret of his friend/girlfriend/lover's plan. The guy is seventeen .... if your friend tells you he/she wants to die and you have to keep the secret, you say \\"No!\\" There is no addressing how the young man will live the rest of his life, having protected the young woman as a brother, but unable to speak the truth with his parents or her parents. And these parents seem to be ineffectual, letting life happen. The other issue is the changing relationship between long-time friends. No one except the young woman is uncomfortable with the dramatic and frightening transformation in the relationship. Has she NO ONE ELSE to talk to? The problem is that she has not been trained to turn to anyone else ... and when it counts, she loses her way.

B00023B1LC|4.0|This trilogy is one of our favorite. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes action movies. In some ways, the first part of the trilogy can stand alone, but it's just as good when viewed with the last two.
B00009ATIX|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS SURREALISTIC AND WHERE PARTS WERE SLOW I DIDN'T MIND. WELL ACTED. I REALLY LIKED THE CHARACTERS. THE PLOT WAS ENGROSSING AND NOT PREDICTABLE. SORRY THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR SOMEONE EXPECTING A LOT OF GORE AND SPECIAL EFFECTS DRIVING IT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.

B009MB682W|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the James Bond movies, so when this album was released I had to get it.  All of the original title songs, as they are heard in the films, from all of the official James Bond movies (except Skyfall) are on this album.  A lot of really great songs are here, the majority of which you never hear unless you watch the movies.  Granted, not all of the Bond songs are for everyone (Madonna's Die Another Day is not my favorite), but I really like most of them.  Amazon had the album for less than iTunes ($10 vs. $12), so I couldn't pass it up.
B0002BO05S|1.0|I ORDERED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I REMEMBER IT AS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES ABOUT THE LIFE OF CHRIST.  THE RECREATION OF THIS MOVIE ON DVD IS HORRENDOUS.  THE PICTURE IS GRAINY AND THE MUSIC SO LOUD AS TO MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR THE DIALOGUE.  THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. THIS IS A WIDE SCREEN VERSION OF THE MOVIE AND IT FILLS UP ONLY THE CENTER ONE THIRD OF THE SCREEN MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE.  THERE WERE SO MANY DARKLY LIT SCENES I COULDNT MAKE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.  THE DIALOGUE I COULD HEAR SOUNDED MUFFLED, OR UNCLEAR, SO I FIGURED I'D PUT THE SUBTITLES ON THE SCREEN.  NO LUCK WITH THIS EITHER,  THE SUBTITLES ARE ONLY IN SPANISH AND FRENCH, NEITHER OF WHICH I SPEAK.  SO TO SAY THIS WAS A TERRIBLE REPRODUCTION OF THIS MOVIE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|\\"The Forever Girl\\" is a parnormal romance novel written by Rebecca Hamilton. I rate the book PG13 for adult situations and language. Sophia is a 22 year old witch living in a prejudiced small town. She is trying to find her own way in life without backing down from who she is. Her struggles came across as genuine despite being preternatural.<br /> The writing style is neat and the plot is smooth. There are time jumps as other reviewers have mentioned yet the plot stayed on target and in focus. Adding anything extra would have created unnecessary padding to the story and slowed the pace. I liked it the way it was. An excellent debut. I took off 1 star for a few typos I found. There weren't too many and it seems others did not notice them. If I could give an extra half star I would.

B002GHIPYI|5.0|I've had these headphones for a couple of months now, and I have nothing but positive things to say about them. I used to use a pair of headphones that were purchased for around $100, and so far I've been much happier with these. I don't think you could go wrong for $30. I've recommended these particular headphones to a couple of friends, and both of them enjoy these as much - if not more so - than I do. Highly recommended!
B006J420UE|5.0|I bought this for my first cheap gaming rig for around $87 and it has worked wonders. Since this is an unlocked processor its easy to overclock and is definitely worth OC'ing at least the Graphics portion of this APU. Make sure to buy at least 1600mhz RAM if you are using this. It will give you much better graphics results. Just by setting my RAM to run at 1600mhz instead of the default 1333mhz that all RAM runs at, the graphics card automatically overclocked from 600-800mhz. Since I want to keep the longevity of my APU, I have decided not to OC the processor and run it that way 24/7. The 200mhz boost received allows me to play even Skyrim at medium-high settings without lag. Getting both my processor and graphics card capable of running anything that I want to play for only $87 was the best deal I could ever get. Definitely recommend this for cheap gaming rigs. ^^
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I was going to download this game until , when reading the description the word Pitbull was used. Pitties already have a bad reputation thanks to the media and bad owners.  I am an advocate for Pitties so reading the description singling out Pitties rather than just saying grumpy guy with his dog,  I then chose not to download this game.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|Had read very favorable reviews for the first season,but never had seen it. Then it swept the Emmies big time. So when we saw the first season on DVD was available from Amazon, we bought it. Wow!!!! We were swept away. So engrossing, well acted and well done.  We're hooked!  Trouble is, with the new season, the hour passes so quickly that we're always wanting more!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A lot of books from indie authors are lousy. This is not! The Wool books are well-written, well-edited, and a great read. The characters are believable and interesting, the setting is detailed and it's clear that the author put a lot of thought into the environment. Such a great read, at a great price - especially this omnibus edition. Stop reading the reviews and buy it. Really!
B0041D843M|3.0|I did find the study interesting as a study and they obviously spent a lot of time in the one region just after a time in history when rural people were lucky to eat some days. But it did leave me with questions relating to its drive with a \\"vegan\\" lifestyle being the only answer. If that is the case then why is the Japanese diet more healthy than most in the world (Very low rates of heart disease in some parts, why wasn't this part of the study?)they eat a lot of fish and rice. What about water quality of the Chinese at the time, conditions of livestock and what were they beign fed during the study? Like the food pyramid it just needed more scope in conclusions and detail beyond science. Worth a read and its the kind of book a read needs to reach their own conclusions as how it affects their life and choices in relation to diet.
0061474355|4.0|If you're in the mood for a somber, gorgeously visual novel that's part Philip Pullman, part Tolkien, and part a world out of one those artful fantasy illustrations that seemed to have had a heyday in the 1970s, Sabriel might fit the bill. The heroine of the title is a girl of mysterious origins who was born in the magical \\"Old Kingdom\\" and possesses a rare natural gift for necromancy. However, Sabriel has spent most of her life in Ancelstierre, a non-magical country that resembles Britain of the early 1900s, but shares a strange border region with the Old Kingdom. The story begins with its heroine, who is completing a clandestine education in magic, learning that her often-absent father, who spends most of his time in the Old Kingdom, has gone missing. Meanwhile, the undead ghouls and spirits that plague that region have been acting up, for reasons that Sabriel doesn't understand, having been away from home for so long.<br /><br />While the quest that ensues follows a well-worn good-versus-darkness script and Sabriel herself isn't the most deeply-developed character, I enjoyed its world creation. Many of Nix's ideas, from the militarized zone between Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom, to the different bells that perform different kinds of necromantic magic, to the beautifully eerie World of the Dead, a Stygian realm populated by beings and souls that have not yet passed entirely from life (and a third parallel reality in the story), are deliciously realized. I also enjoyed the side characters, a sardonic, semi-helpful creature of unclear origins named Mogget, who is trapped inside a cat's body, and a stolid, brooding young man named Touchstone, who is wrapped up in his own past.<br /><br />The writing resembles Pullman's The Golden Compass in that it takes its dark reality seriously and contains a few \\"adult\\" things, such as some glancing references to sex and several grim scenes of death. There's nothing I'd consider prurient or inappropriate for the average 12-13 year old, though. For my money, The Golden Compass was more interesting, but readers looking for a work like it, albeit with a more traditional sensibility, would probably enjoy Sabriel.<br /><br />Tim Curry's audiobook performance, which is a touch campfire tale and a touch Shakespearean theatre, fits the tone delightfully.<br /><br />3.5 starsyear old, though.

B005WMADYE|5.0|The first I knew of Redline was from a trailer on another website. I had known nothing of it, seen nothing of it, and when I first saw it, I wondered why I HADN'T heard of it. Redline is a futuristic film about a group of racers competing in the Redline race, a highly dangerous event held only once every five years. By the end, you get to know  JP, Sonoshee, and each of others in the eclectic cast of characters and why they are racing. No questions are left unanswered. The end is satisfying (if cliched). The animation is astounding, especially when you realize this movie has absolutely no CG images in it's entirety.<br /><br />In all honesty, the only thing that left me hanging was where the hell the giant, mutant love-child between a caterpillar and a millipede came from.<br /><br />I have absolutely no regrets with this purchase, and any anime fan would be glad to have this in their collection.

0385344228|4.0|DEFENDING JACOB is a sit on the edge of your chair page flying thriller both from the crime thru the psychological aspects of the characters. A great read almost all the way to the end. The last chapter seemed thrown together just to finish the book and, for me, did not come together as well as I had thought-out myself. It was pretty much anti-climatic! But still worth the read because the fast-pace is well worth the roller coaster ride in spite of the abrupt ending!

0375850864|3.0|\\"When You Reach Me\\" is a middle grade novel that had a lot of promise, but it never quite came together for me. Rebecca Stead is undoubtedly talented, and for the most part, I enjoyed her writing. She skillfully plays with language, inserting such thoughful nuggets as:<br /><br />\\"\\"It's simple to love someone,' she said. 'But it's hard to know when you need to say it.'\\" (page 149)<br /><br />\\"Einstein says common sense is just habit of thought. It's how we're used to thinking about things, but a lot of the time it just gets in the way.\\" (page 51)<br /><br />However, for a story that relies so heavily on a science fiction twist, I found it rather dull. I almost felt as if I were suffocating inside of the bland, colorless apartment that the characters spend so much time within. And although there are definitely some clever clues inserted throughout the body of the text, toward the very end of the book, there is a suspicious amount of what I believe to be \\"retconning\\"- when characters verbally describe things that supposedly happened off the page, thereby justifying the plotline and tying up loose ends, as if inserting rationale at the final hour. This is not to say that \\"Until You Reach Me\\" is a bad story- it isn't, and it certainly has some worthwhile moments. It just failed to draw me in like the best of stories can do.

1400069289|5.0|What an intriguing subject matter. Often, when we think of habits, we generally think of what route we drive to work, how we dress, or how we perform even the most mundane daily tasks or worse. Charles Duhigg, in his must read treatment of the topic, has us see habits as far more intricate patterns of action. From addictions, such alcoholism, athletic practice routines that lead teams to the ultimate sports success, to corporate training curriculum that help create exceptional performing employees, and even to even shopping patterns, Duhigg demonstrates the crucial role that habits play in all parts of our life. A habit is defined early in his work as a choice that we, at some point, deliberately make, then, generally without realizing it, stop thinking about it but continue doing, often on a daily basis. The habit loop, as it he calls it, starts with the cue, such as a moment, an event or thought or such, that triggers a routine, followed by a reward of some sort that is repeated. The key to making our habits work for us and not against us is in this loop and how we learn to use it. The take away for me is that, habits can be replaced, not changed and that for even some of the most challenging and destructive patterns we find in life, if we recognize what triggers or cues exist, anything can change, which means there is still hope for me.<br /><br />I read this book as part of the 12 Books Group and encourage you to get the book and read it. You will certainly enjoy it, and who knows what lurking habits you will discover and replace.

0385344333|1.0|[[ASIN:0385344333 A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel] I looked forward to reading this book and was terribly disappointed.  I have read all of the other Jack Reacher books and have to say I loved them all.  This one just went from one mental math description to another, counting blinks, counting them forward then backward, how much time for things to happen, and on and on and on.  As a Jack Reacher fan you will probably have to read it just to form your own opinion.  After it started I needed to keep reading just for that reason. No it didn't get any better but I can say I read it anyway.  This is the only book that Tom Cruise should act in. Come on Reacher is 6'6\\" a well filled out man, not a pretty boy.
1451695187|5.0|I have been waiting months for this book to come out and it was well worth the wait! When I learned that it was only going to be about 200 pages in length, I was a little mystified. I have read enough NDE books to know that even a thousand pages worth of writings could barely scratch the surface of even a brief NDE experience.<br />But Dr. Alexander's book still revealed a great deal of what lies beyond our physical perceptions, and for me, it's both a little scary and exhilarating to know that not only does our individual consciousnesses live on eternally, but there are billions of other universes and higher life/consciousness beings, as well. Wow. Just....WOW!!!<br />He did say at least a couple times in his book that it will take him a lifetime to \\"unpack\\" some of the things he was shown and learned while he was in a coma. If and when he is able to decipher that information, I imagine it will blow us all away!<br />So, for the folks who were disappointed in what you felt was a lack of detail regarding his experience - read the book again. As with most other NDE's...it's all about Love.<br />  :-)<br /><br />11/01/2012<br /><br />I just want to add that while some reviewers are disappointed in what seems to be a lack of imagery and detail in Dr. Alexander's NDE, the book is more about the potential impact in the fields of medicine and science. Many NDE'rs can (try to) tell you of the miraculous healing, emotional and/or physical, that they realized when they returned to their bodies. Imagine then, what the science and medical communities could do if they, too, began to study in earnest what we call 'consciousness'. The possibilities are infinite - for example, colossal breakthroughs in reaching and maintaining emotional, physical and spiritual well-being...to have a hand in teaching us how to reach our own personal states of nirvana while still here in the physical world. That's huge!!!  If it weren't for Dr. Alexander's impeccable credentials as a neurosurgeon, his book may well have been ignored by his peers just as he had once ignored the likes of Dr.Raymond Moody, et al.<br />I'm sorry you had to get sick like that, Dr. Alexander, but on the other hand, I'm so glad you did!<br />I can't wait to see what happens next!!  :-)
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book took me awhile to get into it--so many characters whose lives are all intertwined in some way. But I was enthralled by the small English town setting. Having lived in England for three years near a small rural town I well remember the people and the class differences--not much different really than small town rural USA where I grew up. The story was depressing at times, but I feel Americans have this idea that we should be happy all the time (could be the advertising campaigns we see / hear on TV, radio and in print), but most of our lives are mundane interspersed with moments of happiness. I liked the way the characters lives and histories were brought forward bit by bit. How well do any of us know our neighbors or where they came from; why they have made the choices they have in life and what they'd like to forget? How many of us see injustice around us and turn a blind eye? How many of us live our lives without ever leaving our safe confines, whether physical or intellectual? This book takes us out of our comfort zone into a world we may be interested in, but certainly wouldn't want to live in. Or are we already there and don't realize it?

0316228532|4.0|Since there are over 1,000 reviews upon this writing I can skip the preliminaries, you all know the premise of the story.  It took me awhile to get through this book. I believe I dragged the reading out, intentionally, I was too busy laughing out loud  and shaking my head in dismay  and overall being shocked by all the backstabbing and dysfunction.  Nevertheless,  I am going to miss these awful and too real-like characters.  Some of them, I absolutely despised.  There was nowhere for me to hide in this book, no one individual that I clung to that I could fall back on when things got rough.  J.K. Rowling made no apologies for these people, she was bold  and tossed out all of their dirty laundry, paragraph after paragraph.  Wow! I love this kind of writing.  I repeatedly asked myself how did she come back to these people and pour out their miserable souls on a daily basis, then realized that as dreary and wretched as these folks were, I kept coming back and wondered about them even when I wasn't reading.<br /><br />Purchasing a book is one thing and reading it through is another. I didn't know how J.K. Rowling was going to do it, how she was going to nab me.  None of this story was predictable; nor the writing style.  There are so many stories out there waiting to be told.  Could she make me care about her new, shiny, adult novel?  The answer is I anxiously await her next novel and will covet its release as I did this one.

0316228532|2.0|I did not read the HP series of books by this author but I was so thrilled that kids all over the world lined up to buy the books and read them voraciously. That is truly wonderful. I have been enthralled with the author's rags to riches personal story as a result of her talents as a writer. She has shown above all that taking a risk to do something you love can change your world. It did hers and she is a wonderful role model for those very kids she inspired to choose to read over everything else. I am a voracious reader and I absolutely love to read.  I bought Casual Vacancy expecting to have a singular reading experience with one of the world's leading authors. Instead I could not finish the book. I found it dull, slow paced and difficult to relate to. I felt guilty about those feelings because the media and reviewers had spoken so highly of the book. I am left to wonder what is wrong with me. I am wondering if it is a case of because the author is so well regarded most folk don't want to say that in fact with this book &#34;the emperor really doesn't have any clothes&#34;.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|You're asking me to review a movie with Noomi Rapace in it. Of course, I'm going to give it 5 stars. Woman's a find. Hope they do sequels to Prometheus...a Star Trek TV show would be great. Dunno if they'd be able to get Rapace for it, tho.<br /><br />Anyway, tired here, otherwise you'd prolly get a more cerebral analysis of the flick. Short is that I would probably only give it 4 stars, but I adore Noomi. And it had some obvious content. But after centuries of entertaining people with varied plots, how can that be avoided. Polti might know. I don't.<br /><br />As a gal, I loved the more fully-faceted personnas of the female chars.<br /><br />Spaceship (sorry, I'm old fashioned) looks, from the outside, to be a computer animation at times. I know. They couldn't get a REAL one for the film? Well it looked like a copy of a copy of one in films we've/I've seen for the last 20 years. Who knows how fast 'they' change models anyway, I mean, as long as it flies, right?<br /><br />Loved the acting. By all the actors. Splendid work.

B007TK77QE|1.0|I bought this book without reading any reviews.  I really had no idea what to expect, except a book for adults from a writer I trusted.<br />I made a big mistake.  I didn't expect a children's book, but I did expect interesting plot, developed characters, and creativity.  I was very disappointed.  I wholeheartedly agree with the review by S. McKinney, which I have just read after finishing the book, so feel free to skip on over to that review, if you like.<br /><br />The characters in the book were many, which I could have enjoyed, except each one of them was decidedly NOT likeable.  Even the ones that weren't criminal were so self-centered and nasty that I was disgusted.  I can't think of a term for it other than disgusting.  I'll restate and add a few to McKinney's list: child neglect, masturbation, pedophilia, self-righteousness and ugly pride, rape, drug addiction, back-biting, self-mutilation, child and spousal abuse, teenagers who hate their parents, parents who hate their children, wives who hate their husbands, neighbors who hate each other, men who use women, women who allow themselves to be used, trafficking in stolen goods, vicious gossip, mental illness, adultery, more hate, teen sex, prostitution, suicide, temper tantrums, contemplation of murder, jealousy, lust everywhere you turn, and an INSANE amount of cursing. Did I mention the overall theme was selfishness?  Ugh.<br /><br />I would have forgiven the characters had they been involved in an interesting plot.  Unfortunately, every character wallows in their own selfish nastiness, and a few things happen.  I really missed the development of a plot.<br />(SPOILER ALERT) I would have shed a tear at the end if the tragic occurrences had caused some of the characters to really change their priorities.  That would have been moving.  Unfortunately, all adults and teenagers except perhaps two teens (who experienced some sort of remorse) go on with their same selfish ways.  Some may argue that more charactershad a change of heart, but I really don't see genuine concern or change outside of how the tragedy or other events directly affected themselves.  I think this is especially evidenced by the fact that at least three adults could have prevented the main tragedy had they cared for anyone other than themselves, but all forgive themselves in the end with astonishing ease.  Indeed, they had been too concerned with their own concerns (professing love to and being rejected by their best friend's widow, scurrying home for the purpose of murdering their husband, and consumed with confusion because they practically jumped a teenage boy as a married woman) to care about the welfare of a child.<br /><br />Basically, I knew the creativity and beauty that this author was capable of, but in this book, I got the same smut and crud that I could get from any writer of contemporary fiction (struggling or famous), but with a less engaging plot.
B008M87GJK|5.0|At first, I had CNN on my Kindle Fire, but then I found BBC News. It is great. There are so many categories like 'Technology' and there are really good articles. This is definitely a 5 star app!!!!!!!!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book!!! You receive a lot more information in this second book. And there's also a really good twist. I couldn't put it dwn! Now I can't wait for the third
B0034DGPEU|2.0|I felt that writing was often trite; characters weren't well developed (Mama Mae was the best one.)  Situation resolution was often predictable.  Writing style was boring with way too much \\"telling\\" and not much dramatic action.  Author needs to take fiction writing classes to improve style and ability to develop plot.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|Ties in nicely with the Alien series showing the beginning and evolution of the creatures. Spectacular landscapes and were pleasing to view. Dimly lit interior scenes give it and ominous and moody feel that something bad is going to happen.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|It was awesome plain and simple the story, the animation, the voice acting I'm a fan of Kevin Conroy and I was a bit upset that he wasn't playing Batman but hats off to Peter Weller he did a great job if you like the DC Universe original movies you'll really like this one as well, check it out.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|Can't really say much about this app, except that it would not work on my HTC Evo Design 4g. Downloaded and installed a couple times and when I tried to open, all I got was a blank screen, This may work well on some other phones but I was unable to make it work on mine.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|This title is my favorite of the entire Sonic series, which is saying a lot since I absolutely love all the Sonic games. I was afraid this remake would be awful and soil this great game, but it exceeded even the loftiest of my expectations. The unlockable content on the game was an ingenious add, especially the ability to play as Tails.  Also, I found the Japanese score to be quite amazing, but I like that I can still choose the American one.  All in all, it is definately the best Appstore game I have played. Sega, please re-release more of the obscure Sonic titles. I am sure I'm not alone in saying I would buy them all in a heartbeat.

1400069289|5.0|This book is really interesting! It makes you thing about some really obvious things. So obvious, you have never thought about them. With a lot of real cases that help you to understand better how our habits work. The tips are a good framework to help you change some habits. I've done it.<br />I've found myself glued to it.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was absolutely horrifying and a drugged out stripper could of wrote a better story. I relied on the dancing to make up for the rest of the movie, but trust me it didn't. Just when you think things are going to get good (if you know what I mean) it skips to the next scene. I saw this movie for free and I can't imagine how angry I would be if I had to pay to watch this. Stay Away.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|First, I want to say that this book was absolutely amazing!  If<br />you haven't read it yet, go out and buy it now!  Colleen Hoover is one<br />of the most talented authors I have ever had the pleasure of reading.<br />  The characters in Slammed are extremely relatable.  I felt like I<br />knew Lake and Will, and they were a part of my family.  Every time<br />they laughed, I laughed, and every time they cried, I cried too.  This<br />book turned me into a ball of emotion.  That's how good it was.<br />  Another thing that I loved about Slammed was the beautiful love<br />story that unfolded before my eyes.  Lake and Wills' love for one<br />another was the type of love we all yearn for.  They were soul mates.<br />They both enjoyed the same kind of music, loved poetry, were mature<br />for their age, and they both had gone through more than anyone their<br />age should ever have to go through.  The characters connected on such<br />a deep level that they felt each others pain, and would do anything to<br />take away the pain of their significant other.  Lake and Will found<br />refuge, a place for healing, and a home in each other.  Throughout the<br />whole story, I was routing for their relationship to  succeed, despite<br />the obstacles that were continually thrown in their paths.<br />  I also loved the plot line.  There was never a lull or dull<br />moment in this story.  Everything that occurs in this story will<br />touch your heart, and leave you thinking about it, long after the last<br />page is read.<br />  The bottom line is that I would give this book a 5 out of 5<br />stars, and go so far as to say that it's one of the best books that<br />I've EVER read in my life!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I haven't seen such a great movie in a long time. This movie made me cry and laugh at the same time. This is bound to be a new Christmas classic. A must see for adults and children.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love this movie & so do my kids. The digital copy was easy to put on my iPad. The price was a steal!
B005J2UM9S|4.0|As I read on some of the other reviews, the start of this film did not hold much promise.  It was very cheesy, corny, you name it.  Reeked of low budget and poor execution.  But if you hold on and endure it is well worth it.  The rest of the movie was great, very tense, and great scares.  Very well done.  Unfortunate the start is so bad as sadly some may not make it past it and miss out on what the rest of the movie holds for them.  Great ghost movie, loved it.
B008MC175A|4.0|This collection was great for me tying the different X-Men stories together, and making them complete. I love sci-fi, and action movies, and the collection satisfied both for me completely.

B0063IH60K|2.0|Playing this version is just okay.  It is annoying to have a Pop Up Add prior to playing the next game. For me it is a back up game to fill in a short time period.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I recommended it to my daughter who was working on her Master's in Social Work at the time.  She loved it also!  I certainly didn't see the ending coming!!!!
B009GEAPYW|3.0|The original \\"Dark Knight Returns\\" graphic novel re-defined the concept of the term \\"superhero\\" while it paid hommage to the classic tale of the gallant champion who hangs up his sword/gun/weapon of choice to live a peaceful life only to find out that it doesn't fit him nor does it benefit the world that he lives in. This movie adaptation picks up the essence of that story but I felt that something was deeply missing when Bruce Wayne's/Batman's internal thoughts were removed during the creation of this film.<br /><br />While I can't honestly say that I loved the finished product, I can't say that I hate it either. It's true to the essence of the printed page but it could have been TRUER if the filmakers focused on ALL of the words as well as the images of the original story. \\"Sin City - The Movie\\" is living proof that it could be done and it was a purer interpretation of a comic book masterpiece than THIS film was! Perhaps the creators of this project should have watch THAT film to see how Frank Miller tells a story with words as powerfully as he does with pictures and revealing that two mediums, words and pictures, working together can be far more effective than one in the right hands!<br /><br />As a child, I've owned Classic Illustrated Comics/Golden Records combination packs of several literary classics, \\"Mutiny on the Bounty\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\" among them. I enjoyed listening to the records while I was reading the comics and appreciated the adapted stories even more as a result of using this method. Perhaps using a similar technique, read the original book while watching the film, is the best way to enjoy the central story rather than just watching it on the screen. At least a new viewer would understand why Bruce Wayne's story nearly ended in the opening act, what he was thinking during his tense battle scenes and why this film was made in the first place while a fan of the graphic novel can re-read it while enjoying a well-presented soundtrack and moving pictures!<br /><br />Just a thought.pictures!<br /><br />Just a thought.
0307749584|1.0|Dull, drawn out tale. Child was just going through the motions on this one. Between this story and the fact that Tom Cruise is the new Jack Reacher, I think I'm done with Lee Child and Jack Reacher. It was a nice ride while it lasted but this book will bore you to sleep. Don't waste your money.
B000FC1LOC|1.0|SPOILER.<br />I have decided that Jodi hates mothers, especially those who parent in difficult situations. She demonizes them, and makes them to be pretty much evil. The other characters are little martyrs to their mothers demands and become self destructive. This is not in just this book but in several of her books. They follow a theme 1.sick kid 2.awful mother 3.passive all along but suddenly stands up for himself father 4.siblings of sick kid who want to self destruct/hurt themselves. 5.lawsuit 6.win lawsuit 7.kill a main character. I just seriously roll my eyes in disgust at her deciding that she really dislikes people who fight for their rights, and especially dislikes women.

0671578855|5.0|A Civil Campaign (1999) is the twelfth SF novel in the Vorkosigan series, following [[ASIN:1416555471 Komarr]].  This work, its prequel and its sequel are included in the omnibus edition [[ASIN:1416555471 Miles In Love]].  The initial work in this series is [[ASIN:0671655744 Shards of Honor]].<br /><br />In the previous volume, Miles was working with Vorthys on oversight of a serious incident in the Komarr system.  An ore freighter had collided with a space mirror over Komarr.  The mirror satellite had provided extra insolation to the planet for its terraforming.<br /><br />The satellite damage was starting to adversely effect the transplanted biology on the planet.  The Komarrans wanted the satellite fixed as soon as possible.  It was becoming a political issue on Barrayar as well as on Komarr.  Gregor wanted Vorthys and Miles to determine if the incident resulted from sabotage.<br /><br />After arriving in the Komarr system, Professor Vorthys and Miles first observed the efforts of the probable-cause team.  Then they went down to the planet to find quarters.  Ekaterin invited them to move in with them.<br /><br />Ekaterin ordered a grav bed for Miles and then prepared dinner for the Lord Auditors and her family.  Tien was very cynical about the mutant Lord Auditor and Ekaterin wondered how he obtained his injuries.  Nikki had a number of ship models and was very pleased to learn that Miles has traveled aboard many of those ships.<br /><br />In this novel, Miles Naismith Vorkosigan is the son of Aral and Cordelia.  He no longer has fragile bones;  they have all been replaced with synthetics.  He has resigned from the Barrayaran Imperial Service and now is an Imperial Auditor.<br /><br />Gregor Vorbarra is the Emperor of Barrayar.  After the death of his mother -- Princess Karenn -- he was raised by Miles' father, the Regent.  Gregor is engaged to marry Laisa, a woman from Komarr.<br /><br />Ivan Vorpatril is a Captain in the Imperial Service.  He and Miles have thesame great-grandfather;  their grandmothers were sisters.  Unlike Miles, Ivan is tall, handsome and charming.<br /><br />Alys Vorpatril is the mother of Ivan and the widow of his father.  She is a friend of Miles' mother and the official party organizer for Gregor.  She is trying to marry off Ivan and have grandchildren.<br /><br />Georg Vorthys is a retired Professor of Engineering Failure Analysis at the Imperial University of Barrayar.  He is also an Imperial Auditor and is Ekaterin's uncle.<br /><br />Ekaterin Nile Vorsoisson is a Barrayaran from the South continent.  Kat was married to Etienne -- now deceased -- and is the mother of Nikki.<br /><br />Nikolai Vorsoisson is the son of Etienne and Kat Vorsoisson.  He is very enthused about spacecraft.<br /><br />Mark Pierre Vorkosigan is a clone of Miles.  He was created by House Bharaputra of Jackson Whole for Komarr separatists.  He impersonated Miles until caught, but was freed to find his own destiny.<br /><br />Kareen Koudelka is the youngest of four sisters.  Her father had been an aide of Count Vorkosigan during the Regency and her mother has been a bodyguard of the Countess and then of the young Emperor.<br /><br />Enrique Borgos is an Escobaran genetic entomologist.  He has developed a new breed called butter bugs.<br /><br />In this story, Gregor and Laisa are to be married at Midsummer.  Everybody is talking about the wedding.  Alys, Ivan and Miles are working on the preparations.<br /><br />Miles will be Gregor's Second in the ceremony.  Alys is charged with the planning and direction of the ceremony.  Ivan is performing odd jobs for his mother.<br /><br />Miles is trying to arrange a marriage of his own.  He has fallen in love with Ekaterin, but realizes that she still hasn't recovered from her former marriage.  So he is getting involved in her life, but laying off marriage proposals.<br /><br />Miles has some competition for Ekaterin.  Ivan is attracted toward her, but he definitely is not ready formarriage.  Miles gets him to swear on his name that he will not court Ekaterin.  Yet Ivan is a bit peeved at going that far and gets a coworker interested in pursuing the woman.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Alys is issuing tasks to Miles and Ivan.  She even has ImpSec involved for the security aspects.  The wedding will be the prime event of this generation.<br /><br />Then Kareen comes to Barrayar.  She has been living with Mark on Beta Colony and doesn't quite fit the same with her family.  She is waiting for Mark to return.<br /><br />This tale brings Mark back to Barrayar.  He has brought Enrique with him as a business partner.  Kareen soon starts spending time with Mark.<br /><br />Miles plays Barrayaran politics in this story.  The next installments in this sequence are the novella \\"Winter Gifts\\" from [[ASIN:0451217241 Irresistible Forces]] and [[ASIN:0743436121 Diplomatic Immunity]].<br /><br />Highly recommended for Bujold fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of imperial weddings, political intrigue, and tangled romance.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin

0545123291|4.0|Sam is cured and life would be good for Grace and Sam, but there are now a lot of new wolves in the forest. Sam and Grace wait as spring approaches to meet the new wolves in their human forms and wait to welcome back Olivia. Instead, they find they are welcoming back a new wolf, Cole, who is unstable and somewhat familiar. Turns out the former rocker has a past of his own and one that keeps him human and not a wolf for long.<br /><br />We again are jumping views but now instead of two people we have more people that we are jumping around in the minds of. I actually found that this made this one easier to read. You had to be very careful to see whose chapter it was before you started to read to keep with the story flow. This is an interesting style, and I would guess very hard to write.<br /><br />This book like the first seemed to lack real action to drive the plot. I find this kind of book can be set down easily as you are not as engaged. (this also might be due to the short chapter and choppy writing) When we finally get to the action- Cole figures how to save Grace is to personally reinfect her- I ended up just confused. Didn't Shelby already bite Grace in the beginning of the book?? Would she not have already been reinfected?

It has the feel of one of those great sci-fi/fantasy shows that will be prematurely cancelled because people don't realize how good a show it is.  It was worth every dime that I paid for it via amazon.ca.  If you read this and fantasy is your thing, please buy and/or watch the show so it won't get the premature cancellation that most of these type of shows ususally get.  Lost Girl Rocks!

0345525558|4.0|I loved this novel that brought us into the life of young Victoria Jones.  Victoria is lost and alone without any friends or family as she prepares to live on her own.  Now that she is eighteen she is no longer allowed to live in foster homes, leaving her with the responsibility of finding both a job and a home for herself.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh did a great job of presenting Victoria's life to us within the pages of this book.  The chapters alternated between Victoria's current day struggles and times from her past when she lived in foster homes.  The majority of her past glimpses were from when she lived with a single woman named Elizabeth, who planned on adopting her.  Victoria only lived with Elizabeth for a year, but their time together was special and it left quite an impact on the person Victoria would become.<br /><br />Victoria turned into quite a tough cookie, never staying in one house too long, and usually not being treated very nicely either.  This shows through as she tries to start her adult life, living day to day, not making any plans for the future and just falling asleep wherever her head may lay.  How could she know that the knowledge of flowers that Elizabeth taught her all those years ago would help her get a leg up in this hard world.<br /><br />One day while wandering the streets in search of a job, Victoria is drawn to a small flower shop called Bloom. After showing the owner, Renata, a sample of the floral gifts she can create, she is offered a temporary job.  This allows Victoria the chance to express herself in a way that helps her find the person that she wants to become.<br /><br />This story flowed very nicely, making me want to get back to reading it right after I set it down.  So much more happens in this book than I have described above, but I don't want to give any more away.  I found myself pitying Victoria as she made foolish mistakes as a young woman, but then cheering her on when she figured out what she needed to do to make things right.  It wasn't all rainbows and butterflies, but it did leave me with a happy feeling as I read the last page.  With themes of love, forgiveness, family, and survival this book would make for a great book club discussion or just to read at your own leisure.  I don't hesitate in recommending this novel.ings right.  It wasn't all rainbows and butterflies, but it did leave me with a happy feeling as I read the last page.

144235948X|4.0|I have to admit when I requested this audiobook I didn't read the description at all, but was lured by the cover.  This worked out well for me, because had I read the summary it may not have appealed to me.  I believe this book would fall into the Young Adult genre, and I probably would not have enjoyed reading this book as much I enjoyed listening to the audio version.<br /><br />Our main character Abby, is a young college freshman who has not lived an ideal life.  Her father was a high roller in Vegas, but when his luck turned, he blamed Abby and they lost everything.  This left them penniless while Abby strived to separate herself from her gambling addicted father.<br /><br />When her and her best friend America start college at Eastern University Abby vows to make a new start.  She doesn't want any of the trash that tainted her life to this point to threaten her future.  The last thing she expects is for bad boy Travis to put a wrinkle in her plan.  When Travis starts to pursue her she informs him that nothing could possibly happen between the two of them, starting an honest friendship that both of them appreciate.<br /><br />The relationship between Abby and Travis is a rollercoaster ride of emotional ups and downs.  Travis is the opposite of the kind of boy she was hoping to meet, but when she finally accepts that their relationship is much more than a friendship she embraces him wholeheartedly.  She cannot foresee that her past will be the factor to threaten their union.<br /><br />When I first started listening to this book I have to admit that I didn't care for Galvin's narration.  It started out a bit cold an unemotional to me.  But that changed as the book went on and now thinking back it makes sense.  She was trying to start over and leave her past behind, so I can see how one would need to put their emotions at bay.<br /><br />I enjoyed this audiobook more than I thought I would.  Maybe it's because it reminded me of myself somewhat.  A girl trying to put her past behind her, but still being attracted to the bad boy.  Yup, I admit it.  I like the bad boy!  With themes of young love, new beginnings, and college life, this made for an interesting audio book.  I feel that the young adult audience will appreciate this book even more than I did and I don't hesitate in recommending this novel in audio form.ut her past behind her, but still being attracted to the bad boy.

THEN, I watch it again with the director's commentary.<br />For me, there is a LOT to think about in this movie! Plus the story is well-paced in its telling and the special effects had me looking away a couple of times.<br />So far, I think Ms. Rapace has done an excellent job in picking the movies to be in; and she certainly gives a great performance!<br />[I don't know why Amazon has this marked as \\"instant video\\"; I own the Blu-Ray CD.]
B0086700CM|3.0|My mind works well with problem sloving not hand I cordnation. But everyones mind works diffrently. So this game might be really easy for some people
B006LSZECO|4.0|An intriguing plot that keeps you guessing. Whose story do you believe? One of those \\"you can't put it down\\" stories.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|My six-year old really lkes to play it.  There's no profanity or anything.  The game changes a little as you play.  You earn items that keep it interesting enough to keep going.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to get to the appstore!  all of my friends have it on their iphones. now I have it!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Well paced, excellent CG, very good performances by Taylor Kitsch, Tadanobu Asano, Rihanna, Brooklyn Decker and \\"The Old Salts\\".  Two hours flew past since it was so engaging and it really held your interest.  Inclusion of a real life disabled active duty soldier and a group of \\"Old Salts\\" showed how the Navy has advanced and how patriotism is still alive.  Very clever how \\"Battleship\\" the game is included in the story.  Grab some popcorn and enjoy a really fun movie.
B0085W09ME|5.0|I've been researching/booking  flights quite frequently  this year and I find Skyscanner is the easiest way to find the cheapest flights with the most info with the least pain!  The graphical displays of fares by month &amp; day and Airline ROCKS!<br />I vote 5 stars!
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are definitely for adult eyes only and I found the subject matter interesting. Some parts of the book were a little confusing because the author jumped around the plot like it was playing a movie with different scenes. I read the first book practically in one sitting. I was glad I purchased all three books together because I would have been waiting impatiently for the next book to arrive.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Excellent second book in the series! Couldn't out it down!! Will start reading the,third book tonight!! :-) would recommend !
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I got this case because of the reviews i wish i didn't, today i removed the case only to noticed that the 4 corners of my kindle were scratched by this case, man am i pissed i only had this kindle for less then 2 weeks and amazon customer service is an joke. STAY AWAY
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Fabulous excellent! Breathtaking! Just can't wait to read the next book! Could not put bit down! Just the kind of book I love! Would absolutely definitely recommend this book and will be reading the second book as,soon as possible
B008KW43TE|5.0|Lives up to the hype. For once, the preceding publicity is followed up by heady lyrics married to solid grooves.  One of the year's best.
B005XO38KW|5.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of those stories that your supposed to and not supposed to read at the same time.  You're supposed to read it because it's a classic (no need for quotes around classic).  On the other hand, it's pretty much about giving in to one's lesser wants and needs.  We've all probably seen Dorian at one time or another.  If we're lucky, we see him before the fall.  There is something about a beautiful youth who has yet to fell the fingers of corruption.  Many have seen him during the process of corruption (gosh...we may have even participated in said corruption).  We've probably even seen him near the end of the process.  Oscar Wilde's novel is brilliant.  It covers the process of corruption very well.  The ending is cliche, but it wasn't (probably) at the time.<br /><br />And, since I'm writing this for the e-book (uncensored), the model on the cover of the book is, ummmmm..., worth considering being corrupted by or corrupting.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This is great for anyone who is sick of all the trash music, the girls are true artists,there is no fast forword<br />songs. This video is great from start to finish, when ever we get tired of the junk, we go get the girls and enjoy the evening.
034580404X|3.0|The 50 ShadesTrilogy wasn't all a that. I've read way better written steamy novels with \\"good\\" story line. This was too redundant,drawn out n very boring @ times. Extremely predictable which is very annoying. When it was good it was reallly goood, but when it was lame it was unbearable. I either wanted to hurry n get to the end or I had to put it down for a while.
B002AWX6UM|4.0|Americans take pride in the way our technologies and culture influence other nations. We might not be so glad to see how our worse traits are also emulated. Ishmael Beah's memoir lets us see the life of a boy soldier in 1990's Sierra Leone. If we expect nobility and dignity of warriors, A Long Way Gone describes the savage, gleeful resourcefulness of children who delight in slitting throats, playing Rambo with live ammunition, torching villages and stalking enemies. Fueled by inexhaustible supplies of drugs and ammunition, these modern day berserks are controlled and directed by adults; and because there is an inexhaustible supply of expendable children, they are used as scouts and vanguards of military operations.<br />Some of the children survive to adulthood. Some become ruthless, canny adults who wreak even more clever horror on the civilized world. Stripped of empathy and compassion, their only pleasure is mayhem.<br />Some few find healing, as did Mr. Beah. Given the opportunity to escape the inferno of war, he has begun to pursue the life of peace. This book is no doubt a part of his therapy. Although he will probably suffer nightmares and flashbacks until the day he dies, he has set out to define himself as a world citizen and peacemaker.<br /><br />Americans cultivate romantic notions about children: their innocence, beauty, naivete and vulnerability. We should put that romantic impulse to good use and invest our energies in something other than weapons and drugs. If more people read A Long Way Gone we might develop ways to invite African people to join us in building a prosperous world where children are honored as images of God.
B00783NWB6|5.0|5 star for me , from 3d to pictures quality , from quality to actions , I love it , I bought it and I rated it 5 stars , don't mind people that giving it 1-3 stars cuz of plots of the movie , try it and you'll see yourself .
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The product was well-packed. It has all four DVD's in one case so it's handy. THe quality of the audio and image are excellent
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Jean told me the excitement slows down significantly and the book lacks the intensity of the first in the series.  She said she won't be reading the third book.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|Although this EP is only 4 songs, the hardness and complexity of the music is excellent and reminds me of the \\"...and justice for all\\" era. A must-have for all Metallica fans
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Was lucky to get this for free, but well worth the price.  Other games at this price, are not worth the money. Superb graphics and sound.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|I have been collecting Lego since I was a kid and I was excited about this set.  It was a lot of fun to build and it looks great in my village.  Lego has been part of my Christmas experience my whole life!
0061119725|5.0|When I taught English as a foreign language my 2-6 year old students enjoyed this story. They would copy each action as I read along. Now as a new mother I had to purchase this book.<br /><br />We purchased this book when my daughter was 6 months old and now at 7 1/2 months she has started to copy the cat page. She tries her best to arch her back like cat when we read along. For each other page she watches attentively to see my gestures. This is an excellent story for any age.
B0087YYHZU|2.0|Just great!  Music was best I ever heard.  Color is unsurpassed for something filmed in the 1950s.<br />A must have for musical collectors.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|At first, I found Prometheus a little \\"kubrick-esque\\", but after the first 10 minutes, this seemed to fade. It also had some clear references to the \\"Alien\\" movie toward the end. The middle was a little Indiana Jones. Overall I thought it was an excellent movie. I was pinned to the seat for about half of it. Very worth the time if you like sci-fi, sci-fi ethics, or Charlize Theron as a cold-hearted bi#$&. They could have tried a little realism when it came to the spacecraft, though. We have had the International Space Station long enough that even hollywood types have probably heard of it, yet they haven't been able to do a realistic sci-fi spacecraft since Kubrick. Have to say, though, that I really loved the surgery machine. Might have been a tad loose with how it would work, but the concept and cgi was cool an original. Some of the characters were a little too amplified, like the mercenaries and the cold hearted capitalists. Not sure they got the scientists quite right.
1476712042|5.0|I absolutely adore this book!!! I read it start to finish yesterday and today I have spent every spare moment trying to find something that compares to it!
B007ORWL3G|1.0|Everybody knows Draper's secret. Original writers have left or run out of ideas.<br />No new situation to grab your interest. Need more use of Peter and Peggy characters.<br />Roger seems silly. Where's the cool divorcee that was down the street?<br />Haven't seen fat Betsy yet; is that all they've got? Seems a bit misogynistic.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Riordan does it again! In The Mark of Athena, our favorite characters continue to develop as they face more challenges, internally and externally. A heart-dropping cliffhanger leaves us hungry for the next book in the series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|now that I have started using Evernote I can't remember what my life was like before it. I am so much more organized.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game. Just wish It was easier to get diamonds. pretty cool game though. Keeps me playing and busy for a lil bit.
B004AQR24W|4.0|I hold up on seeing this movie because I thought it was just a whole bunch of old action movie stars doing their things.  I mean, you see one and you see them all.  I am not a fan of the Statham guy either.  I watched it and it was funny and not cheesy at all.  I can't believe Bruce Willis and Arnold S. were in the movie for just a couple of minutes!  Anyways, I think I may even rent the sequel! Mickey Rourke has GOT to be the sexiest man on earth!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The  writting, the acting, the special effects were top notch. expected nothing less from Ridley Scott as with all of his movies. I'll be wating for his sequel.
B008GOAFBQ|2.0|Since original producer Bob Ezrin was in charge, I was expecting he'd show some tender loving care for this album. And well, maybe he did. But I'll never be able to tell because I couldn't suffer more than a couple of minutes of Destroyer Resurrected. Half way through Detroit Rock City, I was done w/ the album.<br /><br />I don't know to what extent Ezrin is responsible, or whether it was the privilege of the mastering engineer to butcher the album (I suspect so), but the result is nasty. Way too much compression, way too much limiting - some nasty artifacts and distortion - over-accentuated high frequencies, and so on.<br /><br />Which is somewhat surprising considering how refreshingly light-handed were the remasters of the original Kiss albums, including Destroyer.<br /><br />My take on it - if you care at all for the actual sound quality of the album, buy the original. If you want it louder, turn up the volume. If you want it brighter, use the EQ.
B008XG1X18|4.0|works great!  didn't freeze much and the pin quailty is fantastic. :) great app! it was much easier to use than before.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love youversion! You can download any version they also have different reading plans! You can download different versions as well.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|This is the bluray we have all wanted. The quality is great, as are the extras. The only downer is yet another batch of pointless revisions. We were hit with the first special editions and now the BR version adds its own problems. Even so, the quality is great and this is perhaps the best they will now ever be.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I have to say that this is a film that had a big impact on me. The visuals are stunning, the messages marvelous, deeply disturbing, and not soon to be forgotten. I really liked the free-form direction, the juxtaposition of subject matter. I will watch this film over and over again.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|As stand alone scifi horror thriller, 'Prometheus', is freaking awesome. The visuals,  plot, acting, and special effects were exceptional. Loved the plot twists and the main characters too.  There were a couple of surprisingly horrific sequences that still linger in my mind. But as a prequel to the sci-fi horror masterpiece, 'Alien', 'Prometheus' is not a good one because it raises a hell of a lot more questions than it answers about the xenomorphs' and the \\"Space Jockey's\\" origins.... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!........1ST of all, the movie takes place on another moon, LV:233, and not LV:426 where the xenomorph eggs were discovered in 'Alien'. There were no xenomorphs at all till the last shot of the movie before it ended. So hopefully there will be a sequel to Prometheus that explains a lot more and to also follow the adventures of the survivors who attempt to travel to the Engineers' Homeworld.
0385742886|4.0|The Kill Order by James Dashner is one of those books that you get really excited to read; you count down the days until it's released because you loved the rest of the series and are PSYCHED for this awesome #.5 book.<br /><br />Directly after the solar flares destroyed the earth, Mark and Trina joined a group of survivors; two of those, Alec and Lana, happened to be veterans with military training from back in the day.  When a disease, The Flare, is let loose by men and women in protective suits aboard bergs, people start die off quickly while others lose their sanity. Mark, Trina, Lana, and Alec set off to find out what is going with their village and others, but along the way they come across obstacles and not everyone will come out alive.<br /><br />I really did enjoy the Kill Order.  I was worried that I wouldn't like it because I just fell in love with the characters of the original Maze Runner trilogy; I didn't think I'd like these new guys.  Truthfully, I think I may even like these characters better; it's hard to decide.  They all have their stories and problems, but all they hope for is the right to live. They work their hardest to make it day after day in this new destroyed world, so I give 'em props.<br /><br />The Kill Order really helped explain to readers of the Maze Runner what was going on before we met Thomas and the others; why they were doing what they were doing, why, and how the Flare was set loose on the unsuspecting public after the solar flares burned the earth.  This book was not only a great story with awesome characters, but it gave us the back story I'd been craving!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love minecraft but i can't download it.it says error in download try again i try again and it does it again can anybody help???????????
B009GEFXLC|4.0|I have liked the show Castle since it came out. Very refreshing show compared to most of what are out there today. Though I had always 'hoped' Castle and Beckett would end up together, why does it always have to include sex. Come on..can't we leave some things to the imagination...though I do admit their 'sex' scenes are not as vivid as in most other shows.  Other main characters are also refreshing and an important part of the show. I do enjoy Castle very much and am excited to see where the writers go with it. To Amazon: I have your Amazon Prime membership and feel it is well worth the annual fee. I own a Kindle Fire and really enjoy being able to watch the video on demand shows on that, as I have purchased several seasons of this show and other shows through the Amazon video on demand and download them to either Amazon Unbox or view them on my Kindle Fire. You have a wide variety of options to purchase and also options to sell. Thank you.
B007SGM084|5.0|These 3 books were the best love story I have ever read!! Mystery,passion,secrets,love,intrigue,danger, extremelly well written. I could'nt put it down!I cant wait for her next book!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Son loves this game. Mom loves that it is good clean fun. Keeps him busy and focused. Overall good game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We have thoroughly enjoyed the British version of Downton Abbey and highly recommend it. We are watching season 2 now and have not been disappointed with it in any way. We were told the British version was the best and easily found it on Amazon.com.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Absolutely love it.  I can read hands free when I wish or read like a book.  I would highly recommend it to anyone with a Kindle Fire HD 7\\".
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good game to play while waiting for something else to happen. This game only has one drawback and that is the pop up ads at the start of each new game.
B003U53QT4|5.0|If you liked the first four seasons, this one is just as good if not better!I really enjoyed it and cant wait to watch the 6th and final season.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|This app works great.<br />Developers need to make money to live and support their products.<br />It is immature to complain this is trial software. Look how many packages do not have demo versions and the first time you try it you have already paid.<br />Many users seem to be &quot;collectors&quot;.<br />The goal should be to get an application that fits your needs, not just load and review as many apps as possible.<br />Get the apps you need, support developers so they can support their software.<br />Grow up, you get what you pay for, and if you can't write a accurate review, don't just blast a app because it's not free.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Is this a movie only for horny females or horny gay men?  If you have a thing for men in banana hammocks, this is the movie for you.  As for me, I couldn't wait for it to end, and nearly fell asleep on it.  It was so bad that my daughter walked out of the room in the middle of it.  I thought this movie was an embarrassment with a very thin, and boring, yet predictable, plot.  I'm glad I had a credit to use to see this, but even with the credit, it was a waste of my time and money.
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun addictive game. pretty easy concept, my 4 yr old plays and loves it as well, so great for everyone!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is the best game ever. its also super addicting<br />I recommend this game to everyone. packing groceries had never so much fun
B008JFC6F0|4.0|I can't decide which album I like better, this or Innerspeaker. Where as Innerspeaker, I feel, focuses more on the sweeping spectacle of the effects pumped into the production, Lonerism is a much more relaxed album. Its still saturated with psychedilia and can get quite loud at times, the drums and effects keep the album from stalling, but this time the beautiful relaxed voice and melodies of Kevin Parker stand out. His voice is gorgeous on this album. He makes it reeeaal difficult to not sing along with him sometimes, even if the words are sometimes hard to understand. There are layers upon layers upon layers of effects and distortion, and it often sounds rich and sharp, but sometimes muddy, although I think that was done on purpose, giving a sort of a digital fuzz to counter the sharp futuristic sounds. As I said before, Jay Walker's drumming drives the album. It reminds me of the chaotic style of a lot of 60's psychedelia combined with a repetitive loop on a drum machine. The album title definitely fits the lyrical content. There seems to be a continuous theme of not fitting in, being unsure about one's self and the future, being uncomfortable with success. I guess that's why this album feels more drawn in than Innerspeaker. Here is what I think are the stand out songs...<br /><br />\\"Be Above It\\" is a great segway from Innerspeaker, with a pounding drumline and a repetitive melody, great intro.<br /><br />\\"Mind Mischief\\" is where this album really starts to shine. Its a very laid back song, but the drums drive it. Kevin's voice shines in this, the melodies ooze like caramel and the outro gives you the feeling of floating in a soft purple haze, its probably my favorite song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Why Won't They Talk To Me?\\" has an infectious outro thats great to sing along too.<br /><br />\\"Keep On Lying\\" fades into a solemn yet driving intro, and then goes into Magical Mystery Tour/Yellow Submarine-like sound effects. It's a great example of how this band likesto smooth into these long musical tangents halfway through. The song structures aren't exactly conventional, but thats not necessarily bad. The songs are still tight. There are too many bands that go way too over-board with their talents and effects and solos, and the result is often a bloated and self-indulgent mess. Not with this album, theres just enough chaos to keep things interesting.<br /><br />\\"Elephant\\" is the albums single, and it sounds like it. It definitely sounds like it belongs on Innerspeaker, being the most outgoing and loud song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control\\" basically summarizes the sound of the album. Great high notes sung by Kevin, loud, crashing drums, waves of non-stop sound, great song.<br /><br />In short, buy this album.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Felt a need to find another series after the shades of grey. This was fabulous. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next ine
B005LAJ1O0|4.0|although I haven't watched all of the series as yet, I have enjoyed what I have watched and am looking forward to watching all  of it.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Promethus is rated for less than one star due to the fact that the entire plot became your typical \\"run-of-the-mill\\" sci-fi movie plot.  Prometheus just had more financial backing to produce such a film and sadly left a lot to be desired to retain a uniqueness separate from most sci-fi films.<br />If such a viewer does not mind watching a predictable and generic plot unfold, then good luck.
B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE it! I take my kindle fire everywhere with me and having a pinterest app is fun! Pictures are great and works just like the web version :)
B008WCP2PG|1.0|i had a very time telling if they were trying to be serious with this movie .<br />It was bad bad bad...i dont even think I will wathch the rest before it goes in the trash.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Bank's latest addition to his Culture series does not disappoint.  Each novel of the series is a perfectly self-contained individual read.  This book is a stellar introduction for new readers and a pleasure for a longtime admirers of his work.
B0081BU42O|3.0|I've read all of his books and while this was enjoyable there was little sense of danger or suspense. mostly an interesting story.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Bossypants was a good read, very funny and inspiring in some ways.  It was good to read a book by a down-to-earth woman that wasn't about her inner struggles of accepting herself in a world of hollywood beauties and blah blah blah. It was nice to read about someone who is quirky, happy and successful.<br />Also a very funny book, a little embarassing to read in public though because of the staring- at- the -kindle- book- on- your- phone- and- laughing thing.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|I love this band, and have everything they've ever done.  They are ultimately creative, different, and always unique, with awesome musicianship and of course, Maria's intense vocals and lyrics.<br /><br />But this effort is different...and not necessarily in a good way to my ears at least.  The music is terrific as usual, with tight passages, crunchy guitars, and pounding metallish beats and pulse.  Its hard not to be infected by tone of the music if you're a bona fide metalhead.<br /><br />Now the lyrics and the themes of the record are something completely different, and I'm deeply torn. While I \\"get\\" the whole suffering thing, the lyrics here are not really about suffering near as I can tell.  There is definitely something going on here; I feel as though the band has started selling sex, with Maria's vocals and lyrics almost pornographic at some points.  Not necessarily a bad thing all the time (I'm a huge Berlin fan!!), but this album is bizarre in its themes, which seem to be based mostly around sex and depravity.  I get the whole thing about desperation, drugs, etc, but I for one, found the lyrics and themes deeply harsh and almost surprising.<br /><br />I LOVE in your face metal, and most of us expect this stuff from In This Moment, uniquely in all of our faces.  There has been a subtleness to Maria's lyrics in past albums, where the themes of desperation and being lost are always there, even sex and depravity, but the storytelling was crafted more deeply, so that you had to work for it, to understand what the songs are about..then your brain can pattern match to personal experiences and understand what she's telling us.  Not with Blood:  This is a rocket launcher of explicit ideas, right into the forehead.<br /><br />Not sure what I think.  I've listened numerous times, and while it is unmistakably In This Moment, its also bizarrely hard to get into for me at least, and I feel the lyrics are a cheap play on Maria's sexiness, beauty and personal experiences.I'd rather work for it
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Love Avengers and all the movies that led up to it.  Tool a whole yo purchase them till I felt the promise was worth it and as always amazon had the best one.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I would reccommend it. love that its free. it passes the time when you are bored and have nothing to do
0385535147|1.0|Started out pretty good then got BORING. Plot is implausible. Very disappointing book. The main character is not even remotely interesting. The big surprise resolution is plain stupid and unbelievable.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I've read all of Mitch Albom's books and I enjoyed this book very much. He is such an amazing story teller and manages to connect the characters without losing the reader. I do however favor a couple of his other books to this one, however I still found joy in this read.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Following the Season 2 disaster (I gave it a 1 star rating), Season 3 is on track to be as good or better than Season 1 which I gave 5 stars.<br /><br />The action in this episode is almost non-stop, and during the slower times the tension between the group members is explored.<br /><br />Evidently, the writers took some writing courses over the Summer and have learned how to develop character and context without making it stupid and boring.<br /><br />This is what the Zombie Apocalypse is all about .  . . survivors living by their fighting skills and their wits . . . overcoming difficult situations with their cunning, problem solving and mental and physical toughness.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite hunger games book! I love it so much!!! If u are questioning buying it, GET IT!!!!!! You wont regret it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book to read.  I cannot wait for the movie or to read the final book.     I would recommend it to everyone.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Received Kindle HD as a gift last week. Downloaded this app. Have the same experience many others have reported. Only shows 10 or so items in newsfeed. Very disappointing. Considering returning Kindle HD. Don't see point in a tablet if I can't use it for Facebook.
B0083GQVOC|4.0|That was worth seeing. What would you do is that was your kid? How strong is a mother's love? How creepy can one kid be???
B007SGM084|5.0|I Loved all three books!! I don't normally read a lot, but i could not put these books down! I Thought third was the best but didn't like the ending!!!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|Took me a long time but my son finally convinced me to watch the first one.  HOOKED!!!!!  While I'm not totally crazy about lumbering dead people roaming all over the world the story line and the characters relationship with each other is enough to make me want more and more.
B008Y6ZTKS|5.0|Love this movie ! U should buy soul soufer on ur kindle fire if u wat a movie that is Christian ; Family ;exciting
B005E94WB0|2.0|Just annoying... you look at the \\"most helpful reviews\\", which describe things like magnetic closure and MORE IMPORTANTLY a BELT CLIP.<br /><br />It's got a velcro closure that will wear out far more quickly than the embedded magnet enclosures that are described in reviews.  It has NO CLIP... so, forget about putting it on your belt or anything else.<br /><br />THOSE OTHER REVIEWS SHOULD BE REMOVED AS THEY ARE _NOT_ FOR THIS CURRENT PRODUCT THAT IS SHIPPING.  THEY MAY HAVE CHANGED THE DESCRIPTIONS, BUT WITHOUT REMOVING THE REVIEWS WHICH ARE NOT... ___NOT____ FOR THE PRODUCT THAT I WAS SENT, OR OTHERS BEFORE ME APPARENTLY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AT LEAST...  TROUBLE IS THE REVIEWS THAT YOU ARE DRAWN TO ARE FOR THE OTHER, BETTER PRODUCT.  ALSO --- the SAME EXACT ITEM IS $1.70 LESS IN A DIFF. LISTING... BUT I THOUGHT \\"I WANT THE BELT CLIP\\"..  Hassle to return.  Seller is blacklisted for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game when I saw it I was like Omg finally I could play this game all day
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Being a fan of this trilogy, I couldn't pass up the movie! Movies based on books always make me nervous because my expectations are so high. I think this movie followed the story well enough. My husband became interested in the series after watching the movie, proving that you didn't have to love or even know the story to enjoy the cinematic experience.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Another wonderfully made movie by Dreamworks. The movie is funny and very entertaining. Enjoyed the characters and the songs were magic. A film for all ages, definitely , will make you smile.
B001AJ09JW|3.0|I had heard over the last ten years that the opening scene in this movie is one to be remembered.<br />And it was.<br />Excellent opening.<br />We have a luxury liner where everyone on board is killed back in the early 60's.<br />The ship vanishes.<br />Fast forward to the early 2000's and we have a pilot who spots the ship and enlists a local salvage crew.<br />The acting was surprisingly good for a horror movie.<br />Pacing, direction, score were all very good.<br />The ballroom scene reminded me of The Shining.<br />The movie had great atmosphere.<br />But then we get to...the explanation.<br />Ruined it.<br />Stupid, corny and lame.<br />A cgi cheese fest that destroyed what could have been a great sea/ghost picture.<br />It had so much potential but the ending sunk this ghost ship to the bottom of a sea of other forgettable bargin bin horror clunkers.<br />I'll recommend a rental since it's Halloween time but otherwise don't bother. There's too many other classics of the genre out there to be enjoyed.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|I, like so many others, am a big fan of DeMille -- I've read all his books, some of them several times. This one crashed and burned. The character of John Corey is a good one, but there was too much of his sarcasm shoved down my throat this time, while the plot continued to tread water. Too many of the mini-chapters ended with the promise of a confrontation that (almost) never comes. I see the print version runs 671 pages. A conscientious editor could have helped him pare it down to 400 and improved the pacing. Every good author gets a chance to screw up once, and I hope this is just that hiccup from DeMille. I hope he recovers quickly, and I look forward to his next book.

B005KELWJY|5.0|While I believe that the Belkin Verve Tab Folio was originally made to serve the Kindle Touch, it suits the Kindle Paperwhite wonderfully well because of their size similarities -I could not be happier! There are a few tiny speaker holes on the back cover needed for the audio equipped Touch but not needed for the Paperwhite -No problem there, though, as they are really quite inconspicuous and just not an issue.<br /><br />Striking in black, this slim, low profile, pebble grained cover adds just the protection I want for my Paperwhite without adding any unnecessary bulk. I don't think it's a stretch to call this cover 'handsome'.<br /><br />The four elastic/leather-like corner straps hold the device snug and secure with no worrisome wiggle, erasing any fear that the reader will slip out, yet allow for quick and easy removal should you desire to use your reader without the cover.<br /><br />The magnet tab closure securely shuts the cover with an easy and definite attraction, strong enough to remain closed even when holding the closed folio solely by its front cover and giving it a shake. An unexpected benefit of the magnetic tab closure is that when using with the cover folded completely back for one-hand reading, the tab can also be magnetically secured around the back to keep the folded cover from flapping while reading -Perfect! Lastly, the tab closure is pliable so that it never feels to be in the way as others that I have used have felt.<br /><br />The inner lining is a soft velvetine and feels very nice in the hand. I have read elsewhere that it is a lint collector, but nothing that a bit of sticky tape now and again won't take care of.<br /><br />While I did not think that I would get any use out of pocket located on the inside of the front cover, I have found that by slipping a small magnet down into just the right spot inside the pocket, the cover becomes 'smart', automatically waking the Paperwhite up and putting it to sleep with every respective open and close. I really like that it now works like the far more expensive covers.<br /><br />I think that about covers it for this cover. : ) I highly recommend the Belkin Verve for both its aesthetic qualities and its versatility. Nice!ose.

1401322786|4.0|I've read several of Mitch Albom's past works (my favorite being The Five People You Meet in Heaven), so when my friend recommended this new novel to me, I decided to get it.<br /><br />Although I took less than two days to read this novel, meaning that it captivated me and kept my interest, I still found it lacking. The plot is semi-predictable as you read, leaving you able to guess what would happen next. However, I suppose I could not put down the book because of the story itself. I did want to confirm my suspicions as to what would happen next, and I also wanted to explore this different concept that I have not come across before in any novel.<br /><br />This novel is a mixture of love, reality, and the flow of life. Not only are we left measuring our lives by years, days, minutes, seconds... but our lives are measured with those memories filled with raw emotion.<br /><br />A short read, with different reviews, but in the end, I would still recommend it because of its concept.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A must read for those who like Jack Reacher's novels. The suspense keeps you reading until you find out who did what. And the many ways that he kills those who are trying to harm him shows that Jack is still up to the job.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is the type of book that you cannot stop yourself from \\"fast forwarding\\" turning the pages to get to the end.  This means it is a damn good book!  I read this book in 4 hours but then had to re-read so I could savor all the details.  A very fresh plotline and try as hard as you can NOT to skip any pages as I did because I couldn't wait to get to the end!<br />This would make a great movie!<br />I do not give spoilers as you really should read this book if you want a fast paced and unusual storyline that has not been rehashed over and over.

1424817870|5.0|One of my wife's favorite movies for wintertime. Loves the scenery when it's cold and snowy here in southeast Ohio.
0307744434|5.0|It was quite nearly perfect.  I loved the author's descriptive voice; the storytelling style made it so easy to \\"see\\" everything and feel transported.  I also appreciate that the ending was not tied up in a neat and pretty bow and that it actually required some thought.  I had to chew on it for a couple of days before I decided whether I was truly satisfied with it (and I definitely was, in the end).  I borrowed this as a library book on my Kindle, and I loved it so much I think I'll buy it for myself in hardcover.  This is definitely one I want on my physical bookshelf.
1451662432|1.0|Having followed Arnold's career almost form the start way back in his bodybuilding days,  I can say that although this book has some entertainment value to it, and the part about his mother's death is touching, it is not really candid.  And I don't mean about his sex scandal with the maid.<br /><br />It begins with his descriptions of certain BB contests, like the 1971, 72 Olympia against Sergio Oliva, and the 1975 Olympia against Serge Nubret--which he does not even describe--and the very controversial 1980 Olympia in Sydney.  After Arnold's \\"win\\" in that one, many bodybuilders boycotted the next Olympia in protest. There were many questions about these  contests and the influence by the Weider led IFBB.<br /><br />The race for governor in 2003 is also rather embroidered.  Arnold very much underplays what Enron did during the phony electricity crisis in order to weaken Gov. Gray Davis in the name of energy deregulation. And he also does not mention the famous meeting at the Peninsula Hotel in 2001 which DIck Riordan, Mike Milliken and he himself attended. He then calls the recall effort \\"grass roots\\" when it was instigated by the the ultra conservatives  with Darrell Issa bankrolling it.<br /><br />As per why his administration ended up like Davis', that is with a huge budget deficit, and low approval ratings, he blames it on the sub prime crisis, without saying that those lending agencies were not supervised by the FDIC.  Apparently he does not know this.  What was needed was more and harsher government regulation not less. Perhaps by Arnold himself, since Countrywide and Indymac--two leading sub prime lendrers-- were both operating in California and collapsed under Arnold's watch.<br /><br />For the long version of this review, see Consortium News  (...)
B0035LJY6C|4.0|It's funny how past movies make you get excited to see it again. I still love this quirky movie great for everyone!
0307592731|3.0|Years ago I went on many long backpacking trips; a hundred miles through the High Uintas Wilderness Area in Utah--twice--eighty miles through the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming, weeks at a time in the deserts of southern Utah, and yes, many weekends and longer trips in the High Sierras, which is what interested me in this book.  They are always the occasion for soul searching and deep thoughts, and that was the case with Wild:from lost to found on the Pacific Crest Trail.  As other reviewers have noted, it was brutally honest and searing; too much so, for my taste.  I came for the hiking on the trail and barely made myself stay through the whole book.  I was reminded of what someone, a woman, once said about War And Peace; they read it by flipping through all the pages about war \\"war,war,war,war,\\" until they got to the parts about love, \\"looovvveee\\".  I was the same way with Wild; after the first few multi-page descriptions of weeping and wailing, I got to where I would skip those parts to get back on the trail.  You've all heard of \\"chick flicks,\\" well this is definitely a \\"chick book;\\" it's like Bill Brysons A Walk In The Woods, but without the humor. If you want soul-searching and deep introspection, then Wild is for you; if you want to read about the PCT, then there are other books where you can skip all the \\"war,war,war,war\\" and get on with the hike.

B006QF7664|2.0|Oy....Just when you think you've seen the worst of the found-footage films out there, along comes Apollo 18, As of this writing it's already out on cable, and man am I glad that I didn't spend the extra money to watch this in the theater or on DVD.<br /><br />The concept? Apollo 18 is cancelled circa 1974...or is it? Perhaps it actually launched as a secret Department of Defense mission, so secret that the crew may not even be aware of why they are really heading to the moon. Once at the moon they embark on their supposed mission, but find that there is more to the task than what they signed up for.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that there's currently not a running format like [[ASIN:B001CT05SA Tales from the Crypt]] that writers and directors can go to in order to present cool concepts like the one in Apollo 18, because this movie would have made a pretty good 26 minute short versus the hour and 26 minute long feature film. All of the story content and action could easily have been condensed into less than a half hour, which--done the right way--could have made for a creepy, edge of your seat thrill of a ride. But after 90 minutes of jumpy, static-filled, hand-held camera work with only moments of action at a time...the only time I found myself on the edge of my seat was as I was slipping off my couch in a doze.<br /><br />Sio if there's absolutely nothing else on TV and you see that Apollo 18 is starting on one of the premium cable channels, well...you can see for yourself whether I am right or wrong. But do not wait for regular TV to watch Apollo 18; add commercials to this film, and you will be hard pressed to make all the way through.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|At one level, this is a simple book; the story of a retired brewery rep. who decided (though \\"decided\\" seems too strong a word) to walk the length of England because he has learned that a one-time workmate is dying, and somehow he believes that her anticipation of the visit will keep her alive.  This is the Harold Fry of the title and the story entails Harold, his wife and, at one remove, their son.  With minor exceptions, these are the only people with whom we concern ourselves.  And concern ourselves we did.  My wife and I both read this book and found it compelling reading.  Although the title hints at humour, the book is really a psychological thriller.  Throughout, there is a slight sense of foreboding, but when we find out the reason, it comes as a complete surprise, while explaining much of what has gone before.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book.  It is a first novel, but the author is a playwright and there is a tautness and economy in the prose that has carried forward from writing plays, I suspect.  There is one period of clutter, I thought, towards the end of the book, when the press takes up Harold's story and a number of hangers-on join him, but overall it is a book that I recommend in the strongest terms for its insights into the human condition.

B000ZHCQ5U|3.0|This early to mid era Cold War comedy was OK at best. I remember the film as a kid and recognize it as a classic with a good supporting cast. The plot is simple and pokes fun at Cold War paranoia of it's time and came out the same time as it's more serious counterpart Fail Safe. The plot is simple and predictable. The characters are amusing but not really funny. I enjoyed it for it's historical signifgance but that's about it.

B008M4MB8K|5.0|Being a GIANT Blade Runner fan (My all time favorite film), this Digibook version of Blade Runner has been my favorite release so far. The giant briefcase edition is the ultimate collectors set, but this version cuts out a lot of the fat and strips Blade Runner down to everything that it needs to be. No Gimmicky packaging or toy cars.<br /><br />Here you have the versions of the film that really matter, featuring \\"The Final Cut\\" which is by far my favorite version of the film. The picture quality on this Blu Ray transfer is mind blowing. You would think this film was made within the last 5 years if you didn't know any better. The amount of content on these discs is perfect with out being overkill, plus tons of bonus material.<br /><br />Also, I finally feel that the film has gotten the packaging it deserves with this release. The artwork in the book is great, and I love the cover art of the origami unicorn....a beautiful image that hauntingly represents the movie. This is much better than those character montage covers.<br /><br />If you want a collection of the Blade Runner versions that strips everything down to all the good stuff...this is the perfect set. If you want everything possible that has been released in Blu Ray for this film get the briefcase version. But then you will be paying much more. A release worthy of the classic, groundbreaking film!

B007XUMHQK|4.0|A thoroughly enjoyable collection.  Especially preempted by \\"Happy Trails\\", a totally psychadelic venture.  They act as balances for one another, can you dig?
B009439HEY|3.0|As much as I like Genesis Revisited II, I fear it will be one of the Steve Hackett albums that I will play far less frequently than [[ASIN:B008Z7L8WY Out of the Tunnel's Mouth]], [[ASIN:B000095IWJ To Watch the Storms]] or [[ASIN:B0085W6II8 A Life Within a Day]]. Why? Well, first of all it is not a Hackett album... and most of the (few) songs from his solo portfolio have been constant burners on his live albums, \\"Please Don't Touch\\" and \\"Camino Royale\\" in particular. So nothing really new here.<br /><br />And then it's no Genesis album either. Don't get me wrong, in places it sounds almost like an exact replica of the brilliantly remastered originals with a few variations here, a bit more (great) guitar there. But really nothing to make it particularly spectacular or revolutionary. And me being a fan of surround mixes, I guess I will always prefer to listen to [[ASIN:B001EO2UJK Genesis Box Set 3 (1970-1975)[13 Disc Set]]]. Don't get me wrong, the production values on this album are top notch, no complaints. But that alone does not do it for me.<br /><br />There are, however, a few exceptions, and they alone make it worthwhile to buy this album after all.<br /><br />First of all, Nik Kershaw's rendition of \\"The Lamia\\" is what I had hoped for. Kershaw's vocals are sheer brilliance, probably because he seems to be the only vocalist on this album not trying to mimick Gabriel's or Collin's singing styles in one way or the other. The final guitar solo has been revisited in an extremly enjoyable guitar dialogue...<br /><br />Next, the combo of \\"Unquiet Slumbers for the sleepers...\\" and \\"...in that Quiet Earth\\" are simply better than the original. Slumbers sounds much smoother, mesmerizing than the original Genesis version. Absolute bliss. And \\"Quite Earth\\" just has an absolutely spine tingling finale with Bank's synthesizers being replaced by an alto saxophone solo like you would not believe it. Absolutely, great!<br /><br />And finally, the Steve Hackett original \\"A TowerStruck Down\\" is the third (well, fourth actually) gem on this album. It's way more grittier than on [[ASIN:B000AM1TGC Voyage of the Acolyte]], and has much more impact. Here the modern production values and Steve's seasoned guitar styles really show.<br /><br />So is it a good album? Yes.<br /><br />Is it better than [[ASIN:B001EO2UJK Genesis Box Set 3 (1970-1975)[13 Disc Set]]] or offer different nuances to the material? No.<br /><br />Is it on par with Steve's latest solo offerings (or Squackett)?. No (ignoring [[ASIN:B005KXVFB0 Beyond The Shrouded Horizon [+Digital Booklet]]], which somehow I don't get warm with either).<br /><br />P.S.<br />A word of warning. In my opinion \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" is a real let down. The vocals and some of the (non-Hackett) guitar solos sound like they were recorded by a faceless hard rock band (as in \\"posers\\"). But then again, Hogweed has never been amongst my favorite Genesis songs...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. Didn't want to put it down. Would suggest to anyone!!  Can't wait to read the next two in the trilogy.
B0096HIEE2|5.0|I didn't want to like this movie. But, obviously, something drew me to it in the first place. And I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was simple, not overdone and fluid, which made it believable. It is a classic growing-up story. Matthew McConaughey was a bit annoying for my taste, but the rest of the kids were genuine. Alright, let's not over-think it. Wow that Channing Tatum has a great ass! And his smile...mmmm. And the boy can move! What woman wouldn't want a turn with that? So sorry if I am offending any of you men out there. I totally realize you are not all just man-meat. I'm sure you all have more to offer. And I can just imagine what Tatum has to offer. Please hold...still imagining............yes...........and......!!! Well, there it is. I love this movie! I really thought I was above this kind of thing. But, it turns out I am, well...just a woman with needs and desires like anyone else. And I'm glad to know those parts of me that would appreciate a movie like this are not as long gone as I thought they were.
034552554X|2.0|This was my book club's most recent read.  I have to say that all books sound better when listening to what my book group has to say about them.  The members of my book club always tune into the tender sensitive relationships, the deeper meaning of things and this time they really enjoyed the romantic aspect of the flower's and their language.<br /><br />I have to say I'm more of a cynic than most and I tend to be a harsh judge of fiction.  I also tend to get hung up on the details, which was the case with this book.  I like my fiction to be believable.  I don't care for sappy romances or wild fantasy novels, I want a good story that I can believe happened.  So much of this story was unbelievable that it spoiled the rest of it for me.<br /><br />There were a lot things I found implausible and as I read each situation that seemed unlikely I found myself thinking about what would have made sense in the situation or what seemed more likely for this character and each time that happened it took me out of the story.  I found that happening a lot with this book.<br /><br />I think the author could have created a more realistic and more satisfying story if she had concentrated her focus on Victoria's relationships and completely omitted the story line where she pursues her own career in flowers.  Or if that portion of the story had been developed in a realistic way over a longer period of time it could have added to the story.  I liked the idea of what she did with her talent but her success wasn't believable, it was too fast and too easy.<br /><br />There was a real lack of consistency in character with Victoria.  She was street smart, savvy and capable at times, then feeble and naive at others.  Just one example to illustrate this point is when she's sleeping in the park for weeks before she realizes she could have been sleeping in her car.<br /><br />It felt like the author was manipulating the character and adding hardships for her when it would make the story more compelling or interesting.  She also did the same as far as the fortunes she bestowed upon her.  Which I found equally unbelievable.  (I have never had a boss pay me for time I haven't worked.) Money was another inconsistency in the story, she was flush and set, then four pages later she was worried about her finances.  The lack of realism and the inconsistency of character really spoiled this story for me.<br /><br />Part of me is loath to leave an unfavorable review for this book because the author seems like an amazing person.<br />She's making the world a better place by working to make a difference in the lives of children, five stars for her and all her efforts.pelling or interesting.

B005WTR4ZI|4.0|This book is the wake-up call that every manager or leader of people must read and take action.  Anyone that thinks they are immune from becoming obsolete is kidding themselves.  The authors are very effective at presenting factual data that demonstrates that the path most professionals are on is not sustainable.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|As I previously stated this movie is watchable, but that's about it. As a suspense/thriller it disappoints. As a member of the Aliens family, it makes little sense. Do not expect to be wowed. No great acting, not visually awesome. Simply meh.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Since everyone was talking about this series, I had to read it.  The third book had more of the story developed.  It did redeem the lack of story in the first two books.  This series can be a lot of things to different people.  If you want the sex, boy it had plenty.  If not, skimming works to overlook that part.  All in all though, it was a good read.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great continuation of the story.  The intensity of the relationship is dramatic & touching to read. That said, it was a bit repetitive and it didn't seem to have the strength as the 1st book in it's detail. It answered some important questions but I felt unsated for information when I finished.  It's a pet-peeve of mine that books in a series seem to be intentionally brief so as to save material for the continuation of a series.

The code font is strangely small. All through the book the very text which is the subject of the book is written in a minute font size that is less than half the size of the normal text. Until this is fixed in the Kindle edition it will be a constant annoyance. You either have to make your normal text absurdly large, which will affect all the formatting of every page, or you will find yourself squinting and leaning forward every time the book gets to the interesting part.<br /><br />UPDATE: The Kindle problem is only in the CLOUD READER. The installed PC reader is probably better anyway and does not suffer at all from this problem. I use the installed Kindle for PC and the Kindle for Android on my Galaxy S3 with no problems at all.
B0088TG252|4.0|I'm a Denzel Washington fan and he was good in this movie.  Kind of a Man on fire with euro-trash!
B0078XFYDA|2.0|Okay so I loved 'The Disappearing Spoon' by Sam Kean and have been enchanted by different best sellers about DNA discoveries, flu pandemic research, historical and current, new and exciting food chemistry/diet and health analyses, but frankly I found nothing magical in this latest by Richard Dawkins.  It all seemed like a Cliff Notes rehash of subject material I learned in high school and college in the 70's. Each time he hit on something that might be remotely provocative like quantum particles or whatever, he quickly veered away with a smug statement about how he himself could not follow it.  Somewhere in the middle of the book I began to feel irritatedly condescended to, like some dumb *#:( who got suckered into forking out for leftover science.  Where are the dinosaur feathers?  Star nurseries? Stem cells?  Spare me your tired old preaching about how smart you are to be an atheist and give me some of the magic you promised!
B004EPYZXK|2.0|This movie was fantastic. Tom Hanks goes... wait, wrong movie.... this movie is horrible. Apparently Apollo 17 was the last time anyone went to the moon...officially. A secret mission went underway in 1974? Apollo 18. 3 Astronauts where sent to the moon to plant some sort of spy device... only they discover that may not have been the reason they where sent there after all, especially when they discover something else might be on the moon with them?<br /><br />That may sound interesting, but let me tell you, for most of the movie, you are just bored to death waiting for something to happen as you are treated to annoying sound effects of heavy breathing and what sounds like someone dropping a coin into the porcelain rim of a toilet bowl. What this movie needed was for Jason Voorhees to pop up and say \\"....\\" and then slaughter these guys 5 mins into the movie and end it right there, but instead you have to sit through the done to death boring scenes where a small shadow or a blurry image show up now and then before you see what is actually happening... which is not worth the wait, it's a stupid idea, and I wish I could just say what it is so you too can hear how lame it sounds, but that would be spoiling the movie for anyone who wants to go against me and check out the film anyway.<br /><br />It must be a pretty boring time for movies if this was the one that sounded the most interesting amongst what is currently a new release. I may not always review every movie I see, I just review the ones I have something to say about them, but by all means, don't check this one out over \\"Thats my boy\\", \\"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter\\" or \\"Avengers\\"... man, this one makes the last 3 look like all time greats already compared to this snore fest.<br /><br />Had there been a lot more to choose from at the present time, I probably would have skipped this, seeing it's DVD cover description as \\"This is actual footage an actual event that you where never supposed to see or hear about\\"...yeah, the ole \\"Blair Witch Project\\" advertising that comes about from someone saying, \\"Your daily's look crap, no one will watch it.\\" Response: \\"We will say it's a true story, actual footage 'n stuff\\" \\"Neat!, that might work then, lets allow you to release it\\"... Amazing how the footage of this movie floated back to Earth from the moon and managed to make it's way into the atmosphere without burning up and landed in one piece where someone could watch it. Or maybe that's the storyline behind \\"Apollo 19: The search for footage floating around in space under a pile of spider rocks in the corner of a space witches old home\\"... probably will star Lance Henrikson... but like it's predecessor, I won't be holding my breath to see it, and if I do, well there is another and a half of my life wasted I could have been doing something better with... like watching cars rust.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|don't play if you change devices or if your device crashes. you will lose your game. gameloft does not have a backup system that saves your progress. if you lose your game to a device crash and have to reinstall the game do not expect any help from customer service. they will lie and tell you the will help and then give you a run around, till you get frustrated with them and decide to not play it anymore. yes this is an addicting game.  and they expect you to pay for acorns and coins. they give you missions where you have to spend acorns. and you can not get past them quickly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Amazingly fun in every way! you get to choose the games you would rather play and move on down the road!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Good clean install. Works well with my new Fire HD. Not too buggy. Goes through all the tests in about 11/2 HR. Test uses up only 5% of the battery. Have not had it long enough to judge its accuracy but I feel confident it is.
B007WPLZAK|5.0|If you love period pieces with a romantic element, watch this one!  Eddie Redmayne was fantastic!  His character will draw you in.  The chemistry between Redmayne and his love interest, played by Clémence Poésy, was spell-binding!  PBS has done it again!!
0385366752|3.0|The quality of the audio was perfect. The plot was interesting, but the repetition of &#34;four letter&#34; words was offensive, distracting and completely unnecessary to the story.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All of my friends play this app and even my cousin- who sadly hates angry birds :'( - loves it!!!!!!!!! Just plain EPIC CHIZ Rovio! This one is over the top. I love the way the basic car design weaves its way through a lot of the levels. EEEEEPPPPPIIIIICCCCCC CHIZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Fun game that doesn't require lots of time to get into. You can just pick it up play a few times then go do something else.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Tinker Bell has been re-invented in Disney's current Tinker-reign.  Yes, it is still the Disney formula, but Tinker is an engineer, basically, in her current incarnation.  Less so in this movie, but part of a series where she does discover, build and invent things.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Mature subject matter. I liked the stoy line.Well written. Enjoyed this. I didn't like the name Gidion give to one of the main characters.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is sort of like gambling for kids, as mindless as slots but a fun time sink none the less.
B008JAGZDE|4.0|AP 1, 2, Wedding and Reunion are all well done flicks - consistently funny but not stupid or outrageous. There were other AP movies but they were lame and not worth watching.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Great dictionary<br />Very helpful when i come from school and have to do work on the computer (kindle)<br />_<br />      i i . . i love this kindle so very
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is to notify people that this is working again. There was a short time with errors with installing, however it now is working again. Thank you. Galaxy S III &amp; Samsung Captivate.
0316228532|5.0|The Casual Vacancy uses small town politics, a high school, and a low-income housing project to survey all that is petty, obsessive, sexually subversive, repressed, judgmental, easily-offended, addicted, neglectful and downright mean in human nature.  It is not comforting reading, but then it is plainly not intended to be either.<br /><br />J. K. Rowling is saying something important in this book, and when you hear it described as for \\"adults\\" take that seriously (including many references to sex acts and a lot of strong language). If your reason for reading the book is a desire to escape the way you might have once done with that well-known 7-book series by the author, try something else in the fantasy genre.  However, if you are looking for a well-written, powerful book that may leave you uncomfortable, at a loss for simple answers, and thinking hard, then by all means buy the book.  It is an important book and a good read.
160774273X|5.0|This is probably the most useful of the many excellent bread books I've read, particularly for the serious beginner -- and also for the experienced home baker.  But other reviewers have said all that, so here is my contribution to the discussion:<br /><br />If you don't already have a cast iron pot, which Forkish recommends for all of his bread recipes, consider instead getting a Sassafras LaCloche, a ceramic baking \\"oven.\\"  The down side is that ceramic breaks, and I've broken a couple over the years myself.  But by substituting a cloche for a cast iron pot, you get a miniature oven with a bell-shaped top and a shallow bottom that allows you more safely and easily to place your loaf in a 500 degree oven.<br /><br />I've tried both, using a peel to gently deposit the risen loaf on the LaCloche, which eliminates the stress associated with placing it by hand in a red-hot pot.  Removal is also easy and worry-free with the LaCloche.  And there is less danger of the dough deflating than if you drop it too hard into a hot iron pot.<br /><br />If there is a down-side, it may be that the loaf will spread out more in the LaCloche.  But if your loaf has been properly prepared and proofed, according to Forkish's instructions, and raised in a banneton or equivalent, it should hold it's shape once in the oven.<br /><br />Although iron and ceramic have different thermal characteristics, the results from both are excellent.  (Disclaimer:  I have no connection with Sassafras except as a customer.)<br /><br />By the way, the iBooks version of this book is extremely useful and convenient, especially because you can copy recipes and instructions, email them to yourself, and then edit and print them out for your personal recipe book.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I had a horrible fear that this movie would be nothing but CGI and gore, but I was wrong. It had a plot, characters I cared for, good dialogue. It may be my favorite 'horror' film of the year. Certainly it's top three.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great app. It's more challenging than regular solitaire. A very fun game. Smooth play and easy to learn.  An addictive game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the third book in the Lost Hero series. I thought it was a great telling of the book with many twists and turns. I think it is a great book for all ages 12+ because of violence and perhaps some \\"scary\\" stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. yes they did copy temple tun or maybe they thought of it first but it took longer to develop cause it was a better game? who knows? anyhoo it has three lanes instead of one better graphics better characters. I reccommend this game to anyone who used to like temple run but got sick of it.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|it was fun at first but then it became boring cause you have to really buy a mechanic if u get stuck on how to build it so I cant play it anymore. grrrrrrr!
B0086700CM|3.0|I played it for like a week maybe 2 b4 I got sick of it. subway suffers is much better
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the best clock app I have used with tons of features like different ring tones. setting ringer volume separate from other on my kindle, volume crescendo which starts out soft and gradually gets louder so its not obnoxious and more! I cant believe its free!  this clock has never let me down.
0547564651|5.0|This is the best book ever. I enjoyed reading this and found the author had taken the time to evaluate the overall picture with children and how they learn. This is a must read for Educators, Social Workers, Health care professionals, probation officers and juvenile court magistrates. Anyone who has the ability or yearning to change a young person's life. He took the time to investigate the total child from beginning to end. I cannot say enough about this book. \\"This American Life\\" featured the book and author and I was hooked then and knew I had to get the book. I was not disappointed.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|Gave my fiance her engagement ring last night (yay!) and then made her watch this movie.<br /><br />Told her not to lose it or would send her to the mines of Moria or Sierra Leon, so she'd either have to deal with RUF or Sauron's Orcs if so. Needless to say, she will never lose this ring =)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great way to sync all your thoughts and ideas from all of your devices. Now I don't know how I can live without it. My personal and work life can be put and pulled up from one place.
1423140605|5.0|Sort and sweet.  If you liked the other books written by Rick Riordan, you will love this one.  The ending makes the wait for the next one a LONG one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|A+ A+!! I love the gradual increase in volume of the alarm. also love the size of the snooze button.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|un bon petit jeu bien sympathique sur le thème de l'age de glace. Petit bémol concernant le sens de jouabilité sur kindle fire hd, en effet l'appli ne change pas de sens quand l'on tourne l'écran...mais cela reste une bonne appli à avoir sur sa tablette
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Includes some of the best episodes of the new Doctor Who, especially the Waters of Mars and The 10th Doctor' final episodes, The Stolen Earth and The Journey Ends. They were a fantastic send-off for David Tennant, the best Doctor ever, IMHO. The disc also includes a lot of great extras. If you are a Doctor Who fan, you will want to own this.
B0023S50DO|4.0|The story holds your interest and you have no idea how it will end till it does unlike many other domes day movies.<br />the movies has many stores in one each believable with well known and good acting
B009NQKPUW|4.0|the movie was ok, i think ridley could have done a better job, actors were great, special effects were awesome...just thought that the story line was kinda outta there
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Never takes long to read a Cromwell book.  I felt like I had just started it and was done. If this is your first of her books you will be hooked. If you are a fan you won't be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|awsome game it royalty got me hooked like the first time I played it. the best game I have played in years.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I love this film! I'm a big 80's music fan and I think this movie is funny, exciting, and fun to jam along with!
B008FSCNTK|1.0|As someone who treasures The Girl in the Other Room, Diana Krall in Paris and Love Scenes, I can only wonder who is responsible for this fiasco. I played it twice and was truly appalled. The words \\"boring\\" and \\"banal\\" come to mind immediately. I don't think I can bear to play it a third time. If this album has a concept beyond Krall's \\"sexy\\" photos, it escapes me. I am sadly forced to join all the many one star raters, but if there was a \\"no star\\" category that would have my vote. T-Bone, do you have an excuse? Diana, you have done several Joni Mitchell songs so magnificently, why not a whole album? That would be something for us to take to the desert island and cherish!
B0027MJU00|2.0|I'm a big fan of the author. I absolutely loved Gone Girl and Sharp Objects, but I just didn't like this book. I hate not reading an entire book, even if the book is slow or boring, I HAVE to finish it, but I put this book down. It was so depressing, and dreary, and honestly creeped me out! So if you're not big on morbid stories and get emotionally involved in your reads, this is definitely NOT for you.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is such an amazing read! I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good romance novel. It's a page turner! You can't help but fall in love with the characters.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I have a bachelors degree in creative writing, and I will just say that this book is worth all the rest like it. This is the one to read!
1585673927|5.0|I like all Jeeves books, but this is my favorite. I  got it as a present for my son. He listened to some of the audio versions of the stories and asked for more. Now we both quote Bertie and Jeeves.<br />If you appreciate British humour, read it.
B006H4DBA4|4.0|Great short story .... shame it wasn't longer as I was enjoying it .. I'm a Sophie kinsella fan already
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Did not like as much as previous books. Sort of duh after finnishing would not buy after reading. Would not rate above 1 star
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Works very well. Really is a fun game. Would tell everyone to GET THIS GAME !! Even though i waste a lot of time on it, it really passes the time.
B005EWDAFQ|4.0|Loved this story which had a sense of menace from the very beginning. The creepiness of the tale, and the  mental confusion and uneasiness experienced by  the main characters was described realistically and it continued throughout. Highly recommend you read this book, also \\"Archangel \\" by the same author.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I guess the script for this movie must have taken say 10 minutes to write. It is obviously totally derivative of \\"Aliens\\",  with more special effects, less story. Same spaceship on dubious company business, same robot as key perpetrator of said company business, same deserted planet, same dormant aliens waiting for dumb earthlings, same plans to decimate Earth, same baseball cap to prepare for the ultimate heroic sacrifice. Big change this time is that the spaceship lands in a direct line to the buried spaceships/aliens via a conveniently built road.<br />The actors are a very mixed bag - Noomi Rapace is hard to reconcile as the the mesmeric,  energetic lead in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\"  - her acting in \\"Prometheus\\" is wooden to the nth degree and her facial features are reminiscent of someone post root canal - the Novocaine look. And her hair?  How the remaining actors were able keep a straight face throughout is a mystery.<br />Utter drivel with sub-themes of religion and immortality - oh and the master race.  I've seen Tom and Jerry cartoons that have better and more logical dialog - and by that yardstick - Homer Simpson is a thoughtful genius.<br />This movie is yet another sign of the decline of Western culture, aided and abetted by Hollywood greed.
B008XG1X18|4.0|easier to use then other pinterest apps and everything is formatted to be User friendly. I highly suggest this to download.
B0063IH60K|5.0|im addicted, although the ads are sereiously annoying and some are difficult to clear so i can get back to the  game
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. Very addictive. I can't stop playing. I love the amount of levels. I like that I can put the game down and when I start playing again I start right where I left it. I don't know how many levels there are but I will probably play till it makes me quit.
B0057MFA42|5.0|Just watched the entire show, front to back, on a PS3 and experienced no problems with the sound sync. Maybe if your playing this in a cheap $50 blu ray I can see you maybe having some problems if you can't update the firmware. Other than that, great show and a great blu ray.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game is a bit more than the normal match up type games.  it has some very challenging stages. great time
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|Blues for Jimi is a live Album and Blu Ray by Northern Irish Blues Rock Guitarist Gary Moore with special guest Billy Cox bassist from a Band of Gypsies & Mitch Mitchell Drummer with the Jimi Hendrix experience with a good performance by Gary Moore & Band playing & singing on 12 songs :<br /><br />Purple Haze 4:15 Gary Moore Guitar Vocals , Dave Bronze Bass , Darrin Mooney Drums - Manic Depression 3:48 - Foxey Lady 6:14 - The Wind Cries Mary 4:19 - I Don't Live Today 5:58 - My Angel 0:53 - Angel 5:16 - Fire 5:58 - Red House 11:30 with Billy Cox Bass & Mitch Mitchell Drums - Stone Free 5:45 with Billy Cox & Mitch Mitchell - Hey Joe 9:46 with Mitch Mitchell & Billy Cox - Voodoo Child ( Slight Return ) 10:11 with  Dave Bronze Bass & Darrin Mooney Drums .<br /><br />The sound tends to improve towards the end and found the Blu Ray version of this live concert better recorded maybe because of sound & visual still a Great live performance by Gary Moore & musicians and since is the same concert as the Blu Ray rate it a 5 .
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book....more than I thought I would!  The characters were well developed and one even felt empathy for Dorothy.  The secret kept me guessing right to the end... a surprise twist.  A very enjoyable read.
B0050OMJIW|5.0|Read this book!<br /><br />I remember Catch-22 having a cult like following among my older siblings and their friends.  Catch 22 seemed to have a wide influence in popular culture yet was not a best seller when it was first released.  Heller's humourous war-time Kafkaesque nightmare retains its relevancy forty years on as a political and social commentary. No book has made me laugh and cringe so much at the same time.<br />Technically, its probably not the best book I've read but probably one of the most important and influential.<br />A must read.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I can't stop watching it!  Very much looking forward to the sequal!  It was a perfect setup, or prequal, to the Alien series.
B008M721MS|3.0|I dont have a review since it took so long to get here & i have never used this program before.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This is the most important app on my phone. I use Google calendar for my personal calendar and my office uses Google apps for our business calendar. This app elegantly and effectively merges all of these calendars into one supercharged calendar on my phone. Update events on your mobile device or via the web and the other is updated seamlessly. Chocked full of great widgets such as agenda and task list to make sure you are on top of things.  VERY customizable - but easy to set up and use. If you are a Google calendar user, you want this app.
0767827902|5.0|A beautifully shot, wonderfully acted (Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson, Jeff Bridges, Ellen Burstyn, etc. ) story of loss. Loss of innocence.  Loss of tradition.  Loss of a town,  loss of love, loss of a way of life.  And it's not just loss, but death itself that haunts this beautifully observed story of a dying small town in Texas 1951.<br /><br />This isn't the 'American Dream' 1950s movies and TV told us about.  This is sad, lonely, screwed up people having affairs just to know they're still alive.  Teenagers looking at a future that really isn't much of a future and having to look away.<br /><br />It's a film I understand emotionally much more now that I'm older.  It's a film that looks back on life with wistfulness, but also a cold eye of truth.  There really isn't that much plot, yet you feel like you've gotten to know a whole world.<br /><br />An astonishingly mature film from the young Bogdonovich, arguably his very best.<br /><br />And finally it's available in a gorgeous blu-ray transfer that honors how beautifully it was shot, as part of Criterion's must own BBS box set, along with some of the other best and/or most important American indie films from the late 60s and early 70s (Easy Rider, King of Marvin Gardens)
B005J2UM9S|5.0|Loved it.. Never watch a movie mostly a horror type movie before bed IF you have never seen it.. I couldnt sleep right away lol.. very good movie.. much better than the second.. the second they seemed to be in to big of a hurry... see this one!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I would certainly recommend this to anyone who is a Reacher Fan!  It was a bit slow and took awhile to get moving - was not up to Mr. Childs contemporary professional standards - but always good to visit with an old friend.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Of course it's an absurd storyline but it was very well acted and the special effects were good. It was entertaining and enjoyable to watch!
B0080CL0HM|5.0|Wasn't too sure how i would like this one, but i was pleasantly surprised.  It was really nice to see Rob Playing a role other than Twilight..and it was pretty gritty.  All in all, enjoyable!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This is a splendid narrative that has the intrigue, mystery,  and sex in 14th Century England woven amid the warfare,architechure, agriculture, and mechanical processes of the day.  This is Barbara Tuchman with vivid sex and drugs.

B005FISBTO|4.0|This season Dexter's serial killer is obsessed with bringing on the end of the world.<br />His methodology is to create events from the Book of Revelation thereby causing the end of the world.<br />This season is pregnant with questions of faith, God and forgiveness.  The result is a dark forbidding story striped of almost all comedic overtones.<br />The light-hearted \\"oh my god, this shouldn't be funny but it is\\" comedy series is gone.<br /><br />The replacement is a dramatic series with philosophic overtones allowing for more character interactions and developments.<br />Debra is moving from a plot device to a real character with her own issues.<br />Angel is less likable as a bully quashing his little sister's romance.<br />Quinn is spiraling downward toward his total destruction.<br />LaGuerta is slipping from a political backstabber into a full blown criminal willing to do anything for a promotion or an advantage.<br />Brother Sam, who finds God in prison, goes from Dexter's potential target to showing Dexter to true faith and forgiveness.<br />His influence may be Dexter's redemption and expel the \\"dark passenger\\".<br />Brother Sam's real Christian faith is the counter to the Doomsday Killer's mistaken ideas that can make faith toxic.<br /><br />Dexter always has excellent casting and acting.  Season six continues that with no false notes.  Even the smallest parts are believable and look right.<br />Overall, while seasons five and six go in a different direction from seasons one to four the series is worth watching with interesting characters and fresh stories.<br />This is why the series is in its' seventh season.<br /><br />Showtime put a commercial on each of the DVDs in this set.  My machine was forced to play the commercial each time I started a DVD.<br />Additionally, it is the same commercial on each DVD in the set.  You will be forced to watch the commercial a minimum of four times.  It feels as if I watched it a thousand times.
