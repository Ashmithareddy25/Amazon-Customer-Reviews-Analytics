0385342063|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and the Shopaholic series. I felt that Poppy Wyatt was just like Becky Bloomwood, and that did not bother me one bit, since the Shopaholic series is over. It's hilarious, and will make you laugh out loud. I couldn't put it down and it was one of those books that makes you sad when you are done with because you loved it so much. I read the print version, glad I didn't get it on my kindle since everyone is saying the endnotes are at the end of the chapter. The print version has them at the bottom of every page.
0316044695|5.0|I have read this book. I belive every man,woman and child should read it.  It will bring tears to your eyes many times. He has his opinion of the leftist I for one am proud that he told it like it is. I also got to say i really admire Texas for doing for him and his team mates.  They made a decision that cost them their life on account they were worried what the leftist would do they done away with the sheep hearders. God Bless our young men and women who guard our freedom.  The book is very well written.  It had to tough for him to put all of what happen down on paper.  I'm saying it is an excellent book and tells it like it is
0307959856|4.0|It's not at all like Pride & Prejudice, but it's good!<br /><br />After all of the negative/mixed reviews of this book I was dismayed<br />when my book club chose it.  But despite its problems I found it to be<br />a good and involving read, and I'm glad to have read it.  The author<br />does not make any attempt to emulate Jane Austen's narrative technique,<br />which wikipedia calls \\"free indirect speech\\", which amounts to telling<br />the story in the approximate terms that the heroine would have used.<br />This is straight narrative and makes no pretense of using early<br />nineteenth century language.  The book isn't much about Elizabeth;<br />Darcy has a larger role, since Elizabeth is excluded entirely from<br />many of the major scenes because she's a lady.  Many of our favorite<br />characters from Pride & Prejudice are featured, including Wickham,<br />Colonel Fitzwilliam, Mr. Bennet (but mercifully not much of Mrs. Bennet),<br />Lydia, Georgiana, the Gardiners, and the redoubtable Mrs. Reynolds.<br />Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mr. Collins make wonderful epistolary<br />appearances.  The mystery is excellent, and remained unclear to me<br />until the end.  The language was fine and didn't call attention to<br />itself, and the story moved quickly.<br /><br />I would have liked more descriptions of the beauty of Pemberley and<br />more wit from Elizabeth.

B006LEHOL2|5.0|In this industry of manufactured pop princesses and prepubescent boys `How About I Be Me (and you be you) won't have any songs topping the pop charts. If you are looking for a resurrection of `Lion and the Cobra' you won't find it with this one. What you can expect however, is Sinead's seductively signature sound that evokes emotions and sends you to ethereal places.  Sinead is the only artist that can make an angry song riddled with swear words sound like a melodic ballad. You relate to her lyrics and pained anger and are moved by her voice. This is a solidly simple album that is simply Sinead and you want to listen to it repeatedly.
B004EPZ034|3.0|Just watched this and was very disappointed in it. It was nothing like the first 2. For the first 20 minutes it seemed like the movie had been sponsored by a cruise line company, showing the fancy amenities a cruise ship has to offer with the chipmunks running through the scenes here and there not saying much. Then they fall off the ship along with Dave & Ian (yes he's back, and good thing! He brings the comedy to this one!) and get stranded on an island. They seem to copy parts from other movies in this, such as finding someone stranded on the island who talks to basketballs & golf balls (sound familiar...Wilson) and when Jenette is being lowered into a cave to bring up gold for her kidnapper (just like Disney's The Rescuers- the 1st one). For adults watching, the only good thing about this one was the song choices, Lady Gaga, Rihanna etc sung by the chipmunks throughout which all sounded great, especially S.O.S sung by Jenette in the cave & the end songs performed by all 6 chipmunks on stage. Very basic movie for young kids...lots of singing but not much going on in it. Seemed like they were on a tight budget for this one unfortunately. It was the quality of a \\"straight to DVD\\" movie.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I purchased this album for the song \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\". Thinking the lead singer was African American, I was surprised that One Direction consisted of prepubescent Caucasian boys who appear as though they are still in grade school. Had I seen the cover or band first I would have passed up the album. Lesson learned; don't judge a CD by its cover. This album is purely POP and loaded with fun and high energy. If you are looking for a deep album of mastered riffs, trained vocals, and authentic instrumentals you won't find it here. You will find each song loaded with pure POP ingredients that resulted in a perfectly baked POP CD. One Directions one direction is purely POP.
B00000DCHD|5.0|\\"52nd Street\\" may be the coolest, most hip-sounding Billy Joel album ever made. Why? Start with the undeniable GROOVE and 1970s-era soul heard on several of these tracks. Whether it's a smooth sax solo, the urbane jazz interlude on the musically varied \\"Zanzibar\\" or the trendy swank heard on the all-too-short closing tune \\"52nd Street,\\" this is music that will never go out of style.<br /><br />Released not long after the massively successful \\"The Stranger\\" record, \\"52nd Street\\" does contain some similarities to its predecessor. The atmospheric keyboard work on the Latin-flavored \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\" is reminiscent of \\"Just the Way You Are,\\" while the chorus portion of \\"Zanzibar\\" has musical elements of \\"Movin' Out.\\" But as usual, Joel threw in some progressive curveballs and bared his soul, as heard on the sweeping chorus of \\"Until the Night,\\" which reminds me of a beautiful and grandiose Neil Diamond or Barry Manilow tune. \\"Honesty\\" is a melancholic song with a heartbreaking plea for a trustworthy soul mate. Elsewhere, Joel adds ambience by inserting some sublime, lulling moments on a few songs, which give \\"52nd Street\\" further distinction.<br /><br />What's also endearing about this CD -- and what makes Joel such a man-of-the-people type of fellow -- is how some of the tunes reveal the artist in his most natural, comfortable state. On \\"Zanzibar,\\" for instance, he's \\"just another face\\" in a swinging bar, a guy trying to get lucky with the waitress. The young man in \\"Half a Mile Away\\" yearns for the momentary \\"other-life\\" freedom of being with his best buds on a street corner. And the groovin' \\"My Life\\" is a song about breaking away, becoming your own person. These are things that everybody can relate to, on a great and classy-sounding record that is one of my favorites by Billy Joel.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I give this book 5 stars due to i love every inch of this book i cried at the right parts and i could not put the book down when i had to go to bed i stayed up later then normal to read the book. This book does spark something for me but I am me. It makes you want something more in every word that comes out of  Mr Grey's mouth you are wanting your spouse to say those things also.She took some of what Stephine Myers gaves us in twilight but now E.L James gave us the adult edward that we all want but kinker. So i like this book.
0385344228|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I really wanted to like this book. I had heard such good things about it and it did start out a bit like a Turow novel. I think the best writing was the first few chapters, it seemed that the author took great pains to get it right and then got sloppy. I finished the book and I agree with another reviewer, that the stunning ending was not enough to save the rest of the book. Portions of the writing (especially in the beginning) were very promising but were overshadowed by some very unrealistic and head-scratchingly \\"off\\" dialogue later on. One BIG problem I had was with the huge focus on the \\"murder gene\\" as a possible defense/motive but zero focus on the bullying that Jacob was subjected to by the murdered boy.  With all the publicity these days about bullying (and sympathy for those who are victims), that would have seemed like an obvious and more realistic defense. The last few chapters contain several twists that help to make up for the mediocrity of a large chunk of the book. I added the third star for the ending alone, I definitely did not guess correctly.<br /><br />*****Spoiler Alert*****<br />I don't usually whine about things that are a bit unrealistic in fictional books, but I just can't help myself with this one--there were way too many ridiculous scenarios. With the unexpected early \\"finish\\" of the trial, the victim's father attempts to attack Jacob and/or Andy (even this is not clear) with a knife but is intercepted by another character. Absolutely nothing comes of this, it is never mentioned again, nobody reports it to the police, and Jacob and his family go back to the same house in the same town without ever a second thought that this grief-stricken, homicidal man just tried to kill them (and knows where they live). HUH???? Also, the revelation that Andy and his wife conspired to put a knife at the murder scene-- but Andy (who takes care of every other detail with the skill of an experienced prosecutor) entrusts this to his wife who screws it up. Finally, when Andy visits his father in prison (who has orchestrated events to help Jacob much to the initial relief of Andy) Andy reprimands him and tells him that \\"he took away Jacob's day in court\\". I could go on, there are many inconsistencies and about-faces with characters and the plot that just don't make sense.
0452273331|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite novels through the years & I bought the book for my daughter as she'd wanted to read it too. I received the book in beautiful condition & very quickly. I will certainly use Amazon again!!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Most soulful. Yet still has an edge. I actually don't really like their other albums and I'm not that amused with the albums categorized as similar to this. My other taste includes Cee Lo and The Roots and Amy Winehouse. Most of the songs on this album have a beat but are also incredibly musical. Good stuff.
0345803485|5.0|I know there are a lot of people (men & women both) that do not understand why on earth anyone would say the loved these books.  I've read a lot of comments where people wonder what kind of person loves these books, or read them in one weekend as if they were just one long book.  Well, I am that girl.<br /><br />I didn't know a whole lot about these books before I read them.  A friend of mine from college had read them and based on other books we had read in common and both liked, I thought, why not? After I downloaded them, and before I started reading Fifty Shades of Grey they started talking about the novels on the radio.  I heard these books referred to as \\"mommy-porn\\" but didn't really think about what it entailed.  I mean, there are some steamy scenes on TV I would say could be called the same thing.<br /><br />I will mention it took me a few chapters to get into the book.  There are some phrases that threw me off a bit, and the fact that the writer uses words or phrases quite frequently was a bit annoying at times and it was distracting.  I kept thinking, didn't she have an editor? Why wouldn't they persuade her to change some of this? But the further I got into the story, the less I cared about it (not to say I didn't still see these things, I just didn't care anymore).<br /><br />People are complaining that there is no way the character could be a 21 year old college girl who hasn't had sex.  I guess that's not saying a whole lot about our culture, that we expect every young woman in college is out there giving it up on a regular basis.  For me, this was not an issue as I myself was a 21 year old virgin.  In fact I was a 27 year old virgin and had many of those uncomfortable conversations with many different guys that I dated over the years.  Some thought it was awesome (for some of the same reasons Christian did) and some couldn't imagine it and bolted.  Maybe this helped me identify with her character better than other people can, but be assured this does happen.  Something should be said for the girl who waits until she meets the right guy.  I did, and now he's my husband.<br /><br />People are complaining that Christian is too young to be this successful (hello, Mark Zuckerberg) and that even if he was there is no way he falls for a girl like Ana.  I guess my answer is two-fold, and simple.  We see couples all the time where we think in our heads, \\"I wonder how they got together.\\"  Love is love why put limits on what kind of person someone else can fall in love with.  The second part of my answer would be to remind people, this is a work of fiction.  Of course it's not real! Christian Grey and Ana Steele do not actually exist.  People don't want to watch movies that are based on real life, that's why we go see Romantic Comedies.  This is no different.  Enjoy it for what it is! Why can't Cinderella fall in love with Prince Charming?<br /><br />As for the characters, I could absolutely find things to identify with both of the main characters.  Anyone who is part of a relationship knows that everyone comes with some sort of \\"baggage.\\"  Sure Christian's baggage is more than the average person but isn't the message really that everyone deserves to love and be loved regardless of what they bring with them to the table? I wanted to see this couple work things out and be together and I felt myself (or my inner cheerleader) rooting for them to make it.  (Incidentally, I know these characters are supposed to be based of Edward and Bella, but through most of Twilight I wanted to slap Bella around, I found her annoying, this was not the case for me with Ana and I enjoyed Christian much more than Edward).<br /><br />It's the unfolding of their love and watching as the \\"baggage\\" becomes irrelevant that kept me wanting more.  Yes there is drama, and yes there is fighting and making up to the unrealistic degree but again, this is the same thing women go to the movies to see.  Unrealistic romantic gestures and happily ever afters.It gives people hope that their happily ever after is out there or makes them realize it's really right in front of their face.  Let's remember a business tycoon fell in love with a hooker in one of everyone's favorite movies.  Why can't we have that in this book? Vampires don't really exist and yet they are raking in the big bucks with those books and movies, right?<br /><br />Yes, they have sex...a lot...and well...it's not always \\"vanilla\\" but think about when you and your first love started having sex.  There was probably more then than there is now, right? And while it's not for everyone and I did have trouble understanding at first why anyone would consent to some of these things my husband reminded me that just because it's not my normal, doesn't mean it isn't someone else's and we shouldn't really judge what makes other people happy.  Again, I didn't know what this book entailed when I started reading it and if I had known it was sometimes classified as Erotica, I probably wouldn't have read it - but then I would have been the one who lost out because I really enjoyed this story.  I haven't felt this way about a couple since Noah & Allie.<br /><br />Mostly, I just think it comes down to you like it or you don't, and while I am one of those people who obviously liked it (I'm almost done reading it a second time and my husband now refers to this series as my \\"drug of choice\\"), I accept that not everyone will.  So for those that don't, I think just accepting that some people do is just as important, and maybe people will just have to agree to disagree and just not understand why.  I mean I love Football and Baseball and even NASCAR, but you couldn't get me to watch Golf for all the tea in china.<br /><br />Anyway, this is just one girls opinion, I suggest read it and see for yourself.<br /><br />On a side note, the idea of the movie scares me and I don't think they'll find a Christian that will make everyone happy, but that's just my opinion...like everything else here!It gives people hope that their happily ever after is out there or makes them realize it's really right in front of their face.

0439023483|4.0|Twenty-four tributes ranging between the ages of 12 through 18 enter an annual event battling to the death in \\"The Hunger Games\\", the initial novel in a first person point of view trilogy following 16 year old Katniss Everdeen.  The political reasoning behind the games is a little extreme existing in a futuristic United States.  Since the opponents are from other Districts, the characterization is limited to encounters with the protagonist.  Also some romance colors the vicious landscape.  Considering there are twenty-three contestants slated to die, the actual killing is rarely experienced from Katniss's perspective so I disagree with those raising issues the novel is packed with violence.<br /><br />Secondary character Haymitch Abernathy provides critical support with guidance and training to the two District 12 tributes throughout the games.  It would have been fascinating to learn what obstacles he experienced deciding how to help his District's tributes.<br /><br />I recommend the series to any fan of the survival action genre.<br /><br />Thank you.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I deliberately didn't see the film; I didn't want to get the bones of the story before I'd enjoyed all the meat.  Am I ever glad!  This series was impossible to put down.

Don't think any paper version would have been as reasonable, but I'd highly recommend this series any way you can get it.

038541627X|3.0|Isaac Asimov is obviously one of the most popular Science Fiction writers of all times. He wrote over 300 books in the course of his life, from the 1950s to the 1990s.<br /><br />This volume is not the Complete Story VI as stated above, but the Complete Story I and contains his earliest short stories. For over 600 pages, the book is a fairly quick read.<br /><br />The stories are typically themed around the troubles of the times (1950s). The 1950s saw the growth of television, atomic energy, the hydrogen bomb, rocketry, computers and other new forms of electronics. The stories involve these themes as he probes into \\"what-if\\" scenarios.<br /><br />Being his earliest works, he had not yet reached his potential as a writer. As such, some of the stories are choppy. Also, in many ways they are dated. For example, many of the stories involve a type of computer he calls a \\"Megavac\\". At the time, computers who enormous, heavy objects that cost lots of money. What he foresaw was the growth of the computer in size as it increased in complexity. Megavac is completely underground, is miles and miles long, and pretty much runs the world. A variety of people manually enter information into Megavac, who processes the data, and spits out answers on IBM cards. These cards need to be interpreted or translated by specially trained people. This is a far cry from the miniaturization and improved communications we see today. In one story, he did explore the idea of a smaller computer, but this was not carried on in any of the other short stories in the book.<br /><br />If you are a fan on Asimov, your reading is not complete without understanding his early work. Understand, though, this is only the first volume of three. I have not yet purchased any of the others, and plan to wait and get through some different books in other genres before returning to Asimov.

0345803485|4.0|To submit or not submit that is the question that ponders the mind of the main characters and pretty much dominates the entire book of Fifty shades of grey. The main characters Christian and Anastasia are two young lovers who venture into a physical and emotional affair that has both of them questioning whether there is more to a relationship than just sexual carnal gratification.  Well, I like many of you avid readers got suckered in reading this book due to the rampant hype that flourished the columns of the New York Bestsellers list, Dr. Oz, and of course Watch What Happens with Andy Cohen. I was really intrigued about the story I thought that this would be a novel that would take BDSM to a whole different level. However, after reading the novel I kind of felt bereft. I read all kinds of books ranging from classical literature to romance to some erotica and this book was not as controversial as I thought it would be. If your interested in reading erotic romances this is a good start but definitely try other authors such as Desiree Holt, Jaid Black (she was my first LOL),Madison Ava Jones, Lora Leigh, or Sienna Mynx. Why the four stars? Well, despite its predictable beginning and ending the writing was quite good and of course the writer was able to really portray the alpha male Christian really well. Although, Christian is the not the best alpha male ever written (I have read other authors that had better tortured males)he was what made the book interesting. Ana the main heroine was a bit annoying once she began intimate relations with Christian. The dialogue between her and the inner super sexy goddess was childish. Now Ana's hang ups and insecurity regarding the relationship I can totally buy. For one she gave her virginity to a man she hardly knew. And not just any man a man who has a dark past and dark secrets.  Many readers have compared this book with the Twilight series and I think that although there are some similarities I think that Christian is darkerthan Edward could ever be. In terms of Ana being a virgin and at the same time being introduced to BDSM I don't think it was a problem it was the way Ana was portrayed. At the beginning of the novel Ana was more assertive in her decisions than when she began her physical relationship with Christian. I thought she was too insecure and self conscience, especially when there was no need to. One good point from the book that that I loved about the character of Christian was despite his brutish tendencies he always thought Ana was beautiful and would call her out her for putting herself down. In conclusion, if you like mild erotica then pick up this book if you are looking for something more than avoid it.
0345803485|5.0|Come on guys with the bad reviews. Ive read some great books and some not so great books from classics, erotica to childrens books. I read for an escape and to see other points of view and to possibly learn something new or just to get away from the kind of people that feel the need to bash someone in the ground for their ideas. Closed minded people really suffocate new perspectives but hey to each their own, why not simply say \\"I don't like it\\" with a few descriptive adjectives?  Sure it was a little dark but it was raw and real for the most part. I loved Ana's internal banter with her inner goddess. She's an anomalie in today's morally challenged society, that said I love her I'm proud that she has sass and some self respect just because she engages and enjoys kink doesn't make her any less respectful. She has real battles and she's just an overall perfect girl growing up with a guy she falls in love with. And Christian well he's your basic gorgeous messed up guy with control issues and many skeletons in his closet. Again he's real making a few good choices and a lot of  stupid mistakes. A great young alpha male.For those of you who want a sexy read with a little darker side take the chance it's a great trilogy hope we can get some more soon kudos James -loved it!!!!
B0051E9INK|5.0|The original Highlander movie, the one that started it all.  I love the Highlander series - this one is no exception.

B00479SVBU|2.0|As soon as the warranty expired,  so did the device.<br />I have several of the original Soundfly's and they continue to work great.<br />This one died after a few months.<br />I'm not going to go postal and give it a one star because it's relatives work fantastic.<br />This one model just didn't.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great app. would be better if it could be used offline. Other than that it is wonderful with many features.  It is the best Bible app I've found. I just cant use it at church on my Kindle. I have to use a different Bible app.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This product is great way to read ebooks on my android tablet. It works great and I got it for a free download.
B0040HO16S|4.0|I love Lark Rise to Candleford, which is about all the goings on in Lark Rise and Candleford, which includes people's lives and pasts.<br />I was very disappointed to see that some episodes have scenes missing, and the 4th episode isn't in full! It only contains the last 2 minutes! I wish Amazon could fix this, and soon!<br />Anyway, a great watch!
B0073U2FB2|1.0|36 hours have passed since I watched The Darkest Hour and I am still trying to find something decent to say about this movie; unfortunately I can not. The beginning of the movie kinda reveals the thrill level of the entire movie-- boring. At first, I thought perhaps it might be like Cloverfield (which was, surprisingly, a good sci fi movie, slow start, great finish) but it was not. If you do not mind watching a movie with low budget special effects, tons of unanswered questions, and rather average to poor actors, this movie is for you; however while watching, I suggest you sit comfortably and have a fluffy pillow handy cause your gonna need it.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|I was very excited when I bought this game because I love hidden object games...however...been trying to download it all day and each time I get an error! very frustrating and annoyed!!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|absolutely loved this game but then the glitches started....my buildings&hellip;crops and animals all told me ready to collect but there was nothing to collect....then after a week of that....the timers reset and now tell me 400hrs....wtf....fix it already
1455504106|5.0|The book was in great shape.  I love Nicholas Sparks and read his books in two days.  Thanks for the large print version-it mak<br />es my reading so easy and enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun and interesting.  good family fun in a whole pack. I highly recommend. this game if you like playing games
0307577589|4.0|I didn't want to like this book. We'd seen one of the movies a year or two ago - the Swedish version, I think - and I didn't enjoy it at all. But, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, so I picked the first book up on audio CD and really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The plot unfurls slowly, but the character development and story line kept me listening. I like Lisbeth Salander - she's a tough, take no prisoners kind of gal. A bit crusty around the edges, but that's understandable given her history. Mikael Blomkvist was a bit tougher for me to cotton on to, but I was rooting for him by the end of the book.<br /><br />A good mystery / crime novel, overall. I'll look forward to listening to The Girl Who Played With Fire.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Simply put, this film is required viewing for any of us in the \\"99 percent\\" who wonder why the American dream has become a nightmare.<br /><br />Basically, the top 1 percent have gamed us... fleeced us... sold us a bill of goods... and to date not one of these greedy and morally bankrupt swine has been called to any significant form of account.<br /><br />This documentary is notable not just because it is beautifully filmed and scored, but also because the narrative, spoken by Matt Damon, explains in the plainest, simplest terms how the big crash of 2008 came about and why it is almost certain to happen again.<br /><br />Interestingly, this disaster transcends politics.  The deregulation of the financial industry that has led us to the brink got started under Reagan but was continued under Clinton, Bush Jr., and now Obama.<br /><br />If you are a member of the 99 percent, you may want to throw things at your TV when some of these overpaid and underperforming elites try to give their spin on the collusion and corruption that have brought ruin to so many.  Either these guys are monumentally stupid or criminally insane.<br /><br />Whichever, these are the folks who fiddle and spout disingenuous twaddle while America burns.  And for all the millionaires who moan about attempts to bring attention to class warfare -- well, they're the ones who fired the first shot and continue to stuff their fat bellies and bulging bank accounts at the expense of the middle class and working poor.<br /><br />I must also commend this DVD, which is packed with bonus features, including Director's Commentary, Deleted Scenes, and a Making Of featurette.  Anyone who said that only a BluRay disc has the capacity to hold these extras is probably also a member of the 1 percent!<br /><br />I just hope that Occupy Wall Street will make financial reform a key part of their objective.  This fine DVD contains all the ammunition they will need.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The first 75% of the trilogy was a well-written page-turner. However, I think the story hit a road-block in book 3 where the history repeats itself and gets too predictive and convoluted. Somewhere in the middle of book 3 I lost interest completely and could not care less and simply stopped reading (would have thrown the book away if it wouldn't have been the Kindle version...) Too repetitive and too boring after the first two excellent books. :-(
0307593312|2.0|As others have mentioned, this is way too long. At least 10 total pages are spent describing what people are wearing and what they made for dinner. I'm not kidding. And when I got to the end I felt the same way I did when Lost finally wrapped up - it took way too long, I couldn't give up just because I've come so far, but I'm glad it's over.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Should be able to use without WiFi or internet once downloaded. I was unable to use during my church service.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The graphics are high quality, the interface is easy and full of features, and the ads aren't even annoying. Highly recommended.
B007LEC7CC|4.0|Once again Madonna didn't let me down. I've been a fan since she first came out, but from Ray of Light and forward I think she just turned into an amazing artist, musician,composer. Every time she comes up with a new album I buy it without hesitating. I haven't been dissapointed yet. I didn't give it 5 stars because I'm still getting used to the songs, but so far the whole album is really good and the song Masterpiece is my favorite. I love it when artists come out with something different than what they did in their prior album and it totally is. Completely different from Hard Candy (which I love). If you are a fan, you won't regret buying it.
1433203316|4.0|This collection of short stories essentially has 2 parts. The first part is I am Legend which is excellent and it is clear to see why this is a classic. 5 stars for the I am Legend story.<br /><br />The rest of the book is a collection of so-so short stories some of which are barely comprehensible. I would give the rest of the book 3 stars.<br /><br />This is review specifically of the audio book. The audio book also seems to follow this breakdown as well. There is a different narrator for I Am Legend than the rest of the book. The narration for I am Legend is superb and a joy to listen to. 5 stars.<br /><br />The gravelly, raspy, nasal narration for the rest of the book is absolute torture to listen to. 1 star
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love love love this game...I am 27 and this game is fun for me. the only down fall is how much stuff cost and how long you have to wait on stuff...but I don't care I still play it and love it :)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a great and addicting game I love any game that I can choose what I want to upgrade although attacking is automated would be the only setback
B007I7GGCE|5.0|If you weren't previously a Nicki Minaj fan you will be now in some way. This album has a track for everyone's taste it is literally two albums rolled into one you have the hip hop rap album vs. the dance pop album. Together it is amazing
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is what I like to call an \\"Escape Read\\"!<br />Not the usual type of book that I read but, it was recommended by a coworker.  They are fast reads for sure.  I thought they were very entertaining!  The end was awesome!  Didn't see it coming at all!!!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I have a studio in the middle of nowhere....I like to listen to music while I get creative and this gives me access to stations I cant get on the radio.  It comes through nice and clear and does not put a drain on my Kindle Fire battery.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I bought this app on my kindle fire and it just kept saying &quot;downloading...&quot; but it never did. Don't buy!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had seen the movie with a friend and her teenage daughter and had been impressed by the story line.  I wanted to read the books on a lengthy trip to China and downloaded the Trilogy onto my Kindle.  Could not put the Kindle down and went through the entire set in less than a week.  This story is hypotic and haunting.  Very thought provoking throughout and Ms. Collins did not let up the pressure and intrique from book to book.  Her creation of the characters and their stories was thorough and certainly shows that she has tremendous talent -- I can't wait to read what she produces in the future. Although this series was created for young readers, it is a story for all ages.  Parents -- be prepared for some intense discussions with your teens after they read this trilogy.
B0041KW2UQ|5.0|Well when, I  orded the movie I did not know it was only to be played in zone 2 so I cann't see it
B000K4X576|5.0|After just lucking up on this group on youtube i got hook on them they have great music cd is great
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|This was an interesting spin on the Cinderella fairy tale. I am a goner for fairy tale retellings and I wish there were more of them!<br /><br />The characters were well thought out and very original. The story line was engaging and fresh. Meyer kept me reading long in to the night. When I started I did not realize this was the start of a series.  I was happily surprised to hear the story would continue and can not wait to see what Meyer has in store for these characters!
B00000269G|5.0|Concert by the Sea was arguably the finest record pianist Erroll Garner ever made, and he made many -- a few outstanding -- good recordings. But this live recording (September 19, 1955) with his trio (Eddie Calhoun, bass; Denzil Best, drums) presented a typical Garner program; it was a mixture of originals, show biz, and pop standards delivered with his unique delivery and enthusiasm. The rhythms and brilliant use of tension and release were perfectly captured. And while for many jazz listeners, Garner's deliberate structures were too orchestrated, there was an equal spontaneity in the propulsion of these orchestrations that swung as well as anything. [The 2007 Jazz Beat reissue included bonus tracks.]
B007J4T2G8|2.0|All the other bad reviews cover what I would say about this book. I ordered it anyway to satisfy my curiosity.  Poorly written and got tired of reading the recycled words and phrases over and over again.<br />It's a shame someone who actually has the ability to write did not author this book, because the potential was there with the subject of the BDSM lifestyle.<br />Best seller?! I guess anyone can park themselves at a keyboard and turn out some junk and make money.
B0012X6FR6|5.0|The first of two studio albums by the Bill Evans-Scott LaFaro-Paul Motian trio (both of which preceded their famous engagement at the Village Vanguard), this Portrait in Jazz reissue contains some wondrous interplay, particularly between pianist Evans and bassist LaFaro, on the two versions of \\"Autumn Leaves.\\" Other than introducing Evans' \\"Peri's Scope,\\" the music is comprised of standards, but the influential interpretations were far from routine or predictable at the time. LaFaro and Motian were nearly equal partners with the pianist in the ensembles and their versions of such tunes as \\"Come Rain or Come Shine,\\" \\"When I Fall in Love,\\" and \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" (which preceded Miles Davis' famous recording by a couple years) are full of subtle and surprising creativity. A gem.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It would take much less time for me to say why I DO NOT like this App.  But since I can't think of a reason, then I guess there is no reason for you NOT to download this App!!
0670023329|4.0|I'm just a normal american, not some kind of budding essayist.  I've travelled to Korea and hear things from time to time about North Korea and I understood that conditions there were repressive and horrifying, but it was all assumption and conjecture until I read this book.  It is incorrect to call Mr. Shin \\"courageous\\", to be courageous one needs to understand the concept and the alternatives.  His education as a citizen of the camp was limited to knowing the alphabet and addition and subtraction.  He didn't even know the name of his country's capital, or, in fact, that the world was round.  The camp was NORMAL to him and until he had contact with two older former high-ranking members of the N.Korean regime, he knew nothing of the world outside the camp.  The two men who opened up his mind were the courageous ones, to speak as they did was to invite torture and death - what were they speaking of you may ask?  Simply, one spoke of food he had eaten - the other of his personal life.  To even speak of North Korea outside of the camp was a death sentence.  Perhaps the most disturbing was that children were born inside this camp, raised as slaves and ultimately dying as slaves having never committed any offense.  This is where Mr. Shin comes from - all he knew was that he was being punished for having \\"original sin\\" as it were, and accepting that, survived as best he could, usually by wholeheartedly participating in acts against his fellow prisoners for offenses like having a scrap of cloth. If you were a woman, getting pregnant meant death - upon discovery you were hanged.  And then Mr Shin's eyes were opened, and he plotted an escape.<br /><br />The ghost writer for Mr. Shin didn't put any editorializing into this short book, you will read the words of Mr. Shin with no embelishment or comment.<br /><br />At the end of it I came away angry with my own government.  They have known this place existed for many years now, and every year they send food aid to feed the armyof monsters who perpetuate this place, and then they go on vacation to exotic places while the food aid strengthens the arms of the soldiers and overseers who beat, rape and torture these prisoners.  American cannot be held up as the \\"leader of the free world\\" while it ignores this place.  I came away ashamed, for the first time in my life.
B007UQRW62|5.0|If you love this film, like I do, then wait for the single disc on blu-ray. The extras are great but most, including commentary, can already be found on the regular 2 disc DVD. That can be picked up for a very reasonable price. The price for this \\"special edition\\" is way too high.
B00319ECGK|5.0|I don't care what anybody says  there will never again be anything in history like the matrix. No one can deny the matrix revolutionized action movies forever. The bullet time effect, the 360 rotation, and the slow mo will be something used in movies forever. Long live zion!
B004EC5IV6|5.0|This was awesome better than expected and I cant wait for the next dvd this was super cool and the charicters are all well thought out and very balanced through out both dvds.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If there was an option to give this book zero stars I would have done that. I've read some of the one-star reviews, and I agree with them. The character of Christian Gray is too unrealistic and too inconsistent. The narrator drove me crazy with her indecision. The entire book takes place over the course of less than a week, and in that time, the two main characters had sex so much that they had to have been going at it about five times a day. How could they sit down? That's all I'll say about the plot, but I must also comment on the writing. If I read the phrase \\"my gut clenched\\" one more time, I think I'll scream. And it annoyed me that the author used the incorrect word _disorientated_ four or five times instead of _disoriented_. Obviously, this book is selling because a lot of people want to get their jollies reading a lot of hot sex. But I don't understand what the fuss is about. Penthouse has been doing the same thing for years.

B000UBLQGQ|5.0|I just downloaded this album from Amazon.  When making my selection I spent some time trying to determine the difference between \\"At the Village Vanguard\\" and \\"Sunday at the Village Vanguard\\".  It turns out that this album (\\"At the Village Vanguard\\") is a compilation released much later by Riverside containing 10 of the 13 tunes from \\"Sunday at the Village V.\\" and \\"Waltz for Debby\\", but without all of the alternate takes.  For me it is the perfect choice of a good selection from this historic recording session.  Amazon, please make it clear that this album is a compilation; most of your reviews pertain to a different album.
B007R41E8O|1.0|There was only half a plot. Confusing as all get out. Story did not explain what happened and u were constantly hitting the hint button just to figure out next step. The only redeming grace was the hidden object parts were decent.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The final chapter to the series was just plain old ordinary.  I wish it had a little more excitement to it.  It was ok.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You will not be able to put this book down.  Be prepared to read all night long!!  This book really boosts your imagination.  We can dream!!
B000209ZAE|1.0|I have ordered two of these from Amazon. The first one came with a cracked jaw, making it so I couldn't get the tool into the press. I returned that one.<br /><br />The second worked great for about an hour. I went to tighten the press at a specific height and the piece that clamps down on the vertical shaft to hold it in place snapped. I tried to finish what I was doing, since I was almost done. Then the other half of the jaw snapped off when I tried to see if i could get it to clamp just tight enough to hold on for a little bit.<br /><br />If it didn't break just for looking at it, it'd be a great little machine. They really need to make the parts that have stress put on them out of steel.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|a little diffucult without gold but fun nonetheless.  samurai vs zombies defense is a good game for people not easily frustrated.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I received it, ordered it, and gave it as a gift in as easy as 1,2,3! I would recommend this item! Well worth the purchase! I love Amazon!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have found myself thinking in new ways after playing this game.  Excellent for developing alternate brain pathways and improved problem solving capability.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is great. now I know what all of the hype is about. the only bad thing about it is that some people just write out the clue. that has nothing to do with the game. good though.
1250006341|5.0|I bought this gift for my sister-in-law because she is as dotty over Downton Abbey as I am. She said that it is a very \\"lush\\" book, and the pictures are exquisite. She said that you can make out the details of the costumes, and that it does give background information about the show and the history of its origins. Because it is a gift, I do not know how much detail it goes into about history, but I do know from the way my sister-in-law described the pictures, that she was pleased with all of the detail they picked up, especially the details in the costumes. I'm pleased that the gift pleased her. She's a very nice person.
B0073PZIBQ|5.0|Great to watch at home. Good messages mixed with humor. I would let my kids watch it and see if they pick up the same message I did.  Bird watchers are like golfers  Your on the honor system.
B0079J28NW|5.0|I had Yellow Submarine on my wish list for several months. Finally purchased it through Amazon last month. Now it's out<br />on Blue Ray. Should have waited just a little longer. Oh well can't complain, still a fabulous film.

0061992860|3.0|I purchased this book two years ago and it was a excellent read. Unfortunately it was stolen from me at the gym. My friend gave me his pocket edition of the book. I keep the pocket edition in a pocket of my hiking/bailout bag. I still however wanted a full size copy for the homestead. I ordered this one \\"sas book with the iphone app orange circle in the top\\" And i received another POCKET EDITION. Nowhere on the link to this book does it say that its the pocket edition. Its 2\\"x 3\\". They were happy to do a refund but the few dollars that it cost it was not worth sending it back. SO BUYER BEWARE THIS IS A POCKET EDITION NOT A REGULAR SIZE BOOK
145470246X|5.0|Sabine Lippert's book \\"Beaded Fantasies\\" is first a feast for the eyes and then a feast for the inspirational soul! The designs are fabulous and the palettes are breathtaking. I cannot wait to dive in and start making these sparkling jewelry pieces. I was like a kid in a candy store when my book arrived and that thrill is still there every time I pick it up. I highly recommend this book as a must-have for serious beadworkers.

B00723NWJE|4.0|I thought it was a good album and enjoyed most of her tracks. Something different Norah chose to do and I tip my hat to her. Has a vintage sound to it especially on her vocals and the overall ambiance of the record. I think if you are a Norah Jones fan and don't restrain Artists to a limited little box you will enjoy it as well. Grows on you. Give it a chance..
B007UXSPK2|1.0|This movie was by far one of the worst action movies I have ever seen. The plot was ludicrous and the acting (over acting) was terrible. A nuclear missile is flying towards the United States and nothing is done to launch a missile towards the attacker? I paid $8.00 to watch this garbage. First I rented it for download. It never showed up in my movie collection for download. So many people liked it that I went ahead and paid again to stream it online. I wouldn't even recommend it if it were free. I want my money back.
B00785P2QC|5.0|fun simulation game with goals while still enabling a lot of free creativity to build your own city. please fix the bugs that don't save your game when you build across the bridges.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I was sucked in from the first page.  Parts of the book made me cringe, parts made me cry, but in all, it was a wonderful story.  Highlighting the discrimination that existed between the whites and blacks, and doing it in a way that didn't turn me off was a real task accomplished.  It was an honest portrayal of a prejudiced time in America--the hatred went deep on both sides of the color lines.
B0055SWM08|5.0|super fun better than chess. takes some deep thinking to score well. easy to understand and play.if you are a puzzle worker you'll love this game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. not only is it free you find acorns ( real money) while playing the game. So you can save up for great animals that you have to buy with real money.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|it's the perfect book for a soft erotic adventure and love story. you won't be disappointed. I am not! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This novel was hard to put down. The book is shocking and outrageous but definitely worth reading. I'm done with the first and second book and will start the third tomorrow. I can't wait to see what happens!
B0078N2T8I|2.0|The protagonist in Take Shelter is a young family man who loses his job and is about to destroy his marriage as he keeps seeing nightmares (and day-mares) about an upcoming apocalyptical storm and other related occurrences. He spends everything they have and don't have to build an underground shelter complete with gas masks, a generator, and amenities. There are many distractions that lead a viewer to believe the storm may actually be coming (some reviewers believe the storm is actually coming). The ambiguous ending contributes to that goal. You may believe that too. To me Take Shelter is a movie about mental illness rather than a supernatual thriller with a proactive hero.<br /><br />I did not enjoy the movie because it was singularly focused and seemed artificial at that. The main actor's skills seemed overshadowed by that of a secondary character, his smart and devoted wife.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I have been playing this game for about 4 days and now it all of a sudden wont load anymore. It gets stuck on the getting started page and I'm so upset because I love this game.
B007AMMHSY|3.0|The Skin I Live In is an unusual and scary movie. It involves a doctor who goes beyond any norm in plastic surgery experimentation after his mentally disturbed daughter has a sexual experience with a young man. I cannot reveal other parts of the plot as it would act as a major spoiler but the movie is very well made. To enjoy it you must be able to stomach plastic surgery and violence. It came across as too strong, explicit, and hard to imagine for me.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is fun and enjoyable! I highly recommend this game. I wish I could rate it more than five stars.

B005J9ZE5I|5.0|I've owned this film a total of four times now, the widescreen VHS, the laserdisc, the original DVD and now this stunning new 25th anniversary BD which in my opinion is the final word in quality as far as the film is concerned.<br /><br />They did a remarkable job here and while there are scenes here and there that appear soft the majority are clean, crisp and chock full of detail, colors are vibrant and they stand out, indeed I saw colors on things that I couldn't distinguish before on other releases. I've read other reviews that state the blacks are crushed but I didn't notice that, detail was quite visible in darker scenes and grain structure was consistent throughout the film.<br /><br />Extras are plentiful including a feature-length retrospective on the making of the film featuring all new interviews with all of the principle actors as well as Sam Raimi himself and all of the extras featured on other DVD releases have been ported over too including the hilarious commentary track.<br /><br />The audio is stellar! This disc features a new DTS HD Master Audio track that fills your room with screams and other assorted horrible sounds when things in the film really start to get crazy.<br /><br />Bottom line if you're a die hard Evil Dead 2 fan this is a no brainer, run don't walk to grab this, it is, in a word, GROOVY!
1451673442|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but I could not help but encourage anyone who is thinking of buying this book. Yes I am a fan of The Secret and The Power, but this is definitely Rhonda's best book yet. This book helps you to put your entire life in perspective in a way you have never imagined. It is so powerful I really can't explain it. I have been a reader of almost every self-help book you can think of for the past 5 years and this book for some reason just caused me to look at my entire life differently (in a good way) that I had never experienced..and I have used it over the past few weeks, and I know first hand it works...all I really can say is Thank you Rhonda Byrne!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie was great.  The action, the suspense, that acting all came together in a great way to make a great movie.
B007CKNX28|5.0|When you can play all instruments, compose your own music, write your own lyrics and also sing them, it becomes highly questionable whether you need creative partners.  Jack White has always had creative partners, mainly Meg White, but this album makes clear that he needs no one but himself to make and perform great music. Most solo vocal artists who were formerly with a band played at most a guitar or a piano and also created the entire act with the band.  By contrast, White has always done the heavy lifting no matter who was his partner. Thus, he has moved easily from the White Stripes to the Raconteurs to Dead Weather, not having messy breakups with any of them but instead keeping the door open.  Incredibly, Meg White broke up the White Stripes, not Jack. But he also remains ready to perform with her should she change her mind.  This ability to go back and forth in creative collaboration or to go solo is really unprecedented in the music business.  He also produces other albums for other musicians such as Loretta Lynn and has created soundtrack music for the movies.  I have no idea what he is like as a human being, and would rather not know, but as a musical artist he does it all and consistently so.<br /><br />As for the album itself, the songs remind me of his big hit on a Raconteur album, CAROLINA DREAM.  So this has a very bluesy, darkish feel to it.  I like all of it, just like I like all of his music.  I'd have to say I like this as well as the White Stripes' albums and more than the Raconteurs and Dead Weather albums.  This must be because he is front and center on every song.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B004MPESSY|1.0|Like \\"Hostel\\" and \\"Hostel 2\\", this is a very sick movie. I haven't seen the 1978 original and I won't see it. The rape scenes and the characters are well done, and therefore disgusting. They make you wish the worst for the rapers, but their deaths under horrible and unspeakable tortures are even more disgusting. The level of graphical violence is frankly excessive, and I regret having seen some scenes. The  movie should have been rated, as it is definitively NOT recommendable to a young audience.
B007YYY4WK|5.0|That Heinz account is still at risk so it is Megan not Peggy to the rescue this time around.  I must admit, it is a really good campaign idea. Megan is actually one of the few characters on this show who does not behave badly in everyday life.  She certainly did not get this from her parents.  They visit this week and are the epitome of being unlikable people. I don't know which of them I dislike more.<br /><br />I guess the living together concept got off the ground a little earlier on the east coast than it did in the midwest.  I can't remember people admitting to doing this until the end of the sixties and into the seventies but we generally did follow later whatever was happening on the east and west coasts.  So Peggy is at the leading edge of changing social mores by doing it. Her mother's attitude is typical of someone of that time period in middle age.<br /><br />The women are coming more together in this season than they did in any prior season. Peggy, Joan and Megan are not at each other's throats.  They seem to rightfully see themselves as trying to make headway against the entrenched male enclave which is the advertising world.  So they are more alike in the business world than they are different.<br /><br />Sally also appears in this episode and she is clearly an early teenager at this juncture.  Although she looks like her mother, she thinks on her feet like her father. She is also keeping in touch with the boy from her old neighborhood whom her mother hates.  The only person Sally hates is Betty. When Sally dresses up for a party to attend with Megan and her father, we first see how she will look as an adult.  Already, she eclipses her mother and that is sure to soon make for one heck of a fight between them.<br /><br />Roger Sterling is back to his old self, the cad supreme.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0439023491|5.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is a book you will never put down. It is a very interesting and powerful book. It has been on the #1 New York Times Bestseller list and many others. This is a book I would definitely recommend to read. I give \\"Catching Fire\\" five stars.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Underworld Awakening is a great film for people that love the edgy, vampire movie genre- not the \\"sparkly\\" kind.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Kate Beckinsale is back in the films<br />2) They added solid characters/actors to the cast: India Eisley, Charles Dance, and Theo James;  India Eisley the actress that plays Subject 2 is another hybrid and was able to do the whole \\"transformation\\" without it looking awkward.<br />3) They gave some more depth to the main character Selene, as another reviewer mentioned, she is no longer killing for the sake of killing and revenge, but to protect someone.<br />4) There wasn't a single \\"sparkly\\" vampire<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Scott Speedman is not in the film, he was previously committed to another film at the time, but hopefully the next film he will be able to do<br />2.  It was too short- which is a mark of a good film when you wish it was longer.
0439023513|5.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" was a great conclusion to The Hunger Games trilogy. I found this book easy to be engaged in. This book is very compelling, I had a hard time putting it down. I always thought..just one more chapter! I was facinated by the ending, it took me by surprise. I would definitely recommend this book by giving it five stars.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood's New Cd Blown Away is really amazing. I only had it for about 24 hours and I am just in love with it. Got it the first day cause I am a huge fan of her's. And Man can I tell you that she has yet Blown Me Away. Must Have if your a Carrie Underwood fan and if your not well if you love country or american idol alums you must get this CD.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|Bought this one because it comes with all the copies you could need or want. My wife and I love the movie and the soundtrack. It is currently a favorite for our kids too who are all under 6 years old. It is amazing and exciting that it is possible for Hollywood to make a clean, funny, fun, entertaining movie still. Buy this and enjoy it over and over.
B005NKGEP2|2.0|Spoier alert!!!<br /><br />If you have 1/2 a brain you will figure out the ending 3/4 way into this read. That is, if you can follow it with all of the bouncing around. Essentially this book is a garbled mess with very thin plot twists. At $.99, sure.  But, not for what Amazon is charging.<br /><br />SAVE your money!
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I love this light! I got it as part of the kickstarter project for the product, so have been using it for months. The light is compact, very bright, colorful, and the patterns are great! Better yet, for all us America types, is it's made in the USA! How cool is that!<br /><br />The battery pack is situated at your wheel hub, so it doesn't unbalance the wheel the way some others might, this is a big deal, especially on larger circumference wheels. It still fits on smaller wheels though, I have mine on a folding bike with 20\\" rims. The whole thing is waterproof. I've ridden in the rain and through deep puddles without any light problems. There are lots of ways to set up the patterns, color cycling, selecting specific colors or patterns.<br /><br />The light tends to create a colorful \\"light puddle\\" that you ride within, so as well as a very visible wheel, the entire area of roadway around you is illuminated. I wouldn't say it's in a spot to be useful for identifying road hazards, but people can _definitely_ see that there's a bike there, and I can be fairly certain that you are the most visible bike on the road. The day a cab driver stopped in the middle of the road to ask me where I got the light was the day I knew it was really working :D<br /><br />My bicycle motto is: \\"put your money where it counts - in keeping you alive\\". Monkeylights help to do just that. I will _always_ have at least one on my bike.
0307592731|5.0|Not much more I can add, except that this book blew me away. It's much, much more than just an account of hiking the PCT, it gets in your skin and just won't let you put it down. Truly a joy to read start to finish, my heart absolutely went out to the author more than once. For those disappointed that this isn't a more detailed account of hiking the PCT (or purists complaining she didn't really hike the whole thing), look elsewhere for those accounts - but don't let that dissuade you from reading this book. It's truly special.
0345803485|5.0|This is erotica that touches in the realm of BDSM, but it is also far more than that.  This is a well written and engaging book that goes far beyond the cheap & tawdry interactions too often found in erotica.  It is an in depth look at a complex relationship between a couple that I found extremely engaging.  And more than anything, the complete trilogy is a beautiful love story, filled with character growth and redemption.  I found it extremely hard to put it down, even after I was finished.<br /><br />If you have strong morale convictions that prevent you from enjoying stories with graphic sexual content, then this is not for you.  On the other hand, if you enjoy (or even if you are neutral to) graphic content, then this is worth reading.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I was waiting for this app on my kindle forever it seems. now that its finally out,  it seems as if Draw Something is out of date and not used at all that much any more. it'd be better if the app came a month ago. besides the timing,  no flaw I found.
0316010669|1.0|1.  The only reason I gave this a one star is that the material in this book (which is interesting) could have been markedly condensed.  My \\"blink\\" thought prior to reading this book was, \\"this is going to be a lame book... I'm going to be wasting my time on common sense stuff\\" and as this book describes throughout the too many pages, I was right.<br /><br />2.  Thus, unless you want to waste your time reading redundant and somewhat boring material, just read some summary reviews, get the gist of the book and live life.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|is Just the Perfect Movie it pretty much Tell my life Situation i had to fight My enemies to get to my princess i mean Literally didnt really fought to Death like On the Movie But Still.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This so much fun realistic and cool I mean there's intertaiment minigames and really cool animals. download this game it us really worth all your attention.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I like it because you don't have to hit the zombies by yourself and it is fun how you get aasstents and still get points
B001PS7NL0|4.0|I also endorse this dictionary with some considerable exceptions. First, and foremost, the example sentences provided are entirely devoid of a specified context. Any language instructor worth his/her salt understands that it is not so much learning to say things in the language as it is \\"learning to do in a language\\" (Galal Walker). Thus, it would be of more worth to have the example sentences couched within specified contexts to allow learners to learn to use them within those constraints.<br /><br />Second, this book is targeted at an intermediate audience and yet the fact that it has eliminated the romanized text from the examples sentences doubles the difficulty inherent in the task of learning new grammar. It essentially causes the example sentences to become vocabulary and kanji acquisition tasks on top of the grammatical acquisition task it promotes.<br /><br />These weaknesses being considered, I still heartily endorse this book and the other two in the series as they are perhaps the most comprehensive compilation of Japanese grammar items available. The hallmark of each book is not only the vastness of the items introduced and discussed in the series, but also the in-depth analyses given regarding the subtle differences between semantically similar grammatical items (e.g. node and kara).
B007TML4EI|5.0|buy this app. its better than it looks. addicting like angry birds. worth .99 cents you build a wall around this robot to protect him from something.  awesome five star game
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Great compilation of #1 hits, acoustics, remixes and other future radio hits.<br />Impressed w/this CD and can't stop listening to it! Im also mid 30's (not the usual Katy Perry fan). Enjoy!
B007SGM084|4.0|I WANT TO BUY THE TRILOGY,BUT I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT COSTS MORE FOR THE KINDLE EDITION THAN IT DOES FOR PHYSICAL BOOK.DO I HAVE TO PAY MORE ,BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR A BOOK TO COME THROUGH SNAIL MAIL.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Of course not everyone will like this book.  For me, the style of writing and \\"type\\" of humor was perfect.  I loved it.  With every tap of my kindle, I anticipated another laugh out loud moment.  I even had my husband laughing at certain parts!  I readily admit that I am a huge Tina Fey fan, so I imagined at the start of this book that I would be giving it five stars.  More often than not, when I \\"over anticipate\\" how I might rate a book, I am disappointed due to the high standards I had from the get go.  Not so for this book.  I'll likely read it again.  Great job, Ms. Fey!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Awesome read.  Thought this book was better than the first.  Lisbeth is a wonderful powerful character. This book is a page turner.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I enjoyed the graphics of the game but there did not seem to be enough games to play.  I'm an average gamer but I blew through all of the games quickly.
B000NYT1M6|3.0|Nice toy. Wish it was a little stronger. My son likes playing with it in the sand. Overall I am satisfied.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Meets all requirements.  Would love to see  newer themes....))...... Maybe expand it to also be note taking app..) keep up the good work
0380799006|5.0|This book is nicely laid out and has some basic common sense ideas that we as parent wouldn't otherwise think of. Great way to avoid confrontation and delicately deal with such a crucial subject with our kids. We are finding this book very helpful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun to play when you need to kill time like in a waiting room. There is variety so there's something for everyone. It's bit of a pain to rack up enough points for the higher levels. I won't pay for points.
B0079TQHDO|3.0|This is the sequel to Only Time Will Tell and I was ready for another great read. Unfortunately the Sins of the Father was rather predictable and was not as riverting as Only Time Will Tell. In saying that, it is easy reading. Unfortunately this book leaves the reader up in the air and I believe that there will be a third, making a triology.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather movies have always been a staple for anyone who watches and loves movies.  And most people who order this will already know that, the huge draw for this is the translation into blu-ray.  And it will not disappoint.  Not only do you get all three movies in blu-ray form, you get an extra disk that features how they did the transfer along with other extras that are actually worth viewing.  I have the dvd collection but I couldn't pass up this deal.  Whether you have or haven't seen this collection, it is well worth it.  Sit back and enjoy a collection of films that started and inspired all mafia movies and television series.
B007VPLNGW|3.0|Not what I expected but would recommend to play when waiting for a long period of time for an appointment.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Beautiful movie, stunning to watch in BluRay format on your big HD TV.  Product came with BluRay, DVD and Digital Copy discs, and also has Angry Birds upgrade codes.  Really a lot of content for the price.<br /><br />Some violence that makes this scary for children under 8.  A cockatoo plays the bad guy and is aggressive with dramatic music and imagery.  Pre-watch this movie if your child tends to be sensitive to aggression or is in a nightmare phase.  Even cartoon birds and sharks can startle young ones just trying to relax with a movie.
0553386794|5.0|Calling George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones a \\"fantasy novel\\" is almost like calling The Wizard of OZ a \\"tornado story\\". Yes, the fantasy elements play a part in the story, but they do not make it. A more apt description of the book might be a \\"sort of medieval, kind of fantastical, political thriller on steroids...and slightly drunk.\\" and as strange as that may sound, it actually works! I found this book to be one of the most intriguing I've read in a long time. The characters are strong and intricate, the world is mysterious and imaginative, the plot is wonderfully complex and Mr. Martin writes with a masterful skill. Now, that's not to say there wasn't anything I didn't like about the book. I try not to complain about profanity and vulgarity in books and films as long as it serves a purpose. Unfortunately, the more \\"adult\\" aspects of this book seemed jarring and completely out of place. As if they were only included for shock value. For me, they did nothing but distract from an otherwise amazing piece of fiction. That is my only complaint (though I was slightly annoyed by the characters repeating the title of the book every few chapters. Come on, Mr. Martin, once was enough!) Many are calling George R.R. Martin \\"The American Tolkien\\". Do I agree with that assessment? No, I do not. It is, as they say, like comparing apples to oranges. That being said, if you're a fan of fantasy, mystery, intrigue, beheadings, drunken angry politicians or reading, I would highly recommend this book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Nice ap. Works really well. Just like the windows 7 version. Great way to sate some time when your waiting for a call.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I've been waiting for this to come out on Kindle! It's a great app for passing the time. I love it!
B007VGXS8M|5.0|First of all: anyone who is familiar with Where's Waldo books knows that they are CHILDREN'S books.  Not that they are not fun to revisit them now as adults with my kiddos.  For that reason the game is going to be easy.<br /><br />Secondly: I downloaded on both mine and my 11 yr old son's kindle fires and they have yet to freeze up.  It runs perfectly.
1455870102|4.0|I'm not sure why this didn't occur to me until long after I'd finished An Abundance of Katherines that of course I was going to thoroughly enjoy it. The whole `being attracted to someone with a particular name' thing has The Importance of Being Earnest written all over it, and I don't think it's any secret that I am a fan. And enjoy it I did. Thoroughly. An Abundance of Katherines was the book I chose to give my John Green V-Card to, and I really don't think I could have made a better decision. This book, to me, was hilarious, but not over-the-top-trying-too-hard ridiculous hilarious, completely-plausible-real-life hilarious. The kind of hilarious that means you probably shouldn't listen to this audiobook while working out if you have asthma, because you will inevitably have a laughing fit while already low on breath and have an asthma attack somewhere far from home and your inhaler that you left sitting by the sink. Quite possibly when Hassan is having a fat kid asthma attack of his own. So, so worth it.<br /><br />Jeff Woodman, the narrator, has a pretty sweet backlog of audio goodness behind him. I've listened to his narration of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, and Life of Pi, but he also narrates books I'd love to listen to including The Westing Game, The Queen's Thief series, and other John Green books. Those are some legit credentials people, and he's earned them. His narration of An Abundance of Katherines was spot-on--not the kind of narration that makes a good book better, but the kind of narration that brings a great book to life and lets you consume it in an ideal format.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of An Abundance of Katherines was that I did not like the protagonist, Colin Singleton. Quite frankly, the kid was a tool, and I love well-written characters that are the types of people I would never hang out with enough to observe in real life. I mean, I'm all for nerdome and smarty pants and what not, but Colin Singleton just takes it too far. He's the kind of kid who's socially awkward, and knows he's socially awkward, but only because he has a friend like Hassan to give him clues as to what is and is not interesting for other people to hear. I was less shocked by the idea that Colin had been dumped by nineteen Katherines than I was by the notion that this dweeb could get nineteen girls to go out with him in the first place. His social awkwardome doesn't shut him up or turn him into an introvert, and I kind of love that. Colin is who he is, and even though I wouldn't be caught dead with the kid, more power to him for not compromising and for finding friends who do enjoy him for who he is.<br /><br />Even though Colin is a quirky mega-brain character with many life experiences the rest of us will never have, I feel like he's incredibly relatable. He grew up labeled as a child prodigy, and now that he's finished high school and is ready to move out into the world, he has to decide what it is he's going to do that will mark his future. Colin wants to matter. I think most of us go through a similar experience at one point or another. We all grew up with certain labels, and we all have to decide whether or not those labels will continue on with us, and what we're going to do with our lives. But, as the character Lindsey so poignantly puts it: \\"What matters to you defines your mattering.\\" To Lindsey, her mom, and many people in Guttshot (the town Colin and Hassan end up in on their quarter-life-existential-crisis road trip), it's stories that make us matter. For Colin, it's the idea that he could be a genius--he could figure out what it is that makes someone either a dumper or a dumpee.<br /><br />An Abundance of Katherines is full of profound eureka moments about what it means to be an average person living life and what impact that might have, not on the world but on you. It was hilarious, fun, and full of insight about becoming who you are supposed to be. My one complaint about the audio version of this book is that you don't get to see the equations and graphs that Colin writes for his theorem. For someone very visual, like me, it was kind of hard to picture.is book is that you don't get to see the equations and graphs that Colin writes for his theorem. For someone very visual, like me, it was kind of hard to picture.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|ya its cool it free you got time play it.  that's it good for agree game. so try it and see how it see
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are honestly, astounding. These things have clarity, good mids, good highs, the bass is not over powering, it is SUPER LIGHT, and the detachable cable makes this thing hassle free. These headphones are awesome. Beats by Dre are crap compared to these. AKG, i give you 2 thumbs up.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|While I did find the 1 star reviews entertaining, I must say I completely disagree.  I loved reading this book.<br /><br />The story stayed with me and I couldn't wait to see what happened. I imagined what my life would be like if I had to wake up each morning in a panic, not sure of who or where I was. I won't be giving a long review as I don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />This book reminds me of The Time Travelers Wife... I recommend it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an excellent set of books.<br /><br />I've yet to see the movie, and now I don't think I can right away.<br />I can't imagine how a condensed 2 hour version could possibly compare to this clockwork masterpiece.<br />These books need their own HBO or Showtime series!<br />Or even AMC, since I really enjoy what they have done with Walking Dead so far...<br /><br />I had no idea what was going to happen from the first page to the last, and I absolutely loved every page in between.<br />There were several times when I made the mistake of assuming I knew what was about to happen, but looking back now that was a very silly thing to do.<br /><br />I'm hungry for more, but at the same time I'm glad this series is complete, as I don't know if I could handle a 4th book...<br />There were parts of each book that were REALLY hard to push through, yet I could not peel myself away as they seem to glue themselves to your hands and eyes.<br />I'm not a very sensitive person in general, but each of the books found a way to tug on every emotional string I have, and even some I had forgotten I had.<br />Fear, Joy, Love, Sadness, Surprise, Anger, and every combination in between....<br /><br />I eagerly look forward to what Suzanne has in store for us next!
B0073U2F2Q|3.0|The Darkest Hour has some of my favorite younger actors in it. Emile Hirsch has surprised me regularly with his talent and Max Minghella is a very promising up and comer. Also being a big fan of sci-fi and end-of-the-world type movies, I naturally assumed this would be a winner.<br />The first half of the movie sets up a very interesting premise. Invisible invaders who hunt humans by detecting their body's electric current. There's even a few really great ideas here an there, like a microwave gun that stuns the aliens. Sure, you have to be a little forgiving with the science of it all, but I preferred to think of it as a little more serious Ghostbusters weapon.<br />The problem with this movie isn't the nonsense explanations for why the aliens invade or the ridiculous microwave gun or really anything to do with the general story. The problem is there's ZERO reason to care. The characters interact in the most dull way 90% of the time, and the rest of the time they're being completely unreasonable. You start to realize that any time the movie needs to create some drama, they'll have a character run off for the most ridiculous reasons. Besides the first 10 minutes of the movie, I don't think a single character dies from something besides their own stupidity.<br />Correction- it seems half the characters die because the russian girl doesn't know which way is up. In fact, The Darkest Hour has some of the most vapid female characters I've ever seen in cinema. They're simply there to get into trouble.<br />Overall: I loved the concept. The special effects were neat and there are some genuinely intense moments. This may have been a decent movie if the actors could have sold their performances better. I guess that's the problem with sticking the entire cast in front of a green screen for the majority of a movie.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I've read the naysayers' reviews, the one and two stars discussions on the accepted fact that John Locke is primarily a marketeer, not a writer. So what? Some of them have other helpful information, but I'd still have bought this book after reading them. Why? Because I'm a writer, but not a marketeer. I'd rather write books than try to convince total strangers to read them. But indie writers with limited spare cash can't afford to hire publicists. So he beats his own drum a lot. So what? If I had the kind of successes he has had, I'd do a little bragging too.<br /><br />I needed to learn more about the \\"target your market\\" concept, and John has cleared up my question. Yes, I already belong to Twitter, Facebook, and several other social media groups. But I've been using them all wrong, according to John Locke, and what he says makes sense. I don't agree with his self-assessment that he's not a writer. He writes with passion, tempering the bad stuff with levity. I haven't read a western for years, but have read all three of the Emmett Love novels and thoroughly enjoyed them.<br /><br />I don't know if his marketing system will work for every writer. Frankly, I'd read everything he'd written just by reading a couple of reviews, then watching for his new books, book by book. But worst case scenario: If it doesn't work for me, I'll only have wasted $2.99.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I literally got depressed that I was finished reading these books!  I am reading them again!  I cannot wait for EL James to write more!  You will fall in love with Mr. Grey!  Whew!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just such a trilogy!  I am reading them all again!  Fell in love with Christian Grey and the idea of what he looks like in my own mind, I can't wait for the movies too!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderfully written!  Will make you blush, but very tasteful!  EL James used exactly the right words to describe everything.  The story line keeps you completely glued!  I read this book and jumped right into the next and the next after that!  I HOPE SHE WRITES MORE!!!  I am thrilled they are making a movie, and I can't wait to see!  Couldn't get enough, so I am reading them again!!!
B0067R0APK|4.0|It gives the weather for the next town over.  Not such a big deal.  Overall I think this app is good.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Not quite what I remember from childhood, but enjoying none the less. Gladbots not too Friend based and that u can still play on ur own without having to make &quot;friends&quot; all the time.

B000J1AGQI|5.0|Great action movie. Parents be aware it is a bit graphic but real for the subject matter. I've seen the movie before and decided to buy it for myself.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game because it refelects things that happened in the past to average people. This game keeps you on your toes and mixes in farming/ fishing and other things people had to do in rue past.

1593272200|5.0|This book is extraordinary. Crystal clear writing, great explanations and motivations, and tons of technical detail. It's one of the best technical books I've ever read, on par with K&R and Stevens. It's my go-to reference for anything related to Linux. Thanks to the author for this wonderful contribution to the systems community.  I'm having a blast reading it!
0894803123|5.0|We purchased this book along with an ice cream machine (Cuisinart) nearly two years ago, and we have not bought ice cream since.  We have also purchased this book and ice cream machine for at least four people in the past year.  The recipes in here are easy and delicious...you can make all of your B&J faves (be sure to use peppermint extract in the Oreo mint, rather than just mint extract)...and once you have tried out a few of their recipes, you can start to experiment with your own.  I have used their sweet cream base and chocolate recipes to come up with my own concoctions.  Have leftover Halloween or Easter candy?  Use it in ice cream!  Want to make your own green tea ice cream - use their sweet cream base recipe (I like the first one)...steep a bunch of green tea bags in cream and then add to eggs/sugar.  Their coconut recipe is delicious...but missing coconut (adding coconut flakes takes this recipe over the top!)  Love this book, and now love making ice cream...as a result, we have converted several people to homemade ice cream makers ...Enjoy!
0062060554|2.0|There are people who suffer from short-term memory loss and the premise is pregnant with possibilities, which is why I purchased the book. The story, sadly, doesn't hold up to its promise. The writing isn't engaging, the story is thread-bare, the characters are not interesting, it's lacking in any action, and its repetitive passages (necessary to support the original premise) gets long in the tooth after a while. The major flaws are the disastrous plot-points. The worst offense is the letter the husband had written to be given to the protagonist at some point in her life. That was a badly conceived plot contrivance that didn't work at all. There are several other plot points that are so unbelievable that you can figure out the Hollywood ending long before it gets there.

B0001WGDXA|5.0|Many people complain about how Bernstein \\"changes\\" the Brahms symphonies, and how they do not like his interpretations of them because they are \\"unusual.\\" However, that can be said for most of Bernstein's interpretations. He looks at music differently than most, and in my opinion, he improves the scores he looks at. He senses things in the music that few others do. His interpretations are always based in knowledge about the composer, and insight on the composer's intent for a piece. This can be said especially for this collection of Brahms symphonies. Bernstein conducts a great orchestra (the Vienna Philharmonic) with such knowledge and passion, and it really makes a set of unforgettable performances. I would highly recommend buying this set.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was incredible!  It took me a few pages to get hooked, but once I was I couldn't put it down.  I'm SO glad they released all 5 novels as a bundle because when one ended the next one was right there begging me to keep reading.  Hugh Howey has a way (that all good writers do) of leaving the end of a chapter hanging just enough that you can't help but see what happens next, and that is what makes each chapter more addicting than the next.  The story was brilliant.  The characters in the book were exceptional (my favourite by far being Juliette)!  Everything about her, especially in the way she views the world and attacks the challenges that face her, make her such an inspirational character.  Thanks for such an amazing read, Hugh Howey!

With two fans in push/pull configuration, it keeps my i5-2550k overclocked to 4.4 GHz at 55 degrees Celcius under 100% load.<br /><br />I only deducted a star because the instructions are terrible. Images are tiny and text is very minimal. I'm sure this is a cost-cutting effort by Cooler Master, and perhaps I shouldn't be complaining since price was my primary reason for choosing this cooler.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|This book follows Lena who made it into the wilds and was taken in by some \\"invalids.\\"<br />I enjoyed this book after about 30% into it. I found it a little boring and confusing at first but grew to enjoy it. Each chapter was separated into the past or the present. I didn't like the \\"then\\" parts much but I really enjoyed the current parts. There are many new characters-not as much character development as I would have liked on some of them but that is understandable because of the way the book was written. We are also introduced to Julian-the head of the cure activist youth group. He is by far my favorite new character and if you read this book you will find out why.<br />Lauren Oliver writes beautifully, as we have seen in Before I Fall and Delirium and this book is no exception.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I wanted something to protect my Kindle from light bumps and keep the screen from getting scratched. With that in mind I also looked at the cheaper end of the market. Belkin popped up as a recognizable brand name with a good image so I purchased this one.<br /><br />The inside is lined with a soft fabric material to prevent scratches. The layers are think enough, with a leather like cover over most of the sleeve, that it easy prevents damage from bumps. I've had this in the back of my backpack for several months now and it's protected my Kindle just fine.<br /><br />This is a great case to protect against light to medium damage, it's sleek and professional looking. I kind of wish they had made the entire thing out of one material. Either the either like covering, or the cloth, instead of doing a 3/4ths cover in one and and edge in another, but that's probably just my preference. It doesn't affect functionality in the least.<br /><br />The zipper goes halfway around for easy access.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a great game; no beat-the-clock rush, just interesting puzzles to solve.  And it's a bit addicting ;-)<br /><br />The one downside to the app is that it had an excrutiatingly long start time (about 12 seconds on a Samsung Captivate).  Ok, no big deal you say?  Then someone needs to explain why I need to wait through the same delay even if I simply lock and unlock my phone?!?<br /><br />My tenancy is to gravitate to games that are&quot;quick hitters&quot;.  I want to be able to be entertained for a couple of minutes, and I DON'T want a sizeable chunk to be spent staring at a splash screen.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm really enjoying it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's very easy to use and I really like the choice of books you can read. I would really recommend the App.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I love the series and enjoyed every episode I could see. This set has several disc with errors and I'm not certain if its defective from the manufacturer or if this was bootlegged and repackaged. When I say errors, some episodes do not play in its entirety and some do no play AT ALL. However because of the many episodes you have to view by the time you get to these issues your time for returning them has passed and you're stuck with the purchase. Will & Grace deserves better than this!
B007VGXS8M|5.0|This brings back memories. Not sure about others problems. worked great on my Fire. Definitely recommend for those people looking for Waldo.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Purchased a plastic case with rubber edges for the iPhone4. It lasted a year before chips and cracks started to appear. This was just from everyday use, and maybe 3 drops from my pocket since my purchase. Decided to go with this case from reviews.<br /><br />I like the fact that this case has a clear coat, and a smooth outer finish. I'm always weary or rubber cases as they get stuck in your pocket and have a  tendency to attract lint and dirt. But this case has been great so far. I may purchase another one soon for my wife's new phone.

B005LAIGP0|1.0|This flick was a total waste of my time. a \\"suspense\\" film should be full of twists and turns, surprises and secrets. \\"The Woman In Black\\" is anything but. It is about as straight line as a freeway, and about as exciting and intriguing as the same freeway during rush hour traffic.<br />If you like Harry Potter, I'm sure you'll love this.<br />If you'll watch anything once, go and watch this...however, if you like quality flicks, you'll regret this one.
0345455681|5.0|This is a beautiful work of historical fiction. It's been awhile since I read a book that I could only put down when forced to by social, familial, economic, or bodily considerations. The only caution I want to throw out there is that the subtitle - The Novel - only means that it is primarily a work of fiction. It is not a novel in the usual sense, since characters come and go with the passing of time (and there is a lot of time passing!). The only \\"character\\" that really persists and evolves as a distinct entity is the city of London itself.<br /><br />The way in which the book weaves fictional characters and situations with historical characters and situations is seamless, creative, and thoughtful. I googled all the way through the book (as is my MO when reading history or historical fiction) and I could not find any incidents in which the characters or situation related in the book was terribly at odds with the historical record, as best I could ascertain it. Of course, there are circumstances in which characters relate their own interpretations of situations, but even those interpretations were always at least historically viable (by the way, those interpretations, in my opinion, are what really distinguishes this book from other works of historical fiction). For example, I have read some criticisms that women were not portrayed with sufficient respect, however, I did not find this the case at all. Throughout the book - in virtually every historical period - I found that women played key and significant roles. As a matter of fact, the development of the political and social power of women I found to be one of the main themes of the book. While it's true that in certain historical periods women simply did not have the freedom to speak or act as women do today, there are many examples in the book where women spoke or acted much as I would suppose they would have, maximizing the few opportunities they did have in order to make a difference. Another stong theme in the book is the development of religion, from mysticism to enlightenment. As a matter of fact, I found this a particularly interesting social evolution, although unfortunately it is one that ends well before the book ends. It is as though Rutherfurd has thought deeply and become quite knowlegeable about religion in England prior to about the eighteenth century, and then didn't feel the urge to pursue it past that point into the modern age. At any rate, the part of the book that deals with the development of the Anglican religion and it's battles with Catholicism on one hand, and extreme forms of Protestantism (like the Puritans) on the other hand, was fascinating to me. The instances of brutality shown by Henry VIII (who does not come off well in this book) to opponents of the \\"King's Religion\\" are horrific.<br /><br />The book consists of chapters that are loosely linked by a number of character families. Each chapter covers a certain period, separated by sometimes hundreds of years, sometimes by only a dozen or so. It is not a thorough history, or continuous, by any means, but mentions most of the truly significant events. Some chapters contain summaries near the beginning and/or the end of significant events that should be mentioned but are not described in detail. The Black Death gets only a passing nod, and even the great fire of London - which you might think would play a prominent part in a work like this, gets only a few pages. But there is certainly enough here to give a fair picture of the life and growth of this great city. Many reviewers have pointed out the similarity between Rutherfurd's approach and that of James Michener. I have only read one of Michener's works ([[ASIN:0812970438 Chesapeake: A Novel]]), and found it very good, but I think this is better. In Chesapeake, it seemed to me that Michener put more effort into relating the stories of a couple of families, and by the last third of the book, these stories simply weren't compelling enough to carry the narrative. Rutherfurd, it appears, uses more families (although a few are more prominent), but he uses history to drive the narrative, with the stories of the families supporting the history. In other words, this is a work that emphasizes the history over the fiction. To be fair, even Rutherfurd's \\"story\\" sort of drifts to a close, because, as I mentioned, the work isn't really a novel per se. And the last two chapters (which basically cover the 20th century) are much, much shorter than almost any other chapter except for the first one. By that point there is very much a sense of \\"wrapping things up\\". It also seemed to me that the first half of the book was much more focused on the city of London than the second half. However, at no point in the book did I feel that the narrative dragged, or was painful to read. It is an extremely well written book. It's true that some chapters ended in a somewhat perfunctory fashion, and there were many chapters that I wished were longer, but I can't really complain of a lack of material! This is just one of those books that you wish wouldn't end.<br /><br />I also found interesting Rutherfurd's idea that society consists of layers, much like physical anthropology, accumulated over the ages. Sort of Society as an evolving entity.<br /><br />I have never been to London, although I hope to visit in the not too distant future. But thanks to this book (and lots of looking at google maps) I really feel like I have walked it, all of it, throughout its history. It will be interesting to see how this colors my actual experience of it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book, really kept me on edge.  Loved every minute. Not sure if the movie will be as good, but plan to check it out.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was skeptic about buying this book when I read some of the reviews from other readers that said the book wasn't that great and whatnot, but I took a chance and am so glad I did, because I absolutely loved it from beginning to end. I liked it so much that I'm also going to buy it in paperback form so I can have it on my book shelf. To me it was an emotional roller coaster that intrigued me page after page. But don't come into the book with high expectations, because so many people do that with books and movies, and don't end up enjoying them because they expect this extraordinary thing but are left disappointed when they're done, so just go into it knowing that you're going to be reading a romance with a great storyline and lovable characters that are all equally unforgettable in their own ways. I'd definitely recommend this book, but don't take my word for it, instead give it a chance and formulate your own opinion. I can't say you won't regret it, but I sure didn't, because like I said, I truly loved it as a whole. Characters, plot, romance, and all. It was such a great read. I'll definitely be reading it over and over again.

B00723NWJE|4.0|I remember thinking after the release last year of Brian Burton's 'Rome', his collaboration with Jones, Jack White and Daniel Luppi, that it would be a great idea for Burton and Jones to record an album together. Little did I know at that time that these two excellent musicians were already doing just that! Well, the finished product is here and once again proves Norah Jones' talent as singer/songwriter and Burton's songwriting and producing expertise. The twelve tracks are strong and feature subject matter ranging from failed relationships as in \\"4 Broken Hearts\\" to attempting to find oneself in \\"Travelin' On\\" and \\"Out on the Road\\". Kudos to Jones for experimenting with new musical styles. Lastly, Burton deserves credit for once again taking a talented artist, as he also did with James Mercer and the Broken Bells project, and pushing them to another level of excellence.
B00338QENI|5.0|I like science and I like a good story.  This fit the bill for both.  It was an easy read and offered scientific information basic enough that non-scientists could learn a little about science and not get lost in jargon.  It also reveals the past in a way that allows readers to see the injustices were bestowed upon the unsuspecting. It gives Henrietta and her family the respect and recognition they deserve for an unintentional contribution to the world of science. The ethical issues raised in this story are very relevant and not likely to be fully clarified for some time.  Read and learn.  I enjoyed this book.
B001OSIV62|5.0|Just watch it.  You should see it.  I hope you won't regret it, but honestly, it gave me more faith in humanity than I've had on a long time.  Of course that all went away when I got into a car 2 hours later, but you do what you can.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Not a big snowboarding fan to be honest...but saw a few clips of this at a friends and I had to buy it. The way in which this was filmed and edited just blows me away every time. Now I have it on in the house when I am doing chores because the soundtracks chosen are great to. Travis Rice has taken it to the next level with this one!
B0012GMZMW|5.0|I think this is one of Journey's finest albums.  It's certainly the best album of all time for love ballads. The love songs are exquisite, with a depth of feeling I hope to experience with Love. So it gives me hope that some day, I can find him. Someone who can take me all the way to a higher place, stand by me and help me restore my faith.  Someone I can count on to be there when life's journey gets so bumpy that the path can't be seen clearly. I need someone to kiss me softly and give me a reason to feel alive.the one to sing these songs because people would have been orgasming in the aisles at concerts if his voice had been put with these lyrics. And, well, society just would have frowned on that altogether.<br /><br />It seems the band is still riding on Perry's name even though he's no longer with the band. That's not fair to Perry OR Augeri, (or even Arnel Pineda, the newest lead singer). It appears that Journey is trying to draw Perry fans in by claiming that their new leads sound just like him, and yet they resent him and won't give him credit for what he did for the band.<br /><br />Journey was a good band prior to Perry and then Perry made them great. It was a synergistic relationship. The band raised him up and he raised the band up, far beyond the sum of the two. Even after he left, the magic he brought with him stayed with Journey.<br />Perry helped steer the band in the direction of the love ballads. The band ran with it even without him and Augeri nailed it with this album.<br /><br />I would have a lot more respect for the band if they could just give a little honor and respect to ALL of the leads that have led them to fame, including Perry, and realize they can stand alone and still be great without riding on Perry's name, or at least give him credit for doing so.<br /><br />So, all that being said, it's my Rock N Roll fantasy to be standing at the front of the isle aisle, Perry by my side and Augeri singing \\"With Your Love\\" or \\"Lifetime Of Dreams\\". Now THAT would be worth the wait.<br /><br />Still waiting for you Darling...
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Great character portrayals. The story line never lets up. I found it very difficult to put the book down and read large chunks at a time. Fortunately this final part of the trilogy was longer than the other two. I was sad when I got to the end - no more Lisbeth - no more trilogy.
B007CKNX28|3.0|Not a bad effort, but many of the songs sound the same.  A lot of the tunes are piano driven, but Mr White is a much more insteresting guitar player then piano player.  Even after listening to the album several times, none of the songs really stick in my head.
B004ZISVWC|2.0|It's amazing to see how many people recommended this movie and give it a five star vote. Maybe it's because I went into it after reading reviewers comments and they hyped the movie up more then it was, but I went in expecting something mind blowing, and all I found was disappointment in what I would hardly call anything more then a science fiction movie re-inventing what you think about Trolls. It's definitely not a horror movie, nor a thriller.. it's not scary, unless you are a complete wuss that is afraid of your own shadow, and the re-invention of Trolls as large monsters that the Norwegian Government don't want people to know about is just plain silly.<br /><br />::Plot::<br />3 College kids are out and about looking for something to film, as they haven't got much else better to do. They find a town where there is a dead bear that has supposedly been shot, but some of the people they interview beleive it was not shot, as no one has laid claim to the kill, and tracks around the bear look suspicious. The trio end up following a man who they think may be a suspect to the bear shooting. They follow him into the woods and end up running away from a strange sound caused by something big that is chasing them. They team up with the man who they where following, who just happens to be the #1 and only Troll hunter in Norway who explains to them that he doesn't mind them filming what he does, as long as they do exactly what he says. He also explains that the government know about the trolls and that he is paid to hunt them down if they go outside their territories nearer to human populated areas. He also explains that he doesn't care if they film this secret, because the government pays him very little, which I found hard to swallow, but OK. The Norway leaders only need one guy to hunt these things... sure. Okie Dokey then. Anyway...The 4 of them go on a hunt of trolls, learn how trolls are tracked, their species, and how to get a blood sample of one for a veterinarian.<br/>::End Plot::<br /><br />With everyone saying this is a must see movie, and how scary it is, It makes me wonder what other movies those people have been exposed to so far? Because this movie, it's not all as great as it's being hyped up to be. It's kind of like Blair Witch style but they are on the hunt of large mammals that either explode or turn to stone when they are exposed to ultraviolet UV rays.<br /><br />Sure they CGI is not bad, but that does not make a movie brilliant. I was drifting in and out of consciousness by the end of the movie. I dunno, maybe I prefer my scary movies to make sense or have a more interesting plot going on, but I didn't find this movie as gripping or compelling as some others have been saying it is. I'm not saying don't see it, I know people have different tastes, and although this didn't appeal to me, I'm sure other will. Like many of my reviews, it's more here as a reminder to myself why I didn't enjoy it all that much.
B007FLHW3K|4.0|As a year-round transportation cyclist (26+ years, 350+ days/year, 6000+ miles/year) I'm vitally interested in safety.  I have this theory... (hardly) anybody will deliberately run into me if they see me, but if they don't see me, all bets are off!  I wear high-viz during the day, and have lights and reflectors at night.<br /><br />A bright headlight and a bright, blinky taillight are good for fore-and-aft visibility, but how about from the side?  I've always felt a little vulnerable.<br /><br />Enter MonkeyLights.  I ordered a set in February '12 (within a week after the new model introduction).  The $50 price tag made me stop and think - that ain't chump change!  But is safety worth $50?  They arrived quickly, and I had 'em installed within an hour after opening the package.  (I opted to use Sanyo Eneloop AA rechargeable batteries - 3 of 'em.)<br /><br />Mounting was fairly straightforward.  There are 2 pieces - the LED circuit board that mounts (sealed in clear rubbery plastic and connected to spokes) near the rim, and the hub-mounted battery pack.  A heavy-duty-enough wire connects the two.  Everything mounts with zip-ties; it's uncomplicated and took 15-20 minutes.  (I installed one set on my 700c front wheel.)<br /><br />Trial Run - on sidewalks in a neighborhood park.  FANTASTIC!!  These lights are SO COOL!  Traditionally I've done most of my discretionary riding during daylight hours... but since February I've been riding more at night, just to enjoy MonkeyLight coolness!  It's particularly enjoyable to ride past other people who fall silent and stare.  (I'm glad I don't live in the Big City - I probably would've been mugged for my MonkeyLights by now!  Security should be a concern... they come with a supposed theft-resistant strap, but be smart and park your bike AND your MonkeyLights away from the rabble.)<br /><br />There are three tiny push-button switches, mounted on the LED array board.  1) on-off/dim/bright, 2) color, 3) pattern.  I'm still trying tofigure out the color button; the other two are no-brainers.  And I'm content with the ever-changing cavalcade of color.<br /><br />Construction seems plenty sturdy.  The river is running high this spring, and they've taken many a dunkin' and have kept working through it all.  I've used them in temperatures ranging from 20 to 75 degrees.  They are made in USA, and have a 2-year warranty.  I'm still on the first set of batteries, so I can't comment on battery life.  (So far I've probably accumulated 10-12 hours of run time.)  I'm sold!<br /><br />I did a bit of \\"comparison shopping\\" before buying.  But there's really no competition - all other products I found are cheaply made and obviously not built for the long haul.  I'm very happy with my M210 lights.  (When I put 'em on in February, I anticipated taking 'em off about this time of year, when the days are long, to shave a few ounces.  But they're not that heavy... and they have no perceptible effect on bike handling... and they are COOL!  They're staying on, and I'll be going on more summer night rides this year.)<br /><br />Ride On, Monkey Lights!

0345803485|5.0|This book is SO addicting. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down and immediately after I finished I HAD to purchase the next book!! Yes, there are things that could be \\"disturbing\\" to some but that is what makes it so addicting I think.  Job well done!!!
0440242401|5.0|I love this book. It's definitely a one of a kind, I've never read anything like it. Out of all the Kinsella books I've read so far, this is my favorite!<br /><br />Lexi's life isn't great. Her dad just died, her boyfriend \\"Loser Dave\\" stood her up again, her teeth are \\"snaggly\\", her job sucks, and she's overweight. She trips and falls while running for a taxi and wakes up in the hospital. The nurse gets her purse and it's Louis Vuitton, wait... she can't afford a purse like that. She uncovers herself and sees tan, toned legs... those can't be her legs! What happened to her, she just fell last night? Once her mom informs her that her husband is on the way she knows something's amiss. Lexi discovers that she now has the perfect life, everything she's ever wanted. But, it all has a price tag.<br /><br />What an engaging story! I loved following Lexi through her discovery of what happened to her and what parts of her memory were missed. She takes you through a funny, frustrating, romantic journey that eventually uncovers all the answers to how the new Lexi came to be.
0345803485|2.0|This very poorly written, continuously repetitive book frustrated me because it COULD have been fantastic in the hands of a skilled writer.  The only saving grace of this book - and the two that follow - is that the relationship between the two main characters holds such promise.  It's interesting to watch their relationship unfold from the initial \\"plan\\" to what it becomes (I don't want to give it away to those who might read it) but I have to say that it was made that much better by my imagination and NOT what I read.  For a book that is supposed to be so sexy and erotic, the sex scenes were so repetitive and, considering the subject matter, so unimaginative, I found myself wondering if the author did ANY research at all or just wrote what she THOUGHT would be applicable.<br /><br />It's a shame because this could have a been a marvelous trilogy...............
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a really fun free game. There are lots of tasks to do. It is more like simcity than Oregon trail.
B001USHRCK|5.0|This product is very detailed and contains a lot of pieces for the price. I would definitely recommend this set. It is already a classic and will certainly appreciate in value as time goes on. In addition, children might enjoy playing with it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is fantastically written. Charlie writes to a \\"friend\\" that we have no idea about and the way he writes his letters feels realistic because that is how people talk and you understand his feelings because he is willing to spill them.<br /><br />A great character is brought up by something that we can relate to and it is so easy to relate to Charlie because of the kind of person he is.<br /><br />I have read this book so many times and each time I feel that I find something new to learn and benefit from. This is a book that is constantly going and never boring.
B003AWRM9W|2.0|The movie starts very well with a clever plot, excitement, and two attractive main characters. But with every quarter hour the plot gets sillier. Toward the end it becomes totally absurd, when the two main characters, armed with pistols, set out to confront a large number of heavily armed brutes. (The idea of reporting the baby's abduction to the FBI does not occur to anyone.)
B004289ZW0|1.0|This is the biggest waste of $100 I have ever spent.  For whatever reason the mfg decided to over complicate this device with some kind of funky \\"finger slide switch\\".  It usually takes >10 swipes to turn on.  When I have been able t turn this on, it has made no difference.  It gives me a fix every so often. After it tracks me for a couple of minutes it loses signal.  I sent an email to the mfg, and not surprisingly never heard back.  My friend has the Bad Elf and it works beautifully.  That will be my next purchase.  I purchased this device new.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for a new author when I stumbled on this book and it exceeded my expectations in every way - well developed characters you end up caring about; detailed and believable world.<br /><br />I think I would have gone crazy if I had had to read the stories one at a time, so the omnibus is golden.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am irretrievably hooked on this series!  A Clash of Kings was interesting and spell binding.  I cannot recommend this book or its series members enough.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|We thought that this movie was a very Dark one.  We also thought that it was very long for the story it was trying to convey.  We are sorry that we spent the money on it.  We wish there was a way to return it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great series, fun to watch, humorous, thought provoking, touching.  Superb.  And once again, Corporate Suits step in to destroy a gem.  Idiots.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is sweet! Heavy and sweet! I have had mine for almost a year now and it is holding up very nice to heavy work. I do stuff with this knife that would destroy most knives. This one just smiles and keeps going. Buy this knife now!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Don't listen to those who don't like this.  You cannot put this book down. The author has really tapped female fantasy. Everyone I've talked to about it, raves about it! Can't wait to read the next two in the series.
B005P59ANS|5.0|I used the Life Proof armband and the purple iPhone cover in a recent warrior dash. It held up very well through swimming, crawling through mud and roller over ropes. It never fell out of the arm band and it was covered in mud but I had no problems. It never went more than 3 feet under water but boy it sure went through the mud! Just make sure you have the earphone plug in and that everything is snapped together tightly. I took it apart and cleaned it and there was absolutely no water or mud on the inside.
B0063GORYU|5.0|addicting<br />I stay up way too late playing this game. I probably should be more productive with my time but I'm hooked
B005S9EJZA|4.0|I was asked to join my wife in seeing this film, knowing that it was a chick film as they say, for me it was a very good film, good story, scenery was magnificent, actors were good, overall a film worth seeing, and again when it comes out on DVD.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|The memory came in fast and I popped it in my HP P3005DN printer and it worked well!  Highly recommended.

B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I know this is the kindle version and all, but the FB login fails every damn time. I can log on using my phone, but this will not let me log on at all...
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|I'm an action movie lover from way back and my wife normally tells me the movies I say were not that bad were in fact really bad. So when I say this movie is really boring I mean it was REALLY boring. It is only the 3rd movie in my life that put me to sleep. Not once, because I gave it the benefit of the doubt that I may have been more tired than I thought and tried watching it again when I woke up at 12:30 am (I usually go to bed around 2am but fell asleep at 10pm watching this film) and ended up falling asleep again and sleeping on the couch all night. I had rented it but I may purchase it now just for nights when I can't seem to fall asleep as this movie is better than medication.
B004V297IE|5.0|This series of books are best when read in order.  I MUCH PREFER the hardcover versions of the books because they are sooo thick, 800+ pages.  I find it much easier to hold the hard cover book when they are that heavy.  Paperback covers don't seem to hold up well under the weight.  I wish the story was even BIGGER than 800 pages.  Can't get enough of Jamie and Claire's saga.  I have read everything this author has published so far.  Each book seems to get better and better.  The Lord John books are not serial in form.  The first 2 Lord John books are shorter and weaker but the 3rd Lord John book called \\"The Scottish Prisoner\\" is a cross-over book in that  Jamie is featured throughout it.  It could fit seamlessly into the Outlander series.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|tons of fun. I love this game!!!! very addicting I cant put it down hours of fun. my favorite game yet.
0307237702|5.0|One often wonders how a person is led into public service and into politics. It is also of great interest to know of the impact, and effect on the family of the politician. For Mr Obama to come from where he was to the leader of the greatest nation on the planet is nothing short of an act of the living God.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The best thing about the Wool series is that I was never really sure what was going to happen next. I have been really underwhelmed by most of the new Sci-fi out right now, all very predictable bad copies of the classics I love. I was a little skeptical about purchasing this book, but was won over by the price, and now I feel as if I should have paid more! The characters were great, and the setting in which they lived was very different than anything I've ever read.<br />  The author was able to write a story in which you immediately chose the good guys and the bad guys, but slowly lost your grasp of who was who the more you read. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a realistically dark sci-fi, that keeps you guessing and leaves you hanging! If all of this authors books are as well written as these, I plan on purchasing every one of them!
0312933541|5.0|It's 2:47am, the last page read, and I can finally go to sleep. Great read, great suspense, and a great twist.

B001CDWFPC|5.0|This review is of the latest Kindle version (esbsb.2012.01.mobi)as of the review date, May 3, 2012.  In order to see how well the Kindle version worked, I purchased and installed the latest Kindle version of the ESV Study Bible on my Kindle Fire, my e-ink Kindle Keyboard and on Kindle for PC.<br /><br />All of the negative reviews I've read concerning the earlier Kindle versions seem to have been solved in the latest release and, in my opinion, the publisher has done a great job formatting this study bible for all three of my Kindle devices.  The bible text, footnotes, cross-references, concordance, the articles and the additional resources all display correctly and the navigation tools work well, with one minor exception.<br /><br />The only glitch I found was with viewing the extensive collection of charts.  The publisher's \\"How To Use The Kindle Edition\\" guide explains that screen size and resolution limitations make some of the charts illegible on Kindle devices and they've included clickable links to online versions of these charts.  I found that, in fact, many of these charts don't display well on the Kindle, particularly e-ink versions.  However, the online versions don't display much better and in some cases the links seem to be broken and don't display at all on my KK.  The Fire worked much better and Kindle for PC didn't seem to experience any problems at all.  This was a minor inconvenience and the charts weren't very important to me anyway.<br /><br />The full-color maps display great on the Fire and are very well-done.  Even on the e-ink KK, the grayscale maps are very legible and you can zoom in by clicking on them.<br /><br />This is a massive resource, containing over 2,750 pages and equivalent to a 20 volume resource library. Naturally, there is a learning curve to using it to full advantage and I'm still not completely comfortable with navigating through all the features but the included section \\"How To Use The ESV Study Bible, Kindle Edition\\" is well-written and comprehensive.  So far, I haven't had any problems using the Kindle version that haven't been solved by reading this guide.<br /><br />This is by far the best bible study resource I've found for the Kindle and I highly recommend it.ell-written and comprehensive.  So far, I haven't had any problems using the Kindle version that haven't been solved by reading this guide.<br /><br />This is by far the best bible study resource I've found for the Kindle and I highly recommend it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books are well written and always keep you interested. Once I started the books I could not put them down.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I love watching them live, so I can't wait to have this to watch over and over again. They are pretty much amazing in all aspects. They actually have talent unlike many artists out nowadays.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book kept my attention from the first page.  I have always been a fan of his books and this book is as good as his others.
0741470314|5.0|A fabulous book!  A must read for anyone who is a MJ fan. And I say it gets 5 stars even after reading and considering the critical reviews posted here.  That's because I simply enjoyed the way Dr Moriarty presents her findings. She obviously did the research and wanted her readers to appreciate the many very human facets of this iconic figure. She has given us a realistic and at the same time compassionate view of an amazingly talented and sensitive man.  This is an easy book to read with comfortable size print so the 480 pages goes by quickly for a MJ fan.  Maybe too quickly!  Her sensitive and honest handling of each story or antidote she covers can only please those of us who are fans. Grab this book, find a cozy spot and enjoy an emotional, entertaining and interesting read!
1594203334|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  It is an easy read and has so many good suggestions for dealing with the everyday concerns of childhood.  I have recommended the book to young mothers and grandmothers and would hightly recommend it for discussions at book clubs or mothers' groups.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I finished all 3 in 4 days! Hoping there is way more to come in this series! Can't wait for the movie/s. I highly recommend these books to everyone!
B000OCXI3K|4.0|As one of the books of a book discussion group, I read the book not expecting what I found.<br />The book is loaded with stories that break off from the main topic.<br />I found it both enjoyable and interesting to read.<br />The author put me in the village with her descriptive outline of each and every corner of the plot along with the cast of characters she wove into the stories I felt I wanted to continue to know these people.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This is kind of a guilty pleasure.  I read it the first book in one night and figured Id do the same with this one.  But I had trouble reading this.  The story lines a bit weak and the cheesy love scenes and bickering get old.  Aside from the two main characters the characters are not well developed and it makes this book a bit flat and tedious to read. 3 b/c you'll read it if you read the 1st.  2 if you want a gripping book.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Nice phone but the battery life is terrible.  Charging does not even last 24 hours and that's with only a couple phone calls.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book has little to give you by way of mystery and its pretty much a romance novel.  The second book brings the characters to life a bit more, but basically you are going to read the same drama you get on reality tv.  There is some attempt at S&M, but its not that sensational.  I read all 3 b/c I started reading this one and I don't like to not finish a book or series.  My biggest complaint is the constant bickering.  I HATE it.  It doesn't develop the character and its quite juvenile.  I expected much more.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|I've finished the meat of Krugman's new book in a refreshingly short time since I bought it earlier today.  It was helped, I suppose, by the fact that I've been following his column and blog in the NY Times for quite a while and am therefore familiar with his arguments.<br /><br />I can only say that this book has the potential to stand at the forefront of a renaissance in modern economic policy, if only people will understand the message.  And its message could not be more timely, coming as it does while the economies of United States and Europe are still deeply depressed, with no end in sight, and we stand on the brink of elections that may well determine the fate of both societies.<br /><br />To those ends, Krugman's writing is clear without being vague, and is easily comprehensible to someone without any professional economics training, although you do need at least a basic concept of supply and demand -- economics at the high school level -- to grasp the nuances.<br /><br />In a nutshell, Krugman says that nearly every facet of our macroeconomic policy since the 1980's has been not only flat wrong, but in direct opposition to the hard-earned lessons of the Great Depression.  Far from sinking in, those lessons were conveniently discarded when they stood in the way of unprecedented growth in the incomes of the very, very rich.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that growth came at the expense of increased volatility that led inevitably to the 2008 crash and our current depression.  What's worse, entrenched political interests backed by big money are determined to do everything in their substantial power to prevent us from getting out of this mess and to maintain, or even increase, the current levels of economic inequality.<br /><br />The message in Krugman's book needs to be circulated as widely as possible.  It needs to make its way to President Obama's team of economic advisers and, hopefully, to the President himself.  It needs to be on the lips of every pundit who iswilling to deal with the straight facts of our economic crisis.  It needs to be the rallying cry of a generation who will not put up with being economically disenfranchised any longer.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Got to say: I'm not a big Angry Birds fan, but this version of the game is way cooler. Only one thing annoys me: I have no clue as to how far I am from getting a 3 star rating in a level, but that was true for the previous versions.<br /><br />The gravitational play in this version makes a huge difference as far as gameplay goes, though. It's just... fun!

0330250493|5.0|As far as my family is concerned, James Herriot is one of the very best authors ever, and his books among the most enjoyable. This one is no exception. The fact that the stories are true add much to the books. But what conquers our hearts of readers is the human spirit behind the stories: his devoted live for animals, his kindness, his humility. Unsurpassed!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|This CD is amazing! I absolutley love it!! I think this is the only boy band that I will listen to, cause all of the other ones are not as good as 1D! My favorites are What Makes You Beautiful, Gotta Be You, One Thing, More Than This, and well all of them! I recommend this CD for anybody, but especially to young and teenage girls. 1D makes the girls feel as beautiful as they really are. Love this CD! Amazing!!
B000002MUN|4.0|One great C.D., it's one you can hit play and just keep listening. So many good songs. Thanks Tom Petty!!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I don't read my Bible (book) everyday like I should.  This app insures that I read at least one verse or passage a day.  And, what's nice I can choose to read devotions and other lessons.  This app is great!
0345803485|1.0|I was very excited to purchase this book, despite some of the bad reviews. My thinking was 50 thousand Elvis fans can't be wrong, right? Well, yea they can. By page 10 I had rolled my eyes 4 times at Anastasia's lack of confidence and by page 50, had thrown the book down in disgust, unable to finish. Why, you ask? The character development is nil and the two main characters are unbelievably unlikable and bipolar it seems. The plot is dull--it's been done before (virgin falls for playboy, he has demons in his past, she saves him..boring), the book is redundant and the writing is painfully amateur. Painfully. When I returned the book to the store demanding bookstore credit, the clerk asked me why I returned it. And my reply was 'This book is crap.' Surprisingly enough, he said 'Yea, I've heard that a lot.' So, to the people that love this series, good for you, but I honestly don't understand why when there is erotica out there that is written like poetry with deep characters and an amazing, intricate plot. You want good S&M-read the 'Sleeping Beauty' trilogy by Anne Rice.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|It was amazing!  Bella is starting to get some backbone and come into her own can't wait to see her as a vampire- she will kick some butt. I just love this type of love story that just pulls you in.
B003Z6WFWC|4.0|I showed this film to my nephew (13 years old) and he completely loved it.  In fact, he is not really the type of kid that typically enjoys this type of film.  It spurred him to do more research about the actual people behind the movie characters.  Plus, Denzel Washington is simply a great actor!
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|This book starts out really good although at some point the story starts to get a little bit tedious... but I enjoyed it none the less.<br /><br />I would have liked the narrative not to be in first person as most of the time I found myself frustrated for not knowing what was going on in Gideon's head. I think Romance literature works better when the author allows you to see both points of view, and I think this story lacks of that, Eva thinking gets a bit repetitive after a while.<br /><br />Overall, It's been a good enough read, pretty well written; complex characters, very steamy sex scenes and some really emotional ones. I would be definitely reading the sequel.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|its the best angry birds I have tried ,and I hate angry birds ,but the only reason I gave it 4 stars because its short .
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game ever. You need to get it.It'll give you coins everyday IT'S THE BEST GAME EVER
B007V2UGPE|1.0|its so bad I don't know how to explain it, unless u have more than 3 hours to listen to me
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I am uninstalling this game - finding it extremely frustrating!  When I launch this game on my Kindle Fire  and it \\"reloads\\", I know that everything will be reset to unrealistic times. This has now happened 4 times within a month, where I am expected to wait for over 100 hours to collect anything.  In the past I would sell, then replant or rebuild (to a degree) - just to keep playing.  But, not anymore - not worth the hassle!  I would highly recommend to wait a while to download this game, until they get this major glitch fixed!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|easy but not to easy. good way to waste time. can be challenging. some games are not fun and others are very addictive.

B007SGM084|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is so worth the hype!!! Intriguing, and addicting!! If you have not begun the trilogy yet do yourself and your significant other a favor and BUY IT NOW!!! I'm not generally an avid reader and this series had me hooked I'm not ashamed to say I was infatuated with Christian Grey!!! I really hope they do make a movie from these books!! I've finished the series and am sooo sad!! Although it ended good I want more!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was pushed by my daughters to read this book, especially after the hoopla regarding the movie.  It is always easy to read on Kindle.  After this book I purchased the \\"trilogy\\" and got the entire series which was a good read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are hard to unlock. wish you could buy them.other than that its. actualky pretty fun. so gt it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games to play to kill time :-D.  my kids like to play some of the games to and that's awesome!!
1442419814|4.0|This book has an amazing plot and will keep you reading. However, there WILL be certain parts where you will struggle to focus because of excess sentences and thoughts, however after you've read the book you;ll feel as if you've never read anything better!! Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend this book really to anyone. PLease read it..!
B000FC130E|5.0|My eldest son introduced me to the work of Gaiman through American Gods and as I was struck by the writing style I explored a lot of his other writing as well including Neverwhere.<br /><br />If you are looking for a safe and sedate fantasy story where everyone is happy, you have no business reading Gaiman in general and Neverwhere in particular.  Neverwhere expands on themes in other Gaiman books that blend myth and legend and he everyday world in which we live to give you the feeling that, if only you had paid more attention, you'd have seen this all happening in your own life all the time.<br /><br />The story is filled with well drawn and filled out characters.  We do not have to suffer through typical cads and glorious good folk and the dashing hero.  We are bathed in deceit and double dealing and betrayal and it all works because we've met these folks, worked with them, avoided going out to drinks with them, and ultimately have had to accommodate them at one point or another.<br /><br />This book is worth reading, it's worth re-reading, and it's worth watching the BBC production.<br /><br />A caution, however, there's a large share of gratuitous violence, but then, we see that in the world each and every day so that three are some characters who exist just to inflict pain and misery is not a stretch, it's just a lens on the reality of our lives.
1416955070|4.0|This book was such a joy and thrill to read. I DEVOURED this book in two days!! I hope anyone who enjoys this genre reads this book because the second book is EVEN BETTER!! Please read!!
B000YJ85BI|4.0|I bought this with trepidation.  I'd read Old Man's War and Ghost Brigades and enjoyed them but I feared the writing would suffer greatly if the sequels were put out on name recognition rather than story value.<br /><br />It's not Old Man's War.  It's not Ghost Brigades.  It's a solid story though and explores the \\"what next\\" in the universe and let's us see a bit more of the political motivation and fleshing out of the characters than we'd previously seen.<br /><br />I enjoy Scalzi's writing style, I enjoy the way he constructs a story and does not leave idiot plot threads hanging for no good reason, and I enjoy the way there is some dimension to all the characters involved.<br /><br />If you're looking for the action of the first two books, you'll be disappointed.  If you're looking for a solid story with plot points threaded from the first two books and expanded into new directions, you should enjoy this book.
0385737955|5.0|This book has to be one of my ALL TIME favorites. It was enrapturing, beautiful, thrilling, and EVERYTHING in between. I seriously recommend this book to anyone. HOWEVER, beginning is a little tedious and sometimes (hardly ever) its gets just a little (and i mean only a little) confusing. PLEASE READ!!
B007MDB71O|5.0|Like a lot of the reviewers have been saying, don't believe the crazy critic's reviews. This movie is amazing.<br /><br />Not only is this movie spectacular, there is a very rich history behind it worth discovering. After seeing John Carter I went and bought the digital copy of the first 5 books (the first of which, A princess of Mars, this movie is based) in the 11 book Barsoom series that got its start 100 years ago. I am on the third book now and I cannot stop thinking about how great Edgar Rice Burrough's imagination must have been to illuminate Mars in such rich storytelling back in 1912. While the movie deviates from the original book a little here and there it is still propelled by the same adventure and spirit that ERB penned.<br /><br />Everyone, do yourself a favor and give this movie a try. I am hoping Disney pays more attention to the fans of this film than the critics and continues to make more John Carter movies.
0439023521|5.0|Great book couldn't put it down.  Breezed through the whole story in only a couple of days.  Read the next book in the series just as quickly.
0545265355|5.0|Great Read! Once you start, you won't put down so just get it over with and buy the series. Shipment came quick!
B001OB7R7S|5.0|I love this album.  I bought the vinyl when it came out in the mid 80s and getting a good mp3 of it tops the cake for me.  The whole album has a jazzy feel to it. Donald uses some of the top studio musicians of the 80s then to help create a very cool sound.  If you liked Steely Dan, you 'll love this. I also believe that this was digitally recorded back in the day too.  I listen to this one over and over again.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Within 2 hours of watching the movie, Hunger Games, I had purchased all three books in the trilogy for my kindle at a considerable discount. I loved the movie, and really enjoyed reading all three books.
0345803485|5.0|Loved Fifty Shades of Grey.  I read all 3 books. Easy read...took my mind off everyday stress...About time for a romance. The Character Christian Grey is addictive. I think I will read the books for a second time!
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|I'm a birder, at times rabidly so. I didn't know what to expect from the movie but it was a pretty funny romp and gave a few insights into some of the serious birder's manias and neuroses. We're a funny group of folks and it was fun to see a movie poke fun at us. I'd recommend to any of my birder friends, and most of my non-birding friends would love it just to give me grief.
B001NZREUA|5.0|A lot of people will say a lot of things about this album, mostly in superlatives.  But the fact of the matter is that words simply fall short of the actuality.  If you've never heard this album and you have any use whatsoever for fusion, just get it.  Decades from now, you'll still be listening, mesmerized as much, the thousandth time you hear these tracks, as the first.  Like \\"Kind of Blue\\", \\"Crystal Silence\\", or \\"The Way Up\\", this is one of those rare moments in jazz where something truly transcendent took place because the musicians so completely comprehended each other.  It can't be imitated or duplicated; you can only listen.  In awe.

B007M45PMU|5.0|For at least the first two weeks, I had to listen to the album over and over, every day (not usually one for continual repeat).  Even with some more rest in-between now, there is something to love every time I go back.  Different songs grew on me for different rounds, but always something to appreciate.  If the samples catch you, it only gets better!

In the long run, the bigger the government the slower the economy grows.  More money will just drive prices of necessities even higher making people poorer.  This book will help push the country into hyperinflation.  Don't help make him richer by buying this foolish book.

B0036EH3WK|4.0|With over 300 reviews its difficult to add anything not already covered.  Rather than attempt to rate the show of such a fantastic franchise years after its been off the air, I'll just say that this is one of the most amazing and influential TV series I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  I'd recommend that EVERYONE watch the pilot anyway they can and if they find it enjoyable, then this purchase will be well worth their money.<br /><br />But, I do want to discuss the problems I have with the actual packaging of this great show as a \\"buyer beware\\" section.  While it likely isn't enough to make you avoid the purchase, there are some frustrations that may lead you to the standard seasons instead of this complete collection.<br /><br />First, The actual discs are in a cardboard binder.  It pains me to slide out a disc on cardboard.  But the other problem is the size of the case.  Its 25 - 45% taller than a standard DVD case.  So you can't store this on a DVD shelf without turning it on its side.  This is the actual DVD case removed from the odd shaped box the extras are stored in.  I'm going to buy a multi-disc binder to keep them in, which is a bit of a shame for this nice collector's set.<br /><br />The ankh was a bit disappointing as it feels like very shallow plastic and easily separates in the middle.  If you actually wanted to display this, it isn't smooth enough on the bottom to stand up on its own and it comes apart too easily to wear as a necklace (plus, the place where it separates is very noticeable, even at medium distance).<br /><br />Next, the features on the disc are organized in a very frustrating way.  Items are not listed, they have to be scrolled through.  What's worse, completely unnecessary items are in the way.  Once you choose to watch \\"episodes\\" over \\"features\\" you are then prompted for the season.  Keep in mind you already inserted the disc to get to this point.  If you scroll to another season, it politely tells you to insert that disc.  Why?  Then, every time you start watching an episode you are asked if you want to use the feature that remembers where you left off.<br /><br />Additionally, there are many load screens and splash screens at the insert of each disc (one of which is a warning that some screens may take long to load).  The first disc, season 1, had multiple advertisements for the Lost series.  This was frustrating as I had purchased the entire series in a nice collector's set and was not expecting the same advertisements from the standard DVD that sold over 6 years ago.  So, after watching commercials and multiple loading/splash screens, you then have to click 4 buttons to get the show started each time (not counting the scrolling of episodes since they don't list in a menu).  With only 4 episodes on a disc, I am thinking this could have easily been organized into a more user friendly fashion.<br /><br />Finally, the commentary is what I was most excited about and am now equally disappointed over.  In a show shrouded in mystery and secrets which left epic details unanswered... I was giddy over hearing director/writer/actor comments that would explain some of what was going on.  No show has ever had me wanting commentary more than this one.  Sadly, after viewing the firs 10 commentaries, I've seen little other than stating the obvious, (i.e. \\"this is a great scene, the actor did a good job here\\"), joking with other cast members (while funny at times, it adds nothing to the Lost cannon or helps with understanding the episodes in any way), or talking over the scenes with information that has nothing to do with show or content at all.  To be fair, I am enjoying the commentary, but given this series, its quite a waste of time.<br /><br />In summary, I'm enjoying one of the best TV moments in the history of television while I watch this set of discs, but I'm also disappointed at the treatment the physical media and contents received.
0345803485|1.0|I purchased the Shades trilogy due to the media attention these books have received.  After reading the 1st book, Shades of Grey, I have no desire to read the others.  The writing is terrible.  The author repeats the same phrases throughout the book, \\"My inner godess....\\", \\"His sex tousled hair.....\\", etc... The sex scenes were very monotonous.  It got to the point where I would just skip over them because they were unrealistic.  Don't waste your time and money.

1451683405|5.0|Harris says we originate none of our thoughts from our consciousness.  Our brain introduces all of our thoughts and we become aware of them as they are introduced into our consciousness. We are then under the illusion that the thought generated out of our consciousness. What our brain produces depends on genetics and our total life experience.  Both of these elements depend, to a great extent on pure luck.  But I think this theory is flawed.  I know of quite a few people who were blessed with good genes on both sides of the family and had a perfect childhood and early adulthood, with a loving family, high average family income, good schools, etc.  These people turned out to be total duds, absolute failures in life. Conversely, I have known people who have had absolutely horrible early lives, and yet somehow overcame their circumstances to become triumphant in life and very effective people.  How come?<br /><br />Lilburn Barksdale, who headed a self esteem organization in California in the 1970's, said we always make the best decision we can possibly make at any given point in time, given our genetics and total life experience. We can never say \\"I didn't want to do that.\\"  Yes you did, or you wouldn't have done it.  We can rob a liquor store and kill the clerk, but at that point in time we did the very best we could.  Of course, we would have to pay for our crime and do prison time, but there should be no malace towards the perpetrator.<br /><br />And of course, Harris' and Barkesdale' concept does away with sin.

0691152640|2.0|The authors of this text are distinguished academic economists, and I am sure that they are good at their craft. What their craft does not seem to include is the ability to write decent English prose, or at least prose that is less painful to read than having multiple root canals while Dr. Mengele pulls out the rest of your teeth using a rusty, old pair of pliers.<br /><br />It is no secret that most academics couldn't write a pleasing sentence to save their lives, but Reinhard and Rogoff are second to none in concocting ponderous, deadly-boring prose. I began this book with a healthy dose of good-will toward the authors. I had read some glowing reviews that described it as groundbreaking, and so forth. What followed was page after page of brain-killing, academic defintions (a 'banama' shall be defined in this work as a long, yellowish fruit, native to ....').<br /><br />I thought I was going to die. I just couldn't get past what seemed to be an endless series of sterile, pointless defintions. After a while, the pain became so intense that I started humming Englebert's Humperdinck's old chestnut Please Release Me, just to distract myself.<br /><br />I know that this sort of painfully bad prose is considered acceptable in the academic world, but there are some people, like myself, who read books because we like to read well-written, informative books on any subject. Warning to readers: this is not one of those books. If you are a student taking an economics course, you may be required to read books like this, but the general reader should not voluntarily subject himself to such abuse.

B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|This story is set up fantastically--and in the beginning it seems to have promise; but it is very slow with no real big scares. The climax of the movie should have been a bit more drawn out and just utterly fails to deliver. At the end of the film all I could think was: \\"what the heck just happened...seriously, that's the end?!\\" Not very eloquent, but if you rent this movie, you may find yourself saying the same thing!<br /><br />Regarding the acting, I thought the male lead did a credible job but I did not like the female lead. Her acting seemed a bit forced and her character was somewhat annoying--which was not her fault but made it hard to watch.

I'm kinda hazy on it, i saw it a while ago, but still a very solid action movie with great acting potrayls of Lycans and Vampires. Reccomended. 8/10<br /><br />~Matt.

0385340990|3.0|ISBN 9780385340991 - Printed in the United States of America. Hard cover, 278 pages. Published by The Dial Press, a Division of Random House, Inc., in 2008. By Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows, endpaper map by George Ward.<br /><br />After the end of World War II, author Juliet Ashton is contacted by a man named Dawsey, a founding member of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society on the island of Guernsey. From this first awkward contact, Juliet develops a curiosity about the island and the society and letters flow to and from Guernsey. Although she'd not yet met any of the islanders, Juliet felt quite close to them and comfortable enough to plan a visit - from which she never really returns. Instead, she's fallen in love with the island, the people on the island, the stories they tell, an orphaned child she meets and the mother who left her behind on the island and died during the war. Mostly, she falls in love with Dawsey.<br /><br />This is a cute, cute idea for a book. It is the kind of idea that I think every author probably toys with, and then opts not to write because it sounds far easier than it is. Every character must have a distinctive voice that comes through in his or her letters. The letters have to sound appropriate to the time they were supposedly written and they must convey all the information the reader is going to get without sounding utterly inane. On the first two counts, the authors just don't pull it off. Most of the characters' voices are the same or very similar and the letters themselves are just wrong for the era. The idea of a woman writing to a man, especially one who is not her husband, about anything even remotely related to the word sex in the late 1940s is so far off base that it was hard to continue after that and once a character's homosexuality became a sh-secret that was discussed in letters, it was about impossible. The necessary information did get into the letters, but because of that style, there's little description of place to convince the reader that Juliet would just fall in love and never leave.<br /><br />I love WWII stories, even fictional, but this one doesn't quite jive with what I know of the era. If you're looking for a cutesie love story, jump in. If you're interested in historical accuracy, just beat yourself over the head with the book now and save the time it would take to read it.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBookstion of place to convince the reader that Juliet would just fall in love and never leave.<br /><br />I love WWII stories, even fictional, but this one doesn't quite jive with what I know of the era.

B00006674X|1.0|Other than the fact that this movie has \\"Rubberneckin'\\" in it, there is nothing to recommend it beyond that.  It's offensive in its stereotypes (Elvis utters, \\"The last 3 nurses that worked here couldn't take it.  Two of them got raped.  One even against her will.\\")  Perhaps, at the time, it was meant to be funny, but time has revealed every flaw of this movie and made it utterly irrelevant.  It's very obviously shot on a backlot and not in NY which, at the time, would have added a gritty realism to this saggingly artificial film.<br /><br />In many ways it reminded me of \\"Sister Act\\" except that \\"Sister Act\\" was a comedy and everyone was \\"in on the joke\\".  This movie would have us believing that autism can be cured by hugs in one office visit.  Mary Tyler Moore is her usual self...playing a bit uptight but well-intentioned.  Elvis, if it weren't WIDELY known before this movie, is no actor.  He delivers the lines in this film as casually and \\"throw-away\\" as he would deliver a line about a coconut in Hawaii.  A talented man.  This was not his talent.

I mean, Harry Potter, which started out very \\"young adult fiction,\\" but got super dark later on, at least STARTED OUT as young adult fiction.  This starts out with very mature themes--primarily violent ones.  Admittedly, I don't have a problem with teens reading graphic stuff, and this isn't super graphic really, but I think this more belongs in \\"fiction\\" than being specified as \\"young adult fiction.\\"  I mean, what makes it \\"young adult\\" other than the fact that the main characters are between 16 - 18 years old?  If that's the case, every bad horror movie should also be \\"young adult fiction.\\"

0439023513|5.0|This is the best of the three books.  I just put it down, and I have to say, I'm very impressed with how the series was wrapped up.  Collins resists the urge to shy away from some very dark issues and societal questions.  Very few books--let alone young adult books--confront questions of how people deal with unspeakable horror.  And let me be clear: although books 1 and 2 have some pretty dark themes, book 3 definitely breaks new ground on that front.  And in the process, it manages to resolve a lot of the loose ends in plotting and characterization of the previous volumes.  Ever wondered why the citizens of Panem put up with the crap they're routinely put through?  Well, you're finally given enough info to understand.  Without getting into too much detail, let me just say that before reading the book, I couldn't understand why characters would give a damn about the comings and goings of a person like Katniss, and this book makes you understand what's unique and not unique about her position in the world.<br /><br />One thing I loved about the series in general is its treatment of moral ambiguity.  Never in the series are you really sure that Katniss is truly in the right, nor is she.  She's simply presented as a person who is doing the best she can to do the right thing in the face of very difficult dilemmas and incomplete information.  And Katniss's narrative voice provides a very human navigation of these dilemmas.  When Katniss retrospectively derides her own decisions, the reader can't help but feel reproached as well for accepting them.  And that's a pretty unusual feat of writing, in my opinion.<br /><br />The Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle proceeds, as expected, and yet some very interesting wrinkles are thrown into the mix.  I must say that I love the way the conflict is presented.  Seriously, in the face of constant mortal danger, it wouldn't even be credible to have an underage protagonist make major love-life decisions.<br /><br />Even more so than thefirst two books, Mockingjay forces the reader to ask themselves to what extent do the means justify the ends in life, and especially in warfare?  For the sake of our species, I hope everybody who reads these books put some real thought into answering that question.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that for all of the moral complexity of the book, some of the decisions in plotting and style remain overly simplistic.  The motivations of the real powers that be in the book are not convincingly fleshed out.  Technology is treated like magic, and engineers like sorcerers--pretty much par for the course in fiction.<br /><br />I think this book really deserves a 4/5, simply because more attention to plotting and detail could have made it a striking piece of literature.  Instead, it's simply \\"excellent\\" philosophically and as a page-turner.
B005CMSDLE|2.0|I wanted this to be a good movie...The story line has the potential, but the directory's delivery and end scene of the movie leaves the viewer with an almost anti-climatic build up to...nothing exciting.  Worth a redbox rental in my humble opinion, but not worth paying full price for.
B007V9YF5E|5.0|Gina Carano was fantastic and beautiful to watch in this movie.  Enjoyed the real life feeling of the movie and the fighting style.  No slow motion or recap of take downs. The story flowed well...only disappointed the movie wasn't about 30 minutes longer.  I'll look for her in future movies. Really loved her style.
B0079HLDCQ|3.0|I find David Baldacci's books very erratic in terms of quality.  For example, I enjoyed [[ASIN:1455518999 Zero Day]] but I thought that [[ASIN:0446561975 True Blue]] was appallingly bad.  The Innocent has a lot of his trademark characteristics and if you're a fan of his, you will no doubt enjoy it.  I thought it started really well, but it falls apart due to an absence of credibility that becomes laughable by the end of the book.<br /><br />The main character is a Government assassin called Will Robie.  The early chapters establish that he's a very efficient and clinical killer.  Then he gets an assignment which differs from his usual fare - a US citizen on US soil.  When he gets to the target's house, he realizes that it's a Government employee who's a solo mother with two young children.  He hesitates - and someone else shoots the target.  Realizing that he will also be targeted, he bolts for his pre-planned escape route.  Almost immediately, he crosses paths with a teenage girl who is also on the run after witnessing the death of her parents.<br /><br />Up to this point the story is gripping but almost immediately it takes an unlikely turn.  Instead of proceeding with his escape plans, Robie decides to go home, hide Julie the teenager and try to solve the mystery of her parents' deaths for her.  At the same time he is obliged to start working with the FBI to solve the murder of the very woman that he was hired to kill.  Meanwhile there appears to be somebody on the inside who is setting him up at every turn.<br /><br />The main character - an assassin called Robie - is an intriguing character, but he veers between being extremely smart and extremely slow on the uptake in a way that doesn't make sense unless it's purely to serve the plot.  Julie, the 14 year old girl who's just seen her parents murdered, also doesn't feel even remotely credible.  More concerned about keeping up her grades than grieving for her parents and able to make deductions that the grown ups miss.<br /><br />I'd give the first half of the book 4 stars, but it descends to 2 stars - averaging out at 3.  A generous 3.miss.<br /><br />I'd give the first half of the book 4 stars, but it descends to 2 stars - averaging out at 3.  A generous 3.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I guess most of the hate has to do is this came out in 2005, and fans were promised the second half of this book about a year later, well Dance with Dragons didnt come out until 6 years later.  Of the 4 I have read, I would rank this last (3,1,2,4), but it is still a really good read.  4/5.  There are some slow parts, but there are some jaw dropping moments and yeah you dont see all the characters you might like, but that is what the next book is for.  Ignore the hate of all the fan boys, it is a good read and a must if you enjoyed the first 3 books.

B000002OZY|5.0|Product was as advertised, and arrived on a timely basis in the mail.  In good shape and met all expectations.  Great deal for the price!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Best book I have read in a very long time! I agree with the complaints of the kindle price being too high, but in my opinion, this book was worth every penny and the publisher's mistake should not detract from the quality of this book.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Character development and story were superb! The main character really grows from beginning to end, quite good.<br />Good balance of action and drama. Throughout the movie I was fairly concerned for most of the characters well being; created a good connection between viewer and characters.<br />Minor nudity, alcohol consumption, drug use, serious human on human violence, some gore, adult themes and profanity makes this a 16+ film in my opinion.
B007MU85D0|3.0|I'm not as in love with this as many who've reviewed this are.  From start to finish it really is a fairly pleasing experience.  Only problem is it's incredibly one dimensional.  Many songs sound the same, and some are just downright reptitive to the point of irritation (last track especially).  I think they're on their way to forging their own identity and sound, but I don't think they've done so yet.  The singers blend well together, and all the players have talent.  I'm just not blown away.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|It's a cute/funny/entertaining compilation of many old stories. Fair amount of character development and story line gives it 4 stars.<br />Decent balance of action/drama/comedy, though in the end I think it could have benefited from more comedy.<br />Appropriate for kids 12+ due to some violence, alcohol consumption and adult themes.
1451627289|2.0|I haven't read a Stephen King novel in over 15 years.  After reading this, I wish my streak hadn't ended.  The premise is contrived, the plot lines are all over the map, the romance melodramatic, and the resolution unsatisfying.  This was one of those books that I had to force myself to finish and I was never so glad to see a book end.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Decent character development and interaction. Moves a little quickly at the end. Good balance of action and drama. Pretty good story.<br />Overall entertaining. I'd say it's good for a child 12+. Action and some human on dragon violence with some very minor alcohol consumption and tobacco use. I believe there was a little bit of crude language as well, but nothing too serious.
B007WV05GY|1.0|Huge Liam fan..... Horrible movie, even though I read the 1 reviews I refused to listen and paid the price as I watched the worst movie of the year. Just read the other 1 star reviews.they are dead (by wolves) acurate.
B0074EIQUG|4.0|Admittedly, Dr John has never been a favorite, in the past anyway. I listened to the samples on Amazon since this CD was in the #1 spot and liked it enough to spring for it as the price was right. Surprisingly good all the way though after the first listen and it gets better with each subsequent play. Four stars leaning towards five.
0312427999|2.0|I only read half the book. What led up to me stopping the book was starting nursing school, unfortunately. I will read the rest of the book soon. The problem with this book was she incorrectly correlated Hayek, Friedman and Free market economics with tyranny....which libertarians seek out to end tyranny and over-inflated government power. She also labels Friedman as a conservative... which couldn't be farther from the truth. Trying to correlate an evil dictator/general and his love of the \\"Free\\" market with a freedom-loving economist that was against authoritarianism was where this books dives too deep. There must be actual evidence that gets these people to admit the truth but Friedman was very much against what Pinochet did to his people....<br /><br />Can't understand why some people hold on to such fallacies...
0060899220|4.0|The book arrived as anticipated. It was in good condition with writing only on the first few pages. Hey, books are better than staring at an electronic device, so this purchase was just great.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|I finished this book on my kindle3, iPhone, and Kindle cloud reader, in home, office and restaurant. This kind of reading experience is unbelievable even 5 years ago. Yes indeed we are on the second half of the chess board, as the first half of this book told us in an excellent manner.<br /><br />The second half of this book tried to explore the possible solutions and guidance, but seems the intended reader of this part are those mainly government officials who know little or care little about the digital revolution... I mean the book would be better if it can give some specific advice for individuals.

B000E41MS6|5.0|My husband is from England and he just turned 60.  He recalls the premier episode of Dr. Who being drowned out by coverage of JFK's assassination.  So the BBC had to rebroadcast it before the following weekend so all the kids could catch up with buzz from the few who caught it.<br /><br />Our son follows in his dad's footsteps and loves everything Whovian.

B004E3XD1W|4.0|\\"Does it make it easier?\\"<br /><br />\\"I don't understand you.\\"<br /><br />\\"To have beautiful eyes.  Does it lighten the burden of your Grace, to know you have beautiful eyes?\\"<br /><br />\\"No, Lord Prince.  I'd happily do without both.\\"<br /><br />Welcome to the Seven Kingdoms, a world where those with eyes of two different colors are graced with unique and varied powers. From the moment these Gracelings' eyes settle into the telltale mismatched colors, they belong to the king - if their talents are useful, that is.  If a Graceling is found to be useless to the king, they are sent home to live the life of a society outcast - for no one feels they can trust the strangeness of Gracelings.<br /><br />Lady Katsa's eyes, a stunning combination of deep blue and vivid green, strike fear into the hearts of anyone close enough to see them.  For Katsa's Grace is that she is a natural killer.  Able to deal death with one blow of her hand, Katsa is utilized by her king to inflict pain and terror upon those who trespass upon his commands.  The only flaw to the king's perfect bully is her burning conscience...and the prickling idea that maybe, just maybe, she doesn't have to obey.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book that deeply emphasizes the idea of free will.  I love how Cashore portrayed her lady killer: sensitive, wild, yearning for friends, but afraid of her own power.  Then Cashore did something even more brilliant and dropped this vivid character into a rich plot that contains elements of mystery, intrigue and social revolution with a touch of romance.<br /><br />While the relationships of this novel are not strictly traditional in any sense, I completely understand why they turned out they way they did (no spoilers for you, my friends).  And I must say, I was entralled by the villain of this piece - it was the most terrifying, monstrous villain I have ever met in literature!<br /><br />So all in all, this is a beautifully written, solid plot with vivid characters that youwill love, hate and fear.  The ideals that this book introduce are interesting and thought-provoking...and the best part is, there's more to come in the series!<br /><br />What's not to love?

She missed a day or two & demanded I purchase the book so she could catch up.  For a child that hates to read anything & never picks up anything on her own, she REQUESTED this book which tells me it's engaging!  I plan on purchasing the other two books as well.

0061433047|5.0|Terry Pratchett entertains all once again. This is a great story in the Tiffany Aching series, it is written to be read by all ages. Terry is a wonderful wry storyteller, whether writing for adults or younger folks. This latest in the series has Tiffany learning some of the not so nice things the preconceptions and fear can create in the world. She must overcome changes in her life and world that would bring a lesser person to their knees. She must restore reason and peace to a family torn apart by abuse and liquor. She must do what she can to ensure that Roland ends up happy even though he must bury his father, and marry a sun starved, wispy and ever so fragile girl; who is being controlled by an intimidating countenance of a matron who happens to be her mother. While the subjects seem dark, Terry manages to keep the tale upbeat and highly entertaining. Read the book and find out about witches and life in general on the disc world. You will be amused, dismayed, tickled and above all else entertained as you read the story. Oh yes...Nac MacFeegle's are little blue fellows with a penchant for colorful language, drinking, fighting and snail rustling and those are the good qualities. They seem to find a way to be helpful throughout the story. Well, as long as your definition of helpful includes colorful language, drinking, fighting and snail rustling.

B0034G4P80|4.0|In the realm of Asgard dwell a race of aliens who inspired the Norse myths. A millennia ago, they fought a war against the frost giants, defeating them and forging an uneasy peace. When a frost giant raiding party attacks Asgard, Odin dismisses it as a one-off incident whilst his son Thor demands a warrior's response. When he disobeys his father's command and launches a counter-raid on the frost giant homeworld, Thor is stripped of his powers and exiled to Earth, leaving his brother Loki free to rise to power in Asgard...<br /><br />Of the Marvel superheroes headed for the big screen, Thor was always going to be the hardest sell. Whilst the other Marvel heroes are (mostly) humans who have gained their power through science, technology or mutations, Thor is an alien from another world who dresses up like a Lord of the Rings character, intones rather than speaks and whose answer to everything is overwhelming violence. Marvel made an excellent choice in bringing in Kenneth Branagh to direct the movie. A Shakespeare actor and director of long standing, Branagh embraces the movie's crazy concepts and over-the-top theatrics with all the relish of a director jumping head-first into A Midsummer Night's Dream and brings real flair to many of the scenes. Most notably, he does not balk with either the action sequences or the CGI-heavy scenes and pulls these off well.<br /><br />The movie's depiction of Asgard is a notable part of its success, with the realm depicted as a colourful and weird world of retrofuturistic buildings, rainbow bridges and people who have never heard the word 'camp' walking about in gleaming golden armour. The casting of its residents helps a lot with this, with Sir Anthony Hopkins bringing requisite gravitas to the role of Odin and Chris Hemsworth making for a likable Thor. Tom Hiddleston is excellent in the role of Loki, bringing charisma to what could have been a one-note villain. Idris Elba also does great work in the very small (but crucial) role ofHeimdall. As well as having the most ludicrous costume in the film (this is saying a lot) and some of the most portentous dialogue, he is also saddled with dubious contact lenses, but is never less than 100% convincing in the role. Thor's band of adventuring companions is well-played (and it's always great to see Ray 'THIRTEEN!' Stevenson on screen) but under-used. Similarly under-utilised is Colm Feore as the king of the frost giants, who is appropriately menacing but barely appears.<br /><br />For the Earth characters, Natalie Portman is also solid as Jane Foster, but her character lacks real development in the film. In fact, she degrades from an intelligent physicist into a two-dimensional love interest over its length, which is disappointing. Outside of a few decent one-liners, Kat Dennings also gets little to do as Darcy Lewis, to the point where she seems to have no point in the movie. Stellan Skarsgard is better-served as Eric Selvig (rather better than Portman, as he carries over to The Avengers) who gets a few good scenes, most notably when he and Thor get drunk in a bar. Most surprising is Jeremy Renner, who unexpectedly shows up for five minutes as an archer and then vanishes, which will likely confuse casual audiences but delight hardcore Marvel fans (as will Clark Gregg, returning from the Iron Man movies as Agent Phil Coulson).<br /><br />The film ticks along nicely with some good pacing, and the script does a good job of mixing up the Marvel universe and Norse mythology whilst trying to anchor the Earth scenes in some kind of reality. Considering the potential for the movie degenerating into a confused mess, it's impressive it turned out as cohesive as it has. Unfortunately, there are some issues. Thor losing his powers so he is actually in danger on Earth is a lazy plot device, whilst the Destroyer is not a particularly engaging enemy. There's also a dearth of good female roles, with Portman's role being predictable and Dennings's being pointless. Jaimie Alexander is better-served as Sif, but is still relegated to the supporting cast. The script also arguably does not adequately explain why Thor offers to ally with SHIELD, given that SHIELD's portrayal for most of the movie is not particularly flattering.<br /><br />Still, Thor (***½) is enjoyable in a gloriously over-the-top, bonkers way. Some underserved actors and dubious plot points notwithstanding, it's a reasonable slice of entertainment. The movie is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).
B00511ONPG|5.0|As a busy director of an internet-based nonprofit without a strong background in social media or marketing, I was looking for both a \\"crash course\\" in Facebook and Twitter for nonspecialists, and lots of practical ideas that we could put into practice right away.  This book did just that, presenting the a level of detail that is optimal for practitioners.<br /><br />The book helped us avoid the common tendency of using social media to broadcast unwanted commercial pitches.  \\"Likeable Social Media\\" is really about how to apply timeless principles of good customer relations - sincere listening, transparency, responsiveness, and generally treating customers the way you want to be treated - to the realm of Twitter and Facebook.  Mr Kerpen provides a wealth of practical examples to illustrate how these simple concepts, when applied to customer relations using modern social media platforms, can yield much greater returns than ever before possible.<br /><br />For those who need it, there is a comprehensive and up-to-date (as of early 2012) refresher guide to the main social media networks: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Foursquare, LinkedIn, weblogs, and a good selection of smaller niche social networks.  This guide goes beyond presenting the features and functionalities of the platforms to explain the intended uses of each - helping readers decide which networks to engage with, and to tailor their communications strategy appropriately for each network.<br /><br />The book presents a wealth of case studies illustrating ways corporations have used social media to build loyal and engaged customer communities, as well as mistakes to be avoided.  The examples described span a wide range of corporation types - from pharmaceutical companies to celebrities to small nonprofits - but the concepts and many of the practical applications of them are useful to any entity that wishes to develop a larger, more engaged and more loyal community of clients.<br /><br />I invested some hours ofmy valuable time to read this book, and have advised our marketing manager to do the same.  The investment was worthwhile, many times over.
1401201911|5.0|This story is intriguing and deep. It incorporates all the tropes and famous events and characters in Superman, but turns them on their head. The hopelessly idealistic Superman fits the Soviet model perfectly. Anarchist Batman is an amazing addition. Lex Luthor is an incredible pseudo-hero. The story doesn't just tell you Lex Luthor is brilliant and Superman is idealist--it shows you. Character development and plot tension are amazing. The artwork looks like it comes from 1950s Soviet propaganda. The whole thing is wonderful and I highly recommend it to anyone getting into comics.

B005LAIH9K|5.0|After many long years of waiting has finally come, and with American Pie 4: The class reunion is now the third sequel to the cult comedy cinema.<br /><br />Caveat: The wait has been worth it! Just as everyone is at ease in front of his class reunion. The stars of the past, have lost nothing.<br /><br />We have seen the movie on 04/24/2012 at Herne in the sold-out preview.<br /><br />With this 4th Part of it is the creators Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz and for the first time as Executive Producers Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott worked perfectly all the characters, and that really all the characters back into their roles back to the screen to bring .<br /><br />When the film began and now sparkled even the first song with the Universal globe on the screen, it was clear we are back in the American Pie universe.<br /><br />American Pie 4 is completely on the nostalgia factor, and this is precisely the strength of the film. We are also explained in exactly the characters so we feel as if you never left. Stifler is, as always, has not achieved much, and still lives with his mum, Finch is the coolest type on earth, Oz is a sports presenter and famous celebrity dance-off (Here is also a cool cameo by Neil Patrick Harris), Jim and Michelle are married or have a young son but your relationship seems to problem, Vicky is single and looking forward to the reunion, Heather has a devious doctor as a friend, and Kevin is now home and looks far too much television.<br /><br />The good thing about this film is that he remains true to himself and relies on nostalgia, and not tailored to the hangover generation. Just dig at the Hangover, Justin Bieber and Twilight has me very much. I'm Twilight opponents and makes Stifler down Twilight, what more could you want ;) Right here comes the boys a high school reunion just right, but you quickly find that it is just not as used to. And here is another very Decisive thickness of the film, as falls or is hereby this film. When the guys come together, it really is with immediate effect as the past. You have lost nothing, wit, charm swipes everything is back to it without ever come to below the belt. Stifler's perpetual loggerheads with Finch (problem: Stifler's mom). This time also allowed Jim and Stifler's mom with dad at the party and just the two concerns for a lot of jokes. Overall, the whole film a gag fireworks. It is an absolute fan film. All the memories are just fun part 1-3. The stories about each character was lovingly and worked out in minute detail. Even the little cameos from Milf Guy 1 and 2, Nadia, Sherman and Jessica are just great.<br /><br />Spoiler! Personally, I love the fact that Finch evolved and no longer thinks only of Stifler's mom. Stifler Gets His Revenge (A certain mother shows up) Jim and Michelle, as always, is the final. Heather and Oz have for me personally, but the most beautiful part of the whole movie. At the end of the film for any fan or a reference to part 5 is provided. End spoiler! For me, the soundtrack is a very important point. Part 4 has a very good soundtrack, but he can not reach the other soundtracks of 1-3.<br /><br />The acting was just as benefits are very good in Parts 1-3 and even Tara Reid (Vicky Lathum) can sometimes points here ;). At the end remains to say who'd like to have long loud laugh in this film is just right. If you could start with the parts 1-3 can probably nothing will not do anything with this part. Although everyone has to try it yourself ;).<br /><br />Who was the trailer is already well surprised as the movie itself is still a lot better. The film holds more than it promises, and I was not disappointed as the Years of a fan but I think with such a high level to please even a 5th Part will follow. I could continue writing long hours but then I would make the film a synopsis ;) American Pie 1 9/10 American Pie 2 10/10 American Pie 3 9/10 American Pie 4 9/10 Be sure to sit up after the credits remainimportant ;) American Pie 4 gets me 9/10 but only in comparison to Part 1-3 smooth or he would get 10/10. That's just American Pie brute with a heart.<br /><br />Im From Germany and i Love the American Pie Movies

Also our daughter is way behind like early season 3 so she can watch 4 whenever she catches up since it will always be available to us.  Bravo I scream, bravo!
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|*edited* This movie is wwritten well in my opinion but maybe would have been better produced if they would have gotten a real martial arts choreographer. For a pro muay thai and mma female fighter to star in it, they should have had much better fight scenes although the grappling scenes aren't bad. The only thing that saves this movie remotely at all is that Gina Carano is so pretty and smoking hot. I would not call her a \\"beauty queen\\" in any way but there is just something about her that is so attractive and very womanly and tough. She has  a very pretty face. But on the quality of this movie it reminded me of some kind of mission impossible copy or Angelina Jolie spoof for an upcoming action beauty.There is a lot of action, suspense, fighting, stunts and like I said decent plot, but altogether I think it would have been a magnifiscent movie if they got someone who knew how to use the mixed martial arts bombshell, like a female steven seagal/chuck \\"chick\\" norris/, or jean-claud. In some areas I want to give this movie 5 stars and in others one star so I'll end up with 3 stars or 4 if in kind spirits. NOt bad for her \\"blockbuster\\" movie debut..at least that I've ever seen her in(i know she's been in others but i've never heard of them or seen them). Gina carano is stunning though. A starlett that keeps your attention lol. I would fail this movie in terms of giving it a passing grade, but all in all considered it was not a bad movie and not a bad breakthrough performance for her. All the other supporting actors were tremendous! B+. She also reminds me or kind of looks like rachel leigh cook. I was a little disppointed we didn't get to see more of her athletic \\"form.\\" I also was very shocked and astounded to learn of her extensive fighting background because until I looked her up on wikipedia I though this woman never fought in her life and never acted in any movie. To my suprise she both has acted and starred in many movies, and was a pro muay thai fighter and then a mma fighter as well as an american gladiator (crush) lol. I then changed my whole view to bad fight scene producers and choreographers who didn't bring there \\"A\\" game. If they can make angelina jolie look good, they definitely can make an undefeated (i cancel her fight with santos due to steroids) mma fighter look fabulous. I am definitely looking forward to her in future roles when they will give her better fight scenes and more close-ups of how beautiful she is!!! As in my title she was voted maxims #16 top 100 hottest women for a reason and all the guys go haywire for her in this cinematic action ride! GOdbless!<br />Took a lot of research and time on this so whatever to you haters who think this isn't helpful. I watched it 3 times in 1 days so I know somewhat what's up!<br /><br />~shauns movie reviewa mma fighter as well as an american gladiator (crush) lol.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|While not a fast paced action thriller, \\"Take Shelter\\" is quite a \\"make you think\\" movie. What happens to Curtis LaForche and his family could happen to anyone. The film earns praise for not showing mental illness in a negative light and for reminding us that it pays to be prepared.
B001USHRCK|5.0|Received the order in a couple days when we were expecting it to take more then 3 weeks. The set seems like it came from Lego directly, a free tote was included. 100 percent satisfied
6304696515|4.0|The shipping was quick, the movie is wonderful and I will continue to use this seller and Amazon. This is a very difficult movie to rent, because no one carries it, so I had to buy it! Thanks Amazon!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|First class service from AMAZON,and the drama is a fabulous watch,im well pleased.I was told about this from my son,and i watched it with my niece (adult) and it was fantastic,cant wait for the second season.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|SvZ is a repetitive defense style game where you control a samurai who slays countless demons using a slew of special abilities.  I had a few problems loading some levels on my Motorola Xoom, but only when a wifi network wasn't available.<br />The game rewards you with silver coins and pachinko balls to gain items, new units, and more coins.<br />The thing that kept this from getting five stars is at a certain point you are forced to level up using real money' or stay at about lvl five for each ability.  Free+ should be optional IMO and I shouldn't have to spend money to get higher ranks in stuff.<br />Lastly I had an issue where I found two bonus units.  I used these for a few rights, then went to work.  later the units became unavailable again, as if I never found them.  this was also very frustrating.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|Wow...??? I can't believe all the high ratings on this. These folks must have been watching a different movie. The CGI - was so fake looking  - it was like watching Team Jacob chasing Liam through the woods.  It was boring, lack of any good story line, one of Liam's worst movies, - maybe 1 and 1/2 stars. Fortunately, I was wearing my 3 wolf moon T-shirt and I felt like imprinting with the wolves up until I actually saw one on the big screen. I felt like someone stole my wolf soul from me. My amber eyes turned red. I thought \\"brothers - I am embarassed for our wolf nation\\". (a similar feeling I experienced when I first saw Jacob translate into a wolf). I was really pulling for my wolf brothers to munch on Liam and get \\"taken\\" back to the little cubs at the wolf lair, partially alive, ...Here are some Neeson kibbles and bits my little cublings.  And then I began to howl when Liam strapped on mini liquor bottles - the anguish was too much.  I began to go into a furious wolf rage at the thought of being sliced with broken mini's.  I started urinating in every corner of the theater - I wasn't marking my terrority - I was just too lazy to run on all fours to the restroom.  Fortunately I looked down and saw my 3 wolf moon T-shirt and my sanity was restored, but not with the movie. It blew chunks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a pretty well written ya novel. It is very fast paced, hard to put down. As a dystopian book, it is of course not a happy story, but is very engaging. Unlike the other 2 books, this one *COULD* be read as a stand alone, but of course is best as the series. I would say the subject matter is too mature for very young teens (children being forced to murder children for adult's pleasure) but would be ok for older teens and adults. It is well written enough for adults to enjoy as well.
B0074JODP8|5.0|I read a recent review of Joe Bonamassa and this person said that Joe should stick to other song writers' material!  Are you out of your mind?  I hope Joe pays no attention to some of these reviewers and sticks to his own agenda which seems to be creating more and more beautiful, creative, ever-expanding musical styles and sounds.  In particular, \\"Slow Train\\" and \\"Dust Bowl\\" have the earmark of Joe's ever growing creative work.  I, for one, am hooked for the long haul and look forward to where Joe will be going next.  It's blues and beyond--wherever you want to lead us, Joe!  The experience with Joe's music is new for me.  It's been mesmerizing!  Love you, Joe!  I'm a jazz, some R&B and pop music, Carlos Santana, and classical music girl.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I've built dozens of gaming systems and this is the best motherboard I've owned.  I am highly impressed by the following:<br /><br />-Solid construction/design<br />-Easy to use/intuitive graphical BIOS with mouse support<br />-Extremely fast boot time<br /><br />I paired it with the i7 3770k overclocked to 4.2ghz and live with no regrets.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought the book was a fun read. I enjoyed it a lot. Some of the story line was a little silly but I found it very entertaining. The scenes between Ana and Christian were very steamy! I also read book II and III, I had to find out how this saga ended. I thought book II was entertaining, some story plot was a little redundant. I thought book III was mostly silly. The end was satisfying however.
B0037KMHRY|3.0|I love me sum Daft, but I wasn't expecting this. The huge orchestral score was actually a bit off-putting. Don't get me wrong, they did a hell of a job at scoring for the movie, but I was hoping for something more, um... Daft Punky.<br /><br />I do like the album, but Daft Punk are no John Williams or Danny Elfman. The soundtrack seems a bit generic in places. Nothing original or \\"Daft-y\\" happens until the later half of the album. In the later half, things get more interesting. There are ornamentations of cool 8-bit & Techno layered on top of the big orchestral pieces.<br /><br />It's a great \\"Soundtrack Album,\\" but just an ok \\"Daft Punk\\" album. I was hoping for more of DP's originality, electronica, and remixes of the original score. But what I got was a blend of Daft and overly-dramatic Disney soundtrack. They did it very well, and the effort was admirable. I just wish it was, well... better.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|I loved this book. It felt like being the proverbial fly on the wall that we have all wished to be at one time or in one situation or another. When it was over I kept clicking my right thumb on my KindleFire to go to the next page and no matter how many times I said \\"NO!\\" or tapped it did not produce another page! I definitely did not want this one to end. What a treat! Sam :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a lot of fun .this is a good way to pass the time.my whole family loves to play.best game to come out in a while.
B00003CWRX|5.0|I agree with all the favorable reviews here.  \\"The Insider\\" is a very well-made and well-acted movie of great moral significance.  It shows how two powerful institutions -- Big Business and the Big Media -- can create terrible moral dilemmas for people of principle.<br /><br />I have just started reading Sibel Edmonds's new book \\"Classified Woman\\".  I wish Michael Mann would do a film of this book.  It also shows a whistleblower and moral dilemmas, but in an area of even greater importance: the federal government and 9/11.  In fact, I am writing this review in the hope that it will prompt somebody who has contact with Michael Mann to suggest making a movie of Edmonds's book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great fun addictive game...challenging to unlock all games but you can always buy games for small amounts of virtual cash
B0016CP1QY|5.0|The other reviews do a great job of describing the music on this wonderful album; \\"quietly soulful\\" ... \\"contemplative\\" ... I agree; it's all that and more. Terry Callier possesses a gorgeous voice and the material on this album perfectly suits his style. The songs have a gentle (mellow is too lame a word in this case), soulful, and atmospheric quality to them. Callier's voice floats and soothes the listener. But don't think that these songs will put you to sleep. There is also has a power and vibrancy to this music that demands your attention. You might even call it inspirational. But in the end, this is just gorgeous, beautiful music.
B007CKNX28|4.0|First solo release from one of Nashville's newest rock icons & member of White Stripes, Dead<br />  Weather & the Raconteurs.  This is gritty, potent, varied rock `n' roll with a laid-back bluesy heart<br />  and White's strangely urgent & addictive trademark vocals.  The songs have a sort of energetic,<br />  nervous, edgy White Stripes feel--but with a less predictable, more diverse & earthy approach.<br />  There's a Zeppelin-esque folk rock influence that creeps in now & then, and an overall classic<br />  roots-rock mood.  Other sonic surprises, from theatrical drama to tango piano rhythms and<br />  handclap gospel/funk, flair up throughout.  Occasional wild & spastic guitar leads, and more<br />  dominant piano parts are also apparent.  Sometimes reminds me of Jack Oblivian, Billy Childish,<br />  Dan Auerbach/Black Keys...with a bit of Led Zeppelin & Kevin Coyne.  Overall, his most far-<br />  reaching and singularly expressive release to date, but not necessarily his best.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|this app is really great and fun and i love it, but the sad thing was, i could only play it for a day! I opened it up the day after I bought it and it said i needed more space to play, I did hat opened it op again and I got a black screen and it closed on me. hopefully the app maker will resolve this.
1846555248|4.0|When I read this book, I did get a little frustrated always having to flip back and remember what was happening in what year, but after getting through the whole book, I don't think it's necessary to do so. It only adds to the dreamlike quality that the author was shooting for, as dreams often start and stop and loop back on themselves in an unpredictable manner. Probably the best way to enjoy this book is kick back, drink in, and don't question the destination...in the same way that you would wander Le Cirque des Rêves.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If I had to read \\"my inner goddess\\", \\"my sub conscious\\", \\"my sex\\", \\"panties\\", \\"orange juice\\", \\"pools deep in my belly\\" ONE MORE TIME I was literally about to start pulling my hair out
B0055SWM08|5.0|it is great on the kindle fire thingy.  a calm game that can be challenging but will not wear your thumbs out.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|why does everybody say this game is hard I have it on my evo 4g and my tablet and I get 300 games all the time its simple just wish you could more challenging characters that can bowl a 300 against me its too easy
B00479SVBU|5.0|I am in love with my Soundfly Aux player. Since my MP3 player recently died, I have been trying to decide which new one to purchase, but when I saw this USB stick player, I decided to give it a try. I love the freedom of being able to switch between my music and audio book USB drives within an instant. The remote is nice so I can skip ahead while driving and the folders/skipping controls are fairly easy to maneuver. My only wish is that the display could detach from the electrical socket so I could read the display better since my cigarette lighter is down low in my car and my eyes aren't very good at long distances. One tip... if you are listening to an audio book or podcast, don't forget to bookmark BEFORE you turn off the car. This system does allow for skipping ahead, but it's a pain when you can just use the bookmark feature. No more skipping cd's or energy sucking audio devices! This product is a dream come true for commuters.
0061537969|5.0|this book was really inspirational and teaches you a lot about life, and not just dog life but human life as well. it was an amazing story and i had no idea what i was getting myself into. i couldn't put the book down. it became a problem when i almost missed my stop on the bus.
0062124293|5.0|I AM A FEMINIST!<br /><br />I never thought I would say those words aloud. Feminist. It's a word that conjures up visions of anarchy and short hair, but Caitlin helped me understand it. Not only is this book informative and right on, it's also a laugh riot. I can't believe that Caitlin had the courage to display her growing up faux pas to the world. Things like periods and what to call your private parts when you're too young to know what they even do... I've never read a book that was so open about these subjects. My favorite part is when she described changing from a child to a woman as becoming a baby vending machine. You must read this book to get her brilliant sense of humor.<br /><br />I recommend this book for any woman. I think it should be standard issue for girls coming of age.
B00785P2QC|3.0|its ok but it takes long to earn credits and when u run out of energy it takes even longer to get it back
B003UESJH4|5.0|I had fallen in love with this movie when I had first watched it. I had kept putting off actually buying it for I thought I wouldn't still love it after the fifth time watching it. I was completely wrong and I still love it now. It came extreamly fast and I was actually surprised to see it in my mailbox so soon. The whole thing was just perfect and I would buy from here again.
0345803485|1.0|\\"Oh my!!\\" Getting through this book was like fingernails on a chalkboard! No plot, horrible characters, ridiculous dialogue... it's all been said over many Amazon reviews. One thing that really bugged me was when they replied to each other's emails. They never just hit \\"reply\\"!! They started a new email with a insanely stupid subject line. Who does that!?! And I was embarrassed sitting there by myself every time she heard her \\"inner goddess\\". I can't believe this book was actually published!<br />This book was so wrong and so bad on so many levels. I have been told that book #2 is better, but I just can't get myself to go there. Laters, baby!
1612130283|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this book.  I had heard all the hype, and when it finally arrived at my doorstep, I devoured it!  I read it while flying to San Francisco, and it made the usually long flight from Little Rock to SF enjoyable!  All the \\"Twihards\\" can have their Edward, give me Christian Grey any day!  The book is HOT!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|awesome. now i dont have to use my itouch. only thing i  seem to notice is that the drawing isnt as smooth sometimes, and messes my drawing up. idk if there is a way to calibrate my touchscreen but other than that. i love this app a lot.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|WOW!!  From the first chord of FLOATING BRIDGE to the last note of ROLLING STONE I was blown away by this album.  This album spotlights Gregg's immense talent in the genres of Blues, Roots Rock and Americana.  Producer/musician T-Bone Burnett and the impeccable musicians caught GA in his glory.  If it weren't for this album going head to head with REVELATOR (Tedeschi Trucks Band) for the GRAMMY in the Blues category, this album surely would have won, hands down. Fans of the above genres must have this in their collections.
0345803507|5.0|Never, ever completed a book until I bagan reading The Trilogy: 50 Shades of Grey. I completed this book in a little over a week... You'd be crazy not to read it.

B00723NWJE|3.0|Norah Jones  a decade ago seemed to be in the running for the updated  Sade  ring. had a smooth torch sound and feeling. since then she has  showcased a versatility musically speaking that has taken her into other styles of music and ranges. however she kept the same painful snetiments in her lyrical content and it works, except musically she hasn't really evolved to the next level fully.  to me She is longing to have a Linda Ronstadt meets Etta James record that truly says this here is all the goods.<br /><br />this album showcases her musician skills and she is very talented, problem is, after a while the songs just don't go anywhere and while the album is well Produced and carefully paced, she isn't taken anywhere new.<br /><br />personally I'd like to hear Norah Jones do a Dolly parton of \\"here you come again\\" or a Olivia Newton John cut in the country/Pop flavor.<br /><br />i think she isn't getting the right material that compliments her range and also she is missing that money track.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game I loved it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so!!!
B007IE4DSG|5.0|George Harrison, simple, humble, brilliant and definitely emotional.  You get George Harrison in your face and in your ears, up close and personal and that's just the way we like it.  It's like a 1x1 with George Harrison.  You will be hard put to find something to surpass this.  It's fresh and natural, like George in all his natural beauty.  This collection makes the Inner Light shine on the fortunate listeners.<br /><br />George had a very distinctive guitar style and his voice was deep and soothing.  Those fortunate enough to have enjoyed these on bootleg collections can now have some of these songs made accessible.  The remastering and purity is superb and you will feel what George Harrison was all about - love.  George, as I've said many times was created by love; born into love; surrounded by love; created songs that sparked and reinforced love and his final directive was \\"love one another.\\"  George Harrison's music is a loving influence, an auditory embrace.  I can't recommend this one highly enough.
B0067QPVD2|4.0|This movie gets better every time I watch it and I believe in time it will reach a cult status. Not as much as JC's The Thing but after some time has passed it will be rediscovered like JC's version was. His took a while to find it's fans and so will this.<br /><br />I think they did a great job given the constraints. There are things I wish they had done different. I would have much rather it been all in Norwegian with subtitles or at the very least, no Americas as characters, However, any problems I have with the film are all subjective. It's a very good movie.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the series overall but this book was my least favorite.  Hang in there though, the third book is better.

B0018CMJSU|5.0|I love the Godfather trilogy! The Godfather movies and Goodfellas are my favorite gangster movies. So this is what I have to say about this dvd set of the Coppola Restoration.  I just absolutely can't believe how clean the Godfather movies look compared to how they looked when each of them premeired. The Godfather I and II looked like they were made yesterday because There are absolutely no scratches, blemishes, discoloration or color fading. The Godfather III looks really wonderful to considering it's not as old as the first two. The restoration must have been really expensive to make the movies look this good. The bonus features are really good to, even though they were passed over from the previous dvd edition. The one thing that could have been good, though, was if they put back the original Paramount logos from the 1970s for the  Godfather I and II, but I don't think it really matters, because the movies look nice and clear anyways.  Like I said, the restoration the the Godfather trilogy is wonderful! I wish all old movies between 1920 and 1990 look as nice as this restoration of the Godfather classics!
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is a must read, wheni was reading this book I could not put it down. I also bought the next book Point of Retreat and loved it.

B00001ODGR|4.0|I bought this DVD in order to replace a VHS I still have since late 90's. The sound is far better comparing to the VHS and the image, of course, is upgraded to the possible level, since it is a show recorded a long time ago. There are some interesting bonuses, including an interview with Tommy Shaw. For Styx fans and Classic Rock aficionados.
0451232577|5.0|I'm a little surprised by the vehement negative reviews of this book. I liked \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" but personally find the backdrop of WWI much more interesting than the building of a cathedral. Make no mistake, this is not great literature, but I thought it was great entertainment. Follet's books do not offer great writing or deep, complex characters; they're completely plot driven with a dollop of sex and some blood. I listened to this book while training for a long (500 mile) hike, and it passed the time in much the same way as a beach book does. The reader in the Audible version is brilliant; I certainly didn't realize that the book is 1000 pages, the time passed so quickly. I for one am looking forward to Book 2.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|love it. graphics are great, story is interesting and fun. I would say a great buy for the price. I love it.

0345803485|5.0|How can anyone not LOVE Christian Grey. I'm not into the bondage etc. but when he realizes Ana isnt either he never forces anything on her. He always asks if shes sure she want to do anything first. I think he is so sweet and caring towards her. I love how his character evolves. Everything they do she agrees to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I ordered my book online via my kindle. It appeared on my list of books with in a minute. I had no problems with any of the technology. The book itself is amazing.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Hands down, best solitare app I've found so far! I really like that you can play \\"left handed\\" or \\"right handed\\" and I also like that you can lock the orientation in case you decide to play lying on your side. Being able to change the bg of the cards and board is a nice plus and I find the card faces and numbers the most visually pleasing of the solitare apps I've tried. Oh, and if you're lazy like me, the tap-to-move feature is SwEeEt!! ^-^v<br /><br />I've only found one con. If you're playing for best total score, this may be something to consider... Once you \\"click\\" on a card, no matter how much you try to drag your finger off the screen to pretend you didn't \\"click\\" on it, it will move. You can use the \\"undo\\" button but it'll cost you a \\"move\\" which adds points to your total score. (It makes you not get frivolously click-happy during your games)<br /><br />K, maybe two cons...the app is so awsome, I forgot to mention the adds that pop up between almost every game...it becomes so much of a habit to skip them that when they don't show up, I have to think twice about why my routine felt different. Haha! But I still think it's worth the hastle. It's the price to be paid for a free app I suppose.

As far as I have read, the works inside this book are great for anyone seeking more than just a movie from the Sherlock Holmes universe.<br /><br />On the Kindle, however, there are some issues, most which would be expected at such a low price. There are no chapter stops, meaning that it is not possible to flip between chapters (and entire books) with the use of the directional pad or arrows. This doesn't seem like too great of an issue, but it prevents you from quickly finding a mark within the book, and reduces the convenience of reading on the Kindle. Also, there are no page numbers. For someone who likes to track their progress as they read through a book, this, once again, can be a minor inconvenience. Lastly, there are a few typos throughout the book, some of which consist of easy, spell-check preventable  errors that could have been easily avoided. These don't pose too great of a barrier to the fluency of the book, however.<br /><br />Regardless of these issues, however, the price and size of the book more than make up for them. \\"THE COMPLETE SHERLOCK HOLMES\\" as it is (boldly) described, is very thorough, containing most anything a Doyle fan would want when reading his Sherlock Holmes series.<br /><br />Overall, if you're searching for an inexpensive and generally good experience, this book is an obvious choice. The errors in the book should not turn you away, and I recommend it even to someone not planning to read the entire volume. In any case, if you want a perfectly sound book, more expensive options are almost always available.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|so fun think about it in my sleep! it makes me want to cook in my own kitchen. I also play fashion and bakery and farm story too.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|Great Movie, great service and people, DVD is good, it was a great gift to give there happy and so am I with everything THANKS
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Friend said that book was better than movie. Did not find if any better, enjoyed both equally well. I am movie nut more than reader.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|The movie was good but I won't say great,I did like the American movie better,not being dubbed.Would I rent it again,probablily not,but it was worth seeing.
B001LM1456|3.0|I got my Hulk dose, but heck the first one was better for me. Most people are split about the two movies but this movie just did'nt hold the same excitement as the first one did.  I think the actors were better in the first one even though Edward was'nt to bad.<br /><br />Overall still a descent movie.
0439023491|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition, nicely packaged and exactly as expected. Thank you for the great service! This book is hot, so I was glad to get it at a fair price.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put this down. Read all three books within a few days. You just had to find out what happened next. Read it again for second time just as good as first.Hot,STEAMY,jaw dropping. Leaves you wanting more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you suspect you've figured out what will happen next ... turn the page. And then the next. Once you've started you'll find that can't stop. I can't wait to read all about what's happening in #40! Read this. All of it.<br />Some have said that this would be a great movie. I disagree. It needs a mini-series for justice to be served. 120 minutes just won't do.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kiddos and I love to play these games to see who can get the most unlocked... must have for keeping the kidlets happy.
0739383280|5.0|I started out with a love/hate relationship with this book. The main character Poppy got herself into some completely ridiculous and painful-to-watch situations because she did some stupid things and then lied about them, which drove me nuts. On the other hand, there was something just delightful about the story which made me want to keep listening despite my frustration with the situation and the characters. I partly credit this to the wonderful reader, Jayne Entwistle, who did a superb job, not just with Poppy's voice but with the other characters, as well. I am not 100% sure I would have kept up with the book if it hadn't been for her narration and I am SO glad that I DID keep with the book, as despite my initial frustration and uncertainty, I ended up really, really liking it. The book really hit its stride a little more than halfway through at which point I became totally enamored with the characters and felt totally invested in what happened to them. If you want to read a book where you will laugh out loud a lot (and possibly also groan and cringe a few times), I definitely recommend this book. And if there is any way you can listen to it on audio, don't miss the opportunity.
0439023513|3.0|I found the books a little plodding, but overall I enjoyed the storyline, and first book the most.  Book two had exhausted the most interesting aspects of the storyline, and book three is irritating. It is one thing to suspend disbelief over muttations, Hunger Games, and the bizarre Capital...but to believe the President is completely occupied with bringing down a 17 year old girl?  : )  Really?  Anyway, I do appreciate the imaginative future world, and its unflinching examination of cruelty, as well as honor.  My main complaint is that the story gets pretty thin by book three.
0747586837|5.0|The media is full of bias and never tells the truth.  For example, what is the truth in the Middle East... what is really going on?  The banking elite run the country and the media in America and the world.  The same goes with food.  Yet, Michael Pollan tells it exactly how it is, a real look at what we eat.  This book changed my life by changing my outlook.  It's a must read for anyone who wants to experience change.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|The album starts with Grenade - a wonderful song - great beat, strong vocals and pleasant sound.  As I listen to the disc, I'm impressed how different each song is.<br /><br />The Lazy Song reminds me of a hot, humid summer day.  Marry You is fun.  Every song is a winner.  It reminds me of a 2010's version of Michael Jackson mixed with Prince and a little Al Green thrown in.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|It was easy to order and easy to download to kindle. And its a great book. very uplifting. Smooth sailing all the way.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|My fustration with this book cannot be written in words. Though I will try my best.<br /><br /> More than once, more than ten times actually, while reading through this book, I wanted to unch somebody. Wring their neck and make blood spurt out their nose and mouth. That is not even close to how angry I was with his book. I'm actually being nice. Giving this book two stars. But that is only because I'm glad she ended it between the two character at the end.<br /><br /> First off I did not even recognize this book existed. My friend introduced it to me and I saw the amont of fame this book had, and after two weeks or so, I brought it.<br /> And I regret it.<br /><br /> Why?! I just dont understand. Why would someone want smeone else to boss them around and use them as a sex slave like they're a helpless piece of garbage. Why?!!! I know I'm being whiny and complaining but I will get on about why I do not lie this book and why it such a bad… really there's no words for it. It's just plain BAD. (And I'm seriously considering changing and going to the one star reveiwes). But hold on. I'll get on with that. Just let me complain for a while.<br /><br /> I wanted to curse (something I dont do but slips out at least once through this book), throw my kindle at a wall, choke somoene, run a chainsaw through the heads of these characters. I'm not crazy or mental… really. But this book brought out anger in me. Maybe I'm judging but  I find it wrong. Just wrong to have that kind of sexual relationship.<br /><br /> Now for the review.<br /><br /> So pretty much the hero, Christian, (if you could even call him a &#34;hero&#34;) is a sex crazed freak who has girls sign this contract and makes them his sex slave. Absoloutely repulsive. Not acceptable.<br /><br /> Anastsia Steele (the dumb heroine) agrees to this,though she does not sign the contract, and has sex with him… over and over and over and OVER again. And you know something? She was a VIRGIN before she met him. Then allthe sudden she's become this sex crased freak too who gets aroused at the thought of him spanking her?! Really?!!!<br /><br /> I hate Twilight. Absoloutely hate it. Worst movies ever and I will never read the books. But this… it's beyond my hate for Twilight. Though there are simalirities. The heroines are both dumb, dull, over-trying… did I mention stupid? The heros are supposed to be attractive, loved by readers.<br /><br /> No.<br /> No.<br /><br /> If you want me to love and respect heros, never write them as practically sexually abuser or dull vampire who can't utter a word without whispering.<br /><br /> I felt happy that she finally made the write decision at the end and left him. Though the author could've elebarorated on that (LIKE SHE DID IN THE SEX SCENES!:( ]<br /><br /> One thing: I'm a bossy person myself. I like to be leader. But , sheesh, Christian that is taking it too far. Who orders someone to enter a room naked and immidately kneel on knees and wait until subject is adresses? Hell no. I would've get that whip and beat him myself if that was me.<br /><br /> I am not saying peole cannot like this book. Its fine. But from my point its just damned fustrating. Will not buy another book. Too expensive for such poor work. Sorry to say.

1609611543|4.0|Have been wheat free for a month now.  Interestingly enough, I don't crave any breads/crackers, etc., this from someone who could easily chow down half a box of Cheezits in one sitting.  I do get hungry sometimes, but keep turkey breast and chicken chunks in the refrigerator to snack on which immediately curbs my appetite. I'm diligent about drinking 64 ounces of water every day, too.  I've only lost seven pounds, but here's the amazing and fantastic news! In December, my cholesterol was 211 - it is now 167. My triglycerides in December was 233 - that number has dropped to 72!  I was astounded when I got the report from my doctor.  I do love candy, and still eat one or two pieces every day.  I keep a supply of hard candy in the house, and just those couple pieces satisfies me.<br /><br />Was a little doubtful at first since an official study hadn't been done on this theory, but after seeing the results of my blood tests, I'm sold.  I'm a little disappointed the weight didn't pour off as I hoped and as the book predicted, but I have faith it will come off.<br /><br />June 6, 2012 Update - have been wheat free for over two months now.  Have dropped 15 pounds and went down a pants size.  Was concerned about what to eat when going out to dinner, but most restaurants will prepare a chicken breast and some steamed vegetables.  Otherwise, the salads are a good choice.  Feel great, my tummy is definitely flatter, and never crave wheat products!  This is amazing!
B0064T6LV8|2.0|this gamebreally needs an update BAD.when I got this game I thought it was not goingvto be so blurey but it was and this game force closes a lot that's why I rated this app 2 stars
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I'll keep it short- I liked the first two books, but this one was too horrific, and (spoiler alert) I don't find massacring children entertaining. Two stars, but one word- yuck.

0142000671|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" by John Steinbeck is a book about dreams and shattered dreams.  Many schools have this book as part of their curriculum which is great.<br /><br />This is a rather short book.  John Steinbeck wrote it in such a way that you can imagine the two main characters life before the book begins.  Also, (and perhaps tragically) you can imagine life after the book concludes.<br /><br />Dreams, depression, companionship, work, and trust resonates through the main characters.<br /><br />Wonderful classic.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B007ZD17XO|5.0|great update to the franchise purchase immediately . loves the first two, but I like this one more the one minute levels are super compared to the marathon levels from tom2
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The key to any great adaptation of a book is the primary character.  In this case, Kiera Knightley was born to play the part of Elizabeth Bennett.  Her natural beauty and tough demeanor makes her a duplicate of this character.<br /><br />There have been several adaptations of the book by Jane Austen.  Some have been quite long.  This version is an intriguing and engaging version.  One aspect that makes this version lively and entertaining are the various camera angles.  You actually feel that you are there and can hear every conversation being spoken.  You have that feel that you are \\"gliding around\\" as you hear Elizabeth talking to her best friend or Mr. Darcy secretly confiding to Charles Bingley his thoughts on the Bennetts.<br /><br />Great adaptation.  The ending may offend some die-hard fans of Jane Austen because...Well, you have to watch the movie.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B004JK61K0|2.0|the send button is not visible when composing which makes the email app not too smart. if anything this button and all buttons should be visible.
0897502027|5.0|\\"The Tao of Jeet Kune Do\\" is more about the philosophical and mental aspect of Bruce Lee than the physical component.  That is what makes this book a classic and worth reading.<br /><br />Jeet Kune Do is probably the best form of martial arts for fighting and self-defense.  It does not focus on forms or formalities.<br /><br />Although this book has a lot of philosophical discussions about martial arts, it has a lot of exercises to develop speed and strength.  It is interesting to know that Bruce Lee advocated weight training before it was widely accepted in the martial arts community.  Also, he used isometrics creatively (using a towel for resistance) and often to develop speed.<br /><br />Fantastic book for fans of Bruce Lee.  Great book on Jeet Kune Do.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The folio cover is truly lightweight and easy to install. It is a natural compliment to the stylishness of the Kindle Fire and will be an outstanding investment insofar as protection of the screen is concerned. I am so glad I got it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Thought it was going to be a gory read and almost lost interest. Boy am I glad I kept reading. Recommend it for everyone.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Don't waste your money on this book! Bought the book out of curiosity to see what all the hype was about. Big waste of my money and time. There's no story here just dumb sexual senarios. Will never buy another book that the media has suggested or that E.L. James has written. I hope they don't make a movie out of this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so cool I cant stop playing it. There are so many games on one app and the great thing about this app is that it is all FREE can you belive it its ALL FREE!!!! I would so recomend it for you if you need a break from work or something like that. HOPE YOU ENJOY IT!!!!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|My niece wanted to get this game because she loves the movie.  I was a bit skepticalbecause I thought it was going to be like the zoo game, but once we started playing I had a different perspective.  This one is more interacting. My niece loves the movie,  so she loves this game..... it is exelent to keep her busy.
B007YYY4WK|5.0|It was subtle but so creative, just the like the pitch that won Mr. Heinz Exec over.Love the wife of the Heinz guy. She is lovely and fun to watch.The second to last scene of everyone surrounded by nice things but looking deeply troubled for obvious reasons was like a touching painting. Everyone made such a big deal about what Sally saw. I thought Pete flirting with Sally before dinner and the hypocritical, spiteful way Megan's parents treated each other was worse. Are Peggy and Joan becoming friends ? It was nice to see Joan giving Peggy pointers for her date. My mom has a little gold pencil from this era with her birthstone like Joan had around her neck. She got it for her birthday from an aunt. Alot of good lines esp between Mona, Sally and a friend from the past. Wish Stan would accidently fall out a window. He is like sand in my swimsuit and brings nothing to the show. Otherwise A++++
B0055V6EZE|3.0|Enunciate the blues!  I'm sorry Mr. Laurie, but when you cover a blues song you shouldn't be able to understand the words. `Winin' Boy Blues' I first heard from an old Janis Joplin recording, I couldn't understand a dang thing she said AND THAT'S THE POINT! That's not to say all of the songs are bad, `Tipitina' is my favorite as well as `They're Red Hot' and `St. James Infirmary'.  It shows that Mr. Laurie is having a blast making this album and that shows through.  Let there be another album and may it be even better than his freshman first!
B007IFZU5A|5.0|I have been a fan of Paradise Lost since first hearing \\"True Belief\\" back in 1994.  I love most of the albums they have put out with the exception of \\"Believe in Nothing\\".  Yes I am a fan of \\"Host\\" but prefer them to sound more like they do here on \\"Tragic Idol\\".  It really paid off for these guys to revisit \\"Draconian Times\\" on their recent tour and for Gregor to get his death metal fix from Vallenfyre.  This album is easily their best in years and is really a return to the sound from \\"Shades Of God\\" through \\"Draconian Times\\" era of the band.  Fans should eat this up and new drummer Adrian Erlandsson (At The Gates, Cradle Of Filth) whose drumming is the best the band has had in years as well.  He really knows how to play well no matter how heavy or soft the music is.  The music is amazing and very emotional.  It takes multiple listens to fully sink in just how amazing this album is.  I loved their last album \\"Faith Divides Us, Death Unites Us\\" but find this new album to be so much better.  This is a true return to form and I think any fan of the band should love this album from start to finish.
0446572993|5.0|Baldacci's The Innocent works on several levels.<br />When  I  read the initial synopsis of this book I thought there was absolutely no way it would work.  I mean a stone cold assassin and a 14 year old girl duo?  I immediately flashed on Rooster Cogburn and Mattie Ross in True Grit:  There it did work.  Well, my hat is off to Dave Baldacci for pulling it off.  Well done sir, well done!<br />David Baldacci's The Innocent works on several levels.  There is the procedural assassin level where Will Robie demonstrates his talents as America's foremost assassin.  There is the precocious 14 year old runaway Julie Getty who witnesses her parents brutal murder then flees to find out why.  There is FBI Special Agent By-The-Book Nicole Vance who ends up believing in Will Robie.  There is the \\"Blue Man\\" who is a leader in a very secret, clandestine federal agency (CIA), and then there is solitary Robie's love interest Annie Lambert who captivates his heart.  All work together to intensify the mystery of WHO is out to kill Will Robie and 14 year old Julie Getty?  This is a very complex mystery with more twists and turns than the LA freeway.  Layers upon layers like a ripe odiferous onion that when peeled lead to more layers.  Don't try and figure it all out just sit back and enjoy a great Baldacci read.<br />No gratuitous language, sex or violence.  A  Baldacci literary trademark.  Just good crisp writing.  Good procedural stuff for the clandestine buff.<br />Excellent character development on all levels.  This is the second Baldacci novel in a row where he has returned to his earlier clandestine/law enforcement procedural roots.  This is where Mr. Baldacci shines and he should stick to this literary format.  There are a lot of characters, but Mr. Baldacci is able to keep everything in proper perspective and moving at a rapid reading clip.  There are no dead spaces in this exciting novel so when you start reading be ready to keep reading.<br />Strong recommend for The Innocent.Like his prior novel Zero Day, Mr. Baldacci has returned to his earlier literary style of crisp writing and strong procedural espionage action.  Very reminiscent of Lee Child (Jack Reacher), Vince Flynn (Mitch Rapp), Barry Eisler (John Rain) and Robert Crais (Joe Pike).  Regardless of some of the other reviews, this is an excellent action mystery read.  I know the thesis is a bit weird but remember my comparison to True Grit:  Trust me The Innocent works on several levels.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This is a great CD by the new up and coming country music artist Scotty McCreert. He has a wonderfull smooth voice and a winning personality. I love all the songs on the Cd Clear As Day, but my favorite song is I Love You This Big. Can't wait for his next release.  Judy

B006M7JCC2|4.0|I thought this was a good read - from a very down-to-earth, regular woman. Rather than a new-ager with lots of woo-woo (not that there's anything wrong with that...lol), Anita seems grounded in her experiences and enthusiastic to share her profound adventure with the world. Though it tended, to me, to go on a bit toward the end of the book, Anita's story was well worth the time invested to read from cover to cover. .

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Classic Marvel icons woven into a very fun ride. I've always been a big fan of Thor and really liked the Iron Man movies so i had big expectations going into this one...<br /><br />First a big \\"Hi Heroes\\" to Stan Lee & the folks at Marvel / Disney for pulling off a thrilling ride. Director Joss Whedon who co-wrote this film did an outstanding job of - highlighting each of the main characters as solos as well as pairing many of the key players. Make no mistake this is a summer slugfest but it is peppered with a solid villain \\"Loki\\" as played by Tom Hiddleston and more importantly solid comic humor. With snarky Tony Stark leading the way to some brilliant sight gags (not to be confused by FX which was current state of the art, but nothing really new).<br /><br />The Hulk is the Hulk you were hoping for... As played by Mark Ruffalo (w/ the help of CGI for the Hulk). He brought humility and empathy to Dr. Bruce Banner and Kicked A-- as the Hulk, bringing some of the films funniest moments to unexpected life. The 3rd time is the charm at least for the Hulk.<br /><br />Thor - as stated is my favorite and i feel like he finally gets his due, between the Thor movie and his prominent role in the Avengers. If you have seen any of the trailers you already know Loki is the bad guy so you have the associated Gods and Monsters with the magic, twisted logic, sibling rivalry, betrayal and more slugging.<br /><br />Captian America - was his rolling, tumbling, machine gun toting leader of the pack who bring the diverse group together.<br /><br />Iron Man is Robert Downey Jr, so if you liked the Iron Man movie you know what to expect, enjoy...<br /><br />Also - You must sit through the credits to see the wonderful executed final \\"splash page\\" and the next villain up.<br /><br />All in all a fan-boys delight.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Excellent content and extras I felt a real connection to the time and experience. It made me want to see the WWI exhibit for these men end there animals.

0812550706|5.0|Just kidding about the title.  This book is awesome though and I highly recommend it to anyone who has never read sci-fi or hasn't read anything good yet.  This is a bucket list book, one everyone should read before they meet their maker.  So go out and buy it and get ready for great adventure!

0812550757|5.0|This book was an interesting change in direction from Enders Game.  The story is not very action packed, but it continues where Ender's Game left off and satisfies those of use who wanted more! Go buy this one as well as the first book and you will not be disappointed. (the other two books in the quartet are so-so. book 3 being like book 2 only weirder and boring)
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I have been very impressed with these headphones, of course my ears may not know that there is anything better out there, but they are lightyears beyond the Bose headphones I had before that cost quite a bit more.<br /><br />Good bass response, but not overdone. The response seems quick and accurate, and the highs are fairly crisp. Overall you can still tell it is a pair of headphones, and inherently can't give the same range and response that a full-range system can, but for what they are and the price they are, it's hard to go wrong.<br /><br />Oh, and if you ever have watched the TV show Frasier, he wears the same headphones in his 'studio'.

B0072GPQNG|3.0|I almost bought the DVD.  But thankfully they had it on PPV.  I watched it.  If I were 8 or stoned I would have fully enjoyed it. But is was so full of shtick and formula it was not funny. It was totally unrealistic.  No way all that could have happened and if it did that horse would have been dead like 5 times.  I love animal movies but this would require me to destroy a bunch of brain cells to enjoy.  To the movie producers I say start paying writers,  good writers.  Special effects and appealing to our love of animals is not enough.  Get us a decent damn plot.  This could have been so much more.  It just was too far out there.  I gave it a 3 because the scenes and effects and some of the acting was very good.  If I had to grade it on the plot it would be a 1.

Can't wait for the next book. :D

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I love this book, the whole trilogy. Yes there are BDSM elements which is pretty educational and yes outside my comfort zone but it provides a point of interest and is really part of the whole story. What I love about the trilogy is the storyline, the romance between Anastasia and Christian. So passionate! So heartbreaking, exhilarating. It brings to mind Romeo & Juliette, Sandy & Danny in Grease, Abby & Travis in Beautiful Disaster and characteristics from other really good romance books I've read.<br /><br />I love James' portrayal of Christian and the character development. The different shades in his character portrays him as a complex but very interesting person and what an alpha with just the right amount of tormented vulnerability that could only be brought out and healed by the right girl - Anastasia. I love Ana's character portrayal. I've read other reviews where she's seen as wimpy but I never saw her that way. She portrayed just how a sweet innocent overwhelmed girl would be but her inner strength is shown as we progress through the trilogies. Contrary to what a lot of people think, a woman's strength and power lies in her ability to nurture, compassion, and keeping her integrity regardless of what happens to her and around her while at the same time keeping her grace. A woman doesn't have to act aggressive and assertive like a man to show their strength. She can be self possessed and gracious and smart while being kind with steel inside. This is how Ana captivated Christian. The sex can be hot but without all those other qualities, the relationship will not last.<br /><br />Anyway I just love their story and looking forward to the movie! I just hope they'll have the right actors for the film that portrays the characterization in the books to a T.
B001E45XT4|2.0|These headphones are hot to wear. After 20 minutes, they need to come off. They sound great, but only for a short time.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I agree with almost all of the reviews. I'm just so disappointed that the main characters from books 1-3 have been given such short shrift. I mean - come on already - at least tie up a few plot lines before inundating readers with new characters that come and go randomly through the last two books. I found myself going back and forth trying to figure out who the heck these people were when they popped up hundreds of pages later and no sooner do you figure it out than they disappear again completely. I get it, he's going to milk this since the series came out, but PLEASE resolve at least a few of the sub-plots about the random characters and get back to the meat of the first three books. I'm not opposed to continuing the story by any means, but it drove me nuts reading books four and five with basically NO resolution whatsoever. After reading all five books I just can't help thinking that the only things I know for sure is that Ned's dead, Jaime lost a hand and \\"half a hundred\\" is one of GRRM's favorite phrases - among others that we can all repeat by rote...all together now: \\"about as useful as nipples on a breastplate\\" - which has just occurred to me could pretty much describe the screwy timelines and general frustration in reading these last two books. I could go on, but I'll let George do that - if he ever gets around to it.

B0035MNSPY|5.0|I hadn't really paid much attention to Fear Factory since I stopped listening to their first couple of albums many years ago.  When I heard they had a new album on the way, I decided to give them another listen by purchasing this album.  I am a Fear Factory fan once again.  This album is heavy.  Every track on this album absolutely kills.  Even the more melodic \\"Final Exit\\" carries a punch.  If you're like me and haven't listened to Fear Factory recently, I recommend giving this album a listen.
0547258305|3.0|I haven't read many young adult novels since growing out of the target age range, but on occasion one catches my attention--The Hunger Games because of its enormous popularity, and then Graceling, because of the impassioned debate over whether it's a good example of feminism. How could I possibly not read the book that inspired that conversation?<br /><br />Graceling turned out to be a lot of fun. The protagonist, 17-year-old Katsa, has a variety of superhero-like powers, and since one of them is killing people, the king (her uncle) has been using her as his thug. But even before the book begins, Katsa starts fighting back by creating a secret organization to help people in need. The plot involves her doing basically what you would expect: breaking free of her uncle, learning to make friends, falling in love, fighting an evil king. This isn't new, and ordinarily I'm leery of superhero characters, but here Katsa's powers make the book great fun: I didn't realize how much I would enjoy a story about a heroine who's never in fear for her own physical safety. We get to enjoy the crazy challenges the story sets for her, from fighting mountain lions to crossing infamous mountain passes in the dead of winter, but the real tension comes from her internal struggles and her efforts to protect other characters. It's--dare I say--empowering. And the characters are endearing; the book made me smile several times.<br /><br />But (of course there's a but), despite my enjoyment, Graceling is not a book I'm likely to recommend to other adult fantasy readers. The characterization, while adequate, is not especially deep; nor is the writing anything special. The worldbuilding is incredibly thin: just another quasi-medieval setting. Even the country names are things like Wester, Middluns and Estill, conveniently corresponding to their placement on the map. We don't even know if this world has a religion. The only hint of culture is in the Lienids' rings (which are a cool idea). And the faux old-fashioned dialogue sounds unnatural: people say things like \\"Whatever shall I do?\\" and \\"I'm ever so slightly dizzy\\" non-ironically.<br /><br />I did like the romance, although I was only mildly invested; the author surprised me by not opting for endless misunderstandings and stupid fights. Unlike many other readers, I think the relationship works well for a YA book. The relationship is founded more on shared goals than staring into each other's eyes. It's nice to see a love interest who doesn't feel threatened by his girlfriend's powers, nor does he have a misguided need to protect her. Instead he says things like \\"I'd like you see you defend yourself for real, fight someone to the death, for it would be a thrilling sight\\"--which is pretty cool (although the phrasing makes me cringe a little). And then the controversial bits: yes, there's sex; parents considering this book for young kids might want to consider that, but it's realistic and occurs at the logical point in the relationship, which I appreciate. And I liked that, despite falling in love, Katsa still doesn't want marriage or kids. Many real people don't either, and so it's always good to see variety in fiction. Besides, she's still a teenager, and lives in a society where women are the legal property of their husbands! (The backlash doesn't make much sense to me.)<br /><br />Finally, on whether this book is good feminism: you've probably guessed that I think it is. Some reviewers interpret it as saying you can't be both feminine and a strong woman, which I too would find problematic, but I see nothing like that here. Katsa cuts her hair short and despises dresses, which is perfectly valid, but she doesn't look down on women who make other choices. She criticizes society for not teaching women self-defense, but that's not an attack on the women themselves, whom she wants to help. Seems pretty feminist to me.<br /><br />At any rate, while I'm not sure I'll read the sequel, this was a fun book and Isee why its intended audience seems to love it. If I had a 13-year-old niece, I'd definitely give it to her.see why its intended audience seems to love it. If I had a 13-year-old niece, I'd definitely give it to her.

B000001FAO|5.0|A neighbor friend bought this lp back in the late 60s and I just obtained it on cd. I must say I still enjoy this lp just as much as I did 45 years ago. I consider this to be Eric Clapton at his best. He was most likely the most influential guitarist of his time, which is obvious from hearing these tunes. So much of our rock is fashioned after what you hear on this. I always thought jack Bruce was the best singer in the world, too bad we did not hear much from Him after the break-up of the Cream. Ginger Baker's drumming is second to none, at least in 1967. Their heads pictured on the front jacket resembles Mount Rushmore, surely the musical equivalent to the monument. They are definitely the \\"Cream\\" of the crop, aptly named.<br />My favorite tracks are SWLABR, Strange Brew and Outside Woman Blues.

B002IKLNW4|4.0|Billy Bryson is a very gifted travel writer, almost a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to a writer, for he follows his curiosities when he writes and his works display his vast wealth of knowledge.  Such is the case with \\"The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America.\\"  Perhaps this is an inappropriate subtitle for there is not necessarily a ton of insight into small towns, but there certainly is a lot of insight into what makes America and its citizens tick.  It is part travelogue, part memoir, part rant, part stand-up act.  It is a laugh-out-loud read that doesn't seem too dated even though it was written over twenty years ago.<br /><br />Bryson, an Iowa native, returns home from his adopted land of England, and sets off on a journey to discover the perfect American small town, the kind that you used to see on classic TV shows.  What he finds is that no such place actually exists, but there are amalgams that can be made and a few towns that come pretty darn close.  He begins his trip heading east, describing his hotel stops, the troubles of the road, and the strange humans he encounters.  Perhaps the funniest parts of his travels are Bryson's attempt to capture regional dialect in print form - not an easy task, but one this author manages with aplomb.  After a short pit stop at home in Iowa, Bryson heads west, hoping to hit some of the highlights that he never got to see on those vacations his father would drag his family on.<br /><br />After a while, Bryson's narrative can get repetitive and why he chooses to visit certain places in certain states is a little befuddling.  Yet he mixes these visits - like Colonial Williamsburg, the Grand Canyon, and Gettysburg - wit interesting trivia and other information.  Throughout the course of this travelogue Bryson employs his trademark sarcastic wit, a turn off for some I am certain, but one I greatly appreciate.  Bryson laments what has happened to his homeland, how small towns have been destroyed by strip malls and fast food restaurants, but more so by how so few seem to care about this change.  \\"The Lost Continent\\" is certainly not Bryson's best work, but it is an intriguing look at America by an ex-pat son who could see it like no one else.ast food restaurants, but more so by how so few seem to care about this change.  \\"The Lost Continent\\" is certainly not Bryson's best work, but it is an intriguing look at America by an ex-pat son who could see it like no one else.

B002NJWHHA|4.0|I've read all the books, and I still enjoyed it. I thought all parts were cast well, except for Galbatorix..John Malkovich is not who I envisioned..just the way he talks doesn't work. Special effects on Saphira are great. Wish it had been done better so they would make more. It's one of those movies you see one time and you don't need to see it again.
1400069289|1.0|With that said, this would be the one book I want to get rid of and possibly burn, but I won't because at the end of the day it's still a book.<br /><br />This book reminds of the kind of pseudo-science that is spilled on to the pages of a Malcolm Gladwell book. The beginning is about a lady that says \\"I've got to quit smoking\\" then she quits. That's it no explanation, no breakdown of how she accomplished this task. She just stopped. Next is a story about an old guy that has to live the actual 50 first dates movie minus Rob Sheinder. There was a part that was interesting about the brain so I stuck with the book. Then, this guy goes on to claim that NOBODY brushed their teeth before the 1900s and that the first toothpaste ever invented was \\"Pepsodent\\". A quick Wikipedia check proved that this was not true, toothpaste can be traced back to the Romans and \\"Pepsodent\\" really wasn't that big until much later in the 1900s. Next chapter and this is where I had to stop because it became ridicoulus, I'm convinced Febreeze paid a nice piece of change to have this book written. For an entire chapter, one that is longer than the rest before, he gives anecdotes about people crying that they stink and how Febreeze, has the power to rid the stench of SKUNK. Skunk ,really guy, Febreeze barely works when my 2 year old uses the toilet and your trying to convince me it can eliminate the smell of skunk. Come On! The chapter after that began like a Malcolm Gladwell chapter so I couldn't force my brain to store this type of garbage. Man I've never regretted reading a book but this is the one. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this book. If your looking for something to help you break routine and get off your butt and accomplish what you want go read \\"The War of Art\\" by Steven Pressfield. Pressfield gets a little kooky towards the end but once you get to the end you won't care. Trust me I used to always want to be a writer and look at me now I wrote this review.

I can't say it was ALL that bad.  I did do a double-take there toward the end because I thought I had somehow skipped a few hundred pages all at once.  Anyone that has read this knows what I mean by that.  Overall, though, it was an awesome series.  3 books in one week.  For me, that means GREAT!!!

I returned it as well.<br />I own it on vinyl; purchased when it was released in the 70's.<br />Not a good value for me, yet I repeat a great collection of Stones tunes for any one who doesn't already have the cuts in their library.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|To be honest, I liked the original version more and found it even more disturbing than the American one.  All that being said, Daniel Craig was great in this version and the film was still utterly fascinating...even though, having seen all three other movies and read the books, I knew what was coming.<br /><br />The changes made from the original version to this one actually tightened up the movie some and made it less slow in places.  Still, it retained the chilling edge and mystery, as well as the shock value, of the story as it is unraveled.  It is beautifully filmed, which makes the violence all the more shocking.<br /><br />The actress who plays Lisbet in this version is good, but for some (including myself) the original actress is going to forever be the one and only \\"girl with the dragon tattoo.\\"  The American version of Lisbet was slightly more readable and sympathetic than in the original movie, which made her more easy to like, but things sometimes seemed a touch too wrapped-up in this one as opposed to the rough edges of both the character and first movie.  Part of the allure of Lisbet is her sharp, prickly, and essentially unlikeable exterior and in this characterization that outer shell was much more shallow.<br /><br />I will buy this version, however, because it is well-done(if very hard to watch in places, be warned this is in no way, shape, or form a happy American story), but will definitely be keeping the original trilogy.  I would also go see the second movie if they go ahead and make it.<br /><br />If you have not seen the original movie, then you will probably like this one just fine.  If it's your cup of tea in the first place, of course.
B0012NIF56|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers.\\"<br /><br />  To its credit, \\"Superman II\\" continues the exploration of and challenges to both the \\"Super\\" and \\"man\\" aspects of the legendary Kryptonian.  His \\"Super\\" part must confront three utterly ruthless, rampaging Kryptonian villains he inadvertently freed from the Phantom Zone limbo with the bomb he flung from the Eiffel Tower during the beginning of the film.  Fueled by powers equal to (and maybe even surpassing) Superman's own, and by vengeance against the \\"son of our jailer\\", Jor-el, General Zod, Ursa, and Non prove quite a nasty handful.  Complicating Superman's job, however, is an emotional and psychological dilemma facing his \\"man\\" persona, something I call a \\"Spiderman Existential Moment\\".<br /><br />  Every so often in the Spiderman comics (and in the recent movies), Peter Parker has agonizing debates about whether he should continue as Spiderman, because playing hero denies him a normal life and constantly puts his friends and loved ones in danger.  Apparently but unexpectedly, Superman as soft-spoken \\"bumbler\\" Clark Kent feels the same doubt about his superhero life.  \\"Superman II\\" scores points for devoting equal time to Clark Kent, but in my opinion does not fully prepare us for his renunciation of his powers for love.  Nothing leads us to suspect that he is dissatisfied or burdened by his superhero responsibilities, or by having to support a secret identity.  We are asked to take it for granted.  We are also asked to accept the fact that Superman/Clark Kent has harbored such  secret, burning desire to be with Lois Lane for a long time.  Ok, ok, he did reverse time in the first \\"Superman\\" to resurrect her from the dead.  But, and I know I might get attacked for saying this, why would anyone give up his superpowers to be with Lois Lane?<br /><br />  I guess I was never a Lois Lane fan.  Superficially, Lois is presented as an intrepid, daring, celebrated newspaper reporter.  However, she's always making reckless, foolhardy mistakes that put her in danger from which only Superman can save her.  Lois can also be breezingly thoughtless and cruel to fellow employees like Jimmy Olsen - and the unassuming Clark especially.  And as others have said from time immemorial, if she is such a perceptive reporter, why did it take her so long to notice that Superman and Clark are one and the same?  I guess Superman/Clark has a special kind of emotional, as well as physical, X-ray vision that sees something in Lois we mere mortals just can't.<br /><br />  Well anyway, as the Kryptonian trio ravage the Earth, Superman whisks Lois off to his Fortress of Solitude, uses the crystal shards to de-power himself, and has an un-PC sexual dalliance with Ms. Lane at his Arctic home.  Soon, they somehow leave the Fortress (it must have taken days without his powers) without freezing to death, find a station wagon and drive back to Metropolis.  During a pit stop at a diner, a humiliating brawl with a bully makes Clark have second thoughts about his sacrifice.  Clark has another \\"Spiderman\\" moment when he finally learns that the Kryptonian trio may soon take over, and that with great power comes great responsibilities.  Better get those powers back.  But wait, Jor-El had warned him that the superpower loss was irrevocable.  Except when it isn't.  The green crystal is the key.  Clark has to trudge back thousands of freezing miles with the crystal back to the Fortress to get his mojo back.  Just in time too, because the Kryptonian trio has invaded Metropolis.<br /><br />  You know the rest: the Kryptonians have a destructive battle, the villians capture Lois, Superman retreats to his Fortress to lure the villains away and spare Metropolis more devastation, Superman tricks the villains into losing their powers, the villains fall into an icy crevasse (awaiting a sequal that never came), Superman saves Lois and gives her the \\"forgetfulness kiss\\", Superman promises the President of the United States that he will never desert his post again, the end.<br /><br />  Now, now, I liked the movie very much, in spite of some inconsistencies and improbabilities (due to the checkered development history reported by other posters), because of both the dynamic action and character development, plus the interspersions of humor, drama, and even horror.  But \\"Superman II\\" is special because it humanizes the demigod from another world and, even though it may surprise and annoy us, he is as capable of making hasty, impulsive, romantic choices as any of us.  Fortunately for the world, Superman/Clark Kent learns from his mistakes.<br /><br />  Wait, I forgot.  Lois and newly re-powered Clark revisit the diner and meet the bully again.  Clark shoves the bully against a pinball machine and pays for the damage.  Sweet payback.  NOW it's the end.ill never desert his post again, the end.<br /><br />  Now, now, I liked the movie very much, in spite of some inconsistencies and improbabilities (due to the checkered development history reported by other posters), because of both the dynamic action and character development, plus the interspersions of humor, drama, and even horror.

B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Gina Carano plays an agent working for a private contractor who really kicks butt when she finds out she's been betrayed. The first action scene in the diner is shocking at first, the viewer is alarmed that a woman is being brutalized in such force in public with just a couple feeble attempts to help by the other patrons...but keep watching and you'll see she's not going to take it! She returns the brutality in triple force. Michael Fassbender and Ewen McGregor are favorites of mine and I also enjoyed their performance. In my opinion, the movie slowed down a tad too much in some areas, but in the words of the talented screenwriter Nick Kazan (and probably several others) 'Perfection is the Enemy of Art'. Just because I didn't get the pace in a couple areas doesn't mean it doesn't fit. Overall, I think it's a great action film and the fight scenes are done really well (made me wince more than once). It's great to see a woman putting the bad guys in their place. Gina Carano...you go girl!
0345803485|1.0|Even though E.L. James has gone on record as saying her book was not well-written, I decided because of the media swoon over the financial success of this trilogy I had to read at least the first book to see what all the fuss was about. Having read the Anne Rice Sleeping Beauty series of erotica as well as the original literary shocker \\"The Story of O\\" by Anonymous, I was unafraid of the sexual content and was very curious to see how this author would handle the topic of sex and bondage. Sadly,Ms. James is correct that it is not well written and I didn't find it erotic at all. That was disappointing. I kept  hoping for \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" to get better since so many women (bored suburban housewives?) seem to be so turned on by this trilogy of novels. Tip to aspiring writers: write about what you know. When you don't, it comes out laughable. But then again, Ms. James is laughing all the way to the bank. Any readers interested in this topic might want to check out \\"The Story of O\\". It is the most frightening, believable, disturbing book that sneaks up on your libido and grabs it by the, well, you know, \\"down there\\". Jeez!

B000CNESU8|5.0|Last night I watched the \\"Network\\" DVD. It was excellent, as expected. Well, it won four Academy Awards so that was a clue that I might enjoy it, and I did. The acting was excellent. I felt as if I was in a real-life situation. bizarre though it was. The movie was a bit of a parody of big-time news networks, but I got the idea that it wasn't too far from the truth. Well, this movie came out of the mid-seventies and, at that time, almost all news came out and was managed by the three big networks (in this case four). You know, I no longer watch network news and haven't in the past couple decades. I guess I was just mad as h... and wasn't going to take it anymore, or something like that.<br /><br />In any case, the movie chronicled the life of a big network news room and their interactions with all about them. It explored the standards that big news programing was under and all the threats (internal and external) to those standards. It was interesting. I hadn't thought much about it, I just left network news when cable news and internet news became available and I haven't looked back. If this movie was at all realistic, it was a wise move on my part. It's good  viewing. Well, what else can I say. This movie already has over 200 Amazon reviews and many of them are excellent. Okay, the movie is over three decades old, but it's aged rather gracefully.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Beside that fact that this book is deeply disturbing on so many levels, it is also clearly written by someone who has never written before and has perhaps never talked to someone in their 20's. What 20-something-year-old do you know who uses the term \\"Oh my!\\"? I found it really hard to suspend belief with the characterization of Christian and Ana.  Both use a vernacular that represents the author's generation at the very least--the author is probably in her 50's.<br /><br /> I saw the author interviewed.  She said that she just decided on a whim to write this book after reading the Twilight series.  Imagine my shock when she acknowledged that she had never written a book before!  It shows.  I guess if you can figure out how to deliver a commercial product, you don't have to write well.  You just open a bank account.  The writing in Twilight is light years beyond the writing in this book.<br /><br />I couldn't finish reading it.  I might have been able to overlook the problems with the writing if it weren't for the fact that as I read I found myself somewhere I didn't want to go.  The world of S&M is a sad and depressing place.  Apparently, Christian is wracked with problems resulting from child abuse.  It's not about of love.  It's about mental illness and damaged souls pursuing more damage.  I can only speak for myself, but I find life hard enough as it is without steeping myself in the brokenness underlying this story.<br /><br />In my heart, I feel it's a sad commentary on our society that this series is a runaway bestseller.

0345803485|1.0|I honestly thought this was going to be a thriller book, based on the short oneline reviews in New York Times best Seller list (that right there should have been my first clue!)  390 pages of sex, leaving nothing to the imagination.  I am not a prude and I enjoy sexual encounters in my books, but this was TOO much.  Are we sure EL James is a female?  I actually read the whole book, thinking that the end would have a reason, a solution, SOMETHING!  To make matters worse, I am currently reading the second book in the trilogy and it is just as bad.<br />I do not recommend these books to anyone!  I especially do not recommend these books to single women.  This is just too sick and demeaning to women.  THANK GOODNESS I DID NOT PAY FOR THE BOOKS.  Got you there EL.. you are not worth purchasing!
0345803485|1.0|first off.. i give it a 1 star ONLY cuz you have to give it a star to write a review.<br /><br />secondly, it will kill your sex life.<br /><br />my review.<br /><br />this is full of spoilers.. so if you havent read it and wanna.. beat it<br /><br />i finished 3 books in 3 days.<br /><br />the first one.<br /><br />DISGUSTING. it had me SO SO riled up that i couldnt sleep the whole night! it was not so much the bondage and rough sex.. it was the zilch self esteem the female character had... its true.. no amounts of education can help you grow your brain if you have no confidence in yourself. or self worth for that matter!<br /><br />2nd book<br /><br />better.. cuz we get into vanilla love (regular sex and no bondage)... but the problem persists. ana (the female character) is a sorry piece of a woman. i felt like slapping her like MAD! on repeat! she can handle everyone else BUT her man.<br /><br />3rd book<br /><br />so much sex and none of it did anything for me. the storyline was much better in this part. or atleast we actually got to read bout somethign other than vaginas, penis, and ooo and aahs.<br /><br />my review on the whole series.<br /><br />horrible. the author did a pretty good job of making the reader believe that if you stay in an abusive (consented) relationship long enough, you can change the abuser into a loving soul. its what they show in the movies... and its disgusting! and a lie!<br /><br />abuse here is not physical violence.. its the rough sex and the bondage etc... she is strictly against it but wants to please her man... so gives in time and time again.. sometimes enjoying sometimes not... and the in the end making peace with it and learns to deal with it making herself believe .. ya ya.. i like this.<br /><br />this is ONE confused woman... who wants to please her man. thats it.. at any cost.<br /><br />and this part didnt sit right with me throughout the novel<br /><br />and what a materialistic whore! oh my god i wanted the character to come to life so i could slap her on repeat! argghhhhhh........<br /><br />you can word it however you want it.. but you got paid for sex.. thats it!<br /><br />and dont even get me started on the guy. honestly? this is how you got rich and grew a business worth more than a billion dollars? sex?<br /><br />cuz tahts all teh guy does.. have sex! oh no.. wait.. he does go to work.. only to leave it plenty of times cuz sweet dear ****ed up ana has gotten into trouble.<br /><br />its hard to understand for a smart reader.. he is told to be so busy and so hard to reach and so busy ... yet.. the fool is never at work cuz he is too busy banging up the whore.. !<br /><br />the emails they send each other.. their convos.. jesus they reak of highschool stupidity! and this guy got rich apparently, by using his brains? MHMMMMMMMMMMM<br /><br />other than that... if its shown its ok to be in a confusing relationship full of stuff you dont wanna do, for a girl, to please.. to try to change her lover<br /><br />for a guy .. the author makes it feel like its ok that the woman is a possession for the man. he feels the need to own her.. (thus the bondage love). the author just makes it seem like awwwww sooooo sweetttt..... he loves me so much that he wants to protect me from all evil ... ok for some parts its true.. he does cuz there is someone out to get both him and her... but this need to control and OWN is shwon from book 1 where the situation is in the clear. nothing has happened story wise.<br /><br />so you have a low in self esteem (only where it concerns the relationship), confused and willing to please, female<br /><br />and an overprotective, i need to own you, you are my asset, overbearing male.<br /><br />and of course since this is a fairytale.. al comes to end well when the princess is able to tame the ways of the beast and make him human again.. and they have lovely children.<br /><br />BS!<br /><br />i really really really hope girls and even women who read this aresmart... cuz the way the author idealizes the negetives likes bondage and giving in even if you dont wanna just to please your man.. and how its ok to have your man contorl your every single lil move...and you can change any person with demons inside into a loving sould... it could be very easy for a vulnerable female to believe this is how it is and its ok. romantisizing such characterisitics is digusting to say the least.<br /><br />i squirmed everytime the guy OWNED her ass and felt so stupid everytime the girl gave into the guy's dark side... even though she would always say *no more* once they were done.. but would always go back for more when ready.<br /><br />and lastly.. NO ONE has that much sex! honestly.. NO ONE! not james bond.. not austin powers.. not the casanova that lives upstairs.. not even the neighbours dog! NO ONE. at times it felt like kuttay billio ke baray mein per rahi hu mien.. rather than humans!<br /><br />and lastly lastly.. this book did NOTHIGN for me sex wise. i think i was so disgusted and off put by the author and the characters.. it just killed it for me..<br /><br />women.. read it just for the sex. if you havent done it in a billion yrs... or if you are single. but please. leave your brains out of it.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I guess a lot of disappointed viewers were expecting another \\"Bourne\\" movie (they won't have to wait long), which is unfortunate. Complaining that \\"Haywire\\" isn't an action movie is like complaining that [[ASIN:0783229402 Out of Sight]] isn't a bank heist movie. (And weird, considering that a lot of people went inexplicably gaga over [[ASIN:B0064NTZQ2 Drive]], which had very little actual driving, and even less coherence.)<br /><br />For my part, I loved it. It was about 90% of what I watch a Steven Soderbergh movie for: a great cast (admittedly Gina Carano isn't \\"great,\\" but she's perfectly serviceable in the role and more than holds her own against the men); interesting music (by David Holmes, who did [[ASIN:B001EBYM5I Ocean's Eleven]] among many others; I bought the [[ASIN:B00A95SK9Y soundtrack]] immediately); gorgeous cinematography; and a love of cinema that shows in every frame. The weakest point for me was the writing. Even though it was written by Lem Dobbs, who wrote the beautifully laconic [[ASIN:B000PGACWA The Limey]], which I loved, the dialog (what little of it there was) didn't really crackle. Needed more David Mamet or Tony Gilroy. Based on the previews, I thought Carano was going to look great but perform horribly as an actress, but she really impressed me. Admittedly, this might have a lot to do with her voice being looped by Laura San Giacomo (or so the rumor goes). Her line delivery in [[ASIN:B008JFUOWM Fast & Furious 6]] was pretty bad. Still, she kicks butt way more convincingly than Angelina.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|SvZ is a fun and elegantly styled game.  glu forces you to spend real money to upgrade some aspects but overall you can still enjoy the game w/o spending cash, as I have.  the game lags on older/lower end devices, such as my original incredible but does not interfere with most of game play.  this is a fun time waster and I would recommend it to my friends.  considering my largest complaint is the lack of in game audio adjustment it is a solid effort from glu
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|Although this looked, by all indications, to be just another empty cash-in on a familiar franchise from thirty years ago, in reality it's a completely self-aware semi-satire that's funnier than it has any right to be. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum take their roles about as seriously as the film does itself (read: not at all) but still manage to develop a weird sort of chemistry as a helplessly stupid, modernized odd couple. It's to be expected that they'll stumble and bumble their way to the head of a major criminal organization. But rather than trying in vain to avoid the cliches inherent with such a familiar premise, Jump Street completely embraces them and actually dictates its decision to do so. Maybe the best example of this is in Nick Offerman's all-too-brief cameo, as he stares down the lens and deadpans a monologue about recycling thin gimmicks from the past. For storyline purposes, he's talking about the department resuscitating the Jump Street undercover program, but it doesn't take a grin or a wink to know what he's really on about. He grins and winks anyway. As a parody of everything from its genre to its audience, this is pointedly effective stuff. It struggles to develop into anything more serious, but that's not really the point.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday, he has read all the books in the series that are out and he did get a chance to watch all the episodes one weekend that our cable provider was having a free HBO event, but he was itching to rewatch them. I had never seen the show nor read the books. He put the first disc in as soon as he got done getting the wrapping off, and I've got to say, I'm hooked now. I cannot wait for the person he lent the book to get it back to us so I can start it, and I also can't wait for the next season to be out!
0062068423|5.0|I downloaded this book onto my Kindle in December after my stepdad had recommended the author knowing how much I loved The girl with the dragon tattoo trilogy.  I can kick myself for waiting until the end of April to finally get round to reading it!  I LOVED this book!  It was a great weekend read, gripping with wonderful storytelling.  I won't go into describing the plot because other reviewers have gone into detail on that.  What I will say is if you like a damn good story, well-told, with twists and turns, then this novel is for you.  Intricate yet easy-to-read.  I particularly loved Nesbo's ability to create pictures in my head.  His visual imagery is excellent.  Highly recommended for those who love well-written, well-thought out, complex thrillers.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So, the book is not the greatest literary work of all time.  Who cares?!  It's a fun, steamy read that gets the blood pumping.  I will admit there was one point I felt like I may stop reading, it got a little too creepy-violent, but I stayed with it and it turned out it was a plot point.  It moved the story forward. Women have come so far, why should we be afraid of reading something that is explicitly sexual.  We like sex too.  It won't make you more intelligent by reading it, despite the extreme vocabulary used by the author, but its fun.  And it seems to me, people need a little more fun in there lives.  Personally, I like the second book the best, but you NEED to read the first book to get to the second.  Just enjoy it...that's all it was meant for.

0439023521|4.0|This series is one that it is hard to put down and one that I had no idea was out there until the advertisments starting showing up on my TV for the movie. Boy I am glad I took the time to read the series first. Now my next date will be to see the movie.<br /><br />Katniss annoys me at first with her I am better than you because I held this family together while you fell apart attitude at the beginning but soon this grows on me but also is helpful to her in the games. She is a character we watch flint in and out of awareness of her feelings because she is not sure what to do but we also watch her come alive with Peeta.<br /><br />Gale and Katniss were lifelong buddies after the passing of both their fathers in a mine accident. I was immediately drawn to Gale because he has a likeable personality from the beginning.<br /><br />Peeta who is a lifesaver no matter how you look at it. Katniss ends up being the one who saves Peeta but ultimately he saves her from a hole that she probably had no idea ever exsisted. I loved how they through in the love story between these two. It plays very well in the games and helps them both. He loves her and will do anything for her and that is something amazing despite they have never really had a full conversation prior to the games.<br /><br />Great read and in no time you have the series read! Next stop the movies!

0765316994|4.0|This isn't a Star Trek parody.  I know it looks like one based on the title and plot summary.  But it is a much deeper book than that- and induces several \\"wait, what?\\" moments when you are reading it.  I will not spoil them as they are a big part of the appeal of the book. Again, its worth mentioning: AVOID SPOILERS!<br /><br />Despite the action packed plotting, the book is often a high-level rumination on science fiction, writing in general and even the meaning and purpose of a life.  That said, the book does have quite a bit of appeal for fans of the author's prior works as well.  The writing is typical Scalzi, light, witty, fast moving and breezy.  At the same time, the last third of the book introduces some rather heavy concepts through two independent but related stories which start after the main story's conclusion.<br /><br />If you are new to the author, do yourself a favor and go read [[ASIN:0765348276 Old Man's War]] first.  If you have read that series, and like Scalzi as an author you will certainly enjoy this book.  While I enjoyed the book, there were a few issues.  While the plot is highly inventive and fast moving, at times I felt like I was reading the output of a very high level writing workshop.  Also, Scalzi seems to write many of the characters the exact same way, and the \\"light, witty banter\\" approach sometimes comes off like the author showing off and not how anyone actually talks or acts.<br /><br />But those are minor concerns, for what turns out to be a quick enjoyable read with a surprisingly deep finish.  Recommended.

0439023513|1.0|...and a miss!!  What a truly pathetic ending to what could have been a classic.  Collins shifts her tone so fast in this book to a preachy, in-your-face war story that all of the characters that were wonderfully fleshed out through the first two books simply fade into the background never to be seen again.  Her first person POV that flourished in the first 2 books, flops miserably in the final rendition.<br /><br />This book is demoralizing and just down-right depressing.  I can appreciate and didn't expect a fairy tale ending.  That would have been a cop-out, imo.  But this book follows down the opposite path so much, that it as equally unbelievable and unsatisfying.

They will be a bright and adorable source of narcissistic supply to their much obliged mother's expanded self.<br /><br />But all beauty has its price! For not being allowed to be theirselves, children will also inavoidably develop some downside traits of character. They may become quite exploiting, manipulating, ruthless, intrusive and short fused. And be sure, it will never ever be their fault! Very likely, they will never be able to develop long-time relationships, neither to partners nor close friends - quite lonely, but they always were...<br /><br />In the end, it comes all back to a tiger mom herself. Perhaps there was a reason, she was not able to let her children find their own way, could not appreciate the gift she was granted. Perhaps her childrens' flaws reminded her constantly of her own ones she could not stand. Their happiness touched the losses of her own childhood - and that hurt so deeply. Perhaps she had a severe problem herself?<br /><br />Those parents brake their childrens' wings for not being reminded they lost their own ones. If you are fascinated by this book, read an antidot, for example [[ASIN:0955350735 Daughter of Narcissus: A Family's Struggle to Survive Their Mother's Narcissistic Personality Disorder]] or [[ASIN:1439129436 Will I Ever Be Good Enough?: Healing the Daughters of Narcissistic Mothers]].

0307352145|4.0|I haven't always realized that being shy and an introvert doesn't always go hand in hand. Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking gives the example of Barbara Streisand as a shy extrovert(page 12). My mind just can't comprehend the two going together! I'm an introvert, and shy, and \\"highly sensitive\\"(page 14), and a sufferer of social phobia. Sounds pretty sad, huh?! Reading Quiet did make me feel better about who I am, though. I'm different, and that's okay! :)<br /><br />There's tons of examples of both introverts and extroverts throughout the pages of Quiet. I was actually surprised by some of them.<br /><br />Even the considerably more cheerful Theodor Geisel(otherwise known as Dr. Seuss) spent his workdays ensconced in his private studio, the walls lined with sketches and drawings, in a bell-tower outside his La Jolla, California, house. Geisel was a much more quiet man than his jocular rhymes suggest. He rarely ventured out in public to meet his young readership, fretting that kids would expect a merry, outspoken, Cat in the Hat-like figure, and would be disappointed with his reserved personality. \\"In mass, [children] terrify me,\\" he admitted.<br />(page 86)<br /><br />My favorite example of an introvert has always been Moses, which Cain mentions on pages 60-61.<br /><br />I think Quiet is a great book for both personalities to read. For introverts, I think it will help you accept your personality a little better. For extroverts, I think it might help you understand the introverts of the world a little better.<br /><br />*Thanks to Waterbrook Multnomah for my review copy in exchange for my honest opinion.

I have visited his blog, the art of non-conformity, many times and enjoyed many of his posts.  His blog basically chronicles his travels to try to visit every country on the planet, and it appears he finances that with the blog, his books, and personal appearances.  Seems like he has it all figured out.  Good for him.<br /><br />While most of the start-ups Chris writes about in this book spent way more than $100 to start their businesses, he does give brief descriptions of how they achieved a level of success.  I think the strong point of this book is the motivational aspect.  While you may not be able to read about one of the entrepreneurs listed and follow their exact path, you should come away from this book motivated to start your own thing.  Sure it takes a lot of work, but you are already doing that for someone else, why not do it for yourself?<br /><br />It really comes down to this, find what you love to do, what you are good at, and start making money at it.  You are not going to get rich overnight, but you can usually make some money at it, and then make more as you get better at it and better at promoting it.<br /><br />Here is my personal example, my wife is an awesome baker, very talented artistically and also very creative.  A couple of years ago I started telling her she really needs to turn this into a business.  So she did. She started doing custom decorated sugar cookies, custom cupcakes and custom cakes.  That took off just by world of mouth.  Then she started a blog, the name is listed under my profile, and that slowly grew.  So did my waistline because for her blog she creates three different posts each week, each one is a different dessert, which I volunteer for as the primary taste tester.  She did not know how to do any of it at the beginning.  She just took it a step at a time and learned as she went.  While she started as a decent baker, she has now turned into an excellent baker, photographer, layout designer, recipe creator, accountant, tax genius, and most importantly she is very profitable at all of this.  Who would have thought that a few years ago?  Sure it was a lot of work, but really she just did what she loved, what she was good at, and moved along a step at a time.and learned as she went.

This seemed like the way to go...NOT. the strap comes off (pins aren't seated very well that hold the strap on) and the watch runs slow by about 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />But hey, it looks great!
B0063IH60K|5.0|a classic game that looks great on my fire.  options for deck backs and background 1 or 3 card draw and different scoring options including Vegas.  its simple and doesn't have fancy bells and whistles but I like it this way :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's fun, a time killer, and a life saver when bored...i.e. waiting at the doctor's office, etc.!<br />...have fun!  I would recommend downloading it today!
B0059XTV7Q|4.0|There are two sides to every story, and in this carefully crafted biopic merged with fiction, Madonna tries to tell us the story of Wallis Simpson, the commoner a monarch left his kingdom to marry. Though maligned by the critics, W.E. is an exquisite film.<br /><br />Young Wally (Abbie Cornish) has inherited more from Wallis Simpson than her name. Her mother and grandmother were obsessed with the American divorcee, and so is Wally. Once an employee at a world-renowned auction house, now an upper society housewife with too much time on her hands, she is in a marriage of convenience for security and longs for a romance like Wallis had. Her psychologist husband (Richard Coyle) spends most of his time at work... or with his cell phone off, leaving her to pace her beautiful upper Manhattan apartment and dream.<br /><br />In the late 1930's, Wallis (Andrea Riseborough) is married to a good-natured man after a disastrous first marriage that ended in abuse and left her unable to bear children. Though suffering from a bad cold, she insists on being present at a party in which His Royal Majesty the Prince of Wales, \\"David\\" (James D'Arcy) to his family and friends, is in attendance. There are immediate sparks between them, but for a time Wallis merely \\"looks after him\\" for one of her friends. But when that friendship turns into something more, their love affair threatens to tear a nation apart on the eve of war.<br /><br />Critics have slammed this film for everything from its directorial style to the script. I happen to think they are all wrong. For a debut film by a first-time director, this is a masterpiece. Madonna knows movement and how to use it. She knows how to tell a story through female protagonists. She knows how to tug on our heartstrings and make a woman overshadowed by scandal and rumors a likable figure. That is what she did for me: she took a scandalous, notorious woman and made me like her. Not just a little bit, but a lot. Films from this era take a position on the scandal, either in favor of it or against it. This one doesn't. It presents the relationship for what it was, a unique and at times absurd affair. Yes, it is somewhat soft on their fondness for socializing and does its best to gloss over their Nazi empathies, but never did it feel overly defensive or contrived. In the end, it is a film about normal people who just happen to have titles attached to their names.<br /><br />The past setting is exquisite, with beautifully crafted costumes, jewelry, and a perfect cast that expands to include Laurence Fox, Natalie Dormer, and Oscar Isaac. If there is one fault with the script, it is that most of it revolves around present time and Wally, while her story is less interesting than that of Wallis. I raised my brow a bit to find out that the past and present characters would interact, but it works out well, with their lives intersecting and paralleling one another from time to time. I would have liked a bit more with Wallis and David, but there is enough. The musical score is also beautiful, ranging from passionate piano pieces to more modern pop songs. But rather than being jarring, they give us a sense of excitement and fun.<br /><br />Either this is a movie you are going to love, or hate. Much like public opinion on the romance itself, there is no middle ground. It glosses over some of the unsavory aspects of this couple (such as David's meanness to his brother Bertie) but doesn't hesitate to show us the brutal truth about everything Wallis went through. David may have given up his throne to be with her... but she gave up everything else.<br /><br />Parental Concerns: brief backside nudity, a scene in which a man drags a woman naked from a bathtub and beats her up (resulting in a miscarriage). 5 f-words, one abuse of Jesus' name.on the scandal, either in favor of it or against it.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|After many years of watching the different versions of a Christmas Carol, I came across this version. It was free, and I thought it would be a novel idea to READ the book this past year and not just watch a movie. What a thrill it was! It is often said, \\"the book is better than the movie.\\", and likewise this is so true! This book captures the essences so much more than any version I have ever seen. Though, in my opinon, the Christmas Carol starring George C Scott is the closest to this orginal writing. The book was so enjoyable, it has me downloading other classics that we tend to default to movie versions. Little Women, here I come!
B000E6EHGI|5.0|This is, far and away, my favorite Grateful Dead studio album. NEVER had the band sounded this focused, cohesive and energetic in the studio. From the songwriting to the arrangements to the performances, the band in 1975 had found a creative high point, and it's evident in every tune on this album.<br /><br />It's also clear that every band member enjoyed contributing. Rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, who was nearly booted from the band early on in part because it was felt he wasn't keeping up with the others improvisationally, plays his tail off here, and the mix allows the listener to hear him, whereas he was sometimes drowned out on previous Dead discs. Mickey Hart had returned to the Dead fold for this album after a hiatus related to his embarrassment over his father, a businessman who had, it was discovered, ripped off the band instead of enriching it. Easing his way back into the group, Hart didn't bring a full kit to the sessions, preferring instead to augment Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann with percussion accents (check out the sleigh bells on \\"Help on the Way\\"!). Vocalist Donna Godchaux is in great voice here, even though she has no lead vocal parts, except for a few lines on \\"The Music Never Stopped\\"; she supports the other singers throughout, though. Bassist Phil Lesh is at his creative best, interacting with the two drummers but also playing melodic figures in reaction to lead guitarist Jerry Garcia.<br /><br />And that leaves Garcia and keyboardist Keith Godchaux, who never sounded better together than they did on \\"Blues for Allah.\\" In later years, Godchaux developed an aggravating musical tic, imitating phrases Garcia was playing instead of offering parts that complemented him. Here, though, their musical interplay is a true partnership -- just listen to how supple they sound on \\"Franklin's Tower.\\"<br /><br />The Grateful Dead was always best when it had strong material, and the songs here -- even instrumentals like \\"King Solomon's Marbles\\" and \\"Sage and Spirit\\" -- absolutely burble and bubble with energy. The title track is probably the least accessible, with a decidedly Eastern modality and odd melodic line.<br /><br />I have listened to this album well over a hundred times in the last three or four years alone, and always find pleasure going back to it. Note on the expanded version: The additional six tracks are pretty much throwaways, with five of them being instrumentals labeled \\"grooves\\" and \\"jams.\\" The exception is \\"Hollywood Cantata,\\" a pleasant enough number sung by Weir -- but, given the quality of the other songs the band was writing at the time, it's clear why it was left off the original release.<br /><br />Even if you don't normally like the Dead, give \\"Blues for Allah\\" a try.t\\" -- absolutely burble and bubble with energy.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play this everyday. it's easy to get back to your home screen all you do is click on customer care in settings and your out. I haven't had to shut my kindle down at all. I wish I could visit friends a little easier.  other than that I love it.<br /><br />very addicting
B0055PGUYU|5.0|While I learned much of this in Psych courses I took a long time ago, this was a concise and helpful reminder. Well written and action oriented.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I have two of these, mounted on either wheel. They are extremely bright and *everybody* can see you. Seeing as these are quite new what I really enjoy from a safety perspective is drivers will of course see the lights, but they will think they see a pattern or something, they're not quite sure, so, they'll actively look at my bike.<br /><br />It's great to feel the street at night actively look at me, at my bike. The pecking order seems to change on the road, and I think actually many drivers would be thanking me for making their night drives easier and safer from their perspective, as they certainly don't want to cause an accident. The lights also add to the trendiness or vibe of any street you're on.<br /><br />One problem, not really a problem but certainly something to be looked at, while the battery enclosure and lighting PCB only weigh 80g, once you attach the 3 AAs there's a noticeable weight difference on the bike (if it's a weight weenie). The rotational weight isn't so bad as it is attached at the hub, but there is a slight imbalance which you would really only be aware of if you had the bike up on a stand and spinning the wheels. I'm going to move the lights across to a commuter or urban bike, which are less sensitive to weight differences.<br /><br />Overall, get one! It might save your life one day.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|It has gorgeous graphics and engaging strategy game.  Works great on my Kindle Fire. Highly recommended for fans of tower defends games.
0345528581|5.0|I started my exercise journey with \\"New Rules of Lifting for Women\\" and while the exercises are very intense and I'm sure will get you awesome results, I couldn't keep up the exercises in the program. For someone like me who's never lifted before, I think I was putting way too much stress of my body by doing intense weight lifting exercises every other day. I've been slowly transitioning to exercises from Mark Lauren's book from lifting. I love this book so much. I love the concept of being \\"gym free\\" (how empowering to know you can exercise anytime, anywhere, without equipment!), I love how challenging the exercises are and yet how effective they are. I've been doing bodyweight exercises from \\"You are your own gym\\" for two months now and I feel stronger and see results in my body as well. I highly recommend this book for anyone and everyone wanting to get lean, strong and loose some weight.
0385342055|5.0|I read some of the reviews on here and many complained that it just wasn't a good book. Because of that I didn't have high expectations. I ended up finishing the book in 24 hours! I absolutely loved it! Yes the first two books are the best, and will be my favourite of the series but I still really liked this one. Sophia Kinsella's writing never ceases to amuse me and I found myself laughing out loud quite a bit while reading this. I've read the entire series many, many times over the years when I haven't had much else to read and the shopaholic series is one of my favourites among many. If you love Sophie Kinsella's work and love crazy Becky then you should definitely give this book a chance :) I for one am excited at the prospect of there possibly being another book!
B005EVVESM|5.0|the BEST maroon 5 cd ever!!! i love all the songs. i can listen to it over and over agian. its just the best of maroon 5!
B007UXT6T6|3.0|Really liked the movie, must agree that it's the best MI ever. One thing I liked is that the team is forced to improvise - a lot of things don't go quite according to plan, and the high-tech gadgets are failing right and left. Which brings me to the point of this review...<br /><br />This was my first time using Amazon Prime. I have a Netflix account and occasionally rent a movie through my AppleTV.  With both of those services, I have never experienced any problems with the quality of HD streaming, unless they were directly related to issues on my home network. Yesterday, my internet connection was rock solid and at full speed (20mb down / 5mb up), and my local network was up and running smoothly. In spite of that, connection to the Amazon server dropped app. 5 mins. into the movie. This was fixed by restarting the Amazon application on the PS3; the movie continued where it had left off, and in HD quality. However, throughout the 2+hrs. of the film, I noticed that the picture appeared to be frequently and annoyingly stuttering, especially in rapid action scenes. My very nice 50\\" Bravia runs at 120hz, and I have thus far not experienced a stuttering picture from any other stream or local source.<br /><br />So at this point, I'm not too sure about the quality of the Amazon streaming service. I'll probably rent a few more movies to see how it goes, and if the problems recur, I'll just stick with iTunes.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I picked up the first volume of Game of Thrones about 3 weeks ago; a fantasy/sorcery/medieval lust for blood and power knights tale. I usually read 2-3 books at a time, but this one kept me reading until the end. I have downloaded all four books on my kindle and am on book 3 as I write. Character development is complex and some great characters live very short lives. I miss them. Good news is that there are plenty of great characters to keep this many-layered epic tale riveting. This guy can write. I am watching the HBO first season of Game of Thrones and while events are compressed for film, the cast,sets,graphics, and camera work are extraordinary. What a find!
B0058WFO06|2.0|Sorry but I question all the 5-star reviews. This CD is not that great. Previous works under the title Porcupine Tree are MUCH BETTER than this.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|I was a bit worried how Morton can possibly pull this off without Mags and Pal. i did like some of the songs from Letter of Egypt and Wild Seed, but apart from that Morten was more crawling rather than running on his own. I have to say - I didn't see that one coming! Out of my hands is so not out of his hands, in fact, it is spot on. The songs compliment Morten's doubtless fabulous voice, one is unlike the other and all are absolutely fantastic. My personla favourite is 'Just believe it' a rocky make you happy song, and 'when I reached the moon' which surely initially was called 'loosing you' but then renamed in order to avoid confusion with a-ha's 'I've been loosing you'.<br />I can only urge you to buy this album, even when you didn't like a-ha, you won't regret it.
B005OP2Y1E|5.0|I bought this episode on my Kindle Fire. It was great, like all episodes of Modern Family. The quality was awesome, and I was able to take it with me on vacation and (with my waterproof case) watch it as I chilled in the pool. &lt;3 Kindle Fire

B005FISC52|5.0|Great season, love love love chase and Chris Keller and their bromance:) Only disappointing part of the season is the cameo of Lucas (chad michael Murray) what was the point of bringing him back without Peyton?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put the books down. I went from one to the next and finished the whole trilogy in no time. These are some of the best books I've read in a long time! I would recommend them to anyone!!

B005HJWWW8|4.0|After buying a pair of Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones, it was recommended by a friend that I also look into purchasing an amplifier.<br /><br />The Fiio E6 is well priced for the sound quality improvements it offers. Don't expect to be knocked off your chair, however you should expect that there will be a noticeable difference (based on the headphones or speakers you are using) in quality and bass.<br /><br />The E6 was my purchase over a few other amplifiers for three main reasons:<br />1.) It is charged via USB -- I don't need to worry about batteries or a 12V brick like many other amps.<br />2.) It is very small. It doesn't take up a ton of room on my desk or in my pocket.<br />3.) It is portable; it even comes with a handy clip.<br /><br />If you're looking for a cheap amp that is there to get the job done, I recommend the E6. If you want more quality and don't care about portability, spend more money on a higher-end desk amp.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved this book.  This was the first fiction book I've purchased for my Kindle Fire because it was so highly recommended on Dr Oz.  I started reading and I couldn't put it down.  This book is very light hearted and entertaining. I find the character of Ana to be much like women today which are smart, sassy and independent.  I have read all three and I enjoyed them all with the same reaction of laughter, tears and frustration.  I want to re-read them again. If your looking something intellectual and groundbreaking this may not be for you but if you just want something to pass the time and your not a prude its a good read.
B006RXQ48Q|5.0|I wish I could fugure out what is different in a director's cut and the regular theatrical release. If the difference is significant, I can see a reason for pointing it out in the title. My problem is that I don't ever see that significance.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After hearing about this book from the TV, my hubby looked up the reviews and decided against buying them for me. At the same time, I was ordering all three books. I enjoyed the story line, fell in love with Ana and Christian, and finished all three books within a week. This is the fastest I've read thought a series like this. I enjoyed the sex scences and how what started as alien to Ana becomes her desire to give to Christian. For Christian to realize that Ana needs \\"hearts and flowers\\" allowed him to realize that he needed them too.<br /><br />I understand that not all readers will enjoy all the books they touch, but I think some of the reviews are too harsh. If it was easy enough to write, then everyone would have a book on Amazon.
030788743X|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite book of all time. It is well written and develops its setting and characters beautifully, and references to 80's culture make me find joy nearly every page. It may be because I am a complete nerd, but I will always love this book, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fun sci-fi/fantsy epic.
044024367X|5.0|I loved Nothing to Lose.  I really don't get all the haters out there.  There really are right-wing crazies in the world.  Read the news.  I loved seeing Reacher bring one of them down.  As for Child being anti-Iraq war, isn't every thinking person anti-Iraq war by now?  If you like Reacher, ignore the one star reviews and read it.
0765316994|5.0|There is an old riddle/joke going all the way back as far as Star Trek:  The Captain, First Officer, Chief Medical Officer, and Ensign Jones all go on an away mission to the planet's surface.  Someone isn't coming back.  Guess who it is?  Here's a hint, Ensign Jones is wearing a nice red shirt.<br /><br />The same formula has been used in countless sci-fi movies and series since then.  The guy in the red shirt is toast.  Guaranteed.<br /><br />So what would happen if the guys in the red shirts figured out that, for them, away missions always seem to come to a bad end?  And how about a situation in which the senior officers need to spend an inordinate amount of time recruiting new ensigns to wear the red shirts?  Do you think it might become difficult for the Captain to find any Ensigns around when looking for someone to bring along?<br /><br />That is one of the stories here, but it's not the only one.  This book has layer after layer of sweet, tasty goodness.  And there are no guarantees that there aren't more layers for us to discover after the story ends.<br /><br />I was so happy to see this particular book show up on my review list, because I've really been looking forward to reading it and thought I'd have to wait another month.  Lucky me, I got to enjoy Mr Scalzi's newest book a little early.  Really I think the man is incapable of writing a bad book.<br /><br />This one is funny, cute, filled with inside jokes, but also it's a really good story.  Maybe several of them.

1466401885|4.0|Co-dependence is a reality that many face and this book is told from the prospective of a guy who lost his mother at the age of 3, never to have loved anyone or anything again. Until, he meets Abby. His mind and soul unlock as he falls in love for the first time, becoming dependent on this relationship. As the story evolves, so does their relationship and an ultimate love story takes place. There are times that the character's seem to take their actions to an unbelievable level, but mostly it is a very real portrayal of a co-dependent relationship.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a fun game to play and it keeps u entertained. The theme was fun...although there could be at lest different movies playing
B000IZ7YK6|5.0|If you like Jack Nicholson, this is one of his best. It deals with the 1930's, money, power, oranges, and water. Make sure you watch the sequel to this movie. The Two Jakes
1423113454|5.0|Percy Jackson was good, but the Kane Chronicles are incredible! The characters are really likable and the occasional comic relief throughout the stories helps break up the serious stuff so that it's not too much.<br /><br />Even though the storyline is total fantasy, the main characters, Carter and Sadie Kane are very relatable to young people of their similar ages. Sadie goes through many of the typical pre-teen emotions... crushes on boys, awkward moments etc. Carter on the other hand is the typical ruff and tumble younger brother that has a healthy sense of sibling rivalry with his sister, while definitely loving and looking up to her. Of course, he wouldn't admit that last mushy part!<br /><br />Our 9 year old started the series as a \\"read at bedtime with mom\\" ritual. It was soon evident that the book was being enjoyed not only by him but the adults in the household as well when there was serious competition between mom, dad and even grandma on who would read with him each night! We were all hooked!!!<br /><br />If our family could vote more than 5 stars we all would! It's one of those rare books for kids that even the adults can get into! One great read not to be missed!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is awesome because you get to play different mini games in one game.Which I think that's really cool because thats not usually intakes like these and that is what I think.
1400069289|5.0|Some 2,000 years ago the Roman poet Ovid penned the words, \\"Nothing is stronger than habit.\\"  We have known for a long time that habits rule our lives.  Modern psychology and neurological studies have given us much greater insight into habits - the how and the why of habits.  Since our lives are ruled by habits, this is an excellent resource to learn more about what we do and why we do the things we do.<br /><br />This book is divided into three parts.  Part one deals with the habits of individuals, Part two is concerned with the habits of successful organizations and Part three focuses on the habits of societies.<br /><br />Charles Duhigg, the author is an excellent researcher and writer.  The stories scattered throughout the book are fascinating and are told in a very entertaining manner.  There is a lot of science behind our habits.  But the scientific theories are always explained in layman's terms.  There is a total absence of scientific or academic jargon.  The book is written in very conversational language.<br /><br />You will learn some very interesting behind the scenes information about how retailers collect data about our shopping habits and use that information to determine how to target specific ads toward us.  The retailer Target actually developed the ability to predict when women were pregnant based on their shopping habits.  Casinos also collect and use data to target frequent (and compulsive) gamblers.<br /><br />The psychology behind our habits is fascinating.  The way Mr. Duhigg weaves it all together makes for very interesting and informative reading.<br /><br />Do not expect to find a magic pill for breaking your long term habits in this (or any other) book.  What you will find is some very interesting and insights into various habits.<br /><br />The bottom line about changing habits is this:  \\"If you believe you can change - if you make it a habit - the change becomes real.  This is the real power of habits; the insight that your habits are what you choose them to be.  Once that choice occurs - and becomes automatic - it's not only real, it starts to seem inevitable.\\"<br /><br />A delightful and informative read.  Anyone interested in human behavior will find this a worthwhile, interesting and very informative read.hat you choose them to be.  Once that choice occurs - and becomes automatic - it's not only real, it starts to seem inevitable.\\"<br /><br />A delightful and informative read.  Anyone interested in human behavior will find this a worthwhile, interesting and very informative read.
0345803485|2.0|Yes, I read it. I wanted to figure out why women were responding to it, since it's not like they are an under-served part of the book buying market. (In other words, I was reading the book to learn about the people reading it, not to learn from the book. Sometimes this is just as educational as a good book itself.) My conclusion is that all the articles telling you that women are getting off to the submissive sex/BDSM angle are totally missing the book. The sex scenes are not the real fantasy of this book.<br /><br />What is? The secret and near universal belief that if a woman does things just right, she can turn a man into the person she wants him to be. In this case, Anastasia's real desire isn't sex, it's reforming and changing Christian Grey. I'd read the other books to pursue this theory further but the writing is just bad enough that I probably won't.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is an awesome game u should defiantly get it I love it. it really reminded me of new super Mario so ya u should get it
B005LL4U54|5.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack in that it conveys all the drama and humor of the film, but also works on its own as music. It evokes the music of the late 1920s/early 1930s beautifully (and a couple of tracks are actual pieces from the period). It's a joy to listen to, with melodies that will stick in your head and  rhythms that will keep your toes tapping long after it finishes playing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it. this game rocks. glad I can play it on the kindle and not just on the computer .
0618526412|4.0|This book is so weird. Basically nothing happens, and what does happen is surreal or absurd, yet I couldn't stop reading. Actually, I kept telling myself that I would stop, since I wasn't all that interested, but I never did. It may not have been interesting (plot-wise) but it was captivating.<br /><br />The main character is a deaf mute of all things, and it still manages to be painfully relatable. The writing is beautiful--I think it's a Southern writer thing--and crisp. Of course, the title is also brilliant. Longer and perhaps lacking the crystalline concentration of emotion of the novella Ballad of a Sad Cafe. Still, brilliant, beautiful, tragic, grotesque, Southern.

B006ON41FC|3.0|if you had the option before it took you home after every play this game eould be a lot better
B000I9YWDO|1.0|however, being somewhat obsessive, i couldn't seem to break free...jejune, almost entirely empty, and nearly identical to a very bad and lengthy sitcom episode, except for the absence of the obligatory 50s laugh track...in the first two hours of my promised and blissful afterlife, i may very well look back upon the final two hours, and realize they were wasted in advance on this deeply malformed creature feature.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would just like to add, if you haven't read this book, you're missing a lot. This is not some Twilight love story. This is a hundred times better.
B005DC68NI|5.0|When I downloaded this book, I thought it would be good based on the reviews but it was not only good, it was excellent. For anyone thinking about writing an e-Book this little book is jam packed with information and inspiration.  The only con (very small con) is the lack of information related to writing non-fiction.  All the author interviews were fiction writers.  It would have been nice to hear from the non-fiction side.  That being said, all the information on the hows and whys are for all writers.  Thanks David.  At $3.99 (at time of writing) this book is a bargain.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|just as reviewed... it's fun and challenging. i'm getting better at it. only thing that i find frustrating is the rotating. it would be better with a rotation button. my coordination isn't the greatest.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this remind me of the old version but with some nice tweek and surprise. the homes way to make money with the stores of all types.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Absolutely disappointing book. It is a pity that beginning so well, the reading goes to such boring result. The last part of the novel goes too fast, like it is in a hurry for  an unexpected reason. The end has no sense because it has been done without proper planning.<br />I don't recommend it. There are hundreds of erotic books much better than this one that has had the luck of being very well publicized.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game it is a fun it is a little hard but I like this game so donlowed
B005PTQPU0|2.0|Kate Bush is a woman of many adjectives: quirky, eccentric, offbeat, creative, unique, brilliant, to list a few, but until this CD, there's one that hasn't been associated with her: boring. The seven ponderous tracks here range from nearly seven minutes to 13 1/2 minutes in length, but their distinguishing feature is that they all seem much longer, and there isn't a single memorable melody in the bunch. Listening to this is the aural equivalent of doing nothing but watching snow fall for nearly 70 minutes: it's pretty and soothing at first, but after a few minutes, it becomes a dull blur of sameness. Alarmingly, this comes on the heels of her ill-conceived reworking of earlier songs on \\"Directors Cut\\" (that following an 18-year period in which she released a grand total of one album), giving the distinct impression that she's simply run out of ideas. Highly disappointing.
0756407125|4.0|I must split the rating and give the first half of the book 4 stars and the last half 5 stars.  This second book in the trilogy is not quite as good as the first book, since too much time is spent moving the plot only a couple of steps forward during the first half.  However, the plot kicks into high gear for the last 500 pages, and was as exciting a read as the first book.  Rothfuss has a lot to tie up in the last volume (ugh - it's not being published until next year!), but I think he can pull it off, and I can't wait to read \\"Doors of Stone.\\"
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game seems simple in the beginning but just wait! hits help you get by, just use them wisely.  I haven't been able to find a solution on facebook yet. cool game and a good way to pass idle time. I would recommend to a friend.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I ordered one of these a couple of weeks after getting my Fire, and I really like it. It adds little weight of width to the Kindle, and while it may feel a little insubstantial, it has done an admirable job of keeping the device safe in my bag to and from work.<br /><br />  One of the main reasons I picked it is that the cover can also act as a stand. This works great provided you set it up properly. There have been times where I propped the cover up against the elastic band instead of in the proper groove, and have had it fall over suddenly, but those were purely user errors.<br /><br />  Inexpensive, and it works. I don't regret getting one for even a second.
B004HO6I2E|1.0|Of the same ilk as Bridesmaids and the Hangover series.... appeals to tween to twenties (reality or mentally) who are stoned.  Just sad waste of talent and amazing these actors agreed to this debacle of a movie.<br />Oh well, at least I rented it and didn't buy this boondoggle of a cinamatic wretching experience.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Intriguing plot, with insight into sexual behavior that the average person has no idea about. It makes you want to hear what troubes Mr. Grey has been through during his early childhood. I felt the language to be repetative, the book style Mills and Boonish, when I was 14 I really loved Mills and Boon. It could have been more sophisticated. I read the entire book with interest. It left me feeling a little creeped out yet I praise the Author for being brave and attempting to write such a book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|thoroughly enjoyed first 2 books! It is a kinky love story and delves into the sexual phyche we all possess! These books grip you from the onset and keep you wanting more.  I am half way through book 3 and do not want this trilogy to end.  Bravo to the writer for such a seductive love story!
B007HO392S|5.0|If you want to know how to determine whether a certain CD is great or not..try this test.  IF THE VERY FIRST TIME AROUND EVERY SINGLE SONG BLOWS YOUR MIND, THE CD IS FANTASTIC!  Truly, that is a rare occurance.  THIS CD DID THAT FOR ME!!!!!  I immediately took to every song; every emotion; every rockin' feel, all sadness, all empathy..EVERYTHING MOVED ME ON THIS CD!  My only question when purchasing this was CAN CARRIE ACTUALLY TOP HERSELF. The answer is unequivocally ABSOLUTELY YES AND SHE DID!  This CD is not only her best but THE BEST!!  BUY IT..YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!  If you are, don't blame me; blame a blind eye to brilliance!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to say...that I had a hard time putting this book down but not because of the erotic sex. There was a great story line built in but entirely too many sex scenes. One of the things that makes a romance book great is the anticipation. There wasn't a lot of anticipation. They pretty much got busy from the get go. Having said that.... being ever curious how the mind works... I did find it an interesting read and I was anxious to find out what happened between these two completely different people. If the sex scenes had been cut in half even... this wouldn't have been a trilogy... (by the third book I was skimming the sex scenes)... it would have been one wonderful book. But that's just my opinion. It is a sweet story.... I did enjoy it.... I did make it through the three books in a weekend and they are books that I would probably read again. However, if you don't have a tolerance for unlikely sex scenes....repetitive banter between the characters etc....this probably isn't the trilogy for  you. I realize I sound like I'm trashing it but I'm not. I did really enjoy the books but these are books you are either going to love or hate. Not a lot of shades of Gray. :)
B004CYKZZA|5.0|I ordered this wireless headphone fpr my husband.  It works as he was told hy friends. He really likes it as he is not confined to one spot as he talks on Skype.
B0038AWZ1Q|5.0|Im a huge White Stripes/Jack White fan and im a cd/record collector<br />so i got this cause its limited ed.<br />The cd cover art is red and black on the limited ed not black and white as shown up above<br />the normal cd is black and white.<br /><br />DVD<br />The dvd doesn't have any special features just the the movie<br />Its about there tour in Canada not a live concert dvd but there<br />are alot of live concert videos in the movie its all about them<br />and there music but its just not a full live concert dvd.<br />It has them mostly Jack (Meg doesn't talk all that much) talking<br />about there music and how they never toured Canada before.<br /><br />CD<br />its a great live cd but all the songs on the live cd isn't in the movie<br />you don't see them preform all these songs in the movie if you do its<br />just a clip but the live cd is great and the cover of Jolene is my fav<br />on the cd.<br /><br />All in all i love it i just wish there were bonus features on the dvd.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|cool time passer.<br /> really gets you to try and beat the zombies. great graphics and cool music I love it.
0800141865|4.0|Other than this version of this film, this screener was delivered with real intensity, by the primary character actors, Woody H., Cobains ex wife, she totally owned it! Fabulous performance...
B002VECM6S|5.0|Excellent movie! I love The Blind Side. I have it in my classroom and we watch it when a lot of my students are absent. It's a really good Christian film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My son bought this book after seeing the movie and ended up reading the whole series in a week.  I enjoyed it too.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a great cooler, has my 3570k @ 3.5ghz (just got it ok) running in the mid 30C. It is very quiet, but be warned it is absolutely massively sized, the picture does not do a good job of showing you just how big it is. For those of you in small cases, be warned!
B005723JSQ|5.0|Book Kept the reader interested and wanting to find out what happens to the main character.  Good, easy, fun read.
B007IE4DSG|4.0|First of all, the music on this cd is incredible.<br />It's worth every dime.<br />But please -- Vol. 1?  10 cuts?  I guess that means Vol. 2 with another 10 cuts is due sometime in near future.<br />Why the con-game?<br />We all know how much \\"data\\" a cd holds -- at least 70 minutes -- so why the short-shrift?<br /><br />Well, for the less adventurous, this is still a find; for those in the know, however, bootleg cd's of near-equal (sound) quality featuring George's demos can be had for (roughly) the same price -- but with 20 or more tracks.<br /><br />Cheers.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|But I uninstalled it because of the bugs in it.I have in my kindle fire; and I will wait until they fix it hopeful it be soon.Other then the bugs in it its a great game :)
B0036S4C6G|1.0|Painful.  It was suggested reading the book two times helped one to understand but I just could not do it!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I am pleased with this cpu so far, I paired it with a GA-Z77-DS3H that came loaded with an older F2 bios without any issues. The onboard video is actually fairly decent and will suffice most home users and casual gamers needs, it can run most current titles on med-low settings at decent frame rates.<br /><br />Despite what others are saying, this cpu runs cool especially paired with a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus. The boxed cooler on this unit is almost embarrassingly small especially when this is an unlocked \\"K\\" model meant for overclocking. Im hitting mid 30's and it is not much warmer than ambient temps.<br /><br />The amazon price is a bit higher than Intel initially announced, but overall not a bad value given most people are getting 4.5-5.0ghz on these things.
0345803485|1.0|Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of Erotic Fiction. I am a very open minded person and nothing shocks me. If it's raunchy, nasty and dirty I'll read it.<br /><br />This, however was none of those. Why did I read it? Well because this book was talked about on the radio, on television, and all my friends were talking about it. All I heard was about how hot and steamy the sex was, what an awesome erotic fiction novel this is, how it's a MUST READ. So I unfortunately bought into the hype and I was very, very disappointed. I found the story to be very sophomoric at best and the writing was pretty bad. Then I found out that it is actually a Fanfic story based off of the Twilight characters and well, things kind of began to make sense.<br /><br />While I can believe that there is a twenty-something year old girl who is still a virgin what I fail to believe is that she's never been kissed passionately, felt any sort of sexual feelings -- seriously, the girl had no idea what the stirrings that she felt inside her were and seemed shocked when she realized it was desire --  nor has she ever masturbated. The story line was pretty boring in my opinion which made it difficult to get through. The sex was far from hot and was mediocre at best. As far as the BDSM aspect of it it was very tame. I had a hard time believing that Christian who was supposed to be Anastasia's Dom would make as many concessions for her as he did. I was under the impression, based on the contract, that she was supposed to be submissive at all times and yet she never was and the only time she was \\"punished\\" (for lack of a better term) was if she rolled her eyes at him. I also found it laughable that, considering the fact that Christian fancies himself to be a Dom and is in the BDSM lifestyle, that Anastasia wearing his underwear was shocking as was the night she went out without her panties. I mean really? The guy is a DOM. He's supposed to be in the BDSM lifestyle and he finds those things shocking? Get real.<br /><br />As for the writing: I got tired of hearing about the feelings that he invoked in her \\"down there\\" and the whole \\"Inner Goddess\\" thing was just too much as was all the times Anastasia \\"stared down at her knotted fingers\\", their \\"jaws dropped\\" or how often her \\"subconscious mind crossed her arms and tapped her foot in disapproval\\". It was redundant to say the least.<br /><br />I struggled to get through the book, laughed at the \\"steamy sex scenes\\" and the very tame portrayal of S&M. The only torture that I found in reading this book was the struggle it took me to get through it. I will most definitely NOT be pursuing the subsequent books in this series nor will I recommend it to any one and for anyone out there who is seriously considering buying the book I strongly urge you not to. It's all hype and you'll just end up being disappointed in the end.
0345529057|4.0|Ordered after getting fed up with not knowing the 'whole' story while watching the HBO series. I usually strive to read the books first so I'm a little late to the party here. Good quality, typical paperback. The case has images from the HBO series, but it is fairly flimsy, just your standard paperboard wrapper. Story is engrossing and involved, can't wait to get through these four and start up the next installment.
0985081821|4.0|I loved this book, it has an original storyline and well developed characters.  It is something an adult or a teen would be able to read and enjoy.  I worked at Borders Books and am familiar with a lot of different genres and authors, and I read constantly, so I am always on the lookout for new authors.  Check this book and author out, I promise you won't be sorry.  Can't wait for the next book in the series.
B0070BG10U|5.0|I have been a Bee Gees fan from childhood, but even knowing their abilities to write wonderful, unique music in all the most popular genres didn't prepare me for this.  Robin was always my favorite of the Gibbs--still, it wasn't easy to separate his contributions to the Bee Gees' songs from those of his brothers apart from the times he sang lead.  Finding out what a fabulous classical (dare I say, religious?) composer he could be was a beautiful surprise!  Particularly in light of his recent very serious illness--it is as if he is reconciling himself to God with this piece. Primarily, of course--but not only--a gloriously fitting tribute to the souls lost on the Titanic. Robin's voice alone is a revelation, so much deeper in all senses of the word. If this is the last thing he leaves behind, those of us who have discovered it are truly blessed!  Only one complaint--it would have been nice to have all lyrics, including those in Latin--and especially those of the song Salvation (Gradual), which is in English but a bit hard to understand--in the liner notes.
0345803493|5.0|I read all three books and I really enjoyed them. I really think they should make a movie out of all three books! ;)
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I hadn't heard about this trilogy until the movie came out. Before going to see the movie I decided to read the books. I thought they were a great read! Very entertaining and well worth the purchase. Amazon kindle shop provided great service. I'd highly recommend purchasing from Amazon as, in my experience, they have always delivered!
B007G5O3K0|4.0|As a fan of A-Ha since the '80s, I suspected Morten's new solo album might fall a bit short of his former band's greatness. After all, I own two of Morten's previous solo albums and they're both merely OK. \\"Out of My Hands\\" is better than those, in fact it's quite good, but after listening several times to this collection of 10 songs several times, it's clear that Morten Harket will never be as good by himself as he was with Paul Waaktaar and Magne Furuholmen. It's a shame they had to call it quits. Still, there are some nice tracks here, including \\"Just Believe It,\\" \\"Scared of Heights\\" and \\"Lightning.\\" I expected more from the song \\"Listening,\\" as it's written by the Pet Shop Boys, but it's rather forgettable. Be aware, too, that this is a very SHORT album -- the 10 songs are brief and the whole thing clocks in at a mere 39 minutes. Pretty darn expensive for what you get.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is such a great book. I never review things but I had to make an exception for this book. If you are even slightly a nerd, geek, gamer, or generally just a fan of obscure 80's & 90's references this is the book for you. Fantastic from start to finish!
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I like it. it isn't my favorite game on miniclip but its definitely pretty fun and addicting. so yeah. I agree worth the 99&cent;
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The books just got better and better! Thank you E L James for the intriguing story in all three books! had me hooked! :)
B007U8UBGI|5.0|It's very difficult to find an album these days where every song is a winner. Blunderbuss takes you for an audible ride like the days of olde Rock & Roll records used to do.<br />Thanks Jack.. it's been too long... Rock and Roll is back!!!

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun but the energy system is kinda lame. people that get sick take too long to heal also. get rid of the microtransactions and make the game 4 bucks
B000Q7ZND6|4.0|very good movie, must have on blu ray. although mine was skipping on my ps3 for some reason. amazon was excellent in their customer service replacing the order.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was fantastic!  I couldn't put it down.  Before I was half way through it, I bought and down loaded the next book in the trilogy on my Kindle.  In a matter of days I had read all three books and gone to see the movie.  My husband did the same thing!  The movie was good but very glad I had read the book as it had so much more information in it as to what was going on and made the movie better then what it would have been otherwise.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this cd, it has alot of Adele greatest hits. All sthe songs sounded very good.<br /><br />She has such a powerful voice.<br /> I will buy more of her cds
B007SYWFRM|5.0|would reccomend this game for kids that have the time to play it you can play and then come back to it later
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a pretty good version of the game for being free. There are LOTS of different levels to play. My kids enjoy it a lot too.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|SO SAD AND SO OUTRAGIOUS. Dont wolves have enough threats against their survival without this kind of nonsense and usery story? Wolves DO NOT attack people. As one who has studied, photographed and lived with wolves I can tell you unequivocally that wolves are non violent toward people. They are basically timid and avoid human beings at all costs.<br /><br />Western European peoples have created violent and fearful stories about wolves for centuries. Little Red Riding Hood lied and so has this film. Films like this fuel the brutal arial hunting of wolves in the early spring when the wolves are trapped by deep snows and are helpless to flee, their new born cubs left to die of starvation for the loss of their parents to trophy hunters flying in small planes above them. This happens frequently.<br /><br />For a more balanced movie about wolves try watching a film based on a true substantiated story about a Canadian Biologist who was the first to study and live with wolves in the 1950s.<br /><br />Movie title: Never Cry Wolf.<br /><br />Great film, wonderful score.
0142000655|5.0|A very interesting read - but not something that will inspire patriotism and optimism in American history, American culture. I would put this novel up there as one of the first, best - revisionist, anti American novels that inspired so many movies of this genre. Basically, there are no heroes in this novel - the sympathetic characters are poor, honest (Chinese) servants, failed farmers - business and social success comes only through deception. The father of the Cain and Abel sons was a decorated Civil War hero, military experts who lost his leg in something not associated with Civil War battle, yet he promotes himself all the way up to the Secratary of War's office in Washington. Organized religion is mocked, depicted as a fraud - true spiritualism comes from the suffering of regular folks. The female character of Cathy is one of the most negative, destructive characters in American literature - a manipulative whore, prostitute, madam, tries to abort her 9 month old twins and yet she can act and succeed in an American world that is fallen, always fallen as man is failed after Adam and Eve fell out of grace and were kicked out of the garden of Eden.<br /><br />I feel about this great novel the same way I feel about the Revisionist Western movie - High Noon. High Noon isn't a patriotic American movie - as virtually all the characters of this small Western town are depicted as cowards, hypocrites and the whole America they represent is depicted as a lie. Yes, Communists in Hollywood wrote and directed High Noon - John Wayne hated this movie, being a patriotic America, I should also hate High Noon. But I don't - the movie is just to good, great.<br /><br />I give the same grudging respect to East of Eden - think it is Steinbeck's best.[[ASIN:B00006JMRE High Noon (Collector's Edition)]]

B0052UZIFA|4.0|I am not sure if this is because we had a defective download, but I have had to re-start my game several times which is annoying because you get to a certain level and darn it, you want to have it saved properly.

So, good game!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Wonderful Bible app, the KJV bible is written in a beautiful old word language but is still hard to understand, that being said would like option to permanently download NIV, as most churches  don't have wifi connectability in order to access YouVersion's site to use it.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|To be brief I always felt \\"All things Must Pass\\" was an album or a collection of great songs but I always thought too much brass too loud and when I read George's comments in the all things must pass reissue notes in 2000 he felt that way too and partly wanted to record it without the Spector wall of sound, sound but decided couldn't overall dicard what stood before as recorded history...anyway this short 30 minute collection may not be comprehensive but hopefully someone will go back and put all his demos and acoustic stuff out there for his fans to consume and they'll love it...ironically George was the 2nd most bootlegged Beatle...1st goes to John who had help with a national radio show each week...YES i love this collection, loved the stripped down versions off of \\"All things Must Pass\\" and other stuff which i hope is an overview and maybe the next collections will be concentrated or just go head and release a big box set with it all there...i think once you get past \\"Living in the Material World\\" it gets thin but we don't know that for sure i'm not sure how George worked when recording his songs...eg the songs off of the self titled album George Harrison had some pretty and/or very acoustical orientated arrangements so maybe it won't be thin at all...i said brief but he was a great artist and I really do hope there will be more to come, George Harrison may be overlooked because he was a Beatle overshadowed of course by the lennon-mccartney machine.
0307477479|4.0|A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD<br /><br />Jennifer Egan<br /><br />I was of two minds with this best seller. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to give it four stars or five. I was leaning toward five but then I read something that was an easy five and I had to go with four.<br /><br />Jennifer Egan is a fine writer with a terrific eye. She gets body language. Facial expressions. The unspoken thoughts that we all guard as we mouth other words. Her descriptions of characters are finely crafted, but she hasn't been able to make me care what happens to any of them. In retrospect, I have come to realize that I never saw them as whole beings. Somehow, there was incompleteness in each of them, and I can't say what was missing. It is as if Egan knew them so well, she assumed that we would too. And, I have to say, there are way too many of them for my taste. I know there are some people, women especially, who can remember inexhaustible details in infinite numbers of relationships in dimensions way beyond time and space. I personally don't think men do such a good job in that milieu. I certainly don't. I spent a lot of time trying to remember who was who. Who they were related to. Who they were divorced from. Why they came to the state of affairs the current page found them to be in. I am not sure I have it all right. I could have used a chart.<br /><br />I am also cognizant of her efforts to play with time, to move back and forth and play out intergenerational conflicts. It is clever and creative, but for my tastes, a bit too clever by half. I'm an old guy. I'm not as old as Egan's oldest character, Lou, but I'm older than Bennie, who appears to be the thread that weaves through a series of related but disparate vignettes about people who I would like to care about, but don't. I feel nothing as Lou languishes on his deathbed. I'm not involved in Bennie's divorces or in his inability to make Sasha. I don't find myself caring whether Rob sinks or swims. Or whether Sasha controls herkleptomania. I am amused by the general and starlet, but I find myself hungering for more.<br /><br />What I look for in a novel, besides captivating writing is a story I can relate to. A story I can learn something from. I look for take-away. Now I am convinced that some readers have and will achieve take away from Goon Squad. An imagining of Naples thirty years ago. The recording industry in the `80s. A contemporary club scene. Different perspectives and means of expression based upon one's generation. But that's not what I mean by take away. What I want is the author's insights, experience and research into subjects that mean something to me in my incipient dotage. And in that respect, Egan's observations have not provided me with something I don't know viscerally. She got a lot of things right, but scored low on profundity. But maybe that's a jaded me, and she is telling readers and critics who inhabit a later generation things they didn't know or haven't considered. The truth, we come to learn over time, is that there is really very little that is new in human behavior. The tools may be different, but the goals are the same, as are the motivations. We fool ourselves to think otherwise because of advanced technology. In the end we're still nothing more than cavemen, but with electronic clubs. So I got no take away from this book. I didn't learn something that will open a new vista for me.<br /><br />Beyond that, I don't think Egan dished out a full plate. I wanted to know the how and why of several relationships, beginning and ending. There was plenty of foreplay and titillation, but I got no bang for my buck. Egan had something else on her mind than completing a story. I'm not sure what it was.<br /><br />So all in all, we have an excellent writer with great observation/narration skills, able to tell short stories. And the stories seem to have been put together for a purpose but other than playing with concepts that purpose escapes me. Many readers and criticsfound more meaning in this work than I did. Some books work for you while others do not. I want to be fair. It's a very good book and most people will find it entertaining, worth their time. I did. But it's not worth the time to get into a big discussion about. It's not a book that I'd put on a list of \\"must reads.\\" So it's a four.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|The product arrived in excelent conditions and in two weeks (i live in Argentina). Brand new, sealed box, i strongly recomend this product. The best of all, i didn´t have to pay for any taxes at all. I know, most of you don´t care about this last detail, but for those who are buying from here its an important fact.

0345803485|1.0|I read the review in Time magazine and bought the book prior to reading the reviews in Amazon. What a mistake. The more I read the more I was wondering if the book was written by someone who never had \\"hot\\" sex. What a match in heaven. The gorgeous virgin and the hot 27 year old billionaire who we never find out how he created his empire. There was not one moment in the entire book that felt sensual or realistic.  It felt more like an instruction booklet for sex positions. I guess in the next book we will find out why he is so messed up but not why she is so pathetic and willing to throw away her self respect 5 minutes after meeting him.  If I had a daughter I will definitely want her to walk away from any \\"hot billionaire \\" who wants to insert metallic balls inside her a week after loosing her virginity. There talks about making a movie. Really? If you take out the boring sex scenes you will have nothing left.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can`t speak for anybody else, and i`m not an expert on writing books of any kind, but I thought book 1 was good and 2 was great. I`m just starting book 3 and I can`t wait to see what happens. EL James may not be the best author and maybe she may not have everything  correct, but damn she has one hell of an imaginaton. I was hooked from page one of book one. These books are written for fun. Thats what fiction is all about. Thats what romance novels are all about.  Im sure all women and maybe even some men wish that life could be like Ana and Christian's but thats not real life. So if you need a little enjoyment in your life or a little lift in the bedroom or just a good reason to escape for a few hours, read these books and enjoy. I`ll let you know how book 3 turns out. Note: These books are nothing like the Twilight Series.
B004TSXUWY|5.0|This is a wonderful adventure that leads the reader to protagonist's lonely struggle for self-identity, trust and love. A page turner, yet thought provoking, chilling.

B0071R43MG|4.0|If you're looking at this you probably know Satch and his music. I saw this tour in two different venues and this is similar. Small, intimate, and up front. Though the True HD 7.1 is good, I think the small venue tended to suck up some of the sound. All in all the mix is good but the surround rear channels don't do too much except filler. The video is clear and unsaturated and for the most part top notch. Some camera shaking here and there but not overly annoying. Song selection is OK but we all have favorites we'd rather hear and see.<br /><br />The only negatives for me are...3D...not sure why he bothered. Haven't watched it and probably won't. And...<br /><br />A: Keyboards....eh....Mike Keneally is competent enough but just not sure how much it lends to Joes repertoire.<br />B: Alan Whitman....even less of an eh...Sort of reminds me of Glenn Hughes. Just as an annoying stage presence only not as good.<br />C: Galen Henson...just never seems happy to be there. Sort of the bastard step child of the band.<br /><br />Joe and Jeff Campitelli put in great performances as usual. These two have played together for a while now and it shows. They definitely make the show.<br /><br />If you're a Satriani fan. Buy it. You'll like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is such a good book I couldn't put it down and I am going to reading the entire series,also one of the first books I want to read again and again
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The pros in the game are pretty awesome: you can level up easily by buying fun structures where you can collect money every 30 secs; there's a Scrat mini game within the take where you can win pretty amazing animals that you normally have to purchase with acorns and c'mon who doesn't love the pack and wishes they could be a part of it?<br /><br />Now the cons. Lately, I've been. having problems opening up the game. I'm not talking abut FC and having too much memory crammed in my kindle fire. Noooo, I'm talking abut simply being able to open it and playing. I don't want to start over since I've been playing it obsessively for weeks now. I would rather explore other games than do that insanity. So please, fix your game before you start losing players in droves!
0345803485|1.0|This book is dangerous! Grey is an obvious narcissist. Yeah, the sex might be great but narcisstic abuse is soul killing. So if you read this book and look to meet someone like Grey, dont! Grey only exists in fiction. A real narcissist cannot love, feel empathy or commit. He will abuse you mentally, emotionally, spiritually and maybe physically. Real narcissists cannot change. So if you meet someone like Grey, RUN!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I purchased this free book to try out my new Kindle.<br />This book is a true classic and every bit as enjoyable<br />a read as when I first read it forty years ago!

B004A8ZX28|3.0|I didn't figure this one out very early, but I still wasn't convinced by the revelations towards the end. Liam Neeson just can't play a bad guy if he tried. He's too sweet. I figured we were in for yet another amnesia movie, but at least there are a few twists here to keep it interesting. Variably ok entertainment, but you will quickly forget you ever saw it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it.  distracts me from reading books on my Kindle Fire also a great product with my Amazon cover/stand.  thank you Amazon
1932100660|5.0|The authors of The China Study have obviously spent hours of research, compiling their findings, and organizing this information so that the public can educate themselves and have an happy and healthy life.  There is an obesity epidemic in the USA and so much disease is caused by diet.  Kudos for having the courage to tell the truth.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it love all the different missions that you can play. love creating families keeps it all intresting. needs to maybe move a little faster.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler lowered the average temp of my Core2Quad Q6700 by 15 Degrees over the stock Intel Cooler. Installation was pretty straight forward.  I love that the brackets, screws, and rubber vibration dampening was included for adding a second fan.  That's a nice touch.
B007549W62|2.0|The US is being bombed and in a certain apartment building, there is a mad dash to get to the basement. A small band of survivors get there and the film follows them as they try to survive and as their small semblance of society crumbles. I would say the film was ok. I didn't love it or hate it. I liked that it showed a situation I had never seen before and I am glad I watched it. However, I would not put myself through that 2 hour, soul crushing hopelessness again.<br /><br />I thought a lot of it was unrealistic. For instance, a basement is not indestructible and it's not air tight. Radiation would have gotten in regardless. The people were unbelievable as well. I don't think people would just sit by and let women get raped or let random people decide who lives and who dies. And if they do, then they deserve their fate. Nothing really put those 2 depraved men above anyone else except that they were strong enough to take control. I also don't understand why a gun was so important. There were plenty of other blunt objects and even an ax that would have done the same thing: threaten or kill the 2 men that took control. I swear these people had the worst decision making skills EVER.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that no explanation was ever given for anything. It's unknown who bombed the US and who the troops were that attacked them and kidnapped the child.<br /><br />This film was extremely bleak. There was no heroism or good decision making or hope. It was just people bickering and then torturing each other and then accepting rape and violence as a part of their daily life. I expected the visuals to be little more extreme because it was unrated. I think it would have easily gotten an R rating as is. If you want to be depressed and see a lot of horrible things happening, I would recommend this film.
B006XBSAP2|3.0|I personally find Katy Perry's \\"I will never grow up\\" attitude irritating and think that her vocals, while powerful, lack control; however I still thoroughly enjoyed the Teenage Dream album and gave that a solid four stars.<br /><br />But as much as I like the album, there are a few weaker so-so tracks on it, so I was looking forward to TEENAGE DREAM: THE COMPLETE CONFECTION, as I expected the weak points in the album to be bolstered by the new tracks.<br /><br />What prompted me to write a review for the re-release is that fact that out of the seven 'new' tracks, three have already been available to buy as MP3s for months now, AND they are just alternate versions of original album tracks. Considering that this release isn't just a case of the record label slapping a 'special edition' sticker on the album, instead getting new singles and a costly promotional tour, I was very disappointed with the wasted space filled up with multiple remixes of existing tracks that fans could have gone out and bought beforehand anyway.<br /><br />And then there's the 'new' tracks; only one [Wide Awake] is possibly a new track - the other two [Part Of Me and Dressin' Up] were left of the original Teenage Dream as they weren't deemed good enough. I'm not sure if Wide Awake is actually new, so we're possibly only getting a megamix 'fresh' and leftovers for our money. So, considering that she wanted a new edition of Teenage Dream as she \\"had fresh things she needed to say\\", she has just added three tracks that were already downloadable singles,  two or three songs that were actually recorded over two years ago and one cheesy megamix. So TEENAGE DREAM: THE COMPLETE CONFECTION isn't about sharing new experiences or feelings via song, it's purely an excuse to milk more money out of her fans.<br /><br />At the end of the day, if you already own Teenage Dream then there is no need to go out  and buy TEENAGE DREAM: THE COMPLETE CONFECTION. I pre-ordered my copy before the final track list was confirmed and forgot about it, so I'm now kicking myself over the wasted money. Owners of the original album, only really need to spend 79p on the MP3 of Wide Awake, as that's the only substantial new track to be found on the new edition of the album. Everything else 'new' is padding, which only highlights the original album's weak spots.<br /><br />If you don't already own Teenage Dream, then yes, TEENAGE DREAM: THE COMPLETE CONFECTION is something to consider buying. But be aware that most of the tracks are more radio-friendly and bubblegum, then the songs on Katy's first albums; Katy Hudson and One Of The Boys.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Teenage Dream<br />The title track is about Katy discovering that boys can be more then just friends and the dizzying rush of your first love. The lyrics tell a story, as opposed to being empty and emotionless noise. As the lyrics are telling a story I didn't find them instantly memorable, so this song took a little while to grow on me, but now this is one of my favourite song's on the album. She sticks to the guitar lead, pop/rock music from her 'One Of The Boys' era.<br />Apparently Katy and the other writers had to write at least two or three versions of the song, to get the 'forever young' vibe without -being too cheesy or it being too uncomfortably 'Lolita' sexy.<br /><br />Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)<br />Katy s referred to this being a almost 'Waking Up in Vegas 2' song. She is  recalling one of her booze and fun-filled Friday nights, which features a menage a trois - but unfortunately for her male fans [and a portion of female fans] Katy says that's the only bit of the song that isn't based on real events.<br />When I sit here trying to break the song down to review it I can't find anything valid to say about it; the lyrics are upbeat, easy to remember, but are rather shallow. You could instantly see that this would be a single though, as the combination of the catchy lyrics and 'pop pretending to be serious' music is very radio friendly.<br /><br />California Gurls (feat. Snoop Dogg)<br />This is pure, electro-tinged pop, that Katy has called a response to Jay Z's and Alicia Key's single 'Empire State Of Mind'. Katy's LA version is basically about how wonderful and hot the girls are in California. The singles success was more to do to it having simple lyrics that get stuck in your head, rather then with the song having any message in it, so it reminds me of Last Friday Night in it's shallowness.<br />Still; it does get stuck in my head, so point Team Perry. This is the type of music I'm thinking of when I use the label 'guilty pleasure'; fun, catchy, but there is nothing substantial to be found in it.<br /><br />Firework<br />Katy admitted that she was inspired by On The Road by Jack Kerouac  [shown to her by Russell Brand, who told her that what she was for him]: 'I want to be around people that are buzzing and fizzing and never say a commonplace thing and shoot across the sky and make everybody go ah'. It's a song that she wants other people to adopt as a inspiring anthem to encourage their inner strengths.<br />Katy's vocals are perfectly suited to this song - the strength of her vocals showcases her passion.  I think this track would be at home on Katy's 'One Of The Boys' album as the passion and more meaty lyrics stick out from most of the other songs on this album.<br /><br />Peacock<br />I find this similar to 'California Gurls' in that the music is electro-tinged rock/pop and the lyrics are simple and get annoyingly stuck in my head. The whole thing is basically Katy asking to see a guy's \\"Peacock\\". I personally just find it cringe worthy,  rather then  funny like Katy. Her record label didn't want it on the album, but Katy called them idiots and put her foot down. Sorry, but I agree with them - she did this live on her world tour and that didn't change my mind.<br />Oh; The spoken verse is amazingly embarrassing \\"Oh my God no exaggeration, boy all this time was worth the waiting, I just shed a tear, I am so unprepared, You've got the finest architecture, End of the rainbow lookin' treasure, such a sight to see, And it's all for me\\". I tried to imagine myself saying the lines, but I don't think I could - even if someone was holding a gun to my head...<br /><br />Circle The Drain<br />This track tells us the story of how Katy's ex-fiance's drug addition eroded their relationship, to the point where she had to leave as she couldn't bear to stick around and watch him self-destruct and \\"circle the drain\\". Travie McCoy had this to say for the song; \\"I heard she put out a song that's about me, or about some old habits or whatever. I look at it like this: I'm just stoked that she finally has a song with some substance on her record. Good job.\\"<br />The rockier music really suits her somewhat shouty vocals and is a bit different to the other tracks, so I loved it at first. However the line of the bridge where she informs us that Travis \\"Fell asleep during foreplay\\" is a low blow and bitchy. Humiliating someone in public is just not a nice thing to do.<br /><br />The One That Got Away<br />We once again return to classic Katy Perry with pop/rock music [this time it's drum lead, rather then guitar lead for a change] and lyrics that, once again, tell us a story: about when you promise someone forever, but you end up not being able to follow through. Katy says that most of us will be familiar with the meaning of the song, in this Facebook stalking era.<br />I think the track's style is very similar to 'Teenage Dream' in the way it is telling a story from Katy's past, but it falls slightly short of the mark for me. I'm not sure why, I think that maybe the music doesn't go with it? Either way I skip over this version [see below for more].<br /><br /> E.T.<br />The song was originally intended to go to Three 6 Mafia, but Katy fell in love with it instead. Katy said that the song is about 'foreign love' and  it's another electro favoured track, thatis futuristic and alienistic, like the lyrics.<br />I think of this as being Peacock: Part II. Funnily enough I've recently read that this was released instead of Peacock as a regular single at the last minute; this song was also a promotional single on Itunes before the album's release, so wasn't considered for a regular release until fans spoke up in it's favour [the regular single version is further down].<br /><br />Who Am I Living For?<br />I tend to think of the lyrics are about Katy finding self-confidence and strength in dealing with her increasingly public life, but most fans think it is actually about spirituality and faith.<br />Another soft-sync production which raise my opinion of the track. The style is a nice fit for her vocals, but the meaning of the lyrics isn't clear for me, so it becomes empty noise for me.<br /><br />Pearl<br />The song is about how a woman who used to be strong has now become stuck. Stuck by what or who? I used to have questions about it, so could never just sit and listen to the song; is it someone Katy knows in her personal life or is it a public figure? Katy has since said it's about herself, so I guess that it's about being stuck in a dead-end relationship.<br />This track also has a slick soft-synths and lyrics that aren't immediately clear to me, so placing it next to 'Who Am I Living For' is a mistake. It's too samey and, ultimately, forgettable. Another track that I skip over.<br /><br />Hummingbird Heartbeat<br />I'll just let Katy explain it: \\"I was at breakfast when I saw this hummingbird, and hummingbird was having breakfast as well...and I don't know if you know but hummingbirds are supposedly good luck and I was just thinking about hummingbirds. I was thinking 'How fast does their heart beat?' , like 'how many beats per minute?' And using that idea as an idea for someone making you feel, instead of those butterflies, making your heart beat really, really fast.\\"<br />I've not got anything really useful to say about this track; I always found it OK and 80s sounding, so I don't skip it, but it wasn't very memorable until she used it as the opening song in her world tour.<br /><br />Not Like The Movies<br />Katy has said that part of this song was inspired by meeting Russell Brand [she started a rough draft before she met him, but finished it after], but the lyrics don't match up with meeting him. It actually sounds like she talking about how she accepted her ex' marriage proposal, even though she had doubts right from the start; After all it didn't feel the way the movies depict it.<br />I personally think that Katy's strong vocals aren't really suited to slower, ballad type tracks, but the strong lyrical content, paired with the pared down piano driven music make this a standout track. It was the first promotional single for the album.<br /><br />The One That Got Away (Acoustic)<br />The song is the same as the single version, but Katy rerecorded it in a studio and she also played the acoustic guitar for it. I find the original version a 'skipper', but the music on this version really suits the song, so I started to pay more attention to the substantial lyrics, so the song has really grown on me now.<br /><br />Part Of Me<br />I'll be honest; when I heard this was going to be the first single from the updated album I was disappointed. It's a so-so song; not bad,  but is a generic break-up anthem. Maybe I'm being cynical, but this seems to be a \\"I'm the brave victim, having my heart crushed by the big, bad man\\" sympathy play for #1...<br />The song is actually a few years old now and had leaked, but Katy re-recorded it with angrier vocals and replaced the original line in the central breakdown [you can keep the dog from me, I never really liked it anyway] with \\"You can keep the diamond ring, it doesn't mean anything anyway\\". Getting one last dig at the man who didn't take your money in your divorce, signed the house over to you and hasn't said a single negative word about you? Classy move.<br /><br />Wide Awake<br />Katy's picking herself up from the floor, after her heartbreak. I prefer this break-up song much more then Circle The Drain or Part Of Me, as Katy isn't trying to embarrass her former partner, or cattily having the last word. That this track lacks the bitterness of the former two tracks makes this one seem more 'grown up' and gives it more depth, as it doesn't seem like the outburst of someone spitting their dummy out after not getting their own way.<br />The music is slower and almost ballad-like, but the drum beat and soft synths suit her vocals more then Not Like The Movies.<br /><br />Dressin' Up<br />This is possibly going to be a single. Katy calls this both cute and Prince-inspired. Erm, I've got nothing to add; it's another so-so track, I'm afraid. Tonight is someones lucky night, because Katy's in the mood to break out her naughty nurse costume...<br />It again uses easy to remember lyrics paired up with upbeat pop/rock music, so it will no doubt do well if it does get a single release, but like California Gurls and Last Friday Night the lights are on, but nobody's home.<br /><br />E.T. (feat. Kanye West)<br />The original album version was good-but-not-great, and it was also a promotional single before the album was released, so Kanye's two verses really add the X factor, previously missing, to the song. The music always lent towards hip hop, but it was only after Kanye added his spark that it really became noticeable.<br />I was disappointed to find that this is the single mix; the version on the music video contains an extra verse, so it would have been nice to get that rather then one that's been available to buy since last year.<br /><br />Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) [feat. Missy Elliott]<br />I can't really explain myself clearly, but I just don't think that Missy rapping goes well with Katy's bubblegum track. The rap was just clearly edited into the pre-existing song, whilst on E.T. it was recorded and made to measure. The result doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Tommie Sunshine's Megasix Smash-Up<br />There's not too much to say for this; the track is a mash-up of the six original Teenage Dream album's singles; Caliornia Gurls, Teenage Dream, Firework, E.T., Last Friday Night and The One That Got Away.<br />It's not especially great mix, but it's not particularly bad. It reminds me of album mega-mixes that artists would include on single releases to create buzz.is futuristic and alienistic, like the lyrics.<br />I think of this as being Peacock: Part II.

0385342039|4.0|Audio-This was not the funny story I have grown used to from Sophia Kinsella. It had it's funny parts, but it had a feeling of melancholy through much of the book.

(What a mess.)<br />Sadie is her Great Aunt, she has just died at the age of 105 in a nursing home. She wants something, something that was hers and now it's lost.  She in a funny lighthearted character that shows up in her twenties.<br />The two of them engage in all kinds of craziness. The search opens many new doors, and slams a few others closed. Lara has a chance to learn of her heritage and learn her own heart in this journey. Perhaps even give up her obsession with her ex ?<br />I enjoyed this book immensely. It was so close to my own life, with her job, her partner, her love, her obsession. I can't wait to read another book from this author.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This is a great little case for the Kindle. It is not bulk like some that I have seen. The stand function can be a little wobbly, but that would be my only complaint. It works great for me since I carry the Kindle with me in my purse most days.
B004RE29WW|5.0|some people thought this one didn't live up to the others. I thought it was great!!!! Buy It!!!!!! Yes, I have all of the Alien series. Great movies....
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is very fun, and is one of my favorite apps. i see a couple things i dont really like about it, but it doesnt really affect much. the only thing that i would change is the coin prices, cause i think it takes forever. but overall this is a pretty entertaining game, and is fun if you have a little spare time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|the only thing that i would want is more!  there are some games on the ipad version that are missing from this version.  overall great!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I was very disappointed with their last album, \\"The Open Door\\".  There were a couple good songs, but as a whole it just wasn't nearly as good as \\"Fallen\\" was.  \\"Evanescence\\" is MUCH better than \\"The Open Door\\" is... there is much more energy in the songs, and just the right amount of orchestration (especially keyboard), which is what made \\"Fallen\\" so good.  \\"Evanescence\\" not only goes back to what made \\"Fallen\\" great, but builds on it.  Possibly their best album, though it is hard to say, as \\"Fallen\\" was so amazing.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I have been playing long enough to realize that you don't have to spend money to get what you want love it I recommend this game...
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|but I had the free version now I need to delete the free one but the icons are identical.  So how do I tell which to delete?  Fun if you like doodling its nice you can play via.facebook ...makes it awesome for playing with friends and family who also like playing.  If the icons have something to differentiate free and paid it would be 5 stars. (kindle fire)
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|This DVD was good quality and showed well. However it was odd because it did not respond to my video game consoles when I tried to use them to play the DVD it only worked in the DVD player alone which I thought was odd. Other than that it was a great buy for the price.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm so angry that I wasted my time and money on this waste of a book. I wish i would have known that this book is a porno that sounds like it's written by a 15 year old girl. I have no clue how this book got any good reviews at all!
B005FMZWD8|5.0|this is my second invicta watche.what i love about these watches is that they are always noticable.beautiful dispaly and a nice watch.the force collection and the russian diver are definitely my favourite invicta watches.the only thing in this watch is that it has cloth straps which it shouldnt be a problem for any one and u can change it and put what ever u like.im actually satisfied with the cloth strap.altogether a very good watch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very interesting and imaginative game hope you keep adding to it too keep us entertained<br />has a cool storyline its neat that u can watch the theatre
B003L77GRO|5.0|I definitely enjoy the Dexter series.  I order the next season as soon as I finish watching my current one.  I am in the process of purchasing the sixth season as soon as it is released.  In my opinion, Dexter is a \\"good\\" serial killer because his victims are not the innocent.
B00004YRQA|4.0|Its good and cheap Gamestop carged  me 20$ bucks but Amazon only charged me 5$ its great just in case you  wondering what it is it saves your game progress on ps2!
0345803485|5.0|This book....hands down is the best book I've read this year. I couldn't put it down. I didn't think there was anything wrong with the writing at all...I found it easy to read and extremely entertaining for sure. It's fiction guys.....fiction means fake, so don't be so hard on this book....it's erotic fictional romance. It's a fantasy and a GREAT FANTASY at that! Christian Grey is a yummy morsel that every woman I know would love to have a piece of.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|James' writing is akin to the skill of a master fisherman as he seeks his quarry. She entices you with her superb prose, sets the hook with an intriguing story line, and sends you twisting and squirming as you rush head long to the ending.<br /><br />She's gotchaaaaaaaaa almost panting to see what happens in the final saga.<br /><br />Book three - anticipation can be almost seductive.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|My boyfriend was excited to have me read this book since he heard so many women raving about it. It was a fun read and had all the good sex that was promised by most review I read before purchasing it. I debate about getting book 2 or 3 since there isn't a deep plot so I'm sure the next 2 will have some good sex but may not have much else to keep me interested and reading.
B002ZG99NG|3.0|The actors, especially the leads, were solid, the plot was pretty good and the action scenes were intense (particularly the car chase through the North End). But in the end, the sum of these parts added up to an average movie.<br /><br />For starters, this movie is derivative of \\"Heat\\" is almost every way, a point that is hammered home when Affleck's Doug MacRay watches that movie during a brief scene. There's the obligatory stakeout scene with the feds watching the crew, a hardass cop hellbent on bringing the crew down, the narrow miss between the cops and the robbers, and the third party feeding the crew their jobs (all elements ripped from \\"Heat\\"). There's also the \\"one final heist\\" (ripped from every crime movie ever).<br /><br />However, \\"The Town\\" doesn't feature the same character development, pacing or tension that made \\"Heat\\" such a great film.<br /><br />It was never clear why MacRay was so enamored of Rebecca Hall's Claire Keesey, other than she represents a straight life that he yearns for. But she is also the one person who can put him and his crew in jail, which one would think would kind of put a damper on things.<br /><br />MacRay and Jeremy Renner's Jimmy Coughlin are the main characters in the movie and the viewer gets to know them best, but this comes at the expense of the other two guys on the crew, Gloansy and Desmond Eldon. At the end of the film the only thing the viewer can say with certainty is they were bank robbers; we know nothing of their families/friends.<br /><br />Pacing wise, the movie falls into a pattern of robbery - Doug and Claire doing whatever - Jon Hamm (Agent Frawley) pursuing the crew (and failing) - robbery. It never really breaks from this cycle and it gets kind of monotonous.<br /><br />It seems like there might have been a deeper story about MacRay's past addictions and how that would be effecting his current mood in the film, but that is hardly explored. Even in the extended edition it accounts for just one scene (he snorts Oxy) but then everything is back to the way it was. It would have been best if this was fleshed out or left out altogether.<br /><br />On the plus side, Affleck does a wonderful job of featuring the Boston scenery and, as one other reviewer pointed out, really turns the city into another character. Affleck, Renner and Blake Lively turn in solid performances (Lively is almost unrecognizable as Coughlin's addict sister). Hamm's role seemed like a wasted role, and if not that then certainly one-dimensional.<br /><br />All in all not a terrible movie, but not a great one either.orts Oxy) but then everything is back to the way it was.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this little gem not expecting much. I mainly purchased it for compactness and lightweight.  I thought it would be mainly a rarely used item resting on a key chain, survival necklace, or in a pocket.  I have used it to keep a good, sharp edge on all every knife in my house.  I have used it to resharpen an entire set of kitchen cutlery, chefs knives, utility knives, two cold steel recon 1 knives, 3 pocket knives, a Mora knife and a couple of bowie knives.  It is light enough to not ever have one on your person at all times when in the outdoors and does a nice job of keeping an edge on a knife.  I used to sharpen knives for a living and know exactly what it takes get a good cutting edge.  This little tool does a lot of work in a small package.  Take it from an old pro.  The Smith's Pocket Sharpener is well worth the investment and should be part of everyone's outdoor or kitchen gear.
B007MGWBU2|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but Amazon streaming ruined it in the end. I wasn't able to watch the finale song or anything following it since halfway through the big final scene the \\"buffering\\" message appeared and after waiting 15 minutes, I gave up.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book was suggested as I liked Fifty Shades of Grey, it was nothing like it!!  I may have enjoyed this when I was 15!  It was stupid and a total waste of 2.99!!
B000BP86OG|5.0|I'm writing this review almost 6 years after the album was released because, since then, it's really growing on me (intended). I listen to this album at least as much as Permission To Land and at this point I'd rate them as equal. It's a bit more experimental than the first, but that's what I think a sophomore album should be. You can hear the band breathing a little more; they've got their fan base, a solid record deal, and plenty of money. There's less of the raw, bootstrapped rock n' roll feel to this one, but it rocks just as hard. The song-writing is just as good if not better than PTL. There's also a sense of urgency on this album that foreshadows the impending doom of the band. All the songs work together for an all-encompassing experience. It's a bit darker; a bit more anxious. It's the album you'd make if the world were ending tomorrow.<br /><br />That said, taken on a song-by-song basis, there are several classics to put in your playlist - Knockers, Hazel Eyes and Bald are my favorites, followed closely by Dinner Lady Arms and Seemed Like a Good Idea. Honestly, you can play the first 7 songs all the way through and never think about hitting the skip button. The last 3 are also very good, but they're more of a sit-down-and-really-listen bunch. If you're in the mood for them, they're perfect, which is why they're perfect for the end of the album.<br /><br />I think when Hot Cakes comes out, it'll be more stripped down and closer in feel to Permission To Land, while still marking a step forward for the band. However, ten years from now, when we look at the band's full discography, One Way Ticket won't be viewed as a lesser album at all, but as a classic which was largely overlooked at the time. This happens with a lot of classic second albums.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />For fans of The Darkness who are interested in the overall journey and not individual points in time, One Way Ticket will not disappoint.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It is a classic side scroll but the only downfall is it makes you feel that you have to purchase the game coins.
B000SEGEKI|4.0|Good book but the Kindle version has some bugs... sometimes it jumps to unexpected places when you try to go to the next page.. It does not happen to other books I have on the same Kindle just this one.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|If your trying to get the free versin for kindle in doesn't work. You have to buy it. Those who don't have any money or refuse to put in their credit card number shouldn;t even bother to try to downlaod this app. now im sad because i really wanted this app, but the Kindle Fire version is really excellent and the resolution is awesome. So much better than doing it on my phone.  [[ASIN:B007MNV5WU Angry Birds Space HD (Kindle Fire Edition)]]

B007MJKOY4|1.0|While I enjoy the author and other movies based on his stories, this one just didn't capture my interest. This was a movie I regretted paying for as an on demand movie.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This isn't a general search engine...if you want to know where Adele is performing next or you are searching for videos on YouTube, this isn't the app for you.  This is more like a calculator, science encyclopedia, or a text-driven nerdy info-fetching version of Siri.  For example, you can enter \\"derivative of x^2\\" and get \\"2x\\", or \\"weather in New York City\\" and get a display of weather there, or \\"Antares\\" and get astronomical data about the star.  It's good at what it does.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love it this season, was really amazing! Now I'm waiting for the big day of the third season. This version has subtitles options (spanish)?

B004LROUNG|3.0|Fairly well. His former books are better than this one. I have reaqd all his published books, and is not so satisfyed with the later ones.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I originally thought that The Hunger Games (trilogy) was going to be far too juvenile for me to enjoy, but I was mistaken! And, I should have bought the set right away, because I had to buy the other two books anyway! Good read. Not just for teens.
0452289963|1.0|First, this book mentions nothing about how to wake up to your life's purpose. I spent weeks getting through the audiobook version so I do not know how anyone actually read this nonsense. His voice is so monotone, his accent is annoying and he never has any inflection. It was as if he was reading instructions for installing a piece of machinery. I painfully got through his drivel hoping there would be some moment of sense or that \\"A Ha!\\" moment from a profound statement but it just is not there. He spends 9 chapters talking about the ego, none of it based on fact or experience. Finally he mentions something practical of how a person can help themselves with this knowledge but that is all is was...a mention, and back to the mindless droning. There are tons of better New Age self help books that are shorter and more insightful than this nonsensical rambling. This might be better categorized under psychosis training than self-help. You have been warned!
0345803485|1.0|This book is pure crap! It's not even great erotica....trust me, I've read a lot!  Anyone with an \\"average\\" sexual imagination,  who can write basic sentences, create flat characters...one who  can only say \\"Holy %$^ and Jeez\\"  apparently can make millions with this junk.  She's laughing all the way to the bank! I only wish I'd written it!

0670023329|5.0|Having studied genocide and some of the world's greatest atrocities as a political science major I didn't think I could ever be startled. Escape from Camp 14 reminds you that \\"Never Again\\" is still just an empty promise. Absolutely a riveting tale that should be read in every high school throughout the world until the world decides that the phrase \\"Never Again\\" actually means something.
B00007BK2N|2.0|24 Hour Party People is basically about one man (a news reporter) who walks around Manchester England and explains the significance of the punk movement from the 70's with such groundbreaking artists as the Sex Pistols, Joy Division, New Order and several others.  The problem is that everything is a big party scene and nothing else.<br /><br />You have a man cheating on his wife, the wife cheating on him, back alley parties in vans, admiring and getting inside scoops on certain bands, getting a general idea what the people around Manchester are like, and that about covers it.<br /><br />Unfortunately nothing ever particularly compelling or memorable occurs so a film like this is probably only worthwhile to those who are *heavily* interested in the early days of the punk movement.  If you're expecting a satisfying drama or comedy, you might wanna look elsewhere.  Only the short concert footage snippets are worth your time.  Avoid.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|Definitely as good, imho, as the Fillmore East show. They were all on their game and the energy of those Fillmore shows is reflected here, and it rivals any of the great live shows. A must-have recording.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very easy to work with and has so many features. I can't believe it's free. Its easy to understand and the highlighting and bookmark features work well.<br />The only thing I would like to suggest is making the notes feature easier to use when you are reading. It would be so helpful when listening to a sermon if the notes were easier to get to.<br />Thank you for creating such a comprehensive app,  keep up the good work!
B007TNS6JI|1.0|The game never opened. It would give a force close error then go back to the apps screen. Too bad. Really wanted to play it.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Didn't think I was interested in the Millenium Trilogy, but boy, was I wrong.  Authentic, layered, with intense and complicated characters who make one question conventional morality.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|I am a massive Phantom of the Opera fan so it was only natural that I was a little scared when watching this musical for the first time, but I need'nt have been it was fantastic. ALW has created the second musical with the same magical formula that the original did, only this time he has managed to include parts of the original that actually help this one. In various points in LND you hear notes or lines from POTO which underscore the story he is trying to tell without altering this story. this means that people who have not seen POTO can watch LND without needing the backstory, while those that have can get the extra layers that the music provides.<br />the actual recording of this musical is good, it focuses on the people singing or those using the fantastic sets. the only reason I have not given this musical 5 stars is because I  think they filmed the wrong one. Don't get me wrong I think that Ben Lewis is a great phantom but Ramin Karilroo (sorry about the spelling) is simply fabulous, if they wanted a movie version of this it should have been with him as the phantom.
B000MG1YC0|5.0|At first this album really left a bad taste in my mouth. It sounded like all the other generic female fronted bands out there. After putting it aside for a little while in disgust of what it did to my ears and tummy I started hearing songs in my head at work one night. I could not figure out what these songs were and why i knew them so well in my brain. So i went home and dug through my collection and low and behold it was the album i thought was complete poopy by one of my all time favorite songwritters. Now I kick myself every time I listen to it for not enjoying it those many months it collected dust. i usually dont like my metal this poppy. Morten and company put out their most beautiful, melodic, catchy, and all around fantastic album with this one.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Yes, Yes, Dropbox is nice, but it doesn't work for my Kindle Fire, and until I can tranfer photos through the amazon cloud, this is my go to app. This works great for transfering photos from tablet to phone, phone to computer, and vice versa. Yes, you can plug your Fire in to the computer to transfer photos, but this is just easier without the wire, and it is a super quick transfer. A quick and easy app that I didn't mind paying for. Does exactly what it is supposed to, without any problems.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|A great indie film, better than the majority of high budget films that came out around the same time. I strongly recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|been waiting since I got my Kindle Fire at Christmas! what took so long? Draw Something is way easier on my Kindle than my iPhone.
B006YC74E8|5.0|Great photo editor, I have had better ones for my phone, but this seems to work great on the kindle Fire. Does everything I need it to do. I like the fact when you long hold a pic, that it gives you the option to share to the editor app. This quickens the process of opening up the app for editiong. I also like the fact that you can overwrite an edited pic, or save it as a new pic.<br /> All in all a very good picture editor for the Fire.

0345803485|1.0|Maybe there are 50 shades of grey but the are ALL boring and badly written.  No deepth, no emotion, no intimacy.  I guess my sexual appetite is just a little more sophsticated.  What a joke.
0345522478|4.0|I was very skeptical at first about reading this book. Druids in my mind are old guys walking around with hoods on, lol. I'm use to the druids from the shannara series so I didn't know what to expect. I was very pleased with this book, it grabbed your attention from the beginning and the rollercoaster didn't slow down until the end and even then it started to roll again before you could get off completely. I think this is going to be a great series.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This is such a fun game when it doesn't glitch.<br />  Basically you get to collect from some buildings every certain amount of time. If you turn your kindle off, then, every thing that isn't ready to be collected from won't be ready to be collected from for like 300 or more hours.<br />  Fun but very glitchy :'(
B007SGM084|5.0|one of the best trilogys i have read. very hot very emotional. great story . loved the books very well written.....laters baby
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Bared to You is a dark, intense emotional romance. After I finished I wished there was more and I'm glad Ms. Day is going to be writing a sequel (according to her website). The end was on a note of hope but there is still a lot Eva and Gideon need to work through and it couldn't have been wrapped up in one book so I'm very thankful the author didn't rush the ending.<br /><br />As the story starts, Eva has moved to New York from California where she's taken a new job at an ad agency. She works in a huge building and since she's in a new city she's working out how long it will take her to get to work by walking there before her actual first day. When she's at the new building she'll be working at (Crossfire) she sees this woman drop a bunch of change and stops to help her out. While she's doing this, she `meets' Gideon for the first time. Their eyes connect and it's like this electric energy sparks between them. Even though he learns her name (from her fallen name badge) she has no idea he's the uber wealthy man who owns the building she's in. The next time they meet is in a meeting with her boss at the ad agency. Gideon's focus is on her the entire time and even though she's an assistant, he asks for her opinion and it's pretty obvious he wants her in a bad way. After the meeting he blatantly propositions her in a sort of dirty way. It's very blunt and she mocks him and calls him out on it, which I thought was brilliant. She's turned on by him but she doesn't like feeling like \\"a vagina with legs\\" as she tells her best friend later.<br /><br />*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br /><br />Eva has suffered from sexual abuse, something that's easily identifiable early on in the book. It's clear from the way she reacts to things. It's also very clear that Gideon has suffered from abuse though things are never fully explained in this book. In fact, there are a lot of loose ends in this book so I'm very excited there will be a sequel.<br /><br />Gideon is very wealthy and not used to hearing no so when Eva makes it clear she's not going to just drop her panties for him, he starts making adjustments because he wants her in his life. At first it's almost like he can't admit it to himself just how much he desires her for more than sex. There's a scene early on where he pulls away from her emotionally after a very intimate moment between them. After he pulls away their relationship could have gone either way afterward. Luckily, Gideon got it together. Eva is jealous and emotional and I liked that she let him know this upfront. She also had a habit of running from her problems, which could have been annoying since she ran almost every time Gideon screwed up or she got scared (in the beginning), but considering the abuse she suffered, it was clear that this was the way she handled things. I like that she owned up to it and acknowledged that while it wasn't the best way to handle things, it was her way and she was working on communicating better.<br /><br />One thing I really liked was that when Gideon committed, he full on did. He really screwed up a few times and it's clear that he has never had a real relationship, but he's apologetic when he does stupid things and he tries so hard to make things right with Eva. So while he's a very alpha male and had some control issues, he's not a jerk. He was almost like an adolescent trying to figure out his first `real' relationship.<br /><br />There are some interesting secondary characters I hope we get to see more of in the next book and I really hope we get to learn more about Gideon in the next book. That would be my only complaint about this book; there wasn't enough revealed about Gideon. I understand why Eva didn't push him too much. As a survivor of abuse, it was pretty obvious she was letting him tell her things in his own time.<br /><br />So, if you like darker, sensual romances with a slight hint of domination and submission, this is a great, emotional book. And even though I really want to see what happens next, I don't feel like this book is incomplete and I'm not dissatisfied with the ending.<br /><br />A side note: I've seen some comparisons with Bared to You and the 50 Shades trilogy and I just don't see the huge similarities. I really enjoyed the 50 books and plan to review them soon also, but there really aren't any more similarities in these books than a lot of other romances (like super Alpha heroes which is very common in Harlequin Presents books). The two heroines, Eva and Ana (from 50), are wildly different. Where Ana was super virginal and innocent, Eva is none of those things. She's more worldly, driven in her career and dealt with a seriously messed up childhood. Eva is also a wealthy socialite so to speak so there's no `class issues' unlike Ana who was always uncomfortable with Christian's wealth in the 50 books. Not to mention the sex in the 50 books is kinkier and more in line with the actual BDSM lifestyle whereas there was a dominant/submissive feel to Bared to You, but there wasn't any actual bondage or sadism or anything kinky. There are a lot more differences and I'm not going to do a complete breakdown of why these books are different because I want this to be about Bared to You. I've just found it interesting that so many people are comparing them and I've been trying to figure out why. I feel like I'm missing something.appens next, I don't feel like this book is incomplete and I'm not dissatisfied with the ending.<br /><br />A side note: I've seen some comparisons with Bared to You and the 50 Shades trilogy and I just don't see the huge similarities.

Eva is also a wealthy socialite so to speak so there's no `class issues' unlike Ana who was always uncomfortable with Christian's wealth in the 50 books. Not to mention the sex in the 50 books is kinkier and more in line with the actual BDSM lifestyle whereas there was a dominant/submissive feel to Bared to You, but there wasn't any actual bondage or sadism or anything kinky. There are a lot more differences and I'm not going to do a complete breakdown of why these books are different because I want this to be about Bared to You. I've just found it interesting that so many people are comparing them and I've been trying to figure out why. I feel like I'm missing something.

B0026772N8|5.0|I read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance in the 1970's. It was hard to read at times and yet I could not get enough of it. This is one of the books that changed the direction of my life and how I look at the world. I love having it on my Kindle, to refer to,and reread it, much like I do with Moby Dick also on my Kindle.
B005H29GSI|5.0|My 4 year old son plays with it every day, although a little obsessed...<br />I do recommend getting two sets though, it gives the kids more options to built things on their own and you can then loose a few pieces without it affecting the game-play.<br />I should add that my kids 4, 6 have never ever completed a full game, they rather just free play and its great.

B007T2XC7A|5.0|I really only know a few of Norah's most famous songs, but I was really interested in getting this album for some reason (and for $5, everyone should get it). Norah has an amazing voice, there's no doubt about that, so I was looking to see how this album differed from the few songs that I know; this album blew me out of the water. I absolutely love it. This is definitely a different direction from her past songs, and I think \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" succeeds. There really are no bad songs on the album. My favorites include: \\"Happy Pills,\\" \\"Miriam,\\" \\"Good Morning,\\" \\"Say Goodbye,\\" \\"She's 22\\" and the title track (but really, all are great). I may have to check out Norah's other albums and see if I like them just as much as I like \\"Little Broken Hearts.\\" It's nice to listen to someone nowadays who has a fantastic voice and doesn't solely rely on the computer to make who they are as an artist. Norah has a wonderful voice, and I'm definitely looking forward to listening to more of her music.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|The Name of the Wind by Patick Rothfuss is a story within a story. The main character Kvothe tells the story of his life to Chronicler who writes it all down. From early childhood and on our protagonist Kvothe excels at everything he does. If it takes a normal person a year to learn something, he does it in a week. Kvothe is so good and smart you just want to punch him in the face. Everything works out for him in the end and he always has the answer. Combine this character with the epic length of book you would assume you have quite a bit of adventure happening. Wrong epic length is matched by its epic slowness leaving readers with a huge amount of time put into reading the book and very little coming out of it. Now I'm not saying Patick Rothfuss is a poor writer, I'm just saying The Name of the Wind is not the great story everyone keeps talking about in the fantasy book community. The world Rothfuss has created is a little on the plain side and at times may be boring to read about. Readers beware you are in for a long ride, this is only the first book in the series and there seems to be a lack of a feeling of closure when you finish this book. I would only recommend this to diehard fantasy readers.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Unfortunately i was super excited to go see this movie in theaters, and was super disappointed.  they used the music from ocean's 11 to mission impossible action.  and it was silent during some fight scenes. good parts  completely given away in trailers. the actors were fine, some of my favorites to this day, i would even like to see the break-thru-female lead in more action films, but the direction of this film was a snore. the story could have been told much better.  you could have added another hour of filming to the story and cut out the parts that you snooze through. just very disappointing all around.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great game to play with the whole family! we all enjoy it together everyday! I highly recommend it to everyone.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was very good. In the beginning you think it couldn't be him...(the son.) So interesting was the story idea about what could happen to anyone's family, well sort of. This family had some \\"issues\\" that not every family would have in their backgrounds. But it was keeping me guessing as to-did he or didn't he? It was interesting bc the dad was a lawyer, the son supposedly killed a classmate. Many twists and turns. And it took place in Newton, MA. (I am from Ma. so it was just one more interesting piece to the puzzle!)

B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|I see all these REALLY bad reviews of this movie and after reading them I think they are being a little unfair.  So here's the thing, it does have its problems. Story elements are unclear at times and I would have liked to see more of the main character discovering things for herself rather than tracking guys down and being told what was going on.  But it does have some very good things going for it.  Unlike many spy and action movies made recently it moves very quickly and is well edited (it has to, it is only an hour and a half, gasp! An hour and a half movie? These days?!) I thought Mallory was a very wooden character and that this Carano person could have used some acting lessons.  But then I watched the special features because I was bored, and that was what really made this movie better for me. It turns out Gina Carano is a lady cage fighter! I didn't even know there was such a thing.  The director was inspired to make this movie after seeing her fight on TV.  So that is why her acting isn't that great, she isn't an actress. But her fighting was amazing, and it was very refreshing to see the actress do the fighting and not a stunt double.  Also, Carano is this fascinating balance of pretty and buff.  Too often I see movies where I just can't believe that a skinny 110 pound actress is throwing big guys around.  I was a big Alias fan but I always had to smile at the fight scenes because I just didn't believe Garner could really do what she was doing. But Carano is 145 pounds of kick-ass.  She looks really strong but she still looks like she has maintained a normal female body fat ratio. In a world where female action stars are either too dainty to be believable or are so masculine that they are not fun to watch it is refreshing to see Carano take off her high heels and kick butt in a dress.  If she gets some acting lessons she could do really well. I hope to see more of her.  So, if you are in the mood for some refreshing fighting and a more artsy edited movie,don't listen to the bad reviews, go ahead and give it a watch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this game almost as much as I liked the movie. The graphics are good and the story line makes a lot of sense, especially if you have seen the movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Yep, all the 5 star reviews have it right: this workout (or series of workouts) is as impressive, challenging, and effective as they say. The ironic thing is, I wasn't even planning to embark on a workout challenge when I came across this DVD. I happened to see a \\"before/after\\" review from someone on Pinterest. The pics the user included showing her before and after body caught my eye and totally had me sold within minutes. (And like I said, I wasn't even looking for a new workout at the time - it was THAT impressive.)<br /><br />Here's what makes this series awesome:<br /><br />1) As a busy full-time working mom of a 21 month old, I couldn't be more thankful that this workout can be done in only 24 minutes a day.  TWENTY-FOUR (24!?) minutes a day to a better body? You bet. The way Jillian designed the workouts is genius. Even in Level 1 (the \\"easiest\\" but by no means \\"easy\\" level), you're working multiple muscle groups and/or doing cardio at the same time. As Jillian notes throughout the series, that concentrated focus on more than one muscle area at the same time(large and small muscles - like legs with arms) allows you to get it all done and burn more calories in less time. Who has more time to waste doing easier (but longer) workouts that won't even be as effective? Do this one and save yourself the time.<br /><br />2) The series includes 3 progressively challenging workout routines. You only do 1 routine per day, but as long as you've worked your way up to Level 3 and are ready for any of the levels (that will indeed take you some time to do) you are then free to switch around to any of the 3 workouts depending on your mood for the day. You get bored of one routine, or are ready to move to a harder level, you can move on and the other 2 workouts are there for your choosing. Unless you're already very fit, it's unlikely that you'll want to jump right to Level 3, but now that I've done all 3 levels I super-appreciate the ability to pick which one I want to do from day to day.<br /><br />3) Each level is challenging in its own way - you're not going to find any of the levels easy (again unless you're already super-fit, but even Jillian and her \\"best girls\\" are struggling on some of these moves, so maybe if you're more fit than them?!)<br /><br />4) The workouts deliver. I think the marketing materials I've read for the series actually says \\"lose up to 20 pounds in 30 days\\" - well, that's not a realistic goal for everyone, unless perhaps you are quite overweight to begin with. But if you do have that much to lose, then I can see how this series would help you do it. What really impresses me with this series is NOT the weight loss piece (I've lost about 4 pounds so far and I'm on day 22), but the strength and tone I'm getting from these workouts. I did my measurements on Day 1 and have been measuring every 5 days since then. I've definitely lost inches in places where it counts - waist, hips, thighs. I also noticed my slightly previously-emerging double chin is no more and my face is thinner! :) (I tend to lose weight in my face and bust first.) I also just FEEL more fit in general. I started feeling great after the first few (rough) days.<br /><br />5) Jillian gives the perfect mix of \\"tough love\\" and \\"encouragement.\\" Just when you feel like you're going to die and feel like you're being pushed too hard, she says something that reminds you why you're doing it (just as an example, at one point she reminds you how much nicer it will be to go jeans shopping when you're more in shape), and it seriously helps put your focus back on the positives instead of how GOSH DARN HARD you're working. It's still tough, but those little reminders take the proverbial edge off for sure.<br /><br />6) Totally based on my own experience for this one, but people noticed a change in me after using this DVD for just a few days. I have a job that I am only in the office a few days a month. The last time I went in and saw the people I work with, 3 people told me how great I looked and asked what I had been doing. At that point, I had only been using this DVD for about 7 days. Based on the on-the-spot testimonial I gave to each of them, 2 ended up writing down the name of the DVD and planned to buy it.<br /><br />7) It's UNDER SEVEN BUCKS! I have never before purchased a better workout for less money, or even close to it.<br /><br />Clearly there's a lot that I like about this DVD. Now for the few things I don't (minor.)<br /><br />1) I have neck problems - was treated awhile back for a herniated disc in my neck and still have pain related to that injury. Although Jillian has one of her \\"girls\\" showing modifications to the workout for almost every move, she doesn't specifically tell you how to modify if you have common complaints like neck or back issues. Some of the modifications work out fine, but a couple of them still give me trouble and I kind of just end up suffering through and hoping I don't hurt myself (I suppose I could not do those particular moves, but with a 24 minute workout you don't really want to cut out too much - as Jillian says throughout.) So minor point, but important to be aware of if you have any serious injuries that you may be concerned about aggravating.<br /><br />2) Jillian has two women who workout behind her - one shows the modified move, the other one shows the advanced move. What bugs me about the advanced version of some of the moves is that even the woman demonstrating them can't make it through some without breaking or stopping or modifying her pose briefly. I can surely understand that, since the advanced moves are SERIOUSLY HARD, but if the person on the DVD can't even do it who's supposed to serve as motivation for where you'll get eventually, it can be kind of demotivating - \\"if she can't do it - how can I??!\\"<br /><br />3) Just remembered how much I hate that you can't fast forward through the introduction. So even if you've seen it 30 times already you have to watch the whole intro which takes about 3 minutes or so. Really annoying when it's not part of the workout and you are just ready to get to the workout!<br /><br />Aside from those 3 (minor in the scheme of things) negatives, I clearly LOVE this series and will continue doing it even after the 30 days are over. I want to keep my new-found strength and tone, and that's not going to happen if I only do this for 30 days then quit.<br /><br />FIVE STARS AND FULLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD, provided you are ready for a tough and effective workout that's going to make you BURN and SWEAT!ple told me how great I looked and asked what I had been doing.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|The Sentinel of Liberty did not come crashing to the big screen but came carefully, crafted in such a way as to hopefully maximize his potential earnings not just within North American markets but also across the world.  Downplayed was overt patriotism (consider that the America he inhabited, as the moviegoer is shown, was rife with failure: Stark's hovering expo car that faltered; the infiltration of the laboratory and death of Steve Roger's mentor/ creator, Dr. Erskine; Cap's initial sidelining by way of buffoonish salesman) and played up was the comic and the cartoonish.  It was probably a good choice and the story flowed and was well handled.  Opting to keep our flag-figured hero in his patriotic colors was as far as Marvel seemed to want to push this but their ways of finding nods to his history were very satisfying (see: Cap's initial \\"buffoonish\\" salesman costume complete with unwieldy, pointed shield).  The humor was well-played and gratifying (Stark's hovering car that work and his quips that did; the off-set, griseled Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) being satisfyling wrong about his thoughts of who should rise to the head of the super-soldier pack; Peggy Carter, feeling jealous, firing at Cap's new shield) and The Red Skull was a capable menace, an anti-Captain America if you will, but he wasn't too capable.  I liked very much that he was a failed test of Erskine's and Hugo Weaving played him with a calculated accent.  Chris Evans did a more than fine job, so much so that I accepted him rather quickly and completely forgot that he was ever the Human Torch (played a fantastic Torch BTW)!  Evans actually showed off some acting chops, playing with humor and awkwardness and appropriate pathos.  Where I think Marvel missed the mark was in not having a face-to-face with Hitler, with not focusing (even a little bit) on the horrors of WWII.  This would have grounded the film (a la X-men: First Class) and given it more emotional weight.  But it's still a fun ride and a very good superhero movie without it.  Upon first viewing I thought that the Red Skull was played as a fairly weak villain (he was compared to the comics) but on my second viewing his screen presence and effect was very much close to right (he certainly wasn't a non-event like first Fantastic Four's Doctor Doom).  Overall a gratifying comic book movie experience.<br /><br />One more thing: for those of you who have passed on the extra features I encourage you to check out how they \\"made\\" Captain America/ Steve Rogers.  I thought that they just used another actor the entire time and transposed Evans' face (which they did part of the time) but for parts of it it is all Evans, slimmed down and smoothed away by a computer.  Simply amazing.e and a very good superhero movie without it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not only is the presentation on my Kindle superb (as compared to other ebooks with all sorts of odd symbols and poor pagination ((Is pagination possible on a Kindle?))) but the story and the writing was worthy of me buying the hard copy book to place on my shelf. I don't do this for all ebooks; only a few earn a place on my shelves and those books are never loaned out. I LOVED this book; cried at the loss of life; cheered at the lessons the victors taught; despaired at the savagery of \\"future\\" America. Long after I finished this book, it stayed with me...and that is one of the marks of a truly great book.

B007Z9RAX4|3.0|There is some good and not so good about this movie that made me sit back and think about it before writing a review.<br /><br />The Good<br />- Gina Carano. She is attractive and plays a leading role as a tough girl. When Angelina Jolie did it she was acting. Gina Carano can most likely really kick your ass. It was nice to see her play the kind of role usually held by guys and it really made her more attractive as the movie played out.<br />- There are quite a few well known actors in the movie, which was a little surprising.<br />- Gina's fight scenes. You could tell she knows what she is doing so her part of the fighting was more realistic.<br />- I personally didn't think Gina's acting was bad. Some people have a problem with it, but she did decent considering shes a MMA fighter and not an actor.<br /><br />The Bad<br />- The fight scenes. Outside of Gina herself the fights were a mixed bag. It was occasionally kind of obvious it was fake because the person she was fighting cant operate at her level, like the fight with Ewan Mcgregor, though the fights with Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender were decent. For a movie billed as an action movie there also was not that much action which was disappointing.<br />- The overall story was kind of dull. It really sort of left me saying is this it? The viewers were not really given a reason to care.<br />- The ending. I really didn't like it. It felt like the last 15 minutes of the movie that should have been there were suddenly cut off.<br /><br />Overall this is an average movie, and there are both good and bad areas to it. If you go into the movie just looking for a popcorn flick and some action then you will most likely be satisfied. Haywire is definitely worth renting, but I wouldn't buy it.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Loved this movie when I was younger and STILL love it. It really is a great classic. Wanted to let my own kid see it, so I bought it on Amazon. Good Movie for a Good Price. She loved it. We all did. Watch it sometime :-)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey dramatically raises the bar of what is available on television. We stumbled on the program mid second season and \\"had to\\" buy the whole series. The outstanding, era authentic acting, costumes and set give riveting insights into the class-segregated civil world of the \\"upstairs and downstairs\\" inhabitants of an English manor and community. You will come to care about the many intertwined lives and catch a glimpse of the idealogical foment of ideas as aristocracy began to meaningfully engage with the idealized as well as the real human  manifestations of democracy, socialism and even communism that would change their families and the entire western world.

This thing is so profoundly dreadful, I can hardly formulate a comment....but I will. \\"It\\" was recommended to me by a workmate who just loved it. The critics loved it. You may love it. In my opinion, this movie is so bad on so many levels that it seems improbable that anyone could find anything to appreciate in it. Yet there it is. If you choose to indulge in this vulgar, silly, low vibrational waste and end up enjoying it, then I strongly recommend that you re-evaluate your life mission and do some serious soul searching.

B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Cage is unable to find footing in this loosely defined ambiguous character which ultimately comes across as a little creepy and perfectly goofy. Yet another poorly executed action film with a matrix-ish subtext concerning the nature of reality and so forth.<br /><br />The writers and director could care less about any intellectual or philosophical discourse and use \\"belief systems\\" superficially only because it's the thing to do these days and such ponderous platitudes are required for the story. The film boils down to hot chicks and guys shooting at each other.<br /><br />The ending is meant to stimulate thought........instead, it is yet another irritating point tagged on to a series of ill conceived notions of plot.

Nothing here that is clever, creative, scary, inspiring, thought provoking, humorous, sexy, intriguing, wondrous, exciting...........what did I leave out? Oh.....good.<br /><br />Well what can you expect from the Gods these days anyway? Hunky Thor was nothing but annoying and silly throughout and the evil demon alien bad guys were about as tiresome as the rest of the CG monsters. What a waste of a good comic book character.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I didn't even know that Super 8 was a 'monster movie' or 'alien movie'. I just knew it was a new J.J. Abrams project. Since I am a fan, mostly because I am a fan, I made it to my viewing with little outside bias.<br /><br />I'd rate the film at four stars, but the effects and extra footage included with this BD are quite enough to gently push this to push this film forward into the five-star shelf in my film library. Much like Star Trek, the cinematography and scoring are amazing. Much like Cloverfield, an amazing design of monster hits the screen like no other. But if you are in the viewing for this as a monster/kid-friendly movie, you've got an awesome bid you're looking towards. I say 'kid' with some variance of course, meaning those of age comparable to the actors, but I know some parents would disagree. The kids swear a fair amount, but it's nothing too terrible. And the clincher - the on-screen violence is very minimal. And that's rare enough in movies nowadays. But many parents will doubtless think of films such as E.T., the Explorers, Flight of the Navigator, et al. And should be more than enough to get the whole family to sit down as pass the popcorn.

Now the clowns who design how DVD and BD release have done it again, and this time with a franchise I grew up with.<br /><br />There is no questioning the worth of the Transformer film series. Top notch CGI with crazy virtual stunts and amazing articulation of the title characters. Sure, the acting is a 'little shoddy' some times, but we're not all really watching these for Shia. We've been here because we remember the old school Bumblebee (not that he isn't a bazillion times cooler now). We've been here because Peter Cullen has voiced Optimus since we were in grade school. These movies stretch thin the line of the nonsensical, but we keep coming back because giant robots rock (even if Hugh Jackman let us down just a wee bit).<br /><br />So, in the end, if you just want the films with no frills at all, then this is an epic movie set designed just for you. We the fans are left wanting, and we shall continue to mourn until the folk upstairs get with the program. Epic movies should have a modicum of special features regardless of everything else. Films live past the theatre, so let's all get on the same page please.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game.It is a fun and good game.I love any tea about animals.I think your kids will love this game.This is such a dim game I could play it for hours.A tum and hour playing game that lids will love is right here.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|There only one way that you can descibe a show like this.Wicked, Fun, and exciting!! Vampire Diaries takes you on a journey to so many places that it makes you wander if it could have really had been like that for real at, some point in life this is how you would want it to be!  Obviously its not practical, but man every woman has to love a gorgeous man!! This story line could go on for ever and ever in my book the way they are<br />writing this story line out, its everyday living for these high school kids. My only question is, graduation<br />is coming up and then what are they going to wrap the story line around? kids at the unemployment line!!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I really like the angry bird space app that I downloaded to my Kindle Fire! It is excellent and everything that I could ask for! I am well pleased!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|corn is supposed to grow in an hour and mine tells me to wait 400 hours! would be so fun if time was accurate and had more energy.
0345803485|1.0|I made thru the first sex scene and then wished I had my $10 and time back. This book is horribly written. I hated the main character just a few chapters into. Nothing believable about her or Grey. The writing makes Twilight look like Shakespeare! Don't waste your money or your time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great way to pass the time.  Yes some games are a little silly and boring but others are addictive. I like
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. It was an easy read that I had trouble putting down. I read all three in the space of 4 days.....  I would definitely recommend it.
B007HO392S|5.0|I and the rest of Carrie Underwood's fans waited for 2 1/2 years for this album, longer than her last 3 previous albums. As tough as it was to wait, it was worth the wait. You can tell extra work went into this album. Everything about the album is perfect. The \\"theme\\", the album booklet is amazing with photos and FINALLY lyrics. It's an overall outstanding CD and I was literally blown away. It was a change in style for Mrs. Underwood but it makes things more interesting and I was able to relate to songs more than I thought I could. This album mainly consists of mid tempos and ballads, which brings about a different tone, lyric maturity, and beauty. I like that Carrie didn't try to sing to the moon as she said with this album given the fact she's already proven herself time and time again, and this was just another way to prove herself. Now, I'll go through every song and rate them from a scale of 10.<br /><br />1. Good Girl- The lead single of the album is an absolute perfect opening. Fun, sassy, and full of attitude, Carrie warns us to think before we assume everything is good. The song is a great crossover piece which really broadens her horizons and fan base. A country/pop/rock song that is destined for gold despite already being high among the charts and the stars. Great great way to start the album. (9)<br /><br />2. Blown Away- One of my favorite songs on the album. The lyrical direction is really interesting and covers such a different side of Carrie's story telling. The song is a great piece of work. It really shows that Carrie was serious when saying this album would be darker. Truly one of the most enjoyable tracks on the album. Very easy to listen to and fun to create a little music video in your head. (9)<br /><br />3. Two Black Cadillacs- Most easily one of my top 3 favorite songs from the album if not my favorite. This song is pure genius musically, lyrically, emotionally, just everything. It's so perfect. I can't even critique it. Easy review. It's gonna be a hit and I really hope it'll be a single. I smell awards. CMA Entertainer of the Year, Single of the Year?... (10)<br /><br />4. See You Again- Once again one of my top 3 favorite songs. Carrie's vocals on this are so sweet and comforting. The lyrics contain a beautiful message and the song really holds a lot of hope and necessary uplifting vibes which are needed after songs like \\"Blown Away\\" and \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\". The people singing in the back make the song so much more touching and somehow meaningful.I can definitely see this fitting this into The Chronicles of Narnia film but I am happier that it landed on the album. Really suits the image of the album. After every rain storm is a rainbow right? (9)<br /><br />5. Do You Think About Me- This is the start of feel good songs. The lyrics and cute and catchy and Underwood's vocals and soothing and relaxed. No showing off here, just some good music. This song also starts to incorporate more of a country vibe which is good for Carrie's hardcore country fans. This isn't a stand out track but regardless it is a solid piece of work. (7)<br /><br />6. Forever Changed- This song is one of my top 3 songs and possibly a tie with \\"Two Black Cadillacs\\" for my favorite song on the album. This is probably the most touching and emotional song on the album. The story line is well thought out. This song has that great relate-ability factor. The soft music with Underwood's soothing and beautiful perfect pitched voice really touches deep down. Really makes you stop and breathe and think. Even if this didn't happen to you, it could. Like I said it can be so related to. This song is very hard to critique because its just so beautiful. Although 2 out of my 3 songs are emotional ballads, this song really has a strong impact on the listener and is the best one by far. Underwood did a great job with slowing things down. (10)<br /><br />7. Nobody Ever Told You- This is my favorite mid tempo song on the album. It has a great positive vibe, great catchy non complicated lyrics, and the beat is infectious. Such a casual fun song that will have anyone tapping their feet. This song also cooperates a great country vibe. (8)<br /><br />8. One Way Ticket- Me and this song have already developed a love hate relationship lol. When I first heard this I thought it was the least thought about song, way too different than Carrie's style, and just simply corny. However, then I'll listen to it and all of a sudden find myself singing it. This song has such simplicity but such a great essence of fun, relaxation, and freedom. I can definitely feel this being a summer hit for Mrs. Underwood. The lyrics are especially relaxed, which makes me like the song even more. I really can't give a good or bad review for this song. Its just what it is. It works for Carrie so it works for me. Definitely the most random song on the album but like I said it somehow works (8)<br /><br />9. Thank God For Hometowns- This is another slow/mid tempo ballad that for me sticks out the least. This is the song I was least impressed with. It's not bad, but its not great. It just feels very bland. The song breathes more of a down vibe when the lyrics are speaking about thankfulness and happiness that your hometown is always there for you. It may be because of all the other emotional ballads but I just don't feel the song. (6)<br /><br />10. Good In Goodbye- This completes my top 4. This song is absolutely phenomenal. The lyrics and message is quite simple, but it gets the point across very quickly and strongly...\\"guess goodbye made us strong, sometimes life leads you down a different road, someday you'll see the reason why\\".... absolutely can be related to almost anyone. It sounds more like a sad ballad, but it actually turns out to be one of the most empowering songs on the album. The story telling aspect is incredibly told and it really helps you create the story in your head. Carrie's vocals are flawless on this. It works that she didn't sing over the top with this. It makes it so much more reassuring and comforting. This song really hits me deep and really brings out strong emotions. Truly a piece of art (10)<br /><br />11. Leave Love Alone- This song is another solid one for Carrie. Not my favorite, not the best, not the worst, doesn't make me wanna skip it. It's just what it is. It's a good song. (7)<br /><br />12. Cupid's Got A Shotgun- Ironically enough this is the closest thing to a love song on this album for Mrs. Underwood. The song is a purely enjoyable and full of sass. So needed for the album. This is the only other song that is really upbeat next to \\"Good Girl\\". So much fun. The lyrics are thought out very well. The song makes you wanna get up and dance and just have fun. One of the show stoppers on the album (8)<br /><br />13. Wine After Whiskey- Easily the most classic country song on the album. Truly bittersweet. The song really showcases Underwood's powerful yet controlled voice. Once again not my favorite, but its sure pretty dang good. Very easy to listen to and she really feels connected to the song. (8)<br /><br />14, Who Are You- I didn't start listening to and following Carrie until 2 1/2 years ago, but from what I've read and watched, she really got voters due to her strong vocals obviously but also her strong faith. Given the fact that that's true, with having her first single be \\"Jesus Take The Wheel\\", I feel this will be a big hit with her religious fans. I'm not religious but I have to say this is truly one of the best songs on the album. It's a strong and positive testament to her faith which is nice because she's staying true to herself. (8)<br /><br />Overall, this album is very strong. It is truly Underwood's best work to date, beating out Carnival Ride for me. I have been listening to this album over and over again since I got it. Totally worth buying, I have no regrets. Great music to add to my collection. This album really shows Carrie's growth and maturity which is nice because it makes things more easy to relate to as I've mentioned numerous times. I am so pleased with this and can't wait to hear her sing these songs live at award shows and concerts. The queen of country is back stronger than ever! Best American Idol winner and alumni yet.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Appreciate everyone's reviews on all products.  This is my first review and I feel compelled to provide this review of the Fiio E17.  Like many of us, my objective was to research and add a DAC that could help enhance the overall music listening quality of my Digital files (yes, many from itunes; compressed).  I understand that no DAC is going to completely re-create, enhance, and/or fill in areas to match an original recording.  Meanwhile, we all want to have the best quality sound as possible, especially when playing on your nicer audio equipment.<br /><br />I did, what I thought to be, quite a bit of research.  I had several applications in mind:  A portable DAC that could be used with ipod/iphone in the care, with computer, etc., and a high-end DAC that could enhance the sound with my higher-end system (KEF 107's; Nakamichi, NAD).<br /><br />I first tried the CambrideAudio DacMagic Plus.  Reviews seemed positive.  Price was in between low-end units and high-end; had bluetooth wireless, etc.  I was disappointed with the sound.  Just didn't offer much, to me.<br /><br />I then purchased both the Fiio E17 and the Peachtree iNova.  My thought was E17 for the portable use and the Peachtree for my other system.  Ran a number of tests (original CD's, ipod standalone, ipod with E17, and ipod with Peachtree -- also tried both variable and fixed out with Peachtree).  I must share that I was very surprised.<br /><br />While the Peachtree soundstage and higher end could be argued that it sounded a bit better, the base was disappointing.  The E17, and with the treble and bass controls, was surprisingly good!  I definitely could not justify $1,800 for the iNova.  Sorry, Peachtree, and I was willing to pay this IF the sound was there.<br /><br />I've been frustrated in playing any digital music through my KEF's/Nakamichi;  have always loved the sound of full CD's on this set up.  I can share that while with the E17, it's still not a match, it is MUCH BETTER and definitely worth the investment of an E17.<br /><br />Also used it now with Computer (Mac), headphones, car....and hard to imagine not using this.<br /><br />Hope this helps others as they evaluate DAC's, prices, and applications of the MANY devices out there.
044042321X|4.0|Very good! Especially if you enjoy the novel as much as the TV series. Worth the money that was spent on it!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I recently purchased this watch, after seeing that it was on sale.  I am pleasantly surprised with how well this watch works.  So far, it is keeping time relatively well, but is gaining about 2 minutes every 4 days.  Besides that,  It is a good automatic watch.  It is fairly small and thin, and fits under shirt sleeves well.  It does not weigh much, and the band is comfortable.  It also has a display back, which is very cool to see.<br />Pros:<br />Display Back<br />Small<br />The luminescence of the hands is good<br />Inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />The crown is rather small, and does not screw in.<br />The watch is running fast<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good automatic watch, especially for the price.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun game, with some challenging puzzles that really stretch your ability to plan ahead and think spatially.  If you get stuck, the game offers some help.
0553582038|1.0|Such a let down after the epic third book. iA thousand pages and nothing actually happens? theres definitely an art to that<br /><br />Had to fight to finish the book, and hearing that the 5th book is more of the same really makes me not want to continue this series and just wait for the 5th season on HBO.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It's a great game. Very fun and plays smooth. A great time killer. I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys puzzle based games.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|Bought it on a lark, knew nothing about GI Joe. Figured out early on I should try to pretend I was a 14 year old boy and put aside any expectations for great drama and convincing plot details etc.<br /><br />Then --- Very nice visual material, well designed CG sets, and backgrounds etc. Very visually rich. Good photography and lively camera work. The camera moved frequently and nicely to contribute to the action but they avoided the terrible hand held camera gimmick.<br /><br />Relentless mayhem and explosions and destruction. It never seemed to stop and did not seem to be repetitive and gratuitous. They must have put a tremendous amount of work into it artistically to have had so much variety. I may have never seen so much in a film. I really hate car chases, crashes etc. because they seem like cheap thrills. But they did a great job here with these and I was impressed. A lot of well done action.<br /><br />So technically, I feel that the film was remarkable. Even classy. But unless you are a 14 year old boy (well, 13-22), or interested in the technicalities of film making, this film might bore you for its lack of adult dramatic pacing and slim character development and instead its emphasis on violent mayhem and visuals.<br /><br />I might add that I just watched Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol (again on a lark) which I thought was pitifully formulaic and poorly acted and yet got generally good reviews. I feel it is fair to compare it to this because it also tried to maintain relentless action and tension --but it was just stale. GI Joe was so much more successful in this respect as well as visually, acting etc. my opinion that there is just no comparison whatsoever.  Probably aimed at different audiences and maybe Cruise and MI fans carried the positive reviews. I can't say how this might go over with GI Joe fans, as I said I am coming in cold on the comic book or any background for this film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is a great solitaire game. love it. hours of fun.down loaded easily on android phone and no problems playing.
0345803485|1.0|This book is so stupid and horribly written. I can't believe it is so popular.  I read it because of all the hype.  It starts off ok and the first \\"scene\\" is fun, but after a while...give me a break! I know it's \\"fantasy\\" but really???  The writing is very elementary and I don't care about the characters.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|the game is pretty good. it is similar to Oregon trail. helps time go bye. good for kids and adults.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very awesome & fun game. Very easy to use and navigate! Would recomend to anyone.wish there were more games this easy too use!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love these games. wish there were easier ways to get gems. there are ways to get them. but not a lot at a time. only improvement to the game needed.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This is the best app I've found! I love to go to sleep to certain sounds and now I have them with me when I travel!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|....it has recently stopped working.<br /><br />Draw something is fantastic on the kindle fire, especially compared to the iphone/ipodtouch because if the screen difference.  there's no story mode so almost nothing is repetetive and it doesn't lose my interest ever.  just check it once in the morning and once at night and spend 10-15 minutes playing and it never gets old.<br /><br />this morning however, I tried to play at school, but after a few seconds on the loading screen the whole thing blacked out then forced shut, and now everytime I go to play it, it doesn't load. just black screen then force close.<br /><br />5 star game but the fact I cant play brings down the rating
B007V2UGPE|3.0|get more harder bosses and better weaapons also gt. ea levels anddifrent levels overall I liked the game and get better upgrades.
B007VPLNGW|3.0|Great game.  Cute characters, some achievements to chase (mostly too easy), mechanics don't leave you guessing what you need for 3 stars and very responsive.<br />Basically launch your shark around a bathtub filled with physics changing doodads and try to get the coins and rubber ducks.  I know you're thinking, bathtub...rubber ducks...hmmm.  This is NOT a where's my water clone.  Definitely worth the buck.<br /><br />Also, not a total money grab, which is what I was expecting when I saw \\"Gameloft\\".  There is the option to waste some money in the game but it's for re-skins, unlock all and undos.  IMHO just restart the level instead of reaching for an undo.  Most levels have a target of 2 or 3 moves anyway.<br /><br />The low score is due to Amazon's bizarre device policy.  For some reason they've decided to call this the Kindle Fire Edition and prevent its installation on your phone.  On the Play Store you can download the same game and play it on even somewhat older devices (Nexus One).  So, as a whole experience, you'll end up needing to buy it more than once or jump through hoops. (ie: dropbox) to get it on your phone which hurts the product.<br /><br /><rant> I understand Amazon needs to recoup some of the cash in selling the fire so cheap but crippling their store and not pursuing new development more aggressively (where's kairosoft?) is just going to end up hurting the consumer. </rant>
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Better on tablet than on phone, but addictive either way. A lot like old school Mario bros game. Fun game with good graphics
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I've been hearing really good things about this app from my friends with apple products, and I'm sooooo glad it's finally out. It's really amazing and fun and everyone should have it.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|If you're looking for a nice easy read for summer this will do.  Not depressing as some of his are.  I enjoyed it.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game is so much fun and is just like super Mario bros. it never freezes up or crash anything so I would suggest getting it;)))
B007VDPMYI|5.0|Needed to hear from George and this is absolutely brilliant. Please tell me there will be 10 volumes! Can't wait for more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My 6 yr old really likes this game. its very easy for her to understand!!! no problems so far!!  :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found \\"Hunger Games\\" to be a very relaxing, enjoyable book that kept my interest and yet found to be an easy read.  I did not have to think but just imagine.  A great book to read in between intellectually heavy themed books.
B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I just love Megadeth.  I've loved their last three CDs, all of which really marked a return to the Megadeth of yesteryear.  This one, however, is just meh.  Some bright spots showing up as songs and as parts of songs.  A lot of lyrical cheese.  You know the kind of cheese I'm talking about.  \\"Sweating Bullets\\" kind of cheese.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Documents to Go is not new. It existed when Palm PDAs were number one of portable devices. It was great at that time and is also great now.
B006ZZANG0|3.0|OK, I'm a big Rufus fan and a frequent show attender.  I've loved every studio CD he's ever done, but I wasn't keen on the subdued \\"All Days are Nights\\" CD.  Rufus's ability to arrange music is unmatched in his peer group.  His catalog demonstrates that.  Seriously unique music from this guy.  Tons of ear candy.<br /><br />While this CD marks a return to some of those catchy arrangements, I think it kinda fizzles as it goes.  The first few tracks are good--the first two are probably the best.  Many of the later tracks just aren't memorable sing-alongs or memorable in the broadest sense.  Somewhere along the line, Rufus got in the habit of trying to cram a bunch of words into musical phrases and they come out sounding more forced on this CD.  (Think \\"Tulsa\\" where all that cramming playfully works.  Now, stop thinking about that here because the crammed-in parts drag a few of these tunes down.) The creative arranging (think \\"Slideshow\\" and \\"I don't know what it is\\") is largely not present here.<br /><br />This is a decent CD, and if you found yourself suicidal after A.D.A.N. then you'll be perked up by this offering and half of the songs will stay with you for an hour or so after you've turned the album off.  The rest will drop off and fall to the bottom of the Rufus Wainwright catalog.  So, it gets three stars because it's \\"OK.\\"
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Well, first understand why its so. And the authors do a very credible job backed up by heavyweight credentials from MIT and sound data.<br /><br />Their premise runs counter to most of the popular economic press. While many are comparing the last few years to the Great Depression and a great recession, the authors have a different perspective, its a Great Restructuring. That in fact its not low technology innovation that is responsible, its quite the opposite - very rapid innovation. Specifically, massive productivity gains from IT innovations. And its 100,000s of people that are being displaced by technology that either can't change or change fast enough that are the worse for it. Hence, the title \\"Race against the Machine\\".<br /><br />$$$$ High for some, largely low for the many - The Fix? - see pg 40<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />On the $$$'s front the author presents compelling evidence that while the median income  has stopped growing, the real winners are those that are in a position to leverage technology for their gain. Thats predominately the top end of the economic scale: technology entrepreneurs, executives and many areas of knowledge work that is difficult to automate and codify the associated tasks. Tagged to these careers is the fact that the big winners are those with graduate degrees. And while its difficult to displace workers at the lower end of the scale that do work requiring task skills such as answering phones or fine physical manipulation of objects, they're the ones who's wages are under pressure. The top 5% of the US population accounted for over 80% of the net increase in wealth. And since the 1940s on a decade by decade basis the 2000-2010 decade is the first where technology displacement has produced almost no (net) job growth (pg 35)<br /><br />Time is \\"not\\" on your side - \\"The Rolling Stones\\"<br />--------------------------------------------------<br />With the rapid introduction of technology innovation both organization structures and human skills get outdated fast. And when people get stuck in rigid organizations that can't innovate, companies don't train, skills deteriorate, their learning rate is slow and/or they use those new skills at a slower rate.uction of technology innovation both organization structures and human skills get outdated fast.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game my mom has it and I looked for it and just found it I can't wait to start one with her.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|This movie was so awesome that after watching it twice from a redbox, I knew I just had to buy it.  The videography is fantastic along with a great soundtrack.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|I wanted to try this  in part because it has the pockets for credit cards/other cards which I thought would be handy when traveling. I found it to be flimsy compared to the one I already have (Acase Kindle Fire Premium Micro Fiber Leather Case with built-in Stand for Kindle Fire (Black) ).<br />I found it difficult to slide my Kindle Fire into the sleeve and to try and make it stand up.<br />It does not have the  strectchy band to keep it closed when not in use.Quality wise I do not think it is as good as the one I already have  (Acase Kindle Fire Premium Micro Fiber Leather Case with built-in Stand for Kindle Fire (Black) $7.99) . At $24.99 I find it to be over priced.
B007X0TWOK|4.0|Here's the thing about Rufus - he's a clever song writer with a singing style all of his own. I sometimes think Wainwright was born too late for his musical abilities because I can see myself listening to him while sipping a 20 year old brandy in front of a fireplace with my golden retriever at my feet in a 1920's mansion. Thankfully we get the opportunity to enjoy this unique songwriter with the instantly recognizable voice in his Out of the Game album. With all of the cookie cutter music industry singers now in the music biz it's nice to know that individuality can still be found in the music world and Wainwright provides that with Out of the Game.
0439023491|5.0|This book arrived in record time and is new as stated. The book was ordered as a gift for my Grandson who is 15 years old. He was very happy to get it
0743277465|5.0|After coming across another review that questioned the practical value of the content of this book, I felt it necessary to add my 2 cents. The book is largely autobiographical, very well written, and compelling. The guy is a chess International Master and a Tai Chi world champion - how cool is that? So, I can understand that with a quick read, one might miss some of the practical points for all the great story in which they're embedded. But they are there, and they are extremely useful.<br /><br />I read the book once, quickly - couldn't put it down - a great read, written well, inspiring. After reflecting on it, I realized that I needed to read it again and take notes. There is a tremendous amount of practical information in this book. There are many dimensions at work here, and Mr. Waitzkin seems to have always been on the lookout to turn everything to his advantage - learning, learning about learning, paying attention, using senses, concentrating better, dealing with emotions, developing tricks, exploiting accidents, finding your rhythm & way of doing things.<br /><br />I've given this book as a gift to several people & will continue to do so. And I plan to read it again & add to my notes...
B007YDX4K4|5.0|This episode is definitely reminiscent of older seasons and is full of cool 70s and 80s geeky sci fi references. Bringing great pleasure for those of us kids of the 80s: splotches of D&D, Star Wars, Star Trek and more pop up in character conversations and in the set decor. Great fun! Storyline is excellent and its so great to see Bobby still in the picture. One of my fave episodes to date :) And finally, a great big THANKS to Amazon for offering lots of TV episodes at great prices! Yeah baby, I now have all SN Season 7 episodes so far!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game it is absolutely amazing. You can cook food expand your place and make friends. The only downside is that you have to pay for gems to buy certain items.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|If you are looking to kill some time with a quick game then this is the app for you. Cute!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Makes her focus and pay attention to everything on the screen. She laughs and enjoys seeing the babies hatch. Love spending time with her with this!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have been playing on my itouch and playing on this is what I have been waiting for! thanks for acquiring it finally :)
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Bills Reminder is a nice, easy to use app. Unlike other bill pay apps, you don't have to trust sensitive financial information to an app. This one is short and sweet!
B00466HNHM|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. Had to have it for family archives. Classic love story with two of the best actors ever in the movie industry.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I can go from nlt to kj in just a click. Always right there at my finger tips.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|The acting was spectacular. They played their parts well; it was like I was watching a few real teenagers goofing around.<br />When I first realized it was a documentary style film, I cringed. I find them tacky and difficult to watch. I don't care too much for the shaking and the lack of professionalism that comes with a commercial film. However, most of the film was not shacking. In fact, a great deal of it was smooth and moved like a camera would in a normal movie. Of course, it was because they controlled it with their minds. Either way, it really helped take away the tacky parts that usually comes with documentary films. Another thing I like about how it was filmed was that it wasn't just one camera; it was under the premise that these tapes were found later, so were able to job from one angle to another as if it was professionally made.<br /><br />Now all this, along with a great story line, amazing acting, and characters that I felt like I could relate to, made it a great movie. It had enough of the documentary style to it to make you feel like it was real and like you were there with them, while still holding on to the strengths of a normal film.<br /><br />This movie was awesome! I pity them, but I also envy them.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|well this app is fun and all but it keeps interfering with my music. the tracks keep skipping and it keeps having to reload the app. fun app but I would appriciate it if that was fixed
B007V2UGPE|4.0|fun to play.  the only downside is that u need glue credits to really beat it.  still worth the download
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This book was a pretty typical Sparks' novel.  If you have enjoyed his previous books then you will probably enjoy this one as well.  I was not overly excited while reading this, but I also wasn't bored.  It fell right in between...average.  Logan is an ex-Marine who has Beth's photograph in his pocket at all times.  The photo has proven to be a lucky charm in that it has saved his life on multiple occasions.  Therefore, after returning from deployment, he sets out to find this woman who has protected him.  He walks (yes, I said WALKS) cross-country with his dog to meet her.  All he intended to do was thank her, but GASP...a love story ensues.  At the risk of spoiling anything (though the novel is pretty predictable), I'll leave it at that.  Like I said, if you are a Sparks' fan, there's no reason you will dislike \\"The Lucky One.\\"  But if you're looking for something more complex, with characters that are not one-dimensional, this book may leave you rolling your eyes and wishing you saved that $9.99 for something else.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|As many people do, I believe that children are inherently innocent - it is us - people, who have the power to turn a child into a monster through their life experiences. Before I read this book I did not believe that a child can be born malevolent and yet, to me, this is the frightening realization that I started to believe in. Sure, the mother is not a stay-at-home and bake mom, but I did not feel that she abused her son. In fact, something that we have lost all value for, and Franklin's (the father's) character was so guilty of, is not telling our children the truth about themselves. We elevate them to heights that, at times, they are not worthy of and turn a blind eye to their misdemeanours. Perhaps she was too honest in her assessment of her son's personality, but that is because she recognized this evil lurking inside him. This does not make her a bad mother. Every character, whose life was touched by Kevin, even in passing felt the evil in him. They just didn't have concrete facts to back up their intuition. This is a powerful book, extremely well written and captivating in its inference that nature, not nurture, wins the battle when it comes to serial killings
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|WOW.<br /><br />I, like so many, many others, had the same problem with the countdown timers. The game is actaully entertaining....for about ten minutes. Then we must dip deep into our pockets to spend money on ENERGY. If you cannot afford to spend twenty dollars every ten or fifteen minutes then bad news for you. You must wait for three hours for your energy to fill back up. I will assume that if you are playing this game you cannot afford to spend twenty or so dollars every twenty or so minutes. So you have waited like me for hours to keep playing. But ALAS,  I couldn't keep playing. Why? Because the building timers had been changed to some crazy unrealistic time in the future that seemed highly innappropriate. It is a glitches I am sure. My advice to everyone having this same issue is to report a problem with this application. Hopefully that will lead to an update that is desperately needed for this game.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I loved this movie since it first came out and enjoyed the ride at Disneyland years ago. I shared this movie with my children through Netflix and they fell in love with it as well, so I purchased them a DVD copy from Amazon. The DVD arrived in a sealed condition, I am assuming I received a new copy, and it arrived within the time frame given. My kids were so happy to open the package and see this movie inside. A great gift for any one who enjoys this unorthodox holiday classic.<br />As far as content, it looks like it would be scary for children but our children love this movie. They might be different as they enjoy Tim Burton films. I think the only questionable part is with Oogy Boogy with Santa Clause. There is mild amputation (Sally disconnecting her arms and legs and Jack throwing his rib for Zero) but no blood, guts, or sexually explicted images. The language is clean and don't recall any questionable words.
B007V2UGPE|3.0|It seems that all of the reviews for the kindle fire edition list the same two problems of this game.  First,  if you leave the game from anywhere but the title screen,  it locks up and you have to uninstall and reinstall the game to fix it. Second, the moment you get more than a few bad guys and allies on the screen, it locks up.  And they want us to pay for bonuses?  The game needs to be fixed.
0345803485|1.0|This wasn't a romance. Grey is a sexual predator and Ana is his clueless victim.<br /><br />The sick story in a nutshell:<br /><br />Ana was an annoying stereotypical innocent virginal ditz heroine (Oh, my! GASP! My inner-goddess!!) who never even masturbated, she hooks up with Christian Grey, a predator with a god complex who tries repeatedly to manipulate this poor silly girl into ditching her dreams of having a normal romance, and despite her resistance he continues to try to convince her that what she reeeeeeeally wants is to go into TRAINING (his words) as his obedient sex submissive and 'enjoy' the pleasures of him inflicting severe whippings that will leave welts and bruises. And she will also surrender her entire free will and allow him full control over everything she wears, eats, thinks...etc. When it came to the BDSM sex scenes, she only capitulated (not truly consented) to his wishes. She was uncomfortable and unwilling, yet he took advantage of her innocence until she capitulated. I was thrilled to see her get a back bone in the end of book 1, but sadly that will not last since there are sequels.<br /><br />Bottom line: Any relationship that requires you to keep a bottle arnica cream on hand to sooth `bruising, sprains and injuries\\" is not something I find sexy, healthy, interesting, or romantic. This book was a big 'fail' for me.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I have been a fan of norah jones from the very beginning and happy to say little broken hearts is amazing. The songs have a darker tone which I love it shows another side to her. Highly recommend it.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Nearly everything in the game runs off timers but as others have reported after a certain amount of time the timers glitches to obscene numbers. Where you would normally collect coins after 12 hours, 400 hours replaces it. It seems after the glitch the timers do not decrease at all either. Very disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it...some for those who have heard about the book but refuse to read due to the nature of the book; your loss. It is an amazing love story and anyone who has ever really been in love knows that people are not perfect and we all carry some sort of baggage. Well worth the read and I cant wait to get to the next one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am completely addicted to this game! It is so fun and cute!!! My favorite thing to do is play mung fu scratch!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love Anastasia Steele.  I love how these stories are told in first person from her POV.  I love her's and Christians delicious, sometimes hilarious and fun e-mails to each other.  (I could probably read a book full of these e-mails alone!)  I love Ana's analytical, disecting-a-situation self.  She's a delight!<br /><br />I love Christian Grey's commanding, controlling force.  Christian is absolutely sumptuous.  I love his intoxicating sensuality- - he is a potent combination of male beauty and raw sexuality.  He's a heady elixer of desire.  But most of all, I love how he adores and values the woman that Anastasia is.  He's committed to her completely.<br /><br />I loved the interaction and dialogue of Ana's Subconscious and Inner Goddess.  Hilariousss!<br /><br />I love how this Author equates these two characters as being on opposite ends of a seesaw...slowly inching their way closer to one another.  I love their constant struggle amidst all the drama they're forced to face - - trying to beat incredible odds against their relationship as it grows and deepens into \\"more\\".<br /><br />Such an exceptional follow-up story to book one [[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]...  Amazing story full of angst and delicious drama, discovery and deeper commitment.  Rawness and edginess are expertly applied.  Phenomenal, PHENOMENAL character description, fully developed and scrumptiously detailed.  I loved how this story slowly carried the reader through the many changes Mr. Grey experiences, giving the reader more understanding into his persona...how he has to \\"deal\\"; step by delicious, intriguing step (in terms of realization and healing).  Perfect capitulation of Mr. Grey. Awesome, AWESOME read!  Somethin's gotta be wrong with a reader who doesn't like this second book of ELJ's Fifty Shades series....move on to other genre if this ain't for you...as for me...Please gimme more...  Laters baybeee...

B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an amazing ride!  This final installment begins with Christian and Anastasia on their honeymoon, ever learning and discovering more and more about each other.  For all of Ana's intelligence, her naivete' shines through with her passive aggressive attitude towards Christian.  That is, she'll do or say something to make him relax and laugh and feel somewhat confident in himself, and then turn around and kill his mood with questions she know's he's unable to \\"handle\\"...(yet she needs to know the answers to those questions).  She constantly forgets how unsure he is of himself - - how uncertain he is of their fragile relationship and other matters relating to Anastasia..(ie; controlling & dominating her etc.)  He's an expert in hiding these feelings under an intimidating exterior.<br /><br />Ever so slowly and without realizing it, Ana begins to expect more from her marriage and Christian in general.  That is, she questions \\"why\\" she's not included or informed when decisions are made...(something hard for Christian to relent and give).<br /><br />Ana still struggles with low self-esteem and inferiority issues as well as jealousy (and she is aware of these faults), although she's taking more initiative to control those feelings.  As time progresses, she begins to be stronger and more secure in her marriage...more self-assured.  In spite of all the hurdles they must leap over...in spite of the huge mountain(s) they must climb...they tackle them together.<br /><br />This story is a learning game between these two strong-willed characters.  It's basically about Christian and Anastasia's bond growing stronger as they deal with life's highs and lows, ups/downs...and dealing with all the drama and baggage of Christians' former lifestyle.<br /><br />Superb ending to this trilogy.  And the Epilogue.....all I can say is THANK GOD for EPILOGUES...and reading Christians early years is heart rending.  Reading his thoughts and his POV upon meeting Anastasia was too, TOO delicious!!!<br /><br />I enjoyed this story so much I immediately started the whole trilogy over as soon as I finished this third book in the series.  It was that hard to let them go.  Ok, so maybe I need a life.  Don't frikkin' care!  A phenomenal story with well developed characters.  All I can say is MORE!!!!  Bring on Mia and Ethan's story!!!!<br /><br />Below is written by James A. Michener...his thoughts are exactly the way I feel about letting the characters of Christian and Anastasia go back on my bookshelf for awhile...read on:<br /><br />\\"When I approach the closing pages of a great novel, a feeling of profound regret comes over me, for I realize I am about to sever a relationship with characters I have grown to love. And to abandon a corner of the world in which I have spent rewarding weeks, months and even years, for I read slowly and carefully.<br /><br />I feel, when the pages dwindle, as if something good were being stolen from me, something precious that would not be replaced.<br /><br />You may laugh at what I say next, but when I realize how few pages are left I ration myself, only so many each day, and when the final one looms, and I close the book, I stare at the back of the book for many minutes, aware that something precious has touched my life.\\"  - -James A Michener!!!<br /><br />I enjoyed this story so much I immediately started the whole trilogy over as soon as I finished this third book in the series.

B00723NWJE|5.0|I have no other Norah albums or like her music to be honest although her voice is amazing.  I gave this album a try and wow it is great. I describe it like a cross between Beck's Sea Change and well a little electronica thrown in, sad but a beautiful album. I'll have this on repeat. If you've been through a break up and who hasn't, the male version Sea Change (best ever in my opinion) but this a female perspective.  Give it a try even you don't like her early stuff, this album is darker and reminds me of David Lynch in some ways with a few sounds on it (if you've seen his movies, you should) It's a breath of fresh air in the pop wasteland.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As i finished this book my thoughts were that it was a 4 star review, really 4 1/2 stars. However as i thought about the book, and for hours i did, i realized that this was a uniquely well written book that crept up on me and captured me.<br /><br />The characters were real, as were the emotions and reactions by the main characters. I was inside this family, and i felt strongly for each, and some very strongly. It is a courtroom drama, a family saga, and an emotional story that turns in many ways, and the best part, you never see the changes coming.<br /><br />Well written, and I am very glad i read this book. Problem is now i am not sure which direction to go for my next book. It cant be anything in this genre as it just wont match up to \\"Defending Jacob\\". Great book.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|AMaZING i would never put this book down... but everything great comes to a end. It has so much action and its thrilling. You never know what will happen to the end.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I did not see the movie at the theater. I heard a lot of comments about it- mostly raving over the special effects and characters. I wondered if the movie would live up to all the hype. I was not concerned about the movie being realistic, I wanted to be entertained and drawn into the plot. It certainly happened for me. I liked the unusual idea of mentally transferring into a larger alien body. The brightly colored scenes were a real treat. The human commander was too eager for combat but history is full of competent men who got carried away with conquest. The culture and flora/fauna was different so you had no frame of reference. It was a new adventure for the imagination.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK!! I have been recommending this book to anyone and everyone!! haha! loved the chemistry between to the two main characters!!
079073639X|2.0|The novel was mysterious, intriguing, and addictive. Others have detailed the storyline so I won't repeat, but it was an out-of-the-norm plot. I really looked forward to seeing if my mental picture of the sphere and all that happened would resemble what the movie showed. What a disappointment. It wasn't even close. Had the movie followed the story in the book I would have concluded that my image needed an update. But the movie was just blah. It lacked the ability to capture you in the story. If you haven't read the book, the movie probably is more appealing because you don't know what has been left out. Chalk it up to another failed Hollywood attempt to turn a great story into a lackluster movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK!! I have been recommending this book to anyone and everyone!! haha! loved the chemistry between to the two main characters!! the only disappointment i have is that the series is now over! i just might have to reread all three books!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the summary and sample before I bought this book and it was so good, I went ahead and bought all three. I was surprised this book made it on the bestseller list. I couldn't even force myself to finish the second book. The characters are shallow. They have absolutely no depth at all, and the writing is extremely repetitive. The story has potential, but it was just so badly written. Don't waste your money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK!! I have been recommending this book to anyone and everyone!! haha! loved the chemistry between to the two main characters!! I enjoyed this book more than the first....which is saying a lot!
B006M4RN3U|3.0|This album has a few good songs but is a large disappointment after Aim and Ignite which was a great album. This album seems over-produced and the songs tend to get annoying and boring. Live acoustic performances of the songs on this album are better than the album versions. Nice try Fun. but Aim and Ignite is in a league of its own against this album.
0765350386|3.0|I picked Mistborn up for three reasons. Reviews; the Magic system everyone's talking about; and because if Brandon Sanderson is completing the Wheel of Time trilogy and doing it pretty well, his other works are probably OK.<br />Indeed the magic system is well thought out and quite unique. Unfortunately I had trouble visualizing it working in my head without seeing some poor, unrealistic, special effects used in over-the-top movies and some video games. It is those special effects I find repellent in a lot of movies. Needless to say visualizing a book playing out just like those movies didn't make me like it. I know this isn't that great of an argument since it's the writing I should be worried about, but this is the way I read books. I watch them in my head. It's a little like how I can't read LotR without seeing Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, or Andy Serkis' Gollum. (and how also any charming magic the Harry Potter series once had on me is now lost because I can't read them without seeing Danielle Radcliffe)<br />Visuals aside, the story was exciting and I enjoyed spending time with it. Twists and turns were shocked me a few times and were enjoyable. The blood and gore was fun to read (for me the more the better, too often there's hardly any).<br />At the end of the day though, most of the characters seemed too idealistic and cookie-cutter examples with different clothes on. The story didn't make as much sense to me either. I would have liked a more intelligent reason why things were the way they are. In this book all I could figure out was there is this Lord-Ruler (imagine that) who lives in a tall, dark, spiked tower (imagine that) and rules with a cruel hand (imagine that). There were hints at deeper reasons why the world was in the state it was in, but in this book it was too simple: Dark lord rules, small group of heroes (endowed with certain magical gifts coincidentally) conspire to overthrow him. Undoubtedly my questions on those things will be addressed (for better or worse) in later books in the trilogy. However, I won't be picking those books up.<br />Overall some things are handled intelligently, others simple-mindedly. It's a good experiment with magic and possibly worth the read for that, but I had no taste for the characters or spending any further time in the world.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|this hidden object game is the best one I've played so far. It has great graphics and a really fun story line. At only 99cents you won't find one better. Also great hints!!<br /><br />!
0375869026|5.0|A young boy, who has been home schooled up to the beginning of this story,  is starting fifth grade. His parents, in an effort to protect him, had kept him out of school because of his facial deformity. Now he must confront the stares, gossip and taunting. The story is told from multiple view points which enriches the events as they unfold. He learns how to navigate school, make friends and maintain his integrity. His personal growth influences those around him. This is a powerfully told story that deals unflinchingly with the topic of bullying.
0670023329|4.0|Escape from Camp 14 is short (a smallish volume of about 200 pages) and to the point, providing an unembellished version of Shin's upbringing (if you can call it that), experiences in camp, escape, and post-camp life. It is also informative, with facts about such things as the number of persons forced to live in these camps and the huge disparity between the standard of living of Koreans living in the South and the North. The book's brevity was initially a bit of a surprise (certainly many more details could have been provided about Shin's camp experience, I thought), but as the man's story unfolds, the reason becomes obvious. With the enlightenment that living in the outside world brings, his complete lack of regard for his own actions, which directly or indirectly led to two of his family members' deaths, transforms into a certain level of awareness and possibly embarrassment, at least at how his lack of compassion might look to others. Thus Shin is reluctant to reveal certain information. In fact, he changes a critical part of his story midstream, that about his mother's capture, after recounting the same sanitized version many times over. Not unexpectedly, Shin has had a difficult time adjusting to life in the real world, holding down a job, and interacting with others. Benefactors' attempts to convert him to Christianity were interesting, though expected. Most surprising was the South Koreans' apparent lack of interesting in the plight of Shin and other political prisoners like him. Best of the book was the insight into camp life, worst, the wonderment of what may have been lost in translation. Also good: Coming Out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life by Victor Herman (in unabridged audioformat only), and Abduction: the Megumi Yokota Story (a documentary).
B000VOON7G|5.0|Everyone will tell you if you only ever buy one jazz album in your life, it should be \\"Kind of Blue.\\" There is a reason why this seminal collection of musical improvisations from 1959 still sounds fresh through the decades whilst most popular music from the 1960s, 70s and 80s has become dated and forgotten. When you hear KOB you'll probably recognise most of it because these numbers have been played endlessly in a thousand places all over the world for 50 years and in countless movie soundtracks, and they never age.<br /><br />The musicians Miles assembled around him for these sessions were all at the top of their game: Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly on piano, \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley and John Coltrane on saxes, Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums. Davis used simple modal scales to define to the musicians the limits within which they could improvise, instead of more standard harmonic structure with chord progressions. This gives the album a loose, relaxed and super-cool feel, yet the music is complex enough to hold the listener's interest even after hearing it hundreds of times. It's one of those rare triumphs of musical genius where everything came together to produce something sublime and special. Listen and you will immediately \\"get it.\\"<br /><br />So, yet another five-star review for \\"Kind of Blue.\\" If you don't have it, then buy it. It's the essence of cool. It's great. It's timeless. It won't sit in your CD rack: it will be played, often and forever.
0439023491|5.0|Catching fire is a fabulous book that deserves to be the best book in the world. Suzanne  Collins is the best writer i know. I hope she continuos writing the way she did till now. I would say that everybody that doesn't read this book will be at terrible loss.

0439023521|5.0|The hunger games is absolutely the best book I've ever read. The way Suzanne Collins describes thing the way I thinkI'm in the book itself! The hunger for blood is the way people are and even if we don't realize it now we are always like that. Katniss makes great sacrifices and I promise I couldn't put the book down till the very end. I was reading late into the night in school which was a secret. I take this book everywhere I go. You should read it!!!!

B000001F5F|5.0|Waaaaay back in the day, as a kid, this was the album that got me into U2, and I've been a huge fan ever since. Widely regarded as one of the best live albums ever, 'Under A Blood Red Sky' is brilliant. Already, at this early stage, we see what an awesome live act U2 were, and that they had what it took to be The Biggest Rock Band In The World they would become. And although we can't see him, we can hear what a dynamic live frontman Bono already was, his engagement with the audience, and his pure passion for the songs.<br /><br />Although billed in some quarters as \\"Live From Red Rocks\\", only a couple of songs come from that famous performance, with the others assembled from various other gigs around that time. In fact, the bulk of the album comes from the recording of a concert in Germany a few months after Red Rocks. No matter, the performances are universally high in quality.<br /><br />'Under A Blood Red Sky' contains some great live versions of four early U2 hits; 'Gloria', 'I Will Follow', 'New Years Day' and 'Sunday Bloody Sunday'. I've always felt the album versions of the latter two never quite did the songs justice, and both sound much better in the rawer and more intense live cuts here. The album also contains some less well-known songs, which are a real treat for fans; 'Eleven O'Clock Tick Tock (a personal favourite from this era), the punky 'The Electric Co', and live favourites '40' and 'Party Girl'. It sure says something about a band's live chops when even album tracks and B-sides become crowd singalongs, and the crowd enthusiastically embraces every song here, hit and rarity alike.<br /><br />My only criticism of this album: it's too short! Red Rocks had great versions of other early U2 classics like 'Seconds' and 'Two Hearts Beat As One', and it would be nice to get more than only 8 songs. There is a (more expensive) version containing more live cuts plus a DVD, so serious U2 fans may want to think about forking out for that one.<br /><br />In all,a classic live album from one of the world's biggest bands and greatest live acts. They weren't quite the biggest band in the world here, but they were well on their way. Five stars.

B006OE7XM4|5.0|This album is fantastic. I have already given out a cd and am about to buy three more for mother's day gifts. Usually one buys a recording and one or two of the song are just so so. Not with this recording. Absolutely every song is worth listening to again and again. The lyrics, particularly on \\"Be Good\\" and \\"Real Good Hands\\" create a picture much in line with the first titled song \\"Painted on Canvas\\".<br />Being fond of music that tells a story this suits me well. Mr. Porter's rather unassumingly smooth delivery catches you off guard as it grabs your soul. Thank you Mr. Porter for bringing back \\"real good\\"!!!
B00499LTLM|3.0|We couldn't wait for Sherlock to come out on Instant. We purchased the HD. The Amazon Instant Video works well for us and we download all of our purchases. To be safe if our internet goes down. It looks perfect streaming or playing a download file.<br /><br />Sherlock is one of our favorite series. We love Sherlock in every way but ONE, The Audio.<br /><br />Episode 1 is perfect Video and audio.<br />Episodes 2 and 3 have poor audio.<br /><br />The dialog is fine but the background audio and music is out of phase. It is very hard to listen to and is piercing most of the time. Much of it is painful.<br />It makes watching the 2nd and 3rd episodes too hard to watch. We have stopped watching them.<br /><br />We notified Amazon and they said only if other people tell them they will request new files for these. I'm sorry to say that Amazon's Customer Service which is SUPERB, has no way to fix problems like this.<br /><br />I have heard of other Amazon Instant movies which had perfect Video but the Audio made them unwatchable. This seems to be the case with Sherlock.<br /><br />This is the HD version. We have not tried the non HD ones. The HD versions are so good looking. Really eye candy.<br /><br />We hope they fix this soon.
0446572993|4.0|Just wanted to briefly say I found this latest by Baldacci to be an overall completely satisfying thriller. Though moving at a slower pace in the middle, the beginning and ending was definitely edge-of-your seat. I really look forward to seeing more of this Will Robie Character.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|This was pretty much a travesty to the name \\"Sex and the City\\"  -  it was so dissappointing it was an embarrassment to watch.  I couldn't wait for this mess to end and practically ran out of the theater.  After producing such a gem of a tv series it is utterly perplexing to think that Michael Patrick King had anything to do with such a  horrible picture.  The characters have been damaged - ruined.<br /><br />It is a real shame that there was no \\"city\\" in the movie.  Hello!  the name of the movie - Sex and the City - why would you need to have the girls trek out to the Middle East - to avoid the city???  I still can't wrap my head around it.<br /><br />Anybody hear of a plotline?  Practically essential for any good movie - well, I couldn't find anything that even remotely resembled a storyline.  To sum it all up - nothing happened - the end.  There were such excellent opportunities here - watching Carrie navigate married life. It was interesting for me to go from being an independent single lady - living alone to adjusting to sharing a household, the give and take, etc.  Carrie simply whined about not going out and getting a tv as an anniversary present. It was almost comical when I was inclined to feel sorry for poor Big - married to this whiney little baby.<br /><br />Make up - ok - just bad.  Everybody looked way past their expiration date.<br /><br />Perhaps tv just doesn't translate on the big screen - while I adored the last couple of episodes of the tv series -the first movie, although way better than this garbage, still sort of missed the mark.<br /><br />I just think that there was some style but no substance here - they took all the things that I loved about Sex and the City out of this movie.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is very well written.  It's erotic, witty and addictive.  I've already begun reading the second book in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker.  P.S. I love a book that prompts you to grab the dictionary.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is awesome and very nice.I love it and I'm only eleven.I showed this to my grandmother and she I considering getting a kindle fire and downloading this very game.
0062073281|4.0|I really loved reading this book. Maybe even more than the LA Candy-series. It's easy to read, even if Enlish isn't your mother tongue.<br />I can't wait for the next book in this series!
B00004U8P9|3.0|I researched that this dvd was THX enabled which might also include the THX configuration tool but no such luck.  I love the movie. Just disppointed by the features of the disk.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I stayed up way past my bedtime for a few nights.  So with bags under my eyes, I salute Sylvia Day.  I enjoyed this too much, and I will read the next installment.  Erotic, thought provoking, detailed, and well written (all my favs) I wasn't bored, skipping or skimming my way through any dry spots because I couldn't find any.  If you want a tortured and imperfect couple fighting for some type of romantic normalcy while heating up the sheets, the limo, the walls, the sofas, the floors...read this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use and fun. Not a fancy game but a great free app. It has become a little addicting for me lately.
B000FC2PKG|1.0|This is the most completely unrealistic plot I have read in many years. I am aware of Poetic License, and suspended belief, or disbelief, but this one really violates the Pig Rule. A police sniper, paid to shoot to kill, gets prosecuted for doing his job. A judge has so much power and wealth(where do judges get wealthy?)that he virtually ruins the life of the sniper who shot his son. Give me a break.  I don't know what world the author lives in, but in my world, this is total fantasy.<br />Suspense is compelling because it is based on reality and rooted in experience.<br />I'll stick to George Pelacanos or Michael Connolly.<br />If this book wasn't in my Kindle, I'd have thrown it across the room.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Thank you very simple and fast transaction..would do it again. Will buy all my books from here...thank you very much
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good battery app that shows more information than a person needs to know. You can do some customizing. Graphics are very good as well.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have done it again !!! Great Soundtrack. This soundtrack is very dark but I really like it.  Especially the cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\". This album really creates the darkness that the movie portrayed. The Girl With The Dragon Tatto soundtrack is very atmospheric, and wonderfully executed. Buy this album and you will not be disappointed. With Reznor and Ross at the helm you know that you will get your moneys worth of music.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Well this game is realy fun but I wish u didn't need to buy the game with points. I also wish that u didn't need to get a certain score to pass the game. Only get this game if ur up for some hard games. Otherwise don't bother.
B005FISBV2|1.0|I'm not joking, this was more awful than the final season of Lost.  It is complete filler, and could be entirely ignored save for the final scene (which they should have written for the season finale of Season 5).  The only redeeming quality of Season 6 was Mos Def's acting, and the inclusion of Edward James Olmos.  There are just far too many plot holes, inconsistencies, and non-sensical acts here to even consider watching it (really, Miami metro was waiting for a blood spatter analyst before entering a crime scene...not only that, they let him investigate the scene before they entered.  While alone in that crime scene, no one from Miami Metro heard him pounding away at the wall with a hammer?).  My suspension of disbelief can only take so much.<br /><br />I sold my entire Dexter blu-ray collection after this season aired.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 Shades is a hot, steamy book that has women around the world going crazy and their significant others are living it!!
B00026WUAU|5.0|I've read many reviews of \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" stating it is a painfully autobiographical album of Dylan's marriage falling apart. That album (though I love it equally) sounds like child's play compared to Street Legal. This album is where the blood really flows out. How Dylan is able to maintain his Self as an artist and create a masterpiece out of such pain is something I deeply admire and cannot comprehend.
B007HO392S|5.0|This Carrie Underwood album is amazing!! I previewed it five times on iTunes, but I pre-ordered it on Amazon because it was two dollars less than the iTunes pre-order. Great songs...Some sassy, some love-related and sappy, some tell amazing stories, and some are great for letting your hair down and going for a drive just for fun. This one has something for everyone.
B004LROMSY|1.0|Ai make sure it is region compatible ai ai ai. I ordered it an did not realize that it is only US version thought Amazon would realise that i Order from SA and warn me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good fun . the game really lets u have fun and will keep you coming back over and over and over and over
0670023329|3.0|I hate to rain on the parade of superlative reviews, but this book was just \\"good enough\\" for me.  Yes, it's a \\"searing account\\" of the protagonist's struggle, and yes, it is an inside look into an insanely brutal country and political system, but the book is short on character development and is not very compelling as a result.  I never felt completely taken in by the story and I was left with the impression that the author is still working on mastering his craft.  It's a quick, easy, interesting read -great for an airplane ride or a weekend out of town, but it's not something that will stick with me and I'm unlikely to recommend it to friends.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game. i really like this game but i cannot complete this one quest cause it involves friends. i to
B007CKNX28|5.0|This album runs the gamut, from the fast paced rock of \\"Sixteen Salteens\\" to the mellow harmonies of \\"Blunderbuss\\" and the bluesy rock of \\"I'm Shakin\\". Nearly every song on this album is great, there are not the wailing guitar solos you may expect from Jack White, but who cares? It doesn't need them.<br />Highly recomended.
0345803485|5.0|I finished this book in 3 days and cant wait to start the second one! Im not looking for award winning literature, just a good and entertaining book which this definitely is.. couldnt put it down!
0553386794|5.0|Originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner<br /><br />First Thoughts: I have been wanting to read this series for a while. I have heard wonderful things about it and the show is a huge success on HBO. I have also been craving a good fantasy series that I can devour and I'm so glad I found this book.<br /><br />First 50-100 Pages: The first several chapters are amazing. You are introduced to so many characters, houses, families, agendas, and it is a little difficult to keep track of. But as the chapters go on it gets easier. Every character gets their own face in your head and their own personalities.<br /><br />Characters: Speaking of characters. There are so many good ones and so many that I want to drive a sword through. First, the ones I love: Arya, the spirited child of Eddard Stark who would rather play with swords than dress in skirts; Tyrion, the second son of the Lannister family, a small man with a big personality that I couldn't help but love; Eddard, the lord of the Winterfell (played by Sean Bean in the show), he is a just and fair man and I fell in love with his loyalty and honesty; Jon, the bastard son of Eddard who joins the Black (members have to leave their family and become family with fellow bearers of the Black) is fiercely loyal to his father and his land; Daenerys, or Dany as she is called, is a Targaryan and pawn of her brothers in order to overthrown King Robert. She is a force to be reckoned with and I feel like she had the most growth throughout the book.<br /><br />Now for those I didn't like: Cersei, the queen of Robert and a Lannister, she will do anything to get her family on the throne and I really disliked her incestuous relationship with her brother Jamie.;Joffery, Cersei's son and the next in line to the throne. I absolutely hate him. He is cold and heartless; Sansa, Arya's older sister and the daughter of Eddard. She is such an idiot! She could not see through Joffery's coldness until it was too late and she so badly wanted to be a lady that I felt she betrayed her family; Catelyn, the wife of Eddard, is someone who I don't hate, but I do not by any means love. She jumped too conclusions and acted without thought in many cases and essentially was the one who started the war.<br /><br />The best part of this book by far, is the change in perspectives. Each chapter changes between Eddard, Sansa, Arya, Catelyn, Jon, Dany, Bran,<br /><br />Plot: There is so much going on in this book, it's crazy. At the beginning, we see mysterious happenings and killings done outside the Wall and the Night's Watch are puzzled. After the prologue, we jump into the Stark family. Within the first few chapters, poor Bran is thrown from a window after uncovering the Lannister's secret. Meanwhile, you have the Stark family trying to remain faithful to King Robert even though is married to the Lannister house. The Lannister house is manipulative and heartless and will do anything to get the throne. Then you have Dany and her brother who are teaming up with the Dothraki, the horse riders, so Viserys, Dany's brother, can be king again. Then, as if human problems weren't enough, there are supernatural beings living in the forest that made an appearance in the prologue still haunting the Wall.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Guys. The ending. Holy crap almighty. The last chapter made me squeal and I really want to start the second book soon. This book is wonderful. If you are fantasy fan and haven't read this book, please do. It is truly a great start to what I'm sure is an amazing series.nted to be a lady that I felt she betrayed her family; Catelyn, the wife of Eddard, is someone who I don't hate, but I do not by any means love.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is excellent \\" brain candy\\".  It grabs your attention from the start and is difficult to put down!  I have never read any of Ms. Collins' books before, but I am definitely now a fan!  I highly recommend it!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|it is a pretty good game but it can get a little slow. it is difficult to exit out of on the kindle fire and it wont let me visit friends' villages.
1594203334|5.0|There are some great reviews of this book on this site, so I'll try not to repeat anything, and I'm just going to throw in my two cents as a mom-to-be. This is a GREAT book, even if only to make you think about your parenting style and question certain cultural norms.<br /><br />I would argue that the MOST important take-away from \\"Bringing Up Bebe\\" is to not go overboard with any one parenting style. More than completely adhering to the \\"French Style,\\" I think the author encourages readers to look at a cross-cultural comparison, and take away some ideas from both countries. I LOVE the tips on helping your child learn to sleep through the night without making him/her \\"cry it out,\\" but also without coddling them for months and months on end. I don't, however, think that meal times for my home need to be quite as regimented as they are in Paris. But that's the beauty of this book. The author never says, \\"If you don't do it the French way, your child will go to college still using a pacifier!\\" She just offers her perceptions on how things are done elsewhere, and challenges the readers to consider whether or not this might work for them at home. In fact, time and time again she adds the caveats that she's speaking generally and that of COURSE there are Parisian children who misbehave, and there are French parents who take things to extremes as well.<br /><br />My advice? Buy the book. It's such a great, fun, low stress little read. Don't take everything ANYONE says as gospel, but read this, enjoy it, and see if it adds any tools to your baby toolkit. If not, then just take it for what it is: the story of one mom trying to survive abroad.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|UFO abduction stories never seem to die.  Rational people say there is no such thing and those who say they have been kidnapped just want attention.  Yet, it endures.  As a person who does, repeat DOES, believe in intelligent life on other planets and that UFOs are coming to Earth for some reason or another, this is quite a story.  1993 brought to the big screen the story of Travis Garner, a man whose best seller, The Walton Experience, continues to enlighten and mystify us as to his strange tale of what happened to him on mysterious night many years ago.  In 1975, Travis Garner was just an average guy living in Snowflake, AZ as a logger.  He and four friends were hired to clear a forest space for a developer, when one night something very strange happens.  While crammed in a car together driving home, they see a light coming from a patch of trees nearby.  They drive closer, and then see that it's not a fire as they originally thought it was.  Instead they find a floating craft in a bald spot.  Travis gets out of the car to get a closer look, then is struck down by a beam of light.  Out of fear, the four others speed away.  They go back to get him, and Travis is gone.  What happened?  When they return to town, they say to others &#34;They took him&#34;.  What?  The something they saw in the sky took him.  Town police began to suspect something else, as this sounded like a murder they were trying to cover up.  They take lie detector tests, not all of them passed.  There is something strange going on here.  Then, five days later, Travis calls his friend Mike begging for help.  Mike and others find him in a public restroom, shivering, naked and afraid.  Travis had been kidnapped by a UFO and they brought him back.  He tells his tale through flashbacks and hypnosis sessions with a therapist, also having some horrifying nightmares.  What happened to Travis is not told directly but revealed in a series of flashbacks as Travis relives what happened to him.  In his memoriesrecreated in the movie, he awakens aboard the aircraft being kept in some kind of lab and is subjected to horrific experiments by the aliens.  In the actual tale that Travis Walton told, he said he was taken aboard the craft and observed by creatures in a not so horrific way.  He remembers nothing else after they put some kind of mask over his face, then a few days later he awakens wandering by the side of a highway with the UFO departing overhead.  In the movie he calls his friend Mike begging for help, found naked and afraid near a gas station many miles away with no idea how he got there.  What happened to Travis that night and why did he turn up five days later?  Many said it was a hoax.  There are no other rational conclusions except that he was, in fact, kidnapped by a UFO.  These creatures are real, they are doing things to us.  As to why, there are no answers.  This movie, however, was not marketed very well and only made a modest profit at the box office.  And, let's face it, it was pretty funny that they put Henry Thomas in it.  (If I have to explain that one then you're hopelessly out of touch with pop culture references.)  Stop and be friendly.
0230754686|5.0|The book really moved me deeply! I live In South Korea, and I have studied with a guy from North Korea. It has always been rather difficult to understand they're stories, but this book opened up my eyes to things that are really happening in North Korea. His life was described in a very touching way, that made it really difficult to put the book away before it was done.<br />I did not think that the book was written in a smart way just to attract readers. This book was written with such honesty, that you at times just felt like crying. I have a deep respect for this book, so that means that I do not just want to ask people who live in Korea to read the book, but all people all over the world, because it will open they're eyes to the reality that north Korea is going through.<br /><br />Amazingly good book that all should read

B006IW8DJE|4.0|The story of Finnish director Aki Kaurismäki's latest work takes place in Le Havre, a port city in north-western France. A former Bohemian artist Marcel Marx (Andre Wilms) makes a living as a shoeshine with his Vietnamese assistance Chang (Quoc Dung Nguyen). He may not be rich, but with his loving wife Arletty (Kati Outinen) his life is not bad.<br /><br />One day Marcel meets Idrissa (Blondin Miguel), a young refugee boy from Gabon running away from the police. While Marcel decides to raise money so that the boy can meet his mother in London, Arletty, ill and now in the hospital, conceals a fact that she knows would shock her husband.<br /><br />The theme of \\"Le Havre\\" overlaps that of a 2009 French film \\"Welcome,\\" but Kaurismäki's approach is less political, focusing the everyday life of ordinary people, described with Kaurismäki's deadpan humor/sentimentality. Kaurismäki's longtime photographer Timo Salminen's careful use of muted colors is another plus, adding a realistic touch to the modern-day fable.<br /><br />André Wilms (who 20 years ago played \\"Marcel,\\" a down-and-out artist in Paris in Kaurismäki's \\"La Vie de Bohème\\") turns in quiet and understated performance as the aged shoe shiner determined to do something for the boy. Kati Outinen, the director's muse since the 1980s, is also outstanding as the protagonist's ailing wife, and so is Jean-Pierre Darroussin as Monet, softer version of Inspector Javert trying to catch the boy.<br /><br />I like the film for its positive, life-affirming message, though I for one prefer such films as \\"The Man without a Past\\" and \\"Ariel,\\" in which darker events happen and characters have to struggle more. Perhaps with an exception of cameo Jean-Pierre Léaud, there is no \\"villain\\" in \\"Le Havre,\\" which marks a new phase in the respected director's long career.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|the game was fun but the controls sometimes stick which can get annoying but its an overall fun game Thar's why I only gave 4 stars
B0063IH60K|4.0|It works, and it's fun. It even has a mode for us lefties. I have it on both my phone and my Xoom tablet, and it adjusts perfectly.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|I've never read one of his before, somehow the idea of yet another Scandinavian literary superstar didn't grab me. But now I've actually read one I'm a convert.<br />At first I wasn't sure about the variations in point of view, switching from third person to first person narration, but I got used to that. Then it's true there are one or two wild implausibilities in the plot, but they help the story along, and it is supposed to be fiction - so get over it.<br />But more importantly than any of the above is the fact that it's a really good read, and it kept my attention all the way through - and that's what I want, I can put up with the odd glitch if the book keeps me gripped. Now that I've found him I'll be reading more.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I love this movie and I love this franchise. Each movie keeps getting better and better. I'm glad the got rid of Meaghan's Fox.
